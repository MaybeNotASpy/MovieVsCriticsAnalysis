Apr 10 2024,negative, its the end of the year and everyone is exhausted and ready for rest  except for the kids who are hyped up on candy cane sugar and the prospect of the long days of summer stretching out before them  fear not there are a host of kidfriendly films coming out which you can plonk the kids in front of while you sit in silence and which you might actually enjoy yourself  a grab bag of storytelling tropes generic characters and musical styles from the wellthumbed disney playbook wish unfolds in a onesizefitsall fairytale land ruled by the sorcerer king magnifico a comedically underutilised chris pine  magnificos benevolent dream of nurturing and granting the wishes of his constituency has curdled into selfish tyranny hes keeping all the wishes in the kingdoms mystical vault to be handed out whenever he deems one of his citizens worthwhile  but when plucky teenager asha ariana debose doing the thing wishes upon a star  which looks like a miyazaki sprite reconfigured as a corporate emoji  she sets in motion a challenge to the sorcerers supremacy championing a humanist utopia where the dreams are reclaimed for the people no points for guessing that this analogy for the dangers of monopolising dreams is drenched in irony coming from the corporation with a stranglehold on the childhood fantasies of generationsthats just business as usual for the mouse house when it comes to the universe were all shareholders is an actual lyric in one of the new songs here set that aside and there are sprinklings of the old disney magic to be found  including an amusing chorus of chickens a talking goat who might have sprung from pinocchios pleasure island and a forest full of animals that even features a cameo from bambi the showtunes  primarily penned by singer julia michaels and songwriter benjamin rice  are a little forgettable though on occasion this wish im a star they generate sparks plus its hard to resist when the refrain from when you wish upon a star is threaded into parts of the score wish isnt about to challenge frozen for kids repeatviewing supremacy but you could do worse for a preteen movie diversion this summer holidays the impulse to account for how some fictional freak complimentary got to be the way they are  especially tempting when wading into that most cashgrabby of genres the origin story  is one usually best avoided as with a magic trick to explain this is to reduce a character to less than the sum of their parts  to sub out a tantalising mystery for a game of connect the dots its rather a relief to be introduced to a young wonka who as incarnated by timothée chalamet is already a fully formed chocolate wizard slash magician slash inventor hes just arrived in a new city after seven years at sea ready to launch his confectionary career  even if the moneygrubbing members of the local chocolate cartel paterson joseph matt lucas and mathew baynton are less than welcoming deep roy played 165 oompa loompas including an entire glam rock band in tim burtons 2005 film adaptation of charlie and the chocolate factory will hugh grant in 2023s wonka ever measure up director paul king paddington paddington 2 applies a fairly light touch when it comes to psychoanalysing his protagonists obsession  unlike tim burtons 2005 charlie and the chocolate factory with its flashback to willys childhood under the thumb of a sugarhating dentist  king preserves and in fact amplifies wonkas magic what does gets muted in the translation however is the unnerving weirdness of roald dahls character  his darkness his offputting humour the misadventures of the bratty golden ticket winners in the wonka factory as recounted in dahls 1964 book reveal a candy man with a truly warped sense of just desserts chalamets wonka meanwhile is willing to abandon his calling for the sake of new pal noodle calah lane  the dune star gamely gives willy his all and proves endearing in the role convincing even but he hasnt got a madcap bone in his body he looks like he belongs in a preraphaelite painting not a zany sweet shop if the film isnt quite up to the preternaturally scrumdiddlyumptious standard of its namesake then it would certainly still pass muster at any of wonkas rival chocolate companies its ducks amuck in this animated adventure from familyfriendly hitmakers illumination studios minions sing the super mario bros movie as a flock of new england mallards find their feathers ruffled on an unexpected trip to the frightening big pond of new york city convinced by his wife voiced by elizabeth banks and ducklings caspar jennings and tresi gazal to take a break from the winter doldrums a beleaguered drake kumail nanjiani gathers up the family  and a tagalong deadbeat uncle danny devito  and

latest feature is bright and bouncy and largely pitched to audiences whove only recently learned to waddle with plenty of sight gags that will quack up undemanding audiences  screenwriter mike white the white lotus lands a few serviceable jokes amid the standardissue story beats while french director benjamin renner who was oscarnominated for 2012s ernest  celestine garnishes the farce with the occasional visual grace note theres a shot of the ducks cruising across the new york skyline that really is quite poetic  keeganmichael key meanwhile does an amusingly overthetop accent as a caged

Apr 10 2024,negative, founding the island kingdom of rosas the sorcerer magnifico chris pine collects the fondest wishes from everyone willing to offer them each hoping theyll one day be granted unfortunately those who part with them forget what their wishes were waiting ceremony after ceremony for their special day to arrive enter asha ariana debose an idealistic but scrappy girl about to turn eighteen and seeking to apprentice with the sorcerer king she believes in until she learns most of the collected wishes will never be granted after losing any chance of getting the job by confronting magnifico about his policies asha is inexplicably allowed to depart with this dangerous knowledge later wishing upon a star to fix the problem no one can remember to her and the audiences surprise a star named wait for it star actually shows up to do something or another and it just gets weirder from there not in a good way last years elemental by disneypixar looked like it had the chops to be the next bigcool thing from the mouse house while it chugged along to some success the magic seemed to be missing even more so than the lackluster encanto about a magical house owned by a vindictive grandma you know its true with a century of disney works and animation in the hollywood history books the search was on for some kind of cinematic celebration but instead of a fantasia sequel or other introspective idea moviegoers instead got wish whether this began as an original idea coopted for the anniversary or a creation designed around a bulletpointed checklist deliberate choices were made magic check kingdom check awkward yet spunky heroine either in or involving herself with the royal court and causing disruptions to the status quo check an irredeemable yet worthy villain to be defeated at all costs well lets look a little bit closer at what codirectors chris buck frozen and frozen ii and fawn veerasunthorn raya and the last dragon have put their names on here from the moment we meet magnifico hints of his paranoia are obvious handsome smiles and charismatic facade be damned from seeking his own power to putting down any threat to what hes created read exclusively his were never given a real reason why just a shredded tapestry something about never again and a mysterious book of forbidden magic no one should ever use  plus more than a few clues hes kind of a jerk on the flipside asha has no power other than hope and spunk but everything goes her way as long as she keeps trying she never makes an unpopular decision or ever actually evolves because obviously she was perfect just as she was in the meantime there are a ridiculous number of songs  each as mediocre as the next  in addition to a barrage of easter eggs hinting at better disney fare every decision seems to stop at the first idea anyone had and is never plussed in any way or given any complexity does anyone there still pixar anymore maybe it would have been a better idea to model this 100year celebratory film after the emperors new groove and make fun of everything rather than peddle a lifeless husk dressed up like a feature film wish teases a hardship backstory which could have introduced sympathy for the villain instead of altevil captain kirk from the kelvin timeline but in retrospect the shredded tapestry may have only been a nod to the princes clawed portrait in beauty and the beast in other words how is anyone supposed to notice the real story clues from all the winking and nodding why do the seven members of the kitchen staff seem oddly familiar why do so many of the wishes look lifted from the plots of older disney films never mind when the light bad guy goes extra bad youll guess exactly how that happens and suddenly all the magic is wicked disney green theres nothing to solve or really look forward to because even the surprises feel unexceptional  obligation rather than revelation  reminding fans of better disney animated films and tropes in fact the end credit sequence does exactly the same thing instead of celebrating how awesome what they just watched was characters from previous animated classics are shown as though made of stardust yeah sure okay the little mermaid in 1989 was credited for the start of disneys renaissance animation period one that ended with tarzan ten years later fast forward another decade and the studios traditional animation gave in to full cgi but the storytelling was still there until now with barely enough material to make it over ninety minutes once you add in the credits its clear wish exists merely because the studio demanded it
Apr 10 2024,neutral, the problem with wish walt disneys official 100th anniversary production is not that it is a bad film it is that is crushingly ordinary while undoubtedly there are many younger viewers  and young at heart of course  will be entertained in the long term this is not going to be remembered as one of the greats directors chris buck tarzan frozen and fawn veerasunthorn head of story on raya and the last dragon have both made better films on the mediterranean island of rosas 17 yearold asha ariana debose auditions to become apprentice to king and sorcerer magnifico chris pine magnifico is loved by the people for granting random wishes out of dreams given to him by his subjects when asha learns that magnificos actions are not so benevolent and she is visited by the very star that she wished on asha resolves to free magnificos captured wishes and return them to their owners there is a superficial resemblance here to neil gaimans novella stardust but really the origins of the story are fairly obvious the events are initiated by a character wishing on a star this is not the only reference to disneys animated history to be found in wish the production runs awash with visual and characterbased cues from mickey mouse to snow white and the seven dwarfs peter pan the little mermaid and many others according to one internet source i read these nods run to at least 40 it turns the film into something of an easter egg hunt distracting from and weakening the main storyline one or two might have been rather cute 40 is definitely some way beyond overkill asha is a reasonable protagonist and magnifico a semidecent villain but the films supporting cast runs far too broad and numerous asides from ashas mother grandfather and pet goat voiced by disney stalwart alan tudyk she also has seven close friends  each one resembling one of snow whites seven dwarfs while viewers might remember royal baker dalhia jennifer kumiyama and the irascible gabo harvey guillén by the end of the movie it seems unlikely they will also be able to name and identify hal simon bazeema safi and dario the film becomes overburdened with characters all to make a film reference aesthetically there is a bold attempt to blend computergenerated animation with a flat painterly look intended to resemble handdrawn traditional art as an experiment it is interesting but as an overall presentation the look backfires the loss of detail makes the animation look weaker more than once i was reminded of a cut scene in a videogame the songs by julia michaels and benjamin rice seem to hit all of the expected beats without generating a specific knockout musical number the same goes for dave metzgers orchestral score which feels suited to the events onscreen yet never inspires much enthusiasm these drawbacks represent wish in a nutshell it is competent but boring typically disneyesque yet unenthused and forgettable the quality of the walt disney animation studios goes up and down with time like any longrunning enterprise wish seems to catch the studio in a fallow period 2022s strange world was uncharacteristically poor and looking forward there is nothing announced but sequels it is slightly unfortunate that wishs closing credits are decorated with images of disneys long legacy of animated features although notably the rescuers the black cauldron and a handful of 1940s films fail to get a look in they are there to be celebratory but simply remind us how much better walt disney can be
Apr 5 2024,negative, you know the star that streaks above cinderellas castle in the intro to every disney movie well in wish now streaming on disney the star is an actual character apt for an animated musical released in acknowledgment of disney 100 the brand title assigned to the entitys celebration of a century in business and so we get a classicstyle disney tale of magic and castles and anthropomorphic animals led by a plucky princesstype voiced by ariana debose who won an oscar for 2021s west side story mediocre word of mouth led to reluctance to venture to theaters led to disappointing box office returns about 250 million worldwide a miniflop by big disney movie standards  and perhaps growing ennui for disney product that feels so calculatedly onbrand suffice to say where you land on the spectrum of disney fandom is likely to dictate how much you enjoy an overly familiar story with all the usual genre trappings albeit with one new element bountiful references to disney animated musicals past some of you just read that sentence and wrinkled your nose i did too but maybe it wont be too annoying right  the gist the kingdom of rosas was a perfect utopia  and then growing resentment for the ruler who only wants to control his subjects hit king magnifico chris pine founded rosas as a safe place for all who wish to live there but that security doesnt come without a cost once residents settle down in rosas they have to give magnifico a wish those wishes manifest as floating bubbles that the king keeps safe in his castle and once a month using benevolent sorcery thats about to become not so benevolent he uses his magic powers to grant one person their wish this doesnt make much sense if you think about it even a little bit but we should just try to enjoy the song that explains it all and move on our protagonist is asha debose a 17yearold rosasite rosasanian who works as a tour guide for prospective residents she has a 100yearold grandfather and a mother who has near zero defining characteristics and a kind father who used to sit in a tree with her and wish upon stars before he died thats sad you may cry now here have a tissue go ahead and blow asha is so dedicated to her beloved homeland she scored a plum job interview to be magnificos apprentice  but during that interview she learns that the king is a vain jhole who probably loves smelling his own farts and a control freak who will never grant her 100yearold grandfathers wish why magnifico thinks a simple wish to inspire other people might prompt things like independent thought peasant revolt or even  gasp  the ability to poke holes in the convoluted premise of this movie and therefore see through his scheme to maintain rule over the land asha isnt a fan of this she pushes back a little she doesnt get the job crestfallen asha and her pet goat valentino who wears what i can only describe as a custom goat onesie venture out to wish upon a star and when she wishes upon a star does everything her heart desires come to her no gotcha there you werent expecting that answer were you rather what happens is the star comes down to her the physics of this occurrence are of course affected by disney magic surely this isnt a movie in which a massive ball of broiling unfathomably hot gas obliterates the planet with the nighincomprehensible force of its gravity no the star is alive and about the size of a baseball and it has a little emoji face she names it not harold or jane or carmichael but star it can hear and respond to her and even perform feats of magic eg rendering anthropomorphic all animals within magicshot which means valentino now has the voice of alan tudyk and that bunny over there and that deer over there now very much resemble beloved disney characters from other movies drink ashas first order of business is to bust into magnificos castle and steal her grandpas wish back but magnifico saw the star fall and is enraged by the thought of a magical occurrence happening that he didnt perpetrate himself so ashas staring down the barrel of a tricky endeavor meanwhile the queen amaya angelique cabral exists and becomes a plot device asha wonders if star can help her enact real change around this joint magnifico senses the growing unrest so he descends into his secret plummet hole to become superextraevil and everyone involved in this plot eventually stumbles over halfhearted references to peter pan pinocchio fantasia snow white and all your alltime favorite disney films hooray for disney happy birthday if your wish was for this movie to make a billion dollars im sorry better luck next time what movies will it remind you of wish is subencanto actually encanto was pretty good so wish is more subtangled that one isnt as good its fine though where wish is aggressively ok and nothing more performance worth watching normally with an animated feature i get cute and rejigger this to be performance worth hearing but deboses spirited singing aside i remained uninspired and so this acknowledgment goes to star himself being a purely visual being who communicates with action over words a boon to those of us who think too many characters in animated movies gibber on and on and on and on also star is symbolic of disney wonder and greatness and therefore deserves all the praise hooray for star hooray for disney can i be acclimated into the disney borg now our take anyone else grasp the irony that wish is essentially a cautionary tale about the danger of belonging to a cult led by someone who appears benevolent but is actually quite sinister bob igers ears might be feeling warm right now or maybe walt himself just rolled over in his cryogenic deathbox now speaking as someone who absolutely enjoyed a recent incredibly expensive trip to disney world and who appreciates many of the entitys films as both art and entertainment and might marry donald duck if given the chance and doesnt believe in disney magic but sometimes finds it very persuasive but doesnt go home to bask in a shrine full of disney paraphernalia star wars doesnt count  i collected mostly all that crap before the big buyout i can say that wish is a bit much but also not enough  allow me to clarify a collection of references does not a movie make and this one comes rather close to being that its a bit much and the story is a twothirds realized conglomeration of familiarities that could use more narrative beef and less barely disguised selfcongratulation its not enough the only way wish departs from formula is by backend feeding itself to itself where some disney films are objectively derivative this one is the narrative equivalent of exiting the seven dwarfs mine train through the gift shop and loading up on obscenely overpriced souvenirs  now the animation is firstrate the star is cute the goat is almost funny deboses performance is notable i chuckled two maybe three times at a little over 90 minutes it moves quickly the number knowing what i know now roused a little bit of passion i wasnt necessarily bored nor was i enthralled i was vaguely engaged in the story is that good enough to commemorate an entire century of multimedia domination most definitely not wish looks back when it should push forward maybe disney 101 will give us something more vital instead of something merely watchable our call disney 100 turns up a catch22 those who have seen many disney movies are the target audience of wish but those who have seen many disney movies have already seen everything in this movie skip it 
Mar 12 2024,positive, the lyrics when you wish upon a star are rather synonymous with a large mouse house and its parent company the walt disney company  therefore it should come as a shock to no one that disney studios put out an animated film during its 100th anniversary called wish released just before thanksgiving 2023 the movie was seen as a love letter to the first 100 years of the iconic mouse and the empire that surrounds him filled with easter eggs wish embodies the ideals walt disney imagined a century ago now it can be enjoyed from the comfort of your own home with the bluray combo pack being released for sale at your local retailer and in a special walmart exclusive 4k steelbook living in the kingdom of rosas 17yearold asha ariana debose west side story interviews with king magnifico chris pine star trek to become his new apprentice  the king holds onto all rosas citizens greatest dreams and once a month grants someone back their wish  in becoming his assistant asha hopes the king will grant her grandfathers victor garbor alias wish in honor of his 100th disney anyone birthday when the king refuses asha and her friends learn that there is more to the king and his kingdom than meets the eye however she makes her wish on a star and suddenly she sees a way to set every citizens wish free debose has moved up the ranks from the ensemble in hamilton to leading roles in a few short years and the accolades are well deserved  she has an incredible singing voice and she is solid in any role she takes on  pine while not the most talented singer manages to get through his songs while infusing the king with a deeply resonant and commanding voice alan tudyk resident alien is a master at voices and this time lends his vocal talent to one very cute goat named valentino the rest of the ensemble is good as well and helps to round out the vocals nicely the 2160p video quality is excellent which helps the audience to pick out some of the more subtle easter eggs  and show intense detail on the clothing worn by the characters  the colors look great and have subtle highlights and the bright yellowishgold color of the star helps to make it jump out of the screen at the viewer dolby atmos soundtrack is most noticeable in the orchestration of the songs with layers upon layers of instruments topped by the smooth vocals  the dialogue utilizes the front speakers while the ambient sounds invade the ears from all directions besides play movie and sing along with the movie options there are almost two hours of extras including once upon a studio 100 years in the making the story of wish wish dclassified outtakes deleted song a wish worth making and deleted scenes  the 100 years in the making extra is a very comprehensive multipart hourlong documentarystyle piece that pays homage to what came before it is worth the combo pack purchase price all on its own while disney had its heart in the right place wish needed more time and work to make it worthy of celebrating 100 years of the most recognizable animated character on the planet for more information about wish visit the flickdirect movie database this release has been provided to flickdirect for review purposes                  for more reviews by allison rose please click here allison rose a senior correspondent and critic at flickdirect is a dynamic presence in the entertainment industry with a communications degree from hofstra university she brings her film expertise to krms newstalk 975 fm and broadcast television and is recognized as a tomatometerapproved critic her role as an adept event moderator in various entertainment industry forums underscores her versatility her affiliations with sefca the florida film critics circle and the online film critics society highlight her as an influential figure in film criticism and media
Jan 1 2024,positive, wish feels soulless at times but the film is a step in the right direction for disney animation studios as the company acknowledges they have fresh characters not merely sequels even if the characters retread classic storylines wish also comes across as studio acknowledgment that 2d animation has a place at the table which is significant considering theyre celebrating 100 years the film doesnt break molds like spiderverse and it doesnt bring a revitalizing freshness like mutant mayhem but there are some feels created and the story of asha is original enough to warrant a viewing  asha ariana debose is a citizen of rosas a mediterranean kingdom protected by a magic sorcerer named magnifico chris pine who provides safety for all of his citizens in exchange for their biggest dream every month he grants a wish while everyone else continues to not remember theirs asha desperately wants a family wish to be granted specifically her grandfather sabinos victor garber but she also hopes to become the new apprentice of magnifico after a disagreement with magnifico asha finds out that theres more to his keeping track of wishes than she originally realized so she enlists her goat valentino alan tudyk her dwarflike friends and even a wishedupon star to free the dreams of her people and give them back their biggest wishes historically disney uses a few different approaches for the voice cast in musicals dibose and pine do some really good work in the voice acting department whether singing or not their story mainly focuses on their battle of wits and strength no other character is either a distraction or a bright spot so i think the key is that its important to find actors and actresses that can do sing and voiceover unless youre going to craft their character around the inability or put in some serious training speaking to music and characterization more specifically the songs are functional they are carefully crafted potentially too much and bring joy and goosebumps but they arent quite as memorable as some of disneys recent turns basically theyre just cheesy enough this is where the easter eggs and references are strongest and while theyre momentarily cute the film just needs more than that pines magnifico performs well on his own and in the famous duocombative style that all disney films use but his songs fall into a familiar category they merely exist most of wishs weight comes from the references to various disney properties but since the new material doesnt really resonate the references and callbacks receive more focus than they probably should the characters and songs dont leave much of a mark aside from asha star and this wish the film makes it clear that disney shouldnt abandon 2d for another 12 years nor should 3d cgi and pixar animation studio be their only storytelling lens liveaction remakes arent the answer either and this is why wish is so important it should stand as a reminder that whether animated or liveaction story must come first disney has already shared early photos of inside out 2 we also know elio is coming out and theres an official announcement for toy story 5 theres also confirmation of moanas liveaction along with a few other liveaction films already in postproduction disney animation inspired generations and now those artists are creating stories such as klaus the lego movie and even the classic the iron giant so if disney intends to remain competitive or at the very least inspirational they should take notes from wish and continue to push the bar the film is good but its also very safe disneys percy jackson and the olympians takes bold risks in reimagining the iconic series for a new audience as the heart of the show lies in its young heroes
Jan 1 2024,neutral,when you remind audiences of classic movies they grew up with even as an easter egg it takes away from whats being played in front of them youd rather watch the reference and thats the biggest problem the film has no identity of its own 
Dec 29 2023,negative, when you wish upon a star it makes no difference who you are runs the famous theme song of the 1940 disney version of pinocchio it would be nice to believe that were true although depending on the nature of the wish living in a rich country probably helps in any case when you entrust your wish to a powerhungry sorcerer its a different story as we discover in the convoluted wish its billed as the first ever wholly original disney fairytale though its hard to see more than a tenuous link between hans christian andersens the snow queen and the massively successful frozen films which several key members of the wish brains trust worked on including codirectors chris buck and fawn veerasunthorn intended to mark the 100th anniversary of disney as a company the film takes place in the imaginary medieval kingdom of rosas brought to life through a lush but slightly ungainly blend of traditional 2d animation and the modern digital kind the outwardly benign ruler magnifico voiced by chris pine maintains his hold over the population through the insistence that he alone has the power to grant wishes but just one wish is granted a month meaning you can wait around your whole life to no avail and while in theory everyone has a chance in practice the lucky winner is usually if not always a member of his clique pitted against this tyranny are the downtrodden yet spirited teenage heroine asha ariana debose and her allies among them an incongruously deepvoiced baby goat alan tudyk a fallen star who resembles a glowing airborne pokemon and a gaggle of human friends who parallel the seven dwarfs clearly this is supposed to be some sort of allegory one of the laboured song lyrics includes the word allegory in case of any doubt less clear is the intended significance is it antisocialist a skit on organised religion a belated mea culpa from disney for its centurylong effort to corner the market on magic and wonder if the story had a persuasive inner logic the multiple layers of potential meaning would be a blessing rather than a curse however the script credited to jennifer lee and allison moore feels like a corporate product in the absolute worst sense  as if it had been concocted during a teambuilding retreat by a group of executives who had heard of the existence of humour and poetry but had never seen any concrete instances on one level the total artistic failure of wish is reassuring because it shows there are occasions when vast amounts of money and supposed expertise really dont make a difference  or at least arent enough to save you from falling flat on your face when it comes to the universe were all shareholders maintains one wouldbe inspirational number performed by a troupe of woodland critters modelled after those in bambi one thing we can all count on is that nobody will be humming that in another 80 years an earlier version of this story stated that the character asha is voiced by ariana grande this was incorrect asha is voiced by ariana debose 
Dec 29 2023,positive, where were you when walt and roy o disney founded the enterprise that would become walt disney animation studios unless youre a centenarian you werent around the company was launched in october 1923 as the disney brothers cartoon studio by 1926 it had become walt disney studio and a few years later it was incorporated as walt disney productions for the first decade of its existence the studio focused on short films such as steamboat willie released in 1928 then in 1934 work began on what would be the studios first featurelength production snow white and the seven dwarfs released in 1937 was a critical and commercial success the american film institute ranked it among the 100 greatest american films and named the film as the greatest american animated film of all time in 2008 even though snow white and the seven dwarfs occupies a special place in cinematic history for pioneering a new entertainment form ill bet you cant name a single member of the voice cast  unless youre a disney superfan adriana caselotti voiced snow white while lucille la verne an accomplished stage actress with many broadway credits was tapped to provide the voice of the evil queen the new animated musical fantasy film was directed by chris buck and fawn veerasunthorn from a screenplay by jennifer lee and allison moore buck previously worked on several disney projects including codirecting tarzan frozen and frozen ii wish is veerasunthorns directorial debut she previously served as several disney films as a storyboard artist and as head of story on raya and the last dragon the story is set in the kingdom of rosas where 17yearold asha ariana debose a steadfast idealist uncovers a shocking secret about king magnifico chris pine it seems that the citizens of rosas voluntarily give up their fondest wish  and even the memory of that wish  to magnifico who promises to keep them safe the king is a powerful sorcerer and claims he can grant anyones wishes  but in truth he only grants a few that he deems innocuous magnificos motivation is his role as protector of the kingdom he refuses to permit any aspiration among his subjects that might somehow bring unrest asha learns that most peoples wishes will never be granted  including the wish of her grandfather sabino victor garber who simply wants to inspire others through music because she questions the king during her interview for an apprenticeship magnifico dismisses her and tells her none of her familys wishes will be granted unable to convince her family of magnificos deceitfulness she runs out into the night where she eventually makes her own wish beneath the twilight sky that wish is answered by a cosmic force in the form of star asha and star join forces and they  along with valentino alan tudyk ashas goat who can now talk thanks to star  recruit some of ashas friends to recover all the wishes king magnifico has been stockpiling in his castle this is liable to fluster the antiwoke crowd because it sounds suspiciously like a girl is about to challenge the patriarchy  oh no circle the wagons and prepare to post incoherent rants filled with misspelled words on social media modern politics aside wish is a perfectly enjoyable entertaining fairy tale it is an expressive nod to the past paying tribute to disneys extensive legacy in animation the film is filled with narrative and visual allusions both overt and subtle adult viewers will perceive its selfawareness there are so many references to previous films its as if the writers are sitting in the theater nudging and winking at each viewer the songs in wish arent among disneys best there may have been an effort to replicate musical styles from 100 years of films which made the overall effect inconsistent sometimes the feel of the music doesnt quite synchronize with the tone of the scene visually the film is gorgeous though theres no effort at leaping forward in terms of animation technique thats not a criticism wish doesnt require that kind of innovation disney literally established the artform and for 100 years has continued to transform and modernize it without forgetting its roots the viewers understanding of magnificos disposition might have been strengthened by more backstory but i am inclined to think that it wouldnt matter much to younger viewers a villain is a villain after all kids usually recognize the bad guy with or without a detailed biography pine hits all the right notes in voicing the character as he gradually becomes more corrupted by dark magic one might be tempted to draw parallels between the kingdom of rosas  where your dreams and your reality can collide according to the song welcome to rosas  and some modern régime that seeks to sacrifice freedom for security the concept of hoarding wishes sounds a lot like restricting peoples freedoms if star embodies hope light optimism creativity and imagination it is a potential source of both transformation and revolution  which is why magnifico becomes obsessed with controlling it in another hundred years wish may not rank among disneys top 10 films but i think it will become a treasured classic for some to revisit from time to time its potential appeal spans generations entrancing older viewers with nostalgic cues while delighting a new generation of disney fans with solid storytelling colorful animation and a talking goat with any luck some of those younger viewers may absorb the films forwardlooking social commentary
Dec 26 2023,neutral, theres been a lot of chatter around wish and the fact that its release celebrates disneys centennial where the major theme across a heft of the studios films  that of wishes being granted  would be tied together  its a sweet notion without question but it would appear that the creatives behind the film seem far too obsessed with referencing past glories that they forgot to build a compelling story of their own youll spot such cute easter eggs throughout that reference past titles as peter pan and zootopia but wishs own personality is compromised in the process and its truly a shame as chris buck and fawn veerasunthorns musical tale isnt without its charm  and a lot of that charm stems from the lead vocal work of ariana debose and chris pine the heroine and villain of the piece who sing and swan their way through the films thankfully brisk 95 minute run time debose voices the sweetly asha a 17yearold girl who lives in rosas an island in the mediterranean sea and as we gather from her opening jingle welcome to rosas is a champion of her little village  gearing up for an interview to be the apprentice for rosas king magnifico pine divine asha is hoping that in snaring such a position she can grant the wish of her 100yearold grandfather sabino victor garber you see magnifico having studied sorcery is able to grant the greatest desires of his subjects each of them give up the memory of their wishes to be sealed and protected by the king until he can grant them once a month at a ceremonial event magnifico chooses one wish to be granted  its a little convoluted but it works we all know nothing is exactly going to go to plan and when ashas quizzical nature gets the better of her she angers magnifico who reveals that sweet sabinos wish is just too dangerous to grant  asha pleads in its actuality of inspiring the next generation or to simply return sabinos wish to him theres another plot point about the subject forgetting their own wish once they speak it into the universe but its to no avail and the young lass loses any chance of an apprenticeship and returns home defeated given magnificos enhanced thirst for power wish feels quite telegraphed in its narrative footing and unsurprisingly a little rogue magic comes into play ashas wish upon a star manifests into a physical form granting the forest creatures the ability to talk and sing which extends itself to her trusty goat sidekick valentino a scenestealing alan tudyk  from hereon its standard disney fare and whilst many other house of mouse products have resigned to the same structure wish never manages to elevate itself beyond such with its musical arrangements failing to leave much of an impression despite the best efforts of its cast it must be said that debose truly has such a wonderful tone despite reuniting the frozen duo of director buck and screenwriter jennifer lee the emotional resonance and rapid wit that so often pepper disney outings is lacking across wish and as much fun as there is to be had in finding the ghosts of disneys past throughout the gimmick can only hide so much by no means is wish a complete misfire more that its decidedly average  its harmless and light and asha makes for a fine additive into the annals of disney princessdom even though shes not really a princess in the traditional sense but in knowing what the studio is capable of and in banking so much on this films relation to the centennial we cant help but wish for something a little more impactful film critic with a penchant for dwayne johnson jason momoa michelle pfeiffer and horror movies harbouring the desire to be a face of entertainment news
Dec 21 2023,negative, the film will no doubt contain all the flash and sparkle a 200 million production budget can buy yet aquaman 2has quite a hill to climb despite a petition signed by four million fans the nowcontroversial amber heard returns to try and revive her public standing after losing big in the johnny depp defamation case will it work thats part of the adventure in checking it out the

pg a familyfriendly treat from illumination the makers of despicable me minions and sing feeling a bit like a oldstyle pixar film back in the day when pixar understood its connection to its audiences the tale follows a family of mallards who are persuaded to finally leave the comfort zone of their pond and fly south with all the other birds hoping to find a reasonable version of paradise they go off course of course and wind up in the big bad city where they are confronted with a host of comic dangers the most heated of which is a crazed chef beautifully animated migration is a hoot and a half with lashings of slapstick and a nicely packaged theme about the importance of being part of the wider world oh and of family of course way over at the other end of the spectrum sadly is wish 12 95 minutes pg a very expensive and rather dull musical fantasy misfire from disney that joins the long list of films to demonstrate how far the studio has fallen from its mission to serve its traditional family audience the wobbly story involves a singing teen girl called asha who sets about trying to reclaim the cherished wishes of her community which are being held in floating bubbles by the nasty king magnifico the film which has already tanked in the us both critically and commercially  whod want to be a disney executive these days  struggles with casting magnifico as the villain of the piece  the dude starts out as a benevolent sorcerer who creates the loving world asha and everyone else lives in he seems like a nice guy though wish contains none of the identity politics that have soured other disney flops strange world lightyear elemental its main snag is just how abstract and drab the premise is with its mediocre songlist and surprising dearth of humour leaving viewers unengaged if disney creatives cant do better than this heaven help them woody allen hits another lattercareer high with coup de chance  96 minutes pg a frenchlanguage comedy thriller about a beautiful

remarkable edgy performance from stone the film is graced by fantastic set design and amazing cinematography that toggles between blackandwhite and luscious colour in one life  108 minutes pg anthony hopkins puts in a typically understated affecting performance as nicholas winton the english stock broker who along with a team of dedicated volunteers rescued hundreds of children from czechoslovakia in the late 1930s on the even of the nazi invasion alternating between the prewar period  with johnny flynn playing the young winton with quiet stoicism  and 1987 the film chronicles the risky effort to transport the children and wintons attempts to share his story  its a true jewel of a film a touching reallife tale about real heroes with the exacting recreation of wintons appearance on the popular tv show thats life a powerful highlight sydney sweeney  glen powell in anyone but you loosely based on william shakespeares much ado about nothing  its a highly predictable jaunt about two onenight standers played by sydney sweeney  glen powell who have to pretend to be together so they can survive a wedding and avoid unwanted entanglements with way too many shots of the opera house and strained caricatures of australiana the film contains plenty of nearnudity including pornlike shots of naked men with their genitals falling just below the frame line all hail the crusade of adultgeared romcom fluff yet it is chiefly the easily pleased who will forgive the film its lack of invention and the rather glaring fact that the main male character is a total and unlikeable prat
Dec 20 2023,positive,while this isnt the most essential bigscreen cartoon youll ever see there is plenty of good stuff happening on a regular basis particularly whenever the multitalented debose gets to sing or pine gets to indulge in some kooky villainy
Dec 19 2023,negative,filled with catchy new songs and featuring a classic disney storyline wish is a whole heaping of heart thats completely  wish is shattered by a dreamless plot and hopelessly shallow character development
Dec 19 2023,positive, summary a young girl named asha wishes on a star and gets a more direct answer than she bargained for when a troublemaking star comes down from the sky to join her
Dec 18 2023,positive,while theres certainly fun to be had in spotting all the ghosts of disney past the story felt slight and just missing a little of the mouse house magic
Dec 15 2023,negative, many cultural critics mourn the death of the monoculture however there are few companies more engrained in cultural consciousness like disney between its films experiential offerings and a plethora of personal characters the company rooted itself in the history of american pop culture its tendrils are long and have helped shape discourse about film and television for decades one needs to look no further than those who decry animation as cartoons for kids to see the impact of their dominance to celebrate its 100th anniversary disney chose to focus wish  the animation studios 62nd feature  on the origins of the star what we get is a featurefilled with loving tributes to the companys history sadly this also leaves the audience with bad songs and a shockingly thin story following the story of asha ariana debose wish takes us to the mystical realm of rosas in this kingdom king magnifico chris pine offers a trade safety for your wishes about fifteen times a year magnifico grants his citizens wishes but only once he confirms the wish will not upset his utopia when asha discovers her 100yearold grandfather victor garber will not get his wish granted she fights with magnifico in the aftermath asha sings to the sky as she wonders about rosas future suddenly a livingbreathing star named star comes out of the sky with stars help asha hopes to return the wishes that will go ungranted to the people  from its opening number wish suffers for serving too many masters this begins with its seemingly corporate mandate to celebrate disney as a company over telling an innovative story for decades disney created nods to its previous films by reusing cell animation visuals and animatics for example beauty and the beast and cinderella feature the same dance sequence to close the story robin hood utilized character designs from the disney talkinganimal library at times wish opts to utilize similar pastiche however it does on a much higher scale with mere minutes between these easter eggs sometimes showing multiple in the same scene this often sacrifices story in favor of delivering a moment of fan service  few companies have utilized fan service quite like disney the concept which seemed to gain power when used by star wars marvel and even 2013s mickey mouse gave the fans unique moments theyd longed to see in an ipdriven era of television and film giving audiences what they wanted seemed like a strong pitch yet the divides and changing sensibilities of some fandoms hurt some of these products while those with vision could serve both masters thats where wish finds its struggle as it utilizes the fanservice to play on nostalgia and fanknowledge rather than integrate the concepts into the heart of the story  when one starts to pull at the threads of wish the storyline quickly falls apart rather than use the concept of giving up ones wish for safety and exploring that complicated philosophical trade there seems to be mass delusion over getting ones dream returned to them this also supports the idea that we would prefer a onetime payout of our highest dreams rather than struggle to achieve them over time additionally some individuals become a shell of themselves when they lose their wish its remarked on a few times but also seems selective in those affected each of these threads on their own could be interesting to explore on their own and could frankly be the entire premise of a future disney film yet wish jumbles them all together does little to explore any of these concepts and plows ahead with its frankly underwhelming protagonist  early in the movie magnifico tries to speak to asha about the wishes when she immediately pushes for her grandfathers wish magnifico remarks that it usually takes longer for potential assistants to ask him for the favor were meant to believe that asha is strong of heart and mind but its clear that her interests are based on her own perceptions of the world shes an idealist but the film never tries to grapple with the reality of her situation instead shes proven to have the correct opinion over and over again specifically because of magnificos increasingly bad decisions theres almost no grey area in this movie life is not that cut and dry to make matters worse the songs throughout wish fall unbelievably flat the standout ballad this wish is stuffed with platitudes the same issues plague welcome to rosas im a star and knowing what i know now additionally each feels wildly formulaic shockingly these are much better than this is the thanks i get  which instantly enters the discussion for the worst disney villain song of all time this frankly abysmal and forgettable series of songs put wish at afurther disadvantage finally weve discussed the plethora of ideas in the screenplay its a movie full of ideas never focusing on any onecentral concept unfortunate colloquialisms making their way into the script peep the name ungrateful much and the prob are all uttered in this movie that instantly date wish yet perhaps the most frustrating comes in character design even though the cellshading concept is a new look for disney the actual character design is nearly identical to those in encanto strange worlds or onward disneypixar needs to show more variation in their design as this makes the side characters difficult to identify ultimately wish will have its fans in fact our own writer  josh  was quite high on it however its difficult to get excited about a movie that feels as empty as wish does disney must step back and not rely on our love of existing stories they need to create the next great chapters in the companys legacy wish has the elements within it to be that movie however forcing it to handle a strange concept and then also serve as a celebration of original art never allows it to live up to its potential 
Dec 14 2023,positive,its a solid solid way to celebrate its anniversary 
Dec 11 2023,negative, its been a rough 2023 for disney after strike delays and the failure of various bigname releases wish has suffered the ignominy of being the worstreviewed disney animation in nearly 20 years the film opened to the lowest rotten tomatoes score since 2006s chicken little can this new musical really be that bad reuniting frozen screenwriter jennifer lee with codirector chris buck the film is set in the magical kingdom of rosas ruled over and protected by the sorcerer king magnifico chris pine the seemingly benevolent ruler offers his citizens one wish on their 18th birthday taken from a store of wishes given to him by the kingdom magnificos apprentice asha ariana debose hopes to use her wish to fulfil her grandfathers dream but this leads to her finding out that magnifico is not as caring as people believe  with all the visual flair you would expect from a disney production there isnt much to the story other than the familiar hum of the past its broadly about hope overcoming adversity and of course magic but so much time is devoted to securing viral moments that theres precious little reason to care about the characters success its as if the films creatives were brought in shown previous hits and told do something like that its easy to point to musical numbers like pines laboured this is the thanks i get and be reminded of youre welcome from moana or perhaps encantos we dont talk about bruno  its a shame that such an assembly line approach would be wasted on this excellent cast debose is likeable as the heroine but has little to work with in comparison to other lead characters with scarce backstory and little social interaction with the world around her pine in his first voice role since a brief appearance in the first spiderverse movie nails the fake charm of the villain but is unlikely to be keeping anyone up at night with a performance lacking genuine menace alan tudyk voices an animal sidekick in a running disney gag that at this point feels cynical  wishs release coincides with the 100th anniversary of walt disney studios unfortunately this only highlights what is missing from this bythenumbers fairytale that never comes close to emulating the magic of the past 
Dec 11 2023,positive, like many children born in the 1990s i was blessed with the many animated wonders of disney shaped by numerous heartwarming educational stories now as an adult i still maintain high levels of enthusiasm and anticipation for each new disney animation release especially original movies under the guidance of directors chris buck director on tarzan surfs up frozen frozen ii  fawn veerasunthorn head of story on raya and the last dragon two wellknown names in animation with multiple creative at the studio wish combines the storytelling craftsmanship of the former with the exciting directorial debut of veerasunthorn whose previous credits involve valuable contributions to many of disneys beloved stories the premise of disney animations wish follows many typical studio formulas for better or worse in the magical kingdom of rosas the 17yearold protagonist asha voiced by ariana debose a sharpwitted idealist makes a wish so powerful that its answered by a cosmic force  a little star of boundless energy called star together asha and star face the ruler of rosas king magnifico to save their community and show that when the courageous will of a human connects with the magic of the stars anything can happen only from this synopsis its relatively easy to predict most of what will happen in the movie the narrative structure of wish proves to be to some extent a tribute to disneys legacy on one hand this choice evokes a nostalgic longing bringing back a simplistic villain with basic motivations something that many admirers of disneys renaissance era will appreciate on the other hand it remains a traditional formula with several limitations hindering the exploration of bolder more surprising narrative paths buck and veerasunthorn execute their ideas well but rely too much on the central theme and character to tell their story  a factor that for many viewers is the key difference between it being a rewarding or disappointing experience that said at the heart of wish we find a beautiful powerful message about the importance of wishes in our lives a theme that resonates with both younger and older audiences wishes are intrinsic to our souls and without them we lose purpose and meaning in life the pursuit of what we desire and dream of is presented in this story as the catalyst for true freedom highlighting how our relentless will to pursue our goals whether improvised or longterm is crucial for personal fulfillment and genuine happiness further exploring this theme wish also delves into the complexities of the personal discovery journey we all undergo at some point in our lives represented by the protagonist asha portrayed with wonderful charm by debose academy award winner for west side story is the living embodiment of the wishes that shape our identity her arc is an emotional dance  often literally  between uncertainty and determination emphasizing how personal wishes arent mere impulses but essential elements for everyones transformative journey debose with her powerful voice gives the character an authenticity that touches the hearts of the audience making ashas trajectory a captivating focal point within the otherwise generic narrative in fact the voice cast is one of the strengths of wish chris pine taking on the role of the cliche villain delivers one of those performances where any viewer can tell that the actor had a blast recording the film adding an amusingly sinister touch to his lines alan tudyk is another household name as a voice actor contributing greatly with his comedic ability providing many hilarious moments  theres an unexpected chicken sequence that left me laughing long after it finished  as the new toy destined to fill disney store shelves the diversity of voices and the convincing delivery of the various actors are commendable naturally an animated flick from this particular studio cannot exist without plenty of original songs the music of wish features a score by dave metzger once upon a studio with beautiful melodies that fit well into the magical world of rosas but the spotlight is on the songs that are written by julia michaels and benjamin rice while there are one or two less inspired moments  the villains musical sequence didnt convince me and several songs have verses with too many words creating an occasionally awkward rhythm  the timing of the songs is precise as the lyrics are thematically rich and critical for the development of characters necessary worldbuilding and explanation of certain plot details personally its hard not to pick this wish as the standout which promises to become a new fan favorite as for the animation itself wish offers the expected in terms of visual quality while also crafted with a risky somewhat innovative approach for the studio the combination of painted 2d drawings serving as stunning background scenery with classic 3d designs for all of the characters generates a unique aesthetic for the movie the decision to focus the action exclusively on the city of rosas is also a breath of fresh air deviating from the common trend in animated movies of presenting numerous remote locations and characters this choice strengthens the cohesion of the plot and the audiences immersion in a singular environment disney animations wish is a magical journey about the vitality of personal wishes and the importance of pursuing those same dreams although the narrative follows a familiar structure and doesnt delve beyond the central theme the nostalgia it evokes is certainly appreciated ariana deboses powerful voice embodies the inspiring determination of the protagonist leading a talented cast in a movie marked by its beautiful blend of 2d and 3d animation as well as original songs that for the most part will win over the audience its another charming chapter in disneys vast library offering a pleasant experience for fans of all ages
Dec 8 2023,positive, there were a lot of animated films this year while that seems to be the case every year this past decade 2023 has a lot of bigname titles and despite having caught up with most of the nonhollywood titles nimona suzume etc i needed to catch those others elemental last week mario tmnt and wish this week and theres still the boy and the heron robot dreams the monkey king and chicken run dawn of the nugget to go add the liveaction screeners to that list and it really is impossible to see them all were less than two weeks from the gwnyfca vote so ill be focusing on englishlanguage most since the group doesnt generally watch many foreign films then ill pivot to the international oscar submission before the ofcs voting window that starts 1124 theres always a strategy the order of watching does matter i only hope that searchlight hits my inbox with poor things and a24 hits my mailbox with the iron claw soon both open buffalo on 1221  two days after the nominations cutoff it really is wild that a major hollywood studio and multibilliondollar toy company allowed something like barbie to be made the selfawareness and selfparodying on display is of the sort that would normally be quashed via legal jargon in whatever contract director greta gerwig had to sign before starting to write the script with noah baumbach if that doesnt show you the power of sitting at the table whether it comes to box office take or oscar nominations i dont know what will gerwig took her clout and turned it into that rare productplacement tiein that actually has something valuable to say dont call the result a message movie though it never stands on a soapbox or demeans one side in order to champion another id honestly argue it could have done a lot more to skewer mattel executives with purpose rather than merely jokes it simply allows its characters to naturally evolve by way of providing necessary conflict because none of these dolls have ever faced that sort of existential crisis before theyve all maintained their pristine utopian forms in barbieland as they were passed from child to child so their innocence could become a personality trait so throwing a curveball like depression or fallibility proves to be a monumental adjustment youre going from zero a record loop of routine complacency to sixty questioning the very fabric of your reality in an instant no wonder it throws barbie margot robbie off enough that her body chemistry shifts give a perfect imaginary ideal a whiff of the cesspool that is human biology and everything falls apart because it also falls apart that fast for us one setback can spiral into years of torment that yoyoing ruins lives because we crave normalcy to start over to realize weve never actually begun thats too daunting to even consider whats ingenious about gerwig and baumbachs story say what you will about the whole but you cannot deny the best part of barbie outside its immaculate production design is its script is that they kill two birds with one stone via their conceit not only is the idea of barbieland being a literal manifestation of a childs imagination allow them to dig into a barbies potential to empower connecting each doll to the many youngsters who have indelible memories of them but it lets them comment on the ways in which the toys reductive nature in a patriarchal capitalistic world is problematic for those gains too barbie awakens to the fear and anxieties of being a woman in a mans world just as ken ryan gosling opens his eyes to the possibilities of having autonomy after a lifetime of always being relegated as the plusone we begin to see that neither end of the spectrum is perfect although we should all be able to agree that barbieland is much closer and that the real lesson is realizing empathy and originality is key and that its not always external forces that delude us into thinking conformity is better oftentimes our worst enemy in that regard is ourselves can dolls made real who bring back what they learned to their fictional existence teach that lesson alone no they get halfway with some wonderfully witty humor capped off by memorable turns from michael cera as allan and kate mckinnon as weird barbie but we need someone on the other side to complement and bolster that journey enter sasha ariana greenblatt and her mother gloria america ferreratwo women fighting for their place in a world that treats them like second class citizens two women who can educate the barbies about reality and reclaim a bit of magic by remembering what it means to dream the result is inspiring its also heartbreaking yes ferreras monologue is that good and hopefully turns her into a dark horse oscar pick for all the great things robbie and gosling are doing on a comedic level of committing to the bit their brilliance lies in the ability to also bring pathos to a narrative that never shies away from the complicated nature of listening to understanding and ultimately accepting anothers lived experience and desires because we all deserve to exist as our own person outside the shadows of utility ownership or conditions we all deserve the opportunity to love ourselves and have that be enough for those who dont understand that the walking dead is about the living monsters rather than the undead ones director taehwa eom and cowriter lee shinjis concrete utopia might be able to drive the point home why because the living monsters are the only ones available in their webtoon adaptation kim soongnyungs pleasant bullying the horde of murderous outsiders looking to take over apartment complex delegate yeongtaks lee byunghun home arent zombies theyre desperate men and women just like those inside the walls they simply werent lucky enough to reside within the only building spared from an apocalyptic earthquake so is it really a utopia or a fortress under siege are the inhabitants worthy of the comfort and security fate let them retain while the rest of the city freezes amidst the rubble or are they tyrants monopolizing their fortune and using delusions of grandeur as the chosen to steal and kill with impunity it truly is the same central question behind robert kirkman tony moore and charlie adlards comic books is rick grimes really any different than the governor or negan or whomever else his band of survivors happen across or is he merely benefiting from his position as our protagonist eom and lee deliver the end of days for these koreans and let us watch whether compassion or greed rules the day the residents coexist with the outsiders soon to devolve into the label cockroaches at first not necessarily by choice since they storm the doors out of necessity for shelter but well enough to be civil until a food shortage starts turning everyone feral suddenly its us vs them a residentonly meeting is called to vote on what to do and yeongtak becomes their unanimous leader after selflessly running into a fire to protect them all cue the inevitable evictions what follows is the usual chaos this archetype produces it didnt quite mark me as effectively as highrise or aniara but its slow descent into hell as tensions and betrayals mount is effective credit the de facto leads in minsung park seojoon and myunghwa park boyoung as a young couple that isnt quite as easily swayed to the side of cutthroat tyranny as most shes a nurse who wants to help from the beginning he doesnt but his conscience stays intact to ensure his many mistakes supply sufficient guilt will they be able to stop this outofcontrol locomotive once it gets going i wont spoil things by answering that question just know concrete utopia doesnt shy from the dark depravity we know the actions of ordinary people in such extraordinary circumstances will reach not that this choice isnt without complexity though eom and lee dont have a season or more to play with the duality of violent good and violent evil via separate factions with character development so they portray it through one man yeongtak lee byunghun is up to the task hes a very determined and very impassioned leader with a strong personality hiding his secrets hes hero and destroyer both how the film plays that conflict out isnt surprising in its overall arc or demand that we question whether loyalty and protection negates the opportunism and deceit that allows it to flourish the specific things that occur however can be quite shocking theres one moment towards the end that made me gasp as loudly as myunghwa despite being totally in character and believable in the moment you dont want to accept it you still want to give these people the benefit of the doubt because youd hope others would give it to you in the same situation sadly it doesnt take a long time looking outside the window onto our own turbulent reality to admit that these days the benefit of the doubt is a luxury few if any deserve despite the very sharp turn towards dissent that caused me to forget to even put gareth edwards the creator on my watchlist i found the film to be both exciting and affecting my favorite science fiction works are those that mine down from their high concept conceit to provide characterbased drama instead so where you might think this is a story about war between humans and ai its actually a potential redemption arc for a man who lost everything as a result of his fealty to a government wielding fear as a means to control its citizenry joshua john david washington had a choice though while the events of the prologue quick hits of humanity creating ai ai evolving into humanlike simulants and the inevitable rubicon crossing that was a nuclear blast in los angeles inspire him to fight for his species years undercover gave him an out tasked to follow maya gemma chan daughter of the socalled nirmata or creator of new asias free race of simulants joshua falls in love the two marry maya becomes pregnant and it seems all is well until an unprovoked attack reveals hes been playing both sides cue tragedy pain regret edwards and cowriter chris weitz flashforward five years to find joshua broken and alone when the real plot begins the us army led by allison janneys howell and ralph inesons andrews still wants to find the nirmatanow more than ever since intel says hes created a weapon that will give simulants an unequivocal victory so they recruit joshua to lead the mission back to his old stomping grounds they promise him he might even be able to reclaim what he lost what none of them could guess however is that hell actually get the opportunity to find even more how via a young simulant girl madeleine yuna voyless alphie the us calls her a weapon his old new asian allies including ken watanabes harun call her their savior joshua simply sees a means to an enda way to find maya again whether or not its just because shes a child his old rhetoric about simulants being programming gradually fades he feels something for her maybe its pity at first but it blossoms into respect and perhaps even acceptance because her innocence somehow renders her real in his eyes and watching humans try to kill her renders them into the monsters theyve always been the result is thus less about the dangers of artificial intelligence and more about americas growing lack of empathy for those it deems foreigners abroad and domestic alike its about our ease at projecting our own violence and aggression onto our victims in order to justify our increased vitriol towards them as if it was us who was harmed by their very existence the messaging and themes become closer to colonizers versus colonized its americans going to distant lands under the auspices of protecting home murdering with impunity and bloodlust in response to a tragedy they refuse to acknowledge their own complicity in igniting sound familiar so much talk tried to connect the creator to the hollywood strikes and the risks of ai displacing artists when its narrative more closely aligns with the current palestinian plight against the globallybacked zionist state of israel when do we finally recognize whats happening when the body in the crosshairs is no longer an adult we can imagine as the enemy the same happens here joshua has extenuating circumstances as far as not putting a bullet in alphies head straight away but her being a child quickly becomes as much a deterrent as the possibility that she might take him to maya ill leave why that duality means more in the context of the whole to the film itself since elaborating would create spoilers all ill say is that it hit me exactly how edwards and company hoped despite what i had read about it being a cold emotionless affair i will even disagree with comments about washington being an unfeeling protagonist too since this might be his most threedimensional and human performance yet add the gorgeous production design breathtaking special effects on a relatively tiny budget compared to its ilk and a pitchperfect ending and this thing is firing on all cylinders heres hoping more people watch it sans expectations to discover just how good it really is its a new beginning for mom jodie comer and dad joel fry their home is set in the heart of london and they have a baby on the way unfortunately this chapter starts for them just as another ends for the entire world relentless storms and flash floods become so destructive that i thought the beginning of mahalia belos the end we start from was a metaphoric hallucination about childbirth for its main character only after young zebs birth is crosscut with water crashing through a window do we realize its really happening london is gone adapted by alice birch from megan hunters novel the narrative moves to its logical next step a parents house luckily dads parents mark strong and nina sosanya are borderline survivalists living high above sealevel with a stronghold of provisions but even those must deplete at some point eventually those who were privileged enough to ride out the early chaos become the ones unprepared for what the world has become in the meantime the story shifts to one of protection delusion nightmare and fantasy some can push through others cannot belos film is slowmoving as a result what began with a rousing couple of scenes with some real electric drama settles into a series of ordeals that want to be more confrontational than they are actually shown to be more than once mom and dad get into a disagreement that ends with a jump cut to her having to fend for herself eventually she meets an ally in o katherine waterston another mother with a toddler and we follow them as they move between shelters and chase the pipe dream that is an island commune seeking to forget the past while building a future comer is very good in the lead its easy to underestimate the performance since the whole turns into a onewoman survivalist show for long stretches so while it feels like were just watching the same thing in different forms over again there is nuance if youre willing to look even so its the supporting characters that stick to your memory since their impact is more explosive waterston is fantasticespecially in her final scene strong too even benedict cumberbatch steals a moment via a brief cameo they each shape moms decisions to move forward by either allowing herself to look back or rejecting the urge those who can take something more from the themes of motherhood and separation will surely come away with a lot more to say and like about the overall film i personally found myself appreciating the journey more than taking anything away from what ultimately proves to be familiar tropes within the postapocalyptic genrealbeit much quieter and more introspective than usual its a solid story that looks and sounds great but i wouldnt be surprised to discover it works better on the page insofar as digging further to unearth the weight of emotion thats ravaging moms heart you cant really blame the filmmakers for going full fan service with the super mario bros movie i would have liked a story but loosely connected action setpieces within nintendos sprawling marioadjacent universe is still fun and thats what the young kids in its target pgrated demo want anyway because this isnt for nostalgic millennials and genxers this is an advertisement for new generations to board the bandwagon so we get a mushroom kingdom obstacle course complete with every powerup imaginable a battle royale with donkey kong mario kart race on the rainbow road dungeons water boards and even brooklyn with varying camera shifts to make the screen look like a sidescrolling platformer add a decent classic rock soundtrack some interesting remixes of the original score and a mostly passable voice cast and this low stakes romp excels at superficial entertainment does it also disappoint you bet especially on the level of being a real movie rather than episodic introduction with more loose ends is peach human then concrete mythology the whole multiverse angle has been played out too but  whatever thats the easiest way to juggle multiple stages the real headscratcher though is an end stinger that epitomizes this mixed results weirdness by teasing a character yoshi whose world they literally showed an hour beforehand two things love a reboot of a known property that doesnt default to origin story even if mutant mayhem is the origin story of the teenage mutant ninja turtles coexistence with humans it keeps their first fifteen years postooze a fun flashback montage and love that director jeff rowe producers seth rogen and evan goldberg and that trios other cowriters let the heroesinahalfshell be teens what a great young voiceacting cast to make it believable too the story itself is a nice entry point into this new tmnt world very reminiscent of the grunge animation popularized by the spiderverse films it introduces the idea of ooze throws a bunch of mutants that havent been in previous films onscreen and gives the leads a trial by fire confidence boost to prepare themselves for the fights ahead watch the credits for a shredder tease the action is slapsticky and kinetic with great choreography and the tone never falters in large part due to making april oneil ayo edebiri a teen too jackie chan as splinter and ice cube as the big bad superfly are both inspired choices and the needle drops are memorable give four non blondes their royalty check but i will say that the joke construction gets very grating rogen and company went heavy on the name dropping and pop culture references that seem to scream hey were hip in the kind of way aging dudes who arent hip anymore would i kept waiting for one of the turtles to actually turn to the camera and wink thats how cringey it became hopefully they can shore that up with the inevitable sequel a people duped into believing their once benevolent king still has their interests in mind despite falling prey to ego and avarice must rise to defeat him by following the one person able to see through the deception because of her selfless heart directors chris buck and fawn veerasunthorn along with screenwriters jennifer lee and allison moore pretty much deliver everything youd want from an old school disney filmcomplete with overthetop villain chris pine is having lots of fun as magnifico and talking animals and objects alan tudyk is great as valentino the goat but nothing beats the mushrooms its big on emotion and message yet very short on plot ariana deboses asha leads a rebellion of the soul to take back the wishes her neighbors volunteered to magnifico under the auspices that he was protecting them and not just hoarding them for loyalty once he loses himself to fear neither is necessarily a bad thing i would have liked better songs though since they range from catchy knowing what i know now to obvious this wish to mostly forgettable this is the thanks i get the real draw is the animation its like wish took 2d cell paintings and modeled them in 3d the backgrounds are simultaneously flat watercolors and 3drendered rooms with perspective depending on the cameras angle same with the clothing hair and faces the duality can be jarring at first but quite beautiful the more you sit with it moshfegh and oldroyd reach a point with the climax where the curtain must be lifted to show the scars this world has etched upon the bodies of those wed like to believe still maintain a semblance of innocence  full thoughts at hhys coon and kozak show that the star wars holiday special truly exists on an island alone as an unwitting cautionary tale never to be repeated again  full thoughts at the film stage scorsese understands he cant truly tell the osages story as a white man in a way that gives them the voice they deserve so he tells the tale of their oppressors instead and he does so with zero sympathy for even their most sympathetic members  full thoughts at hhys the result is entertaining and not without its dramatic reveals but while a good time was had i cant shake the sense that there was potential for so much more  full thoughts at hhys some of what results can be confusing but all of it is dramatically potent and its mostly due to a wonderful performance from zalopany  full thoughts at hhys
Dec 7 2023,positive, as disney celebrates its 100th year its walt disney animation studios borrows its past for its latest film wish its 62nd making references to at least a few of the 61 that came before it most notably wish leans into the idea of wishing upon a star giving viewers a few bars of the melody from when you wish upon a star  from 1940s pinocchio  before the movie even actually begins and visually it uses stateoftheart digital tech to execute what the films production notes refer to as a watercolor storybook style meant to evoke the watercolor paintings that inspired early disney films including sleeping beauty snow white and the seven dwarfs and yes pinocchio fortunately wish is more than a walk down memory lane while not an instant classic the musicfilled adventure is a wholly enjoyable perfectly pleasant cinematic experience  one with a message about holding on to and working toward ones dreams as with many a good disney movie an appealing young woman resides at the heart of its story asha voiced by ariana debose is one of the residents of rosas a fantastical island located off the iberian peninsula where wishes can come true that is thanks to king magnifico chris pine a sorcerer who grants one wish per month from those given at a ceremony marking a persons 18th birthday all of this is covered quite thoroughly in the energetic and catchy deboseled opening number welcome to rosas one of seven original songs penned by singersongwriter julia michaels and producersongwritermusician benjamin rice theres a catch however to this whole wish deal once you make your wish its held onto by magnifico until he grants it and the person making it forgets what it is until then sounds a little iffy to us but the people of rosas love their king that includes asha who is set to interview to be his apprentice get that prestigious gig she figures and she can persuade magnifico to finally grant the wish of her 100yearold grandfather sabino victor garber or alias she seems a shooin especially because as she learns she has a fan in magnificos wife queen amaya angelique cabral big sky who admires the way asha is there for her friends family and others on the island it isnt long into her interview though that magnifico and asha find they arent crazy about one another asha becomes disheartened by the reason magnifico has never granted some wishes like that of her grandfather and he is offended that she so quickly would ask anything of him disillusioned after magnificos latest showy wishgranting affair asha makes a wish  yes on a star  and soon has the company of a little personified ball of energy that she calls well star as magnifico takes a turn toward cartoonish supervillainy asha her suddenly talking pet goat valentino alan tudyk star and others risk much to stop the king whos now getting high on his own supply  of wishes the screenplay by jennifer lee  the writer and codirector of frozen and frozen ii whos now the studios chief creative officer  and allison moore packs in so many supporting characters that few of them have an impact even star a very important player never feels fully developed but the silent little electric thing certainly has its magical moments and while tudyk is good for a few laughs as the overthetop valentino the harley quinn voice actor sounds as if hes voicing a cross between clayface and the joker his characters on that hilarious max adultoriented animated series to the point that its a little distracting that said directors chris buck  lees codirector on the frozen films  and fawn veerasunthorn head of story on disneys raya and the last dragon  keep things moving along nicely as they keep the focus on the two welldeveloped characters asha and magnifico the performance by debose the prom west side story helps endear us to asha from the films first few minutes and the gifted singer shines with leading numbers including the yearnful this wish and the determined knowing what i know now however its pine star trek hell or high water who steals the show as the powerhungry and vain magic man the charismatic actor seems to be having a lot of fun singing the kings disgruntled and selfloving this is the thanks i get as the selfreferential wish arrives in theaters on thanksgiving week the 100yearold walt disney animation studios is all but asking for a little appreciation thanks to many films of this quality or better its earned it

Dec 6 2023,negative, when disney animation head jennifer lee announced wish as the companys century celebration film during their 2022 d23 upcoming slate presentation fans were skeptical to celebrate 100 years of disney magic lee told the audience that the studio would be producing a new animated musical based on the titular star from their theme tune when you wish upon a star with recent oscar winner ariana debose west side story attached to voice the lead character it felt to many like disney was indeed scraping the bottom of the ip barrel unfortunately despite a sizeable effort the finished product manages to prove those initial criticisms well founded  wish comes from codirectors chris buck frozen tarzan and animatorturnedfirsttimehelmer fawn veerasunthorn with lee and allison moore behind the screenplay the film is set in the medieval era within the kingdom of rosas where king magnifico chris pine and his wife queen amaya angelique cabral rule and govern the deal if one wants to live in the kingdom of rosas under the protection of magnifico residents must give him their one true wish as part of a ceremony when they turn 18 when 17yearold asha debose discovers magnificos dark secret she makes a wish so powerful that a literal star shoots down from the night sky to help her  the cinematic fairytale begins with a classic but sloppy storybook introduction as asha explains the history of the kingdom of rosas to the audience this opening sequence highlights wishs biggest problem the writing and directing just dont match up the unfortunate result is a movie that never lives up to its potential  visually that opening and the rest of the film work wonders as an homage to past disney classics the watercolour animation style is jawdroppingly beautiful some frames look like paintings taken directly from the louvre the defined pencil strokes the wider aspect ratio and gorgeous nods to sleeping beauty cinderella and more will hit any disney fan right in the feels  but after the first few sequences it quickly becomes clear that wishs underdeveloped story doesnt live up to the studios gorgeous animation at the films conclusion wish feels uncannily like a generic version of modern disney hits like encanto or moana it contains only a few moments of the distinct magic that so often elevates the animated classics that have come before the very best disney films are simple but this one is anything but simple in premise and ultimately presents far more questions than it gives answers  the fact that wishs most significant flaw is its story is severely disappointing given one of the films greatest strengths is its initial premise an animated feature representing a century of disney animation seems like a no brainer the idea of a young girl trying to stop her king from stealing his kingdoms wishes is also great combining them into one overarching concept could have been great but with the creative choices made wish is messy and overcrowded  at the films start asha visits her best friend dahlia at dahlias bakery when she arrives we meet their six other friends who combine to represent the seven dwarfs from snow white an idea perfect for a disney celebration but not one with the story complexity that wish has and should be focusing on whats worse is that the film actually had the time to explore most things the movie sets up but the writing ignores those more unique features in favour of generic adventure story beats in fact the most entertaining parts of wish are all in the first 25 minutes after that the plot grinds to a halt and rarely escalates in any nonpredictable way  wish also falls short in the villain department disneys golden era villains were pure evil no questions asked flashforward to the 21st century and there have been a real lack of memorable baddies if there was ever a film primed for a new and timeless villain wish was it disappointingly king magnifico is a generic combination of past disney characters without any unique or delicious characteristics to make him iconic thats perhaps most perfectly laid out in king magnificos villain song this is the thanks i get which is catchy but as many have pointed out sounds nothing like a disney villain song the music in wish comes from pop singersongwriters julia michaels and benjamin rice while both are immensely talented they were perhaps not the greatest pick for this project this wish sung beautifully by debose is the only track that comes close to evoking the feeling one gets from listening to their favourite disney themes the rest of the soundtrack is akin to the mediocre pop fair you hear on the radio and immediately turn off or tune out given one of the most necessary attributes of a disney animated classic is lavish musical numbers the lack of memorable ones in wish is extremely disappointing its baffling that the studio approved these songs knowing what the movie was attempting to celebrate  with all of these clashing creative choices wish is yet another cinematic example of the lack of focussed disney leadership its becoming painfully apparent in the finished product across every brand under the conglomerates massive umbrella wish could have been a timeless classic if it had a hint of its own identity and embraced the necessary elements of iconic disney films of the past since the film commits to neither it seems unlikely wish will be the bright star disney animation desperately wanted it to be  all you need is death is the latest in the celtic folk horror genre that will appeal to fans of you are not

Dec 5 2023,negative,on the basis of its halfthoughtout script hollywood writers fears of being supplanted by artificial intelligence appear wellfounded this movie seems proud even smug about recycling scraps from other fairy tales
Dec 4 2023,neutral,wish features plenty of classic disney nods a great performance from debose and two solid musical numbers unfortunately this story feels rushed scattered and extremely familiar the villainous arc goes nowhere and the spark is somewhat missing
Dec 3 2023,positive, a centennial production that manages to do what disney have repeatedly struggled with and properly tap back into that sense of wonder and childlike joy that audiences to this day associate with the studio
Dec 2 2023,neutral,disney once upon a time provided outstanding movie magic for the entire family sadly that time has passed
Dec 2 2023,negative, wish doesnt originate from an interesting character or a fresh story it originates from a desire to selfcongratulate the movie is about the disney star  the one jiminy cricket sang about wishing upon and the one featured in the studios logo it imagines something like the marvel cinematic universe where all the disney animated characters exist in the same world references to them are everywhere from the beginning all the way through to the postcredits scene ironically in its desire to celebrate disney magic wish fails to generate any magic of its own asha ariana debose lives in the kingdom of rosas she dreams of working alongside king magnifico chris pine who has collected the wishes of his people ostensibly to keep them protected in bubbles occasionally he will select one to come true asha learns that hes not nearly as benevolent as he seems and is in fact hording wishes to prevent them from coming true frustrated by this she wishes on a star for a way to stop him that star comes down from the sky giving her pet goat the ability to talk andwell this is a weird movie on its own wish is mediocre yet harmless the animation is pretty if not innovative the songs are catchy although theres nothing on par with frozens let it go or even encantos we dont talk about bruno the plot aims for a sweet theme about the importance of having a wish in life thats nice but not necessarily treated with the depth that emotions were in inside out or love was in beauty  the beast overall the movie is lowertier disney thats because the story is working too hard to be a tribute not every reference is blatant some certainly are as when peter pan wanders into a scene others are more subtle you cant help noticing them though and theyre distracting ariana debose is wonderful as asha nevertheless the characters journey is flat given that she doesnt have an actual arc for herself her arc is intended to serve disney similarly king magnifico isnt a particularly fearsome villain since his motivation is driven by a need to infer his connection to other disney figures maybe the worst sin of all is that the star itself is kind of boring thanks to an inability to speak it isnt able to develop a personality considering the star is the single object the entire movie revolves around thats a massive flaw wish obviously aspires to be another disney classic it should have aspired to develop a tale worth telling

pm wednesday dec 6 filmmaker qa after the screening  near the end of napoleon the eponymous french emperor joaquin phoenix demands to know what happened to the adoring letters he wrote to his beloved joséphine vanessa kirby yet for all his lordly airs napoleon doesnt sound like a conqueror he sounds like a high schooler whining about his flirty love notes to a cute girl in algebra class getting tossed in the trash such is life in napoleon which fuses the beautifully erratic humanity of phoenix with the sweeping meticulousness of director ridley scott portraying napoleon as both a devilish strategist and a lovesick dope is hardly a stretch when the emperor died in exile in 1821 his final words were france the army head of the army joséphine that demands a paramour of mythic proportions though mythic hardly does kirbys joséphine justice a scene in which she bares her crotch to napoleon once you see it you will always want it she prophetically declares is memorable but barely necessary one word spoken in kirbys steely velvety voice could seduce all but the sternest of authoritarians napoleon is even better as a sex comedy than it is as a violent spectacle which is really saying something even the melees scott staged for gladiator are outdone by his poetic and brutish recreation of napoleons theatrics at the battle of austerlitz which leaves lake satschen filled with ice blood and cannon balls still scott never lets us forget that napoleon is the overgrown adolescent who in one scene shames an englishman by shouting you think youre so great because you have boats

Dec 1 2023,neutral, disneys newest animated original wish can be described as the cinematic equivalent of the gift shop youre forced to walk through at the end of the ride its not the worst movie that you will bring your kids to but the obvious goal is to vacuum up more money for the mouse the film itself is supposed to be honoring 100 years of disney with a fairy tale story in the image of past iterations such as sleeping beauty cinderella and snow white only without half of the imagination a few of the original songs are good the animation looks crisp but little interest in giving the audience something fresh instead wish serves up more nostalgia an empty exercise resulting in a fairy tale as fleeting as a shooting star it begins in the friendly town of rosas where the people work together in harmony while the wizard magnifico chris pine has the job of taking the wishes of the people granting only a select few every year his new apprentice becomes asha ariana debose a young woman with the hopes of being as good as the man she follows that is until she gets to know the real magnifico when she discovers he refuses to grant wishes that would benefit anyone outside of himself asha chooses to wish on a shooting star who soon visits her with powers shes never had now with the help of an adorable star a talking goat and her seven friends they must try to stop the powerhungry wizard on the surface wish seems like a nice and harmless approach to trying to create an original new fairy tale sadly what directors chris buck and fawn veerasunthorn have is a broadway play masked as a disney movie the screenplay written by buck jennifer lee and allison moore steals from the dna of frozen peter pan bambi and snow white and the seven dwarves its stolen to a fault where ashas friends all represent one of the dwarves including one who sneezes a bunch one with big dopey ears and another who loves to sleep it turns the entire narrative into one big easter egg hunt for all the disney diehards making the originality obsolete along with minimizing any fresh artistry what should not be denied is the incredible talent of ariana debose and chris pine their vocal work is quite stellar including the rousing duet at all costs and deboses big belter this wish if wish was left to just the two of them delivering dueling songs we might have a better movie but instead it becomes a standard process of asha needing to bring the townspeople together to take down magnifico as his power grows as strong as maleficent its also obvious that the goal is to eventually connect wish to other fairy tales including a cameo by peter pan and a mirror on the wall that might find a way into other faroff lands its not just the soulless part of wish that makes it a miss there are also plot holes including moments where scenes seem to be missing thats something we rarely see in a disney production on top of it there are continuous dollar signs on the screen from an adorable cuddly star that will end up in a bed with little suzie a soundtrack that will garner plenty of streams and the potential for a stage production that may have worked better than this its a celebration of 100 years of disney and done in the only way they know possible all in hopes of making another buck thats just a rotten wish

Dec 1 2023,positive, the continuing theme in creations that have come along since walt disney released the mouse on the world has been the importance of hope how that resonates from films to parks has always been at the heart of disney magic it was never made as clear as in the 1940 animated film pinocchio jimmy cricket as sung by chris edwards told the world that when you wish upon a star makes no difference who you are anything your heart desires will come to you an exclamation mark is put on that philosophy in the new walt disney animation studios release of wish not only is the movie built on a foundation of the need for hope but it also features an animated star that has been the object of so many wishes the film isnt one of the top films to come out of the studio mainly because the music is not as dynamic as in frozen or encanto thats a hurdle that generally is overcome by a solid story from jennifer lee chris buck and allison moore that is laced with optimism and features a heavy dose of nostalgia asha voiced by ariana debose lives in the magical kingdom of rosas she is an idealist who is not afraid to speak her mind even when it comes to the too onthenose named king magnifico chris pine the kings big rule is that every subject must give up their deepest wish it is his viewpoint that average subjects cant be trusted with a wish because the odds are high it will never be fulfilled and that would create great anxiety he has declared himself the only one worthy of saying if a wish should be granted this comes during a yearly ceremony where only a few subjects get their wishes granted asha believes that each person should be the shepherd of their own wish whether it comes true or not just the idea of something grand possibly happening is what gives people hope her viewpoint earns the wrath of magnifico worst name ever for a cartoon villain and it isnt until she makes a wish on a star that she gets help the star a character destined to be a popular toy comes to the kingdom and gives asha magical powers most of the film is a very traditional good vs evil tale what elevates it is the references to past disney projects from peter pan to mary poppins ashas friends are the sneeziest and dopiest group to come along since snow white and the seven dwarfs pine plays the king with such bravado that he is only one twirl of a mustache from being melodramatic directors chris buck and fawn veerasunthorn have painted him as a male answer to maleficent from his obsession with mirrors to his evil rants it is refreshing to see that the primary villain is male as disney has filled films with evil queens and nasty stepmothers for decades buck and veerasunthorn took an interesting direction in the animation although the primary characters have the standard look of drawn characters via a computer the backgrounds have a different texture each setting looks more like an ancient tapestry than the kind of perfectly crisp backdrops of recent animated movies the look fits with how the film uses a modern approach to its theme but a classic approach to the storytelling the seven allnew songs in wish were written by grammy nominated singersongwriter julia michaels and grammywinning producersongwriter benjamin rice michaels has written songs for the likes of selena gomez and shawn mendes while rices works have been recorded by lady gaga and john legend its a nice musical pedigree for both of them but their songs for wish never reach the kind of memorable status of past works songs from past animated offerings such as let it go or we dont talk about bruno are immediately recognizable debose gives everything she has but her talents just cant lift up the music despite the weak soundtrack wish works because of its strong continuation of the disney mantra a warm animation style and a very fun wink and nod to so many past disney productions to have a successful garden you need to know when it is the best time to plant here are the best plants to start in may
Nov 30 2023,positive, lisa johnson mandells wish review says that lovely visuals and an extraordinarily talented voice cast including ariana dubose and chris pine elevate the animated feature that is otherwise just meh in the beginning i was happily enchanted by disneys latest animated feature wish partially because i immediately adored the gorgeous setting with its intriguing moorish embellishments there are so many dazzling artistic opportunities available when basing a fantasy on a mediterranean island likely located between the coast of andalusia and morocco okay so i lived there for a few years fell in love with the area and think the whole world should revel in its aesthetics the gifted artists who worked on wish did the setting full justice with its colorful patterns lights architectural highlights and dimension the movie is a sight to behold children may not be aware of the cultural treats but subliminally theyll be delighted helming the animated film intended to celebrate the rich animated heritage of 100 years of disney was an ambitious project for fresh directors chris buck and fawn veerasunthorn their debut is not bad considering all they had to weave into the film including on the nose references to the when you wish upon a star theme disney enthusiasts will have a great time noting the nods to the classics unfortunately wish may not make the cut to join the pantheon of those disney classics it just doesnt reach the same heights while the plot is forgettable and the message almost imperceptible the cast does their best to elevate the material and by and large succeeds the radiant ariana debose who won an oscar last year for her performance in steven spielbergs westside story reaches a voiceover high note in her portrayal of feisty heroine asha chris pine is at his best voicing the herovillain king magnifico they play against each other in a convoluted story about how the residents of the kingdom on the island of rosas give their fondest wishes to kingsorcerer magnifico for safekeeping while he decides which ones to grant asha uncovers the flaw in his motives and the system and rallies the locals to take back their wishes i think i need a nineyearold to explain it to me but i did enjoy the music and the humor while trying to make sense of it all perhaps i shouldnt overanalyze it just lean back and enjoy if lisa johnson mandells wish review encourages you to pack the kids in the car and head to the cineplex find times and tickets at fandangocom products recommended by at home in hollywood are selected by our editorial team we often receive free samples of these products some of our features include affiliate or sponsored links if you buy something through one of these links we may earn an affiliate commission or other compensation
Nov 30 2023,positive, oh how the mighty have fallen its easy to be weary of wish the newest animated parable from disney meant to commemorate the companys 100th anniversary through a barrage of easter eggs and selfcongratulatory platitudes about the importance of following our dreams despite adopting an original story the film from codirectors chris buck and fawn veerasunthorn falls prey to a multitude of clichés that have become synonymous with the studio in recent years for every attempt at newness the art style the studios first afrolatina heroine there is a recycling of old trademarks the goofy sidekick the patterned musical vignettes therein lies the dilemma of wishs ironic charms to what extent is something a cliché when judged on its own merits and can a movie like wish even be evaluated without endless comparisons to its forebears  set in the kingdom of rosas a magical land ruled by the charismatic king magnifico chris pine wish centers on earnest 17yearold asha ariana debose upon almost landing an apprenticeship at his majestys palace her idealism is crushed as she realizes that the ruler whom she exalted isnt all he seems magnificos claim to fame is granting his constituents wishes and entrusting him with your wish means being freed from the burden of feeling that absencein other words you forget however it soon becomes apparent that the king does not plan on granting most of the wishes hes been given hoarding them in his palace where they will never see the light of day when ashas own wish is answered by a cosmic force she and her friends set out to save their community from magnificos control on its own terms wish isnt half bad the fairytale at its center is adorable and combined with the opaque watercolor effect of its 2d and 3d animation creates the illusion of a childrens book come to lifesomething made even more evident by the films storybook introduction to that point its easy to wave away any questions that arise such as why did no one else see through the kings veneer when his whole thing is stealing peoples dreams the moral lesson matters more than any inuniverse logic theres value in teaching children about the strength that comes from being part of a collective and that individualism will only get you so far pines totalitarian ruler is the kind of classic disney villain the company has been phasing out in recent years and if nothing else the concept of a young person becoming disillusioned with the leadership in her country after getting a look behind the curtain feels prescient better teach these kids now before its too late still the irony of praising a film about nonconformity from a media conglomerate with such an iron grip on our culture is not lost and wish certainly relies on tired formulas if you thought olaf from frozen was annoying watch outthere are multiple hyperactive sidekicks here the anthropomorphic star who looks like a kirby character and doesnt talk is cute but baby goat valentino alan tudyk is sure to quickly irritate adults meanwhile the human characters for the most part have the exaggerated cadence and mannerisms of disney channel actors who perform as though there are casting agents watching waiting to whisk them on to more promising opportunities the songs are also a mixed bag debose makes a wonderful addition to the disney princess or notquiteprincess roster her themean empowering anthem á la let it gois beautiful and the choice to have asha sing it twice once alone and once as part of a collective is charming and clever other musical numbers such as magnificos the thanks i get are lackluster the bouncy beat painfully reminiscent of generic radio fodder like imagine dragons on top of the world rather than the musical theater sensibilities of your classic disney villain song it doesnt help that writers allison moore and jennifer lee bizarrely choose to pepper references to other better disney movies throughout given the companys acquisition and franchising of nearly everything under the sun one wouldnt be blamed for reading this as a stab at the shared universes popularized by disneys subsidiary marvel despite its current connotation though disney has already been doing these minor tributes to its previous films for decades still its hard to imagine wish having the longevity that the companys other recent output such as soul and encanto are clearly poised for from the intricate line art of 101 dalmatians to the impressive realism of moana past disney movies had enough charm to enchant audiences through the decades without relying on generically cutesy sidekicks and musical numbers with all the personality of a boardroom meeting harboring inventive visuals and a heartrending message wish has enough heart going for it what a shame

Nov 29 2023,negative, the halfbaked story attempts to shoehorn  in as many references to previous disney films as possible attempting to explain the origins of characters from snow white and the seven dwarfs cinderella peter pan mary poppins and even zootopia wish is the spiderman no way home of the disney animated canon an attempt to bind their films into one shared universe it was cute when beauty and the beasts belle wandered through the background of the hunchback of notre dame or rapunzel showed up in the crowd at the coronation of queen elsa in frozen those were clever little easter eggs for the sharp eyed fan but this megaprequel feels like a contrivance of the highest order its as if the filmmakers started with these bullet points and then worked backwards to construct a story to fit them it does not work star is a cute character and alan tudyk provides a few laughs as a talking donkey but the film around them seems to be actively working against them giving them very little to work with wish is done no favors by a surprisingly bland animation style and a series of generic and unmemorable songs  theres no breakout let it go or we dont talk about bruno to be found here every song feels designed to be a popshowstopper but are instead weighed down by exposition the fact that it spends so much time trying to explain itself should have been a red flag to all involved but instead somehow this made it through multiple stages of development to become a major tentpole release honoring the studios storied past that is perhaps wishs greatest weakness much like the studio as a whole it is too focused on what once was rather than charting a course toward what could be it feels stuck in the past trapped by its own limiting conceit unable to break free of the manufactured nostalgia its trying so desperately to peddle even as someone who feels genuine nostalgia for those films wish feels like its simply trying too hard and as a result it fails on nearly every conceivable level its just a feature length greatest hits reel that makes you wish you were watching something better
Nov 29 2023,neutral, this year in case you hadnt heard disney celebrates its 100th birthday and as a present to itself the animation giant has commissioned wish  a film that celebrates that most disney of themes wish fulfilment set in the mediterranean kingdom of rosas its a world created by its king a sorceryproficient ruler named magnifico chris pine he has captured everyones wishes storing them in blue baubles in his kingdom and doling them out very irregularly when young asha ariana debose visits the king to see if she can become his apprentice she has one thing in mind the latest wish ceremony coincides with her grandfathers 100th birthday how very disney and she would love for his hearts desire to be granted then in the way only disney can asha meets a star who falls from the sky  a bright yellow cutie who has magical powers to grant wishes from there our wholesome heroine encounters a menagerie of talking animals including her pet goat valentino alan tudyk when she takes a trip into the forest the film comes codirected by fawn veerasunthorn and chris buck the latter cowriting the script with allison moore and his erstwhile codirector on the mega hit frozen jennifer lee unfortunately theres little chance of buck and lee conjuring the same magic here to start with the films songs are instantly forgettable only in isolated moments such as when a crop of talking mushrooms get used as drum cymbals are there flashes of charm largely it feels like a selfcongratulatory nod to disney past the end credits feature images of such disney stalwarts like pooh bear the jungle books baloo and the foxy robin hood there are even oblique references to mary poppins and peter pans neverland in the story itself plus if you stay to after the end credits youll find a very sweet rendition of when you wish upon a star the song made famous in 1940s pinocchio maybe the house of mouses century of achievement merits some sort of celebration but wish isnt really it the animation does have a pleasingly oldschool handdrawn sheen to it and west side story star debose gives a lively and likeable vocal turn

Nov 28 2023,neutral, this mercifully short musical fantasy feels as if a studio executive shoveled every one of disneys animated classics into an artificial intelligence program and used the result to construct a 92minute collective commercial for the centennial anniversary of the mouse house this should not be a bad thing at all for younger audiences whove yet to experience the original magic of snow white and the seven dwarfs pinocchio bambi dumbo and other classics the agreeably unmemorable songs spectacular set pieces faintly touching plot and obligatory comic relief animals and objects one that could well be the star wished upon by jiminy cricket will engage them enough for wish to find an appreciative audience nonetheless for the rest of us this wishywashy movie might be best viewed as a featurelength game of spotting numerous disney references crammed into the dialogue and visuals bright and idealistic 17yearold asha ariana debose  a bundle of nervous energy and overarticulated cuteness  wants to become the emperors apprentice in rosas a magical land ruled by the handsomely beneficent sorcerer king magnifico chris pine as a supposed service to the people king magnifico collects all the residents dreams for safe keeping in blue glass bubbles that float inside his palatial house once every year he says he might grant a wish asha presses the king to consider granting her fathers secret wish when he refuses she dares to criticize him for not returning the wishes to the people and threatens to tell everyone prompting a suddenly volatile king to reveal the real shorttempered megalomaniacal dictator under his doctor strange facade she then makes a wish so big that it causes the rosas citizens to glow  and summons forth the most magical of stars a celestial entity so famous it goes by a single name star does this zippy emojilike character free the peoples dreams nope but it does enable animals to speak english just in time for asha to find a comical sidekick  a talking goat named valentino alan tudyk one might ponder exactly what form of criminal activity has king magnifico committed he promised to free his people of the burden of unrealized dreams and would consider granting one every year and the residents agreed to this deal what if wish is really a cautionary political tale about the dangers of pinning hopes and dreams on a charismatic leader promising to unburden his followers who are blind to the true egodriven id creature lurking under those sharp clothes and productfixed hair i decide what everyone deserves the king thunders his soft blue eyes turning into green laser beams of raw control and power he orders his people to hunt down asha the single dissenter in this supposedly utopian kingdom do they comply how sad that the animated movie selected to celebrate 100 years of disney joyously references so many classics but fails to include two components key to their successes innovation and unforgettable characters

Nov 28 2023,negative, by walter chaw its possible to catch the zeitgeist express and still suck and heres the proof fawn veerasunthorn and chris bucks flaccid disturbing les mizforkids disney flick wish on the verge of giving her fondest wish to the autocrat king magnifico chris pine in exchange for his beneficent magical protection 17yearold asha ariana debose discovers that magnifico is actually a fanatical powerdrunk authoritarian zealot his greatest fear is that one of his people in the kingdom of rosas may nurse a fond wish that leads to his downfall so he hoards them extracting them during a ritual from his people as they grow from childhood to the rest of their wishless lives he keeps them as bubbles of blue smoke in a glass observatory in his castle why doesnt he just destroy the ones he deems dangerous asha is a classic disney heroine who makes the critical error of asking magnifico why her grandfather sabino victor garber cant have his wish finally fulfilled upon his hundredth birthday the wish in questionto write a song that inspires the next generationhas been deemed too radical is why magnifico shows his true colours and crushed asha assembles her posse of lovable misfit village children to overthrow their ruler she has magical help though in the form of an adorable wishing star shes summoned with a real curtainraiser of a broadwaystyle number belted with best original song gusto their plan to convince the king to return everyones wishes for the people to do with as they please brings to mind great ideas of the past like the internet or pandoras box there are two things wish forces you to consider and the first is that it is a childs version of tarkovskys stalker in which the macguffin is a thing that could conjure a persons fondest wish the second is that no one has really thought through the ramifications of the movies premise in stalker the people who are given their wish kill themselves in wish the first thing the new republic of rosas does when it expresses the power of its people is to exile magnifico into a twodimensional purgatory for the rest of eternity grim more than grim it appears to be an apologia for a certain kind of groupthink that glorifies the dreams of the individual over social consequences and the need for an organizing principle this seems like sympathy for the devil right for a defense of murdering dreams in favour of finding fulfillment in quotidian pursuits i propose a middle road where kids maybe shouldnt be told they can have or do anything they want should they only wish it hard enough on the one hand the timing for a film like this is good appearing as it does in the middle of an active period of protest and organized labour actionand indeed the climactic battle features the citizens of rosas manifesting the sentiments of good morning starshine to focus their twinkle and collectively rise above wishs connection to hair is more than follicledeep in fact both are pieces of pop provocation appearing during a period of unpopular war and social unrest but only one of them has the courage to say that the usual pragmatism and distraction will snuff out all this energy wish has its good morning starshine but not its flesh failures that face a dying nation of moving paper fantasy and on the other hand the timing of wish is terrible because all i can think about is all the dead children chalked up as casualties of an inevitable religious war designed to bring about the end of the world by the death cult we have collectively voted into power this suffering is the product of wishes toothe ones had by good people worshiping good religions asha and the plight of her little buddies hits differently now than it would have a year ago six months ago king magnificowhite bearded unshakeable in the belief of the correctness of his wisdomhits differently as well the idea that a cult leader or a nation of people not doing a good job of disguising how quickly they turn to retribution and tribalism might see the hell theyve created as utopia is possibly the only thing i found realistic about wish even as wish promises that what youre seeing when youre watching a horror movies resolution is something good instead of something depressing i think thats the overriding impulse driving wishs creation the wish that this aggressive harvesting of every disney movie that worked and a few that didnt strikes you as novel and uplifting rather than as an endorsement for the way things always were vengeancefuelled and misdirected in the end the first casualty of war is always innocence
Nov 28 2023,positive,from the fantastical fairytale setting to the blandly designed characters and contrived plot nothing feels very original but theres plenty of charm to keep us watching a few enjoyably nutty moments and some terrific voice work from an ace cast
Nov 28 2023,positive, like trying to recreate a delicious meal with all the same ingredients  a strong female lead living in a beautiful remote place who tries to stem someones magical powers  wish is what the disney diner has served up this centenary film to mark the yearlong celebration of 100 years of walt disney is the story of young asha ariana debose who lives in the magical kingdom of rosas the first scene harps back to many classics with the opening of a storybook and the words once upon a time     it then uses this device as a tool to explain the slightly convoluted rules that govern rosas beloved king magnifico chris pine collects a wish from everyone when they turn 18 then when hes compiled them into a giant bauble that floats around the ceiling of his castle the giver of the wish forgets his or her desire to do something extraordinary he wants his citizens to desire little from life and have control over their hopes and dreams while once seeming to be a handsome hero hes quickly revealed as a narcissist wanting to dangle empty promises over the kingdom there are some cracking power ballads with debose getting the goosebumps rising a cute sidekick in the form of a baby goat and plenty of nods to other disney movies and their characters but the humour and heart of frozen moana and tangled are just not there  and theres very little jeopardy or magical moments that make your eyes well up with tears of joy the pair check into a gothic welsh country house hotel where rosalind   a genteel woman with a clipped accent pearls tweed skirts and faithful spaniel ludo by her side  spent time as a child and julie seeking inspiration for her new screenplay hopes to unearth buried memories the floorboards creak windows bang and ludo whines repeatedly richly layered set textures are deftly employed to unsettle  walls are dark and foreboding and lamps dim while neat modern touches such as julies trainers playfully add contrast to keep us guessing whether this house is haunted or not it sees wealthy couple amanda julia roberts and clay ethan hawke leaving their new york townhouse for a weekend away in the hamptons just outside the city the pair arrive at a sprawling immaculate house to soon be joined by the alleged owner gh scott mahershala ali and his daughter the very outspoken ruth myhala soon the whole of america is in crisis with the characters guessing it is a terrorist attack as gh constantly alludes to knowing more than he lets on yet still remains vague meanwhile amanda is a clichéd white woman idiot everyone appears to talk in riddles and you dont know who you are meant to like  if anyone

Nov 28 2023,negative, poor disney barely a fortnight after its latest superhero offering the marvels delivered the worst opening weekend performance at the american box office for a marvel movie this new animation has received the studios lowest score in 18 years on the reviewaggregating website rotten tomatoes directed by chris buck and fawn veerasunthorn respectively the codirector and storyboard artist on frozen and written by jennifer lee who wrote and codirected that film wish arrives almost a year to the day since disneys last animated flop strange world the brand is clearly in crisis and this is why disney has very literally lost the plot
Nov 28 2023,negative, a pair of hugely complicated marriages dominate two major biopics this week both films tell the stories of great men one called bernstein the other bonaparte whose love lives at least in these cinematic interpretations drove and defined them almost as much as their genius bradley coopers maestro is a searingly intelligent drama focusing on the complex relationship between the mighty american composer leonard bernstein superbly played by cooper and his wife the costa ricaborn actress felicia montealegre a matchingly exquisite performance from carey mulligan many of those complexities spring from bernsteins bisexuality when we first meet him in the 1940s he has a male lover and theres a slight but telltale pause when his sister sarah silverman learns that lenny and felicia are romantically entwined however the film deliberately fudges the question of whether felicia knows her husbandtobe also sleeps with men and exactly when she finds out there is a moving scene when bernstein reassures their daughter jamie that theres no truth in the scurrilous rumours shes heard and a furious row between husband and wife in their grand manhattan apartment that has a darkly hilarious counterpoint as a giant inflatable snoopy floats past the window part of the macys street parade all this is so sharply written by cooper and his cowriter josh singer an academy award winner for 2015s spotlight that there are moments when it feels almost impertinent to be watching a public intrusion into private tumult but it is clear throughout that their difficulties are underpinned by mutual devotion which movingly becomes clear when felicia is diagnosed with cancer it was bold of cooper to let bernsteins thrilling musical talent play second fiddle to all this but the film still chronicles his dazzling career and explains how he was tugged in different directions between his extraordinary talent for composing stage musicals above all the incomparable west side story and his equal facility with classical music not long before he died incidentally i was privileged to see bernstein conduct it was an unforgettable spectacle watching an elderly man walk arthritically to the podium slowly pick up the baton and shed decades it was as if he was holding a wizards wand the wrong way round with all its magic animating him cooper both with his performance and direction captures that wonderfully his principal achievement in this film only the second he has directed after 2018s splendid a star is born is to convey the thumping charisma that made everyone in bernsteins orbit dance to his tune moreover maestro does not deserve to be tarnished by the brouhaha that erupted when it first emerged that nonjewish cooper was sporting prosthetics to replicate bernsteins nose bernsteins children gave their approval which is good enough for me there has been another brouhaha around napoleon sir ridley scotts epic telling of the life of napoleon bonaparte as i predicted in my first look review last week historians have got very huffy about the inaccuracies and the broad characterisation of the title character enigmatically played by joaquin phoenix they have a point the film is sumptuously watchable but also inherently flawed phoenix mumbles his way through it sometimes to the point of incoherence and david scarpas script doesnt allow napoleon to express himself much beyond the battlefield where hes a tactical genius and the bedroom where hes a bit of a weirdo we are rather sketchily shown how he rose in postrevolutionary france to be crowned emperor becoming as obsessed as any hereditary monarch with fathering a son to succeed him yet of his myriad other achievements all those innovations that gave rise to the adjective napoleonic there is nothing still at 85 scott remains a heck of a storyteller even if this is not quite the full story of napoleon above all the battle scenes are fantastic starting with the victory that established the ambitious corsicans formidable military reputation his surprise attack on the english to end the 1793 siege of toulon there are plenty of sound reasons to watch this film the music is terrific very stirringly edith piaf accompanies marie antoinette to her execution rupert everett is perfectly cast as the duke of wellington and in particular vanessa kirby is wonderful as the beguiling josephine it is easy enough to see why napoleon is smitten from the moment he first catches sight of her although again one of historys most celebrated love stories is largely reduced to his lust and her forbearance by the time this picture reaches the small screen it will have put on weight in due course apple tv will show the directors cut which lasts about four hours im rarely in favour of filmmaking at that tremendous length but theres no doubt that this boney needs more meat with lacklustre animation and forgettable songs it tries desperately to be a new frozen but falls many snowballs short despite a decent voice cast led by west side storys ariana debose and chris pine the story unfolds in a magical ethnicallydiverse island kingdom ruled by king magnifico pine a control freak who takes and stores the wishes of his loyal subjects asha debose is a spirited 17yearold girl who first seeks an apprenticeship with magnifico but soon realises hes not the benign protector he appears and with the help of a wishing star enrages him by challenging his power over peoples emotions its a nice enough idea if rather complex for the likely audience but theres nothing bewitching about wish unlike frozen it lacks charm and charisma leave the world behind 138 mins  is a netflix thriller in what you might call the armageddon genre starring julia roberts ethan hawke mahershala ali and kevin bacon and executiveproduced by none other than barack and michelle obama roberts and hawke play an affluent new york couple who take their kids to a long island holiday rental owned by alis character only to experience a series of first unsettling and then downright alarming events that suggest america is under attack but by what or whom writerdirector sam esmail presents some spectacular images such as an oil tanker crashing into a beach resort and dozens of driverless teslas crashing but the film is at least 25 minutes too long a quiet place 2018 covered broadly similar territory much more deftly ronnie osullivan the edge of everything 15 113 mins  is an intense documentary following the brilliant snooker champion as he wrestles very profanely with his demons it too goes on a bit  to misappropriate snooker jargon you might need a bottom cushion  but it certainly offers some unprecedented insight into what fires rocket ronnie
Nov 28 2023,negative, the animation world was recently startled by warner bros announcement that they planned to shelve their recently completed feature coyote vs acme for a quick tax writeoff rather than spend money to release it not to be outdone disney studios offers up wish an animated feature that is the kind of artistic misfire that deserves to be hidden away and never spoken about again this is a creation so alternately bewildering and banal that its implausible that at no point during the entire creative process did anyone point out the seemingly obvious fact that virtually none of it works on even the most basic levels wish takes place in the kingdom of rosas which was founded and is currently ruled by magnifico chris pine a seemingly benevolent sorcerer who offers peace and protection for all those who live there the catch is that they must surrender their deepest wish to magnifico who stores them in the lab in his castle in bubbles and once in a great while returns one to the person who made it inexplicably the people of rosas think this is a good deal none more so than asha ariana debose a teenager who is all in on both rosas and magnifico and is hoping that the latter will present her beloved grandfather victor argo with his wish to commemorate his upcoming 100th birthday when asha is summoned to apply for the job of magnificos apprentice everything seems to be falling into place however during her meeting with magnifico she quickly discovers that he would rather hoard the dreams for himself save for the occasional innocuous one and refuses to relinquish any that could threaten either rosas or his reign including the one belonging to ashas grandfather finally recognizing the folly of people sacrificing their greatest wishes asha makes a new wish and to her shock gets a response in the form of star an impish celestial body that has a wide array of magical powers including gifting animals such as ashas pet goat valentino alan tudyk with the power of speech with the aid of star valentino and her friends asha is determined to free the captured wishes and return them to the people who made them at the same time the increasingly paranoid magnifico is determined to capture star and harness its incredible powers for himself in the broad strokes wish sounds like just the kind of grand animated fantasy tale that is synonymous with the disney name however this one feels as if it has been constructed entirely out of ideas scavenged from the studios reject pile for starters the basic premise is so odd especially in how the film essentially glosses over the concept of someone voluntarily giving up their greatest wish that it takes far too long to figure out what exactly is happening if a reasonably intelligent adult finds themself struggling to understand the key story points what are the young members of the target audience going to make of it the characters are also lacking although debose and pine certainly give their all in their vocal performances not even their evident enthusiasm can quite hide the fact that the characters theyre voicing are as blah as can be asha is cheerful spunky and resourceful but completely devoid of any of the details or nuance that might have made her into someone more memorable or interesting magnifico seems a little more promising at first but his shift into evil mode is way too abrupt to be believed and even then he never becomes truly fearsome in the manner of the most memorable disney villains ashas sidekicks star and valentino are cute enough to sell lots of toys this christmas but contribute little besides that the former is just too cutesy while the latter mostly just drops oneliners that land with nearly audible thuds throughout  visually the combination of 2d and 3d animation is superficially attractive but the two approaches never merge into a cohesive whole and once again there is nothing particularly memorable or striking about the design as for the songs by julia michaels and benjamin rice they are uniformly bland and not a single one of them does anything to advance the narrative or our understanding of the characters every single one of them could have been stripped out of the finished film without losing much in the process  perhaps the most disappointing element of wish a film that seems to be comprised entirely of disappointing elements is that this is the project that represents disney studios as they celebrate their 100th anniversary as a result the film is filled with little easter eggs and references to their past animated accomplishments on the one hand these bits are a bit of a welcome diversion you and your friends can challenge each other to see who can find and list the most without worrying about being distracted by anything regarding the story on the other they also serve as an inevitable and perhaps unfortunate reminder of the ambitions and qualities of the films that helped the studio reach that landmark anniversary and how absent they are from this particular entry while adults arent the target audience for wish not even the younger viewers who are its key demographic are going to have that much interest in it either because its bright and colorful and silly they might watch it once but most likely wont return to it as they do with the films many of them disney animated works that they embrace for a film that spends much of its time talking about magic its too bad that wish displays so little of it cordcutting once carried the promise of reducing live tv costs but with most services nearing a 100 per month that statement checks less every day that said there is a handful of cordcutting services with reasonable monthly prices below we list them maybe youve just seen oppenheimer and have the strongest urge to marathonor more fun yet rankall of christopher nolans films or maybe youre one of the few who havent seen interstellar yet if you are then you should change that immediately the dystopian epic is one of nolans best and with that incredible twist in   which netflix country has interstellar for whatever reason the hunger games series isnt available in the same countries around the world youll find the first and second aka the best installments in hong kong for instance but not the third and fourth its a frustrating dilemma especially if you dont even have a single entry in your region which is   which netflix country has each movie of the hunger games
Nov 27 2023,negative, like the mighty empire it is disney has been spending 2023 celebrating its centennial understandably one of the worlds most recognizable brands wants to bask in its longevity but wish is a curious way to carry on the party via the studios animation department animation is where disney truly began its conquest for world domination but this surprisingly bland offering is both small in scale and in boldness its story is pushed aside to make way for easy nods and winks nostalgic traps and unconvincing reminders of why we should all love disney of course lets not be too harsh when it comes to the basics a very young audience member might still be entertained by this movie and its fleeting charms its the adults that have to accompany their children many of whom have vivid memories of disneys glory days who will be left emptyhanded the story drops into the magical kingdom of rosas an island lorded over by king magnifico chris pine its a relatively stable place mostly because magnifico has the ability to collect peoples wishes so the inhabitants of rosas have handed him over all their wishes which he keeps in glass bubbles high above his castle if nobody has any wishes in life they will become passive denizens someday magnifico might decide its time for your wish to be granted enter 17yearold asha ariana debose who is applying to become the benevolent tyrants new apprentice but when she questions his methods asha is quickly kicked out of magnificos presence theres a slight problem for the dictator because asha was raised by her late father to wish upon a star and thus keep your wishes to yourself she makes such a wish and an actual star drops down tinkling and cheery like a living emoji star will help asha change the people of rosas and rise up against magnifico  wish is the first disney animated feature in a long time that truly feels like pure advertising it has an appealing visual style in its design which gives off the look of sketched animation it doesnt go for colors that pop the plot is as subdued as the look directors chris buck and fawn veerasunthorn helmed disneys smash hit frozen yet here dont show off the same kind of deliriously engaging storytelling theres not much to the plot of wish because its so bare and phoned in magnifico has everyones wishes trapped as he struts around animated with great cocky gestures and hair and asha just has to free everyone with the help of star inbetween the key confrontations are a few funny gags most involving star and ashas pet goat valentino alan tudyk the latter is given the ability to talk by star and tudyk gives the animal some hilarious droll moments ashas 100yearold grandfather sabino victor garber tugs at our heart strings because his wish has never been fulfilled which means you know it will by the end credits there is much skillful work present in this movie but it offers nothing new nothing is dared and everything feels manufactured the songs by dave metzger julia michaels and benjamin rice are lively but sound like carbon copies of everything linmanuel miranda ever wrote complete with his knack for rhyming a single word to death a few do work better such as im a star though the glory days of the lion king and frozen are very missed the characters equally feel slapped on with little purpose other than to fill villain and hero roles magnifico is performed with spirited villainy by pine but theres not much to him ariana debose is just as good as asha but her character also functions as nothing more than a walking song and dance number over at pixar theyve been delivering films with rich and entertaining concepts like turning red though disney figures audiences are easier to attract with a simple premise in the form of wish the final standoff with magnifico is shockingly quick and simple over in a flash the movie quickly wraps everything up with an end credits sequence featuring classic disney characters drawn next to all the names and positions so what are we left with star as a creation is undeniably lovable especially when it puts on different hats and other items it finds laying around chris pine is having fun even if hes not really allowed to let loose magnifico is the tamest disney villain in a long time what matters to disney is that the message is delivered that we should keep wishing upon a star while whistling the tune and buying passes to the theme parks but of course theres a reason the company is so successful it knows families will indeed file in with the young ones to have a good time some of this movie is indeed just that but this studio is capable of so much more
Nov 27 2023,positive, wish is a movie that looks like it was made before its makers fully finalized exactly what they intended to do it has a worthwhile metaphoric message strong vocal performances and occasional moments of charm and effective humor however wish is also a bit of a mess in wish we are on the mediterranean island of rosas the sorcerer magnifico voiced by chris pine has founded a kingdom here where he is able to protect his subjects with the magic he has learned rosas is a tranquil happy place where the citizens love their monarch on each rosas residents eighteenth birthday they tell magnifico their wish if magnifico deems the wish worthy and not likely to endanger the status quo he grants it notyeteighteenyearold asha voiced by ariana debose hopes that her grandfather voiced by victor garber will be honored on his hundredth birthday by having his wish granted to this end she gets a job interview to be magnificos assistant things start off well but take a turn when magnifico confides that one he hears a wish he removes it from the wishers mind and keeps hold of ungranted wishes forever asha thinks this sounds extremely unnecessary and unfair even if magnifico cant grant the wish people ought to at least be able to remember what it is that they wanted magnifico somewhat huffily disagrees and asha goes home jobless to her mother voiced by natasha rothwell grandfather and pet goat valentino voiced by alan tudyk remembering gazing up at the night sky with her late father asha wishes upon a star to her astonishment an anthropomorphic little yellow star comes down from the sky a great light washes over rosas delighting the inhabitants  except for magnifico who views this as a threat to his power the plot from the screenplay by jennifer lee  allison moore from the story they crafted with the films directors chris buck  fawn veerasunthorn has the advantage of talking in broad strokes about something real as another reviewer has pointed out wish deals nighdirectly with concepts of intellectual property theft the parallels are clear and given the recentlyconcluded writers guild of america strike could scarcely be timelier but too many details dont fit right has no one else in rosas wished upon a star before asha why does star come down now what exactly can and cant star do likewise character beats feel odd when one character goes through what should be an alarming change it just seems like an amplification of what has come before likewise when a betrayal occurs we know so little about the betrayer that it doesnt register even the plentiful musical numbers seem a little strange debose as demonstrated in her oscarwinning performance in 2021s west side story has a gorgeous voice and uses it to top effect here pine shows that he can do leadingman vocals admirably but the choreography for the musical numbers excepting those involving singing animals is made to resemble theatrical staging its not unreasonable to suppose that productiondistribution company walt disney pictures is hoping for a stage version of wish but surely strictly human dancerstyle moves can wait for that while its not explicitly demanded of the art form animated musicals usually avail themselves of the opportunity to do things that cant be done in live action there are bits of this but fewer than we might expect there are things to like in wish including tudyks slightly pompous baby goat some stunning backgrounds and stars playful good cheer its just not all that we might er well you know the title 
Nov 27 2023,negative,for a film thats meant to sum up a centurys worth of groundbreaking animated feature production  the song when you wish upon a star is even baked into disneys corporate logo  wish plays more like a collection of deleted tracks than greatest hits
Nov 27 2023,positive, enter wish the latest musical fantasy movie from the house of mouse with its special focus on the origin of the famous wish upon a star frozen codirectors and writer chris buck and jennifer lee were brought in for the ultimate disney tribute movie but the end result is sadly something of a mixed bag the wizard king has the ability to grant wishes to each resident of the kingdom of rosas who give him one when they turn 18 once a month magnifico selects a citizens wish to be granted but it turns out he actually erases their memories and never returns the unwanted wishes to his people nevertheless asha ends up getting help from an actual star she wishes on to save the kingdom and defeat the tyrannical villain sadly this storyline and its characters are pretty thin lacking in inspiration and struggled to keep our attention or interest throughout it feels like disney were so focused on a paintbynumbers tribute to their fantasy musical movies that they forgot to sprinkle on the magic despite this there are aspects of wish to be praised and enjoyed the fruit of clearly a lot of hard work by the cg animators and music team firstly the movies animation has received a lot of criticism online but its really missing the point its a cganimated film which takes a leaf from the spiderverse blockbusters by having a 2d traditional look that beautifully pays tribute to the original way these movies were made secondly we laughed a lot there are some great comic moments here especially from alan tudyks talking goat valentino in some really fun set pieces during energetic musical numbers speaking of which where wish really shines is its songs new musicals can take time to cotton on to but julia michaels and benjamin rices songs with dave metzgers score really work well  catchy tracks like this wish and our favourite this is the thanks i get are also all the more aided by debose and pines excellent vocals lastly look out for those blinkandyoullmissit easter eggs linked to classic disney movies near the end giving a nod to all that came before its just a shame that all in all wish doesnt quite live up to the studios legacy
Nov 27 2023,positive, released in the same year that disney celebrated its 100th anniversary this animated adventure pays subtle tribute to the studios storied past while delivering its own watchable brand of magic the kingdom of rosas is ruled by sorcerer king magnifico voiced by chris pine who safeguards peoples wishes and grants them when he chooses asha ariana debose is desperate to be his apprentice but when she realises some wishes will never be granted she makes her own wish upon a star this summons star an adorable energetic yellow being who helps asha and her friends defend rosas against the powerhungry magnifico wishwill mostly appeal to younger audiences although it ticks a lot of boxes for adult disney fans  half the fun is spotting the many references to other stories pine and theatre star debose really shine in their musical numbers with magnificos this is the thanks i get an indignant anthem fit for any disney villain while ashas this wish and im a star are empowering bops however the film is let down by an underdeveloped plot that fails to flesh out magnificos reasons for going on a wishcrushing rampage the film is undoubtedly full of magic hope and nostalgia but it ultimately falls short of classic status
Nov 27 2023,negative,the movie is so busy referencing the classics it makes itself an afterthought
Nov 27 2023,positive, wish owes a solid amount to what came before we see this through the decision to bookend the film with a storybook its 2551 aspect ratio pays homage to sleeping beauty the animation style also offers the best of both worlds as far as disneys animated library is concerned but the watercolor style is a throwback to the earliest feature films animation has come a long way since 1923 in another universe wish would be in 2d but it wouldnt be the samenot with the advances in technology there are homages all over the place including in dave metzgers score paying homage to when you wish upon a star after all this is a studio with a history of making dreams come true speaking of the score the deluxe soundtrack is over two hours in length according to the production notes buck describes star as a ball of energy that embodies hope light optimism creativity and imaginationeverything that walt disney represents to us here at the studio after watching the film in midnovember theres no disagreement from me i know ive been late in getting my review online but i hope the film finds an audience were living in a world where people are trained to wait for films to arrive on disney and thats something of  shame i hope the theatrical run is extended since bob iger is back at the helm but anyway when people dont support such films in theaters studios tend to stop making them sure there were films that were both dayanddate during the pandemic but that was supposed to just be a pandemic thing wish offers fine storytelling and it benefits from a theatrical experience im not sure where i would rank it among the 62 feature films produced by walt disney animation studios danielle solzman is native of louisville ky and holds a ba in public relations from northern kentucky university and a ma in media communications from webster university she roots for her beloved kentucky wildcats st louis cardinals indianapolis colts and boston celtics living less than a mile away from wrigley field in chicago she is an active reader sportsentertainmenthistorybiographiesselect fiction and involved with the chicago improv scene she also sees many movies and reviews them she has previously written for redbird rants wildcat blue nation and hidden remoteflicksided from april 2016 through may 2017 her film reviews can be found on creators
Nov 27 2023,positive, the story in the kingdom of rosas citizens enjoy carefree lives under the benign rule of their magicwielding regent king magnifico voiced by chris pine but teenager asha voiced by ariana debose learns he is not who he claims to be her yearning for a better life for her people draws down star a being made of light and gifted with magical powers  hats off to the walt disney company for being the only studio still making familyfriendly films that ask audiences to do more than look at zany creatures or watch sitcoms with drawn characters instead of live actors  disneys animated musicals are in a class of their own they call on viewers to pay attention to lyrics drink in gorgeous visuals and follow stories built on the aspirations of idealistic young characters  wish ticks all of these boxes as a work of art it is an ambitious attempt at summoning the spirit of the golden age of animation  the period from 1928 to 1969 when disneys snow white and the seven dwarfs 1937 fantasia 1940 and the jungle book 1967 pushed boundaries with every new release while wish has a foot in the past it has the other in the present asha is every bit the gutsy modern protagonist she pines for no man and awaits no rescue and her courage pushes the story along  visually the 2d handdrawn look of the past is digitally evoked without slavish reproduction look at ashas pet goat valentino voiced by alan tudyk and 1977s the many adventures of winnie the pooh will spring to mind  there is a but coming and it is that while wish includes a range of golden age influences it comes after movies that are also inheritors of that legacy  encanto 2021 had songs and magic and not too long before that was frozen ii 2019 the sequel to the phenomenon that was frozen 2013  it would be churlish to criticise disney for making yet another kidoriented musical when wish encanto and the frozen films are of such uniformly high quality  the superhero work spiderman across the spiderverse 2023 the shrek spinoff puss in boots the last wish 2022 and irish independent film wolfwalkers 2020 not only have allages appeal but also show  in thrilling fashion  that one can hark back to tradition while pointing boldly at the future hot take released to mark 100 years of animation from the walt disney company wish would have been special if not for the wealth of highquality animation works that have recently been produced 
Nov 27 2023,negative, this one should have been a knockout in fact all the pieces are in place for a memorable magical fairy tale musical heck theyve even thrown in a talking goat always welcome dancing chickens likewise and a singing grandfather prepare the oscar  alas disneys wish a handsomely budgeted animation designed to commemorate 100 years of the mickey mouse house is empty inside a noisy hodgepodge of drippy oneliners and rickety recycled ideas
Nov 27 2023,neutral,wish is a basic fairy tale that knows its audience and plays to it without guilt
Nov 26 2023,negative, wish tries to put disney back on the map  but in the age of spiderverse is there room for the brands traditional house style if youve seen any of the animated features in disneys sprawling back catalog then youve already seen wish the companys latest is not so much a film as it is a highlight reel of their greatest hits a disney expoturnedeaster egg hunt that rewards even the most casual fan the instinct to catch every reference does give wish some sense of purpose the haze of nostalgia is undoubtedly powerful disney has been weaponizing it for the better half of its centurylong history but its been a long time since the illusion was totally effective and thats a big part of what keeps wish occasionally delightful as it may be from justifying its existence despite a game cast and some earnest popinfused music numbers wish doesnt really have anything new to say that wouldnt be so bad if it existed in a vacuum disneys rested on its laurels before and has bounced back from far worse but were a long way from the novelty that steamboat willie the lion king or even frozen offered the world as the magic kingdom grew into a sprawling empire animation became less of an artistic pursuit and more of an exercise in futility disney still strives to keep up with the times  but in the face of so much innovation elsewhere could something like wish ever be enough for what its worth wish does remix the disney formula where it counts where most of its animated movies are pretty faithful to their respective time periods wish follows disneys liveaction little mermaid down a path of anachronism the kingdom of rosas is our films fairytale setting a melting pot of cultures where people of all creeds live in harmony its protagonist is asha ariana debose an adorkable afrolatina whose freeflowing box braids stand in cheeky defiance of wishs 13thcentury setting what is historical accuracy to a world where animals can talk anyway adding to the offbeat imprecision  albeit behind the scenes  is chris pine as the hispaniccoded king magnifico the sovereign ruler of rosas and sole magicwielder of the realm he founded the kingdom on the premise of safeguarding his peoples wishes literally when each citizen of rosas turns 18 they make a wish and hand it over to the king who stores it in his castle and reserves the right to grant it at a later date as long as its not too dangerous or too vague most wishes are fair game but very few actually meet magnificos requirements  and its not until asha gets close to the sorcerer in an audition to become his wink apprentice that she notices the flaws in this system and starts asking one too many questions about it no she does not get the job like any authoritarian magnifico has a thing about too many questions but that inspires her to make a powerful wish of her own one that sends an impossibly cute anthropomorphic star hurtling from the heavens to help her make rosas a more democratic place with wish disney finds itself at its most selfreflective its always been a company in conversation with itself  the trends tropes and motifs its films once created have become a sort of holy text to be remixed at will  but with other companies in the industry moving on to greener pastures disneys most recent efforts have put it in an echo chamber of its own making there was a time where disneys house style was at least occasionally innovative at the very least it was frequently gorgeous to look at  but as the company distanced itself from handdrawn animation and embraced the convenience of computer graphics homogeny inevitably set in of course by that time disney had long established itself as king of the castle its hard to dissent against the progenitor of so many fond childhood memories and the standard that so many others have followed when spiderman into the spiderverse burst onto the scene however that spell was irrevocably broken  and disney is still trying to catch up in the five years since spiderverse made imperfect painterly visuals cool a quiet revolution has taken hold in the industry its no longer enough to coast on a polished familiar technique and for what its worth disney seems to recognize that wish runs on an interesting blend of old and new computergenerated characters play in a 2d watercolor world it adds a literal bent to the storybook motif that opens the film cribbed from classic disney flicks like sleeping beauty and cinderella but its not quite enough to tip wish into new territory wish is of course meant to serve as an homage  but at every turn it conflates that responsibility with rote imitation so many of its characters feel like regurgitations of past favorites disney face has been an issue as far back as tangled and it rears its head again here too its ideas are occasionally intriguing especially when its willing to confront the part that fear and failure play in our daily lives but too quickly does it slip into a more traditional and trite battle of good against evil or worse a winking reference to a far superior disney film by the time wish reaches its fantasmicinspired showdown its hard to wonder if it would have functioned better as fan fiction than a celebration of a billiondollar enterprise this experiment is not without its merits and hopefully its a sign that disney is finally willing to take a harder look in the magic mirror as great as its past triumphs have been no amount of nostalgia can stand up to the excitement of something new its time for the company to let go of its own fear  only then can it reclaim the innovation that once made it such a juggernaut in the first place
Nov 26 2023,negative, disney celebrates its centenary with a grimly cynical marketing exercise wrapped in the sparkly cloak of an escapist animated fairytale chris bucks film unfolds in a utopian kingdom ruled by a sorcerer monarch named magnifico chris pine understanding that hopes and dreams are a potential source of discontent in his populace magnifico confiscates the dearest wishes of his people and keeps them safe very occasionally deigning to grant one teenager asha ariana debose realises that stripping the people of their cherished aspirations is not a sound basis for a happy society she makes her own wish  upon a star no less  for a fundamental change in the kingdom it soon becomes clear that having cannibalised its back catalogue for liveaction remakes disney has finally got around to making a movie out of its own ident the animated logo that plays before each disney production there are nods in the score to when you wish upon a star the classic song written for pinocchio now as closely associated with disney as mouse ears but mostly the soundtrack is an unhummable mess of warbled exposition
Nov 26 2023,positive, what does that tell you that they  just as i did  appreciated the themes of celebrating 100 years of disney and to hold on to your wishes  they might just come true at the beginning of disney films youll hear a snippet of when you wish upon a star which was featured in the 1940 pinocchio it became the first disney song to win an oscar youll hear all about wishes and stars again in this story set in the land of rosas where king magnifico chris pine a sorcerer takes each residents wish and keeps it in storage asha ariana debose applies to be an apprentice to the king who thinks hes doing his subjects a favor by removing what they long for because they forget their dreams as soon as they share them with their ruler asha has seen the wishes that the king has stored away and she wants to return them to the people an adorable little wishing star comes down from the heavens to give her some help the songs are remarkable with this is the thanks i get among the showstoppers valentino alan tudyk ashas cute goat sidekick always is on hand with comic relief when things get intense the plot serves as a way to string together references to earlier disney movies from bambi whose title character makes a brief appearance to strange world with some of them  constellationlike  sprinkled through the credits its not as memorable or as deep as some of the disney tales that came before it but its fun and with its brief running time might leave you wishing for more  to have a successful garden you need to know when it is the best time to plant here are the best plants to start in may
Nov 25 2023,neutral, synopsis asha a sharpwitted idealist makes a wish so powerful that it is answered by a cosmic force  a little ball of boundless energy called star together asha and star confront a most formidable foe  the ruler of rosas king magnifico  to save her community and prove that when the will of one courageous human connects with the magic of the stars wondrous things can happen
Nov 25 2023,negative,a lifeless focusgrouped attempt at throwing back to the classics
Nov 25 2023,positive, it becomes clear during the animated musical wish that although its a new story its also an attempt to collect elements of more than a dozen classic disney movies in one place wishing on stars evil monarchs adorable woodland creatures that talk mystical books mirror mirror on the wall and even a deer named bambi the effect which marks the companys 100th anniversary is a cinematic version of one of those dj earworm songs that mash up a years worth of bangers into one song ariana debose supplies the voice of asha a teenager in a land ruled by king magnifico chris pine who is known for his ability to grant wishes early in the film asha realizes the king actually uses that power to keep people docile and that in fact he maintains power by stealing his subjects wishes so she and a plucky band of friends resolve to reveal his evil plans and give people back their wishes as callbacks to previous disney movies such as snow white and pinocchio pile up wish sometimes feels more like fan service than an original movie in that same vein the adorable nonverbal creature known as star could not be a more obvious attempt to generate a minionslike merch cash cow from wish its even yellow what distinguishes the movie is its look which combines elements of painterly disney classics with the computergenerated visual style of more recent hits such as frozen and its sound the songs mostly sung by lively west side story oscar winner debose have energy and style a couple are in the talksing vein of satisfied from hamilton a crummy tune can stop an animated movie dead but the wish numbers give the movie a huge lift while also carrying forward the narrative momentum you can probably guess how things turn out in wish one thing about assembling a new movie from parts of old ones is that its going to have a hard time surprising us but that worked  for me at least  because nostalgia is the point of the movie itll be interesting to see what if anything happens in the future of this possible dcu will we get a movie with tinkerbell asha and jiminy cricket joining forces to grant wishes to lucky strangers will hercules tramp peter pan and the beast form a boy band i am intrigued enough to find out
Nov 25 2023,neutral, disney turns 100 this year for its centennial the studio gifted itself with wish a film that makes so many references  veiled and blatant  to the disney brand that it descends into utter shamelessness this fairy tale feels more like a corporate product than a magical event its a limp dissertation on disneys motto that when you wish upon a star your dreams come true did some higherup demand a movie based on that lyric from jiminy crickets classic pinocchio song screenwriters jennifer lee and allison moore took the most convoluted confusing path to get there playing the instrumental version of the song over the disney logo for the past few decades apparently wasnt enough to hammer the sentiment home wish opens with one of those fancy storybooks the kind that memorably appeared in films during disneys heydey which in my opinion is bookended by 1937s snow white and the seven dwarfs and 1967s the jungle book immediately this image conjures up gorgeous handdrawn masterpieces like 1959s sleeping beauty this oldschool throwback soon gives way to the more recent look of disney films like 2013s frozen were introduced to the city of rosas a place ruled by a benevolent magical hunk named magnifico chris pine its not only home to the 17year old protagonist asha ariana debose its also a tourist attraction if youre lucky youll be there on the one day a year magnifico grants a wish from one of rosass denizens though he has magical powers magnifico is no genie people in rosas give him their fondest wish which he yanks out of their chest because as cinderella once sang a dream is a wish your heart makes for safe keeping magnifico keeps these wishes in floating blue bubbles within his palace its from here he selects the one wish to be granted asha hopes that this year her grandfather sabino victor garber will be chosen to have his wish granted sabino has just turned 100 years old like disney itself asha applies for magnificos sorcerers apprentice job in order to influence his decision things dont go as planned but before i get to that i must tell you what plot detail caused me to write wait what the hell in my notebook when magnifico removes peoples wish bubbles they forget they ever made a wish the rationale is that without a wish those people feel much better about their lives so theres an entire city clamoring for decades to have a wish granted that they dont even recall it makes no sense we never even discover the details of sabinos wish  we only see him playing guitar while surrounded by adoring fans is he wishing to be taylor swift anyway it doesnt matter magnificos niceguy act is fake hes really evil and he has no intention of granting most of those wishes he just likes having control over everyone he even has a big scary book locked away under glass one that contains all sorts of badmagic spells when asha confronts him about his devious plans she earns a powerful enemy after several disney films without an actual villain we finally get an outandout baddie dont believe me well who was the villain in frozen or 2021s encanto see magnifico looks like a walking thirst trap and pine plays him with gusto he even gets to sing his own villain song and though he acquits himself nicely he doesnt have the impressive vocal talent that debose does that doesnt matter either because the forgettable songs by julia michaels and benjamin rice sound like linmanuel miranda ripoffs say what you want about miranda and the wordplay that drives his critics batty but the man knows how to craft a song for and about characters we dont talk about magnifico after hearing these numbers since everything in wish has to be literal theres also the embodiment of that star jiminy told you to wish on it looks like the star from super mario bros and the yellow teletubby had a baby of course its named star and asha wishes upon it causing it to fall from the sky and wreak all sorts of cutesy havoc such as making all the animals in rosas talk that development gives asha the standardissue talking sidekick a goat named valentino alan tudyk despite some funny voice work by tudyk valentino is forgettable ashas excellent character design is more memorable than the character itself though thats the screenplays fault as in her oscarwinning turn in west side story debose does her best and sings her heart out to keep myself engaged i pondered this films intent and its meaning is magnifico a standin for the disney corporation i mean hes got his own vault filled with items he threatens to keep hidden forever is the city of rosas disney world why does everyone only have one wish and when will disney once again be daring enough to kill off its villains the way it disposed of ursula maleficent and other evildoers though the visuals are often quite stunning youll wish that wish had a better story not even magnifico is powerful enough to make you forget

Nov 25 2023,positive,wish has a very ambitious premise its too bad that everything else about it is bland and generic
Nov 25 2023,neutral, i grew up watching disney animated movies so i have a special fondness for them which have mostly been turned into liveaction versions with varying degrees of success my faves are still the classics i saw as a kid ie bambi cinderella sleeping beauty etc wish is the 62nd disney animated feature and was created as part of its centennial celebration october 16 was walt disney companys 100th anniversary its no surprise that disney turned to chris buck and jennifer lee the duo behind the behemoth of frozen which grossed 13 billion buck serves as a codirector along with fawn veerasunthorn while lee cowrote the script with allison moore the story centers on a 17yearold girl named asha ariana debose who lives in the mediterranean island kingdom of rosas ruled by king magnifico chris pine perfectly cast as a handsome royal whose people actually thirst for and his wife queen amaya angelique cabral the movie pays homage to classic disney animated movies right from the start starting with the epilogue once upon a time complete with its antique storybook intro ashas story is decidedly more progressive in that she is no longer pining for a prince or any man for that matter for her happiness in fact she absolutely adores her family especially her grandfather sabino victor garber whose 100th birthday natch coincides with the day of her apprentice job interview with king magnifico the story hinges on the relationship between asha and magnifico no not in that way as asha initially looks up to her king and shares a mission to protect the wishes of the people of rosas that is until she finds out that magnifico doesnt really have the peoples best interest after all he refuses to grant ashas grandfathers wish which he deems dangerous because it has the potential to inspire others who in turn might turn against him aisha is doubly disappointed when she soon finds out about the kings true colors i suppose it shouldnt be a surprise when a king named magnifico turns out to be a deeply narcissistic and powerhungry man who uses the peoples own wishes as a way to oppress them asha later makes a wish upon a star and suddenly voila she ends up with a powerful ally in the form of a cosmic ball of light that drops from the sky i love the visuals which combine 3d computer technology with the look of disneys traditional handdrawn animation the forest looks a lot like the one in sleeping beauty while the kingdom of rosas is made out of a diverse population that reflects various cultures asha herself has a darker skin tone and black braided hair while her bestie dahlia jennifer kumiyama is of east asian descent kids would likely adore the anthropomorphic look and expressive face of the star its so playfully energetic that it leaves a trail of pixie dust everywhere it goes the stars magical power transforms the tranquil forest as the plants and animals come alive ashas hilariously talkative pet goat valentino alan tudyk becomes an instant scene stealer while the movie seems to have the makings for a perfect centennial celebration wish is well lacking that inherent disney magic if you will the story aims for greatness and the power of self but is chock full of clichés and tropes that dont really inspire ones imagination given the reaction of the children in the audience the movie can clearly still capture their attention but for the rest of us we can see right through disneys selfcongratulatory production and all the blatant tribute to self i have to admit its quite fun to spot the easter eggs throughout the movie a wishing well in the forest a deer named bambi auroras dress etc ashas look seems to be inspired by pocahontas and obviously magnificos style and mercurial temperament are modeled after maleficent who can be charming one minute and terrifying the next at the same time having 100 references to its past work doesnt exactly translate to a good movie ironically considering that one of the strengths of disney classics is the music and songs wish is sorely lacking in that department i realize i shouldnt complain about the plethora of musical numbers given that its billed as a musical fantasy but i wish the songs were at least catchy no offense to julia michaels and benjamin rice who wrote the lyrics and dave metzger who composed the music but listening to wishs bland songs makes me dearly miss alan menken and howard ashman its really a bummer given both debose and pine have such amazing voices but the melody of the songs just isnt memorable even its anthem this wish is meh i think the only ones i enjoyed are pines defiant rendition of this is the thanks i get and the rousing battle cry knowing what i know now with the fun drum beats but i cant for the life of me remember any of the songs even an hour after the movie is over while the creators had a neat idea about how were shaped by the dreams we hold dearest in our hearts overall the movie doesnt really tug at my heartstrings i wish this were a more enchanting movie but no amount of fairy dust on the screen could magically turn a mediocre movie into a magnificent one i think ill wait for this on disney as this has been a pretty bad month for disney with this and the marvels which i really liked not meeting expectations yeah perhaps people just want something more original thats better executed wish seems like an original idea because its not a sequelremake but it felt like a manufactured product engineered to celebrate its own past achievements film is in my blood love movies of all genres from jane austen to james bond official blogger for the twin cities film fest tcff ive written and produced my first short film  hearts want in 2017 and currently working on developing the full story as a feature film
Nov 25 2023,negative, thanksgiving week tends to be a busy one for movie theaters many families have a tradition of going to see a movie during the holiday but is there anything worth seeing heres arts and culture editor collin garbarino collin garbarino apple studios has been burning the tech companys cash in its pursuit of accolades and awards earlier this year it spent hundreds of millions of dollars on martin scorseses historical prestige movie killers of the flower moona movie which was never destined to make back its budget this week another of apples ridiculously expensive historical films from a storied director arrived in theaters ridley scotts napoleon as you might expect napoleon tells the story of napoleon bonaparte one of the worlds most famous military leaders you also might expect a certain amount of stylishness from ridley scott and his lead actors joaquin phoenix and vannessa kirby who play napoleon and his wife josephine what you might not expect is how utterly stupid the movie is this is the kind of movie history buffs get excited for but director ridley scott has a pretty spotty track record when it comes to the genre his kingdom of heaven and robin hood are two of my least favorite movies of all time if you love history like i do then youll hate napoleon first joaquin phoenix is miscast hes too old the movie begins with the 49yearold actor playing a 24yearold napoleon at the beginning of his career to make matters worse in real life napoleons wife josephine was six years older than him but vannessa kirby who actually makes a nice josephine is 14 years younger than phoenixand she definitely looks it the average moviegoer will probably find the battle scenes mildly entertaining but ridley scott doesnt attempt to be historically accurate he has napoleon charging out at the head of the army on impact cannonballs inexplicably set a mast of a ship on fire the battle scenes are pure fantasy the keeneyed fan of military history will be appalled to see british squares forming up and firing directly at each other its all very stylish but its all a lot of rubbish ridley scott isnt the filmmaker you go to for nuance but nuance is just whats needed when talking about napoleon he was complicated and historians still argue over whether he was an enlightened military genius or merely a brutal tyrant this movie views everything in napoleons life through the single lens of his relationship with josephine he isnt brilliant proud and ambitious hes lovesick jealous and frustratedand actually kind of dumb  i also left napoleon feeling like scott was taking a swipe at masculinity itself attempting to rob one of historys most consequential men of any distinction wish is disneys newest animated feature the young heroine of wish is asha voiced by ariana debose she lives on the island nation of rosas which is ruled by a benevolent sorcerer named magnifico voiced by chris pine asha hopes to become the sorcerers apprentice but shes horrified when she learns magnifico is nefarious rather than benevolent stealing the wishes of his subjects  wish takes its inspiration from the idea of wishing on a star which became a central theme in disneys marketing and to be honest wish feels less like a movie and more like a marketing campaign to celebrate disneys 100 years of animation the movie follows the classic formula we get a talking animal sidekick and six original songs and the movie is also chock full of references and visual imagery derived from earlier disney movies for example asha has seven loyal friends who mimic snow whites seven dwarfs  sadly the homage to disneys better years feels wasted because this film is so disappointing the storyline what little of it there is seems to be an afterthoughta mere framework to stuff in all the references and the songs are mere echoes of the catchy tunes from disneys best musicals one particular song sounds downright blasphemous as the characters sing about how were all made out of cosmic stardust and we are our own origin story so were all our own wishing stars and were obligated to never give up on our wishes which the movie says is the most special part of our hearts disneys really dialed up the devilish follow your heart theme to the nth degree with this one so it turns out theres not much to be thankful for this week at the movies but if youre looking for a recent historical movie this weekend you could cue up jesus revolution on netflix or if you want a familypleasing animated movie you could try the super mario bros movie on peacock world radio transcripts are created on a rush deadline this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future accuracy and availability may vary the authoritative record of world radio programming is the audio record
Nov 25 2023,negative, a dream is a wish your heart makes cinderella sings peter pan wishes to never grow up pinocchio wishes to be a real boy ariel wishes to walk above water for the past 100 years disney has invited its audiences to dream alongside the characters in its films wishing on stars and making dreams come true have been synonymous with disney and embodying that signature theme is wish directed by chris buck and fawn veerasunthorn and written by jennifer lee and allison moore the film is a love letter to classic disney and an ode to the wishing star that has played a prominent role in its history since cliff edwards as jiminy cricket sang when you wish upon a star the song has become a part of the studios identity playing over its logo since the 1980s its only fitting that for its centennial we are presented with the origins of the very star that characters like geppetto and tiana once turned to with their hearts desires wish opens like a tale as old as time with the flipping of a storybook the films lore and backstory are established in a classic and welcomed way this latest fairytale recalls that of a powerful sorcerer who created a kingdom of protection in exchange for the wishes of his people the kingdom of rosas is like any classic disney setting medieval in design with a castle looming overhead once a month the sorcerer and selfcrowned king magnifico chris pine grants a wish to one lucky resident the people of rosas live waiting for their wishes to come true and for some like 100yearold sabino victor garber their time is running out however sabinos granddaughter asha ariana debose hopes acing her interview to become the kings apprentice will mean her familys wishes will finally be granted king magnifico has created his kingdom seemingly to protect his people from the dangers of the outside world his desire to create a haven without pain speaks to ashas caring nature making her feel like the perfect candidate to be his apprentice magnifico keeping everyones wishes safe sparks hope in rosas a future of beautiful possibly however asha learns that he has no intention of granting everyones wishes only those that would benefit him most as a result she does something no one thought possible she wishes upon a star so i make this wish  to have something more for us than this debose sings with powerful emotion the star however doesnt just continue to shine above it comes down shaking the kingdoms foundation in the process taking shape as its own character star aides asha on her quest to return the wishes to the people of rosas so they too can feel the magic of a wish granted  the biggest question one could pose when speaking of wish is does it live up to the expectations of what one would think a film paying homage to disney should be like its a yes and no answer its definitely the most disney movie ever meaning that it has everything you would expect talking animals a good guy turned villain the theme of loss a great main tune and a storybook ending its also littered with easter eggs that harken back to various characters and films in disneys catalog but theyre added in organically so the film doesnt become just constant callouts  it has a perfect voice cast with debose contributing a very classic feel but also signaling the modern evolution of the disney heroine asha has adorable sidekicks in star and her goat valentino who bring most of the films humor in the formers fun pantomime and the latters terrific voice performance by alan tudyk pine is delightfully nefarious as magnifico whose style and vanity mirror the disney villains of old the animation style is especially memorable as it paints this story in a combination of traditional watercolor and computer animation illustrating the evolution of disneys animation with every frame what classic disney movies need to have above all are good songs wish is a pretty mixed bag on that front the films main tune this wish is excellent it fits the films message perfectly and elicits very uplighting emotion thanks to deboses stunning voice and while pine is entertaining in his role as magnifico his solo this is the thanks i get is terrible the rest of the songs arent very memorable luckily the musical numbers are energetic with some using influences from other songs like colors of the wind in his score dave metzger incorporates notes from when you wish upon a star sparking at least a little bit of that old disney magic  wish reminds its audience what makes classic disney so special  and that it cant be replicated and this is where the films pixie dust loses its shimmer by being a love letter to the studios past the film uses a tried and true formula that at this point is trite the why is obvious of course but by hanging on to so many influences wish struggles to find its own identity disney has yet to find the spark that will pull it out of the cycle of trying and failing to replicate what it once had when wish ends and the credits roll you cant help but reflect on once upon a dream when the disney magic was still there
Nov 25 2023,positive, synopsis wish will follow a young girl named asha who wishes on a star and gets a more direct answer than she bargained for when a troublemaking star comes down from the sky to join her wish the new walt disney animation studios picture is a warm and winning animated film that acts as an origin story for the studios legendary filmography while incorporating classic disney themes and clever nostalgia chris buck frozen i and ii and fawn veerasunthorn raya and the last dragon put a fresh spin on classic disney themes albeit with a wink at recycled material the story follows young asha oscarwinner ariana debose a precocious 17yearold wise beyond her years asha is celebrating her sabinos victor garber 100th birthday as is her mother sakina natasha rothwell shes young energetic and beloved by her community of rosas the young woman represents all the hopes and dreams of their family because simply they have none of their own thats because a sorcerer king magnifico chris pine manages everyones wishes and is in charge of whose very dreams come true luckily for asha she is interviewing for a job as his assistant they immediately hit it off having a natural rapport however asha sees sabinos wish floating in the royal palace she cant help but ask the king if he could grant her grandfathers wish on his special day however magnifico declines his explanation granting such a wish may be too much for the old man to handle and disrupt the peaceful balance of the community as magnifico says imagine a place where wishes come true where your hearts desire can become a reality what if i told you that place was within reach all you have to do is give your wish to me it dawns on asha that the ruler has no intention of giving back the wishes to rosas effectively never allowing peoples hopes to shape their futures buck and veerasunthorns film with the help of a clever screenplay from frozen collaborator jennifer lee and allison moore night sky takes off when it begins to act as an origin story for the greedy mouses legendary filmography for example after asha is dismayed by the kings action she yes wishes upon a star causing a cosmic event seen throughout the kingdom the result is an adorable ball of energy called star that magically comes to life shaking the lives of the rosas community star begins to bring objects to life and allows animals to talk like ashas beloved goat valentino voiced by the scenestealing alan tudyk the animation will be much talked about with the filmmakers using digital techniques to give wish a look of handdrawn images or storybook drawings to evoke appreciation from diehard disney fans however while the effort is appreciated the visuals of wish have a saturday morning cartoon look thats almost jarring initially until the artistry becomes whimsical in an era of animated choices in the last few years where studios mix and match styles and take bold chances disney has pandered and played it too safe here however what wish does have are some dazzling musical numbers my favorite is chris pines thoroughly enjoyable this is the thanks i get which is pure disney magic and of course the gifted deboses showstopping this wish will surely bring goosebumps to diehards and casual fans alike a wish worth making is a worthy closing number for any disney animated featurewish isnt a classic by any means but it has a chance to develop a worthy following for one films with lasting legs are always defined by younger generations and disney fans will love the nods and origins of the timeless classics which will bring generations together along with what im sure will be a massive sale of plush toy stars in the future wish is a wonderful holiday treat for the entire family
Nov 24 2023,negative, wish is set in a magical island kingdom somewhere in the mediterranean ruled by a magical king named magnifico chris pine everyone who comes to live on the island surrenders their greatest wish to him for safekeeping and a few times a year he even grants random people their greatest desires the chance to have their wish granted only attracts more people to the island from all over asha ariana debose is a 17yearold girl who seeks to become the kings apprentice in wish magic everything seems to be going great until she realizes   hes not exactly a good guy holding the wishes of everyone hostage in order to solidify his rule over the kingdom desperate to free everyones wishes asha makes a wish upon a star in the night sky and a literal star flies down to the island armed with powerful magic in order to help her quest together with star and her talking goat valentino alan tudyk asha hatches a plan to return everyones wishes as king magnifico turns to forbidden sorcery to stop her all of that sounds like a promising story but wish is actually more interested in spending 95 minutes reminding viewers of disneys greatest hits in just half an hour audiences are peppered with so many callbacks to better disney films that theyll be rolling their eyes feeling assaulted by the intended nostalgia the house of mouse absolutely wastes pine shackling his charisma and any potential silliness to bland writing the film sentences him to a backstory with more holes than swiss cheese and the gaps in logic dont end with him wish is filled with forgettable songs and unremarkable lyrics that want to seem much grander than they actually are its story is tired audiences are exhausted by magical kingdoms and the cliches that have made disney great over the last century and the one thing disney should excel at the art is such a misfire throughout this picture flat backgrounds intended to look like a storybook do not blend well with the 3d characters dancing around singing trees in the forest look halffinished and the characters themselves often seem more like they belong in a kingdom hearts game rather than a centennial celebration from disney so when wish fails to inspire audiences with its music its animation and its story whats left to appreciate the dozens of callbacks to hit movies that serve as bludgeoning reminders of the past rather than cheeky easter eggs perhaps the film wouldnt suffer so much if it had instead been relegated to an animated short on disney expectations would be lower and the writing could be forgiven for so many holes and unanswered questions wish feels thin sort of stretched like butter scraped over too much bread any number of improvements could have made this a better movie setting pine free to be a massively silly villain who hams up the screen fleshing out the hero and giving her some semblance of a backstory or even committing to the studios past by returning to traditional 2d animation for a change
Nov 24 2023,neutral, wish feels like disney didnt start with wanting to tell a story about wishing on a star it feels like they started wondering how they could organically cram as many legacy nods to previous films wish is a beautifully animated homage to classic disney but the film in front of us is weighed down with the baggage that all of the modern disney movies seem to have director chris buck and fawn veerasunthorn summary wish will follow a young girl named asha who wishes on a star and gets a more direct answer than she bargained for when a troublemaking star comes down from the sky to join her from the moment that disney announced wish on stage at the d23 expo it was met with a resounding huh the problem was disneys elevator pitch for me this movie was confusing and the more they tried to lean into that idea the more confusing it got the more time went on the more that this seemed like a lightyear situation could be right around the corner where audiences might decide to skip the film because they dont understand what it is and disney pulled back on the legacy aspect of the marketing at its core the story of wish is pretty conventional and also very classic disney the studio wont stop trying to pat itself on the back for its own anniversary and this movie is part of that however as the marketing on this film progressed you were left wondering how much that was part of the actual story it turns out that the disney legacy component of the film was more than we needed and while it was sometimes distracting it wasnt a dealbreaker when looking at the idea of wish it seemed like disney went into this with the idea of how many subtle nods to previous movies they could sneak into the film first as a yay were 100 thing and then built the story around it thats the thing about wishes they can be as magical as we need them to be so referencing wishes related to disney movies can be about as subtle as a 24 to the face there is an entire musical number in the woods where star makes all of the animals talk and it seems to exist solely because disney wanted to try and get as many disney animal cameos hidden in there as possible this wouldnt feel so transparent if disney wasnt selling this film as the bookend for the first 100 years that the studio has been open the problem with so many of the modern disney movies is that they often feel like they are one long victory lap for being disney and we should be giving them extra kudos simply for being disney in the case of wish we nearly got the disney animation version of im here to talk to you about the avengers initiative with how many times they were winking at the camera at some point youre not winking anymore youre just blinking normally and its clear that this is the norm for modern disney and thats the baggage so many of these films are forced to carry the various cameos in wish might be distracting and sometimes take away from the film itself but the core story is pretty basic which is in no way a bad thing king magnifico is a nice return to form with disney villains who really dont have a kind bone in his body and even the kind things he did were done out of selfpreservation his songs are the most fun and people will likely come out of this film surprised that chris pine can sing so well unless they were one of the three people who watched into the woods disney will have a hard time trying to put asha in the princess line because she is very much not a princess in any capacity and it is nice to see a disney movie with a female lead who doesnt have any royal heritage again ariana debose has a killer voice and while none of the songs in wish are bad they probably dont have a let it go or a we dont talk about bruno in here either in contrast to many major films of 2023 wish could have used some more time to marinate and expand the whole film felt a bit rushed and while it might seem on brand to keep things around the 90minute mark it made large segments of the film feel like they didnt have any time to breathe asha has a whole group of friends with their own stories and personality traits but there is no time to expand on them this film could have tacked on some extra time to be an hour and fortyfive minutes and it would have been fine it also would have given us some more time with the animation it doesnt always work and there are moments that it looks a bit wonky but well take a bit wonky when you take an artistic chance than doing the same computergenerated stuff that weve seen since the early 2000s wish is not bad not by a long shot and there is plenty to like there star is adorable the design is the kind of ingenious work that is the hallmark of a good animator because it is distinct and easy for a kid to replicate in their own coloring book that is how you create character magic and they could easily sell a billion plushes of that thing if this movie hits and while longtime fans will enjoy looking for all the references you cant build an entire film around that you need more and it feels like disney didnt start with wanting to tell a story about wishing on a star it feels like they started with wondering how they could organically cram this many legacy nods to previous films all of the whimsey in the world cant make up for that cynical feeling
Nov 24 2023,positive,wish may not be the grand spectacle for the studios 100th anniversary but it is still an enjoyable and enchanting feature that serves as a throwback to their classic era

Nov 24 2023,positive, wish with the voices of ariana debose chris pine alan tudyk angelique cabral victor garber written by jennifer lee  allison moore directed by chris buck fawn veerasunthorn rated pg for thematic elements and mild action 92 min in theaters walt disney studios is celebrating its 100th anniversary but it hasnt had a lot to celebrate of late the liveaction versions of their animated classics  some of which were quite good  are becoming increasingly unwatchable and pixars recent offerings failed to scale the heights thus it is with great relief that wish turns out to be the groundbreaking film for which they might have well wished the story sets up the fairytale kingdom of rosas it is presided over by the benevolent king magnifico voice of chris pine who learned sorcery in order to create a safe haven from the cruelties of the world when his subjects reach adulthood they give him their greatest wish which has two effects first they forget what their wish was and second they hope that someday magnifico will use his powers to grant them that wish asha ariana debose is being considered to become magnificos latest apprentice but blows the opportunity when she asks that her grandfather sabino victor garber be granted his wish on his 100th birthday magnifico refuses and rejects asha showing signs that his actions may be more selfserving than anyone suspects when asha then wishes upon a star the embodiment of that star arrives creating magical havoc giving voice to plants and animals including ashas pet goat valentino alan tudyk asha decides to release the wishes  which float in bubbles in magnificos secret lair  back to the people who made them putting her on a collision course with the king this fantasy becomes not only a lesson in how power corrupts but in the importance of wishes read personal hopes to people by giving up those wishes to magnifico and leaving them in his control the people of rosas may be safe but are living less than their full lives magnifico who created rosas in response to his own familys tragic history becomes the illustration of how the road to hell is paved with good intentions thats pretty heavy stuff for a disney cartoon and yet it plays out beautifully wish is also a musical and some numbers work better than others but it will take some time to see if there are any breakout hits like let it go from frozen or we dont talk about bruno from encanto the key disney song of course is when you wish upon a star from pinocchio which plays as part of the disney logo at the beginning but also following the closing credits also during the closing credits we get images from many of the disney animated features from the past a celebration like the lovely short once upon a studio featuring all these characters and currently running on disney daniel m kimmel is a veteran movie critic and author of a host of filmrelated books his latest book is a film criticism parody can your heart stand the shocking facts exploring plan 9 from outer space he is the 2018 recipient of the skylark award given by the new england science fiction association he lives in somerville massachusetts
Nov 24 2023,positive, if we were in fullon scrooge mood we might argue that the film pitched to celebrate 100 years of disney animation is a worthy successor to the likes of chicken little and the rescuers down under that wouldnt be quite fair wish is a perfectly serviceable effusion of the postfrozen protoprincess accommodation ariana debose is in typically fine timbre as the voice of a young woman struggling to shake off fairytale tyranny you already know that she has a moment perched on an elevated area opening her tonsils triumphantly to the sky why complain about that repeated trope when julia michaels and benjamin rices songs crackle with such irresistible choruses at all costs gives debose a seesawing duet with chris pine the percussive knowing what i know now would if such an unlikely thing came to pass stop any broadway translation on a nightly basis and its got a cute talking goat and a sentient grounded star that in its simplicity looks to be gesturing to friendly rivals in studio ghibli whats not to like well for all the references to goldenera disney wish struggles with similar issues to much recent mouse house animation as in elemental the films apparent allegory fails to land a storybook opening introduces us to king magnifico pine a magician who constructs a city that welcomes all those who want to fulfil a personal dream is this about the united states is wish the godfather well maybe but it gets more complicated magnifico captures every dream in a bubble thus if i have this right causing the wisher to disconnect from his wish only the few who at a special ceremony have their dreams magically satisfied again make contact with those aspirations i have no idea what this is supposed to be teaching us about the human condition initially magnifico is more of an unsympathetic technocrat than a proper disney villain more herbert hoover than richard nixon but when deboses asha pushes back the familiar green shadows cast themselves across his witchy brow she wishes upon a star get it and brings just such pointed plasma to earth and were off the film will do well enough but its backwards glances serve only to remind us how transcendent disney animation once was  as recently as frozen  without offering any hopeful signposts to the future but yes cracking songs
Nov 24 2023,positive, in wish a new musicalcomedy featuring the voices of chris pine and ariana debose disney celebrates 100 years of animated entertainment with a fairy tale featuring easter eggs referencing their classic films theres a deer named bambi snippets of the pinocchio theme when you wish upon a star a magic mirror and many other tributes wish takes place on the island kingdom of rosas a magical place where king magnifico chris pine stores the wishes from people all over the world imagine a place where wishes come true says magnifico where your hearts desire can become a reality what if i told you that place is within reach all you have to do is give your wish to me at the age of 18 everyone in rosas gives the king their deepest desire which he then seals up in his castles observatory i grant the wishes i am sure are good for rosas he says once a month he announces a winner and grants their dreams come true when 17yearold asha oscar winner ariana debose meets the king to apply for a job as his assistant she hopes to convince him to grant her 100yearold grandfather sabinos victor garber wish when the king refuses asha uncovers a terrible secret magnifico not only deletes the memories of those who tell him their wants he hoards the wishes to keep the citizens of rosas compliant king magnifico has wishes in his castle asha says hell never give them back we have to free the wishes and return them to the people as they join forces to stop magnifico the king manifest all his dark magic powers to stop them there is a traitor amongst us he bellows find asha wish has all the elements of classic disney but falls just short of memorable the builtin nostalgia should appeal to fans as a centurial celebration and aficionados will get a kick out of spotting the hidden tributes to the older movies but the film is stuck in looking in the rearview mirror it feels old fashioned a celebration of what came before from its look to its storytelling as pleasant as it is theres not much new happening here in its themes of the magic of dreams and power of good to defeat evil character wise its standard stuff although valentino alan tudyk a talking goat with a surprisingly deep voice earns laughs as he announces i cannot swim like greek herald stentor as he dives into the water best of all is the star a simple character with very expressive face which is virtually guaranteed to move a bunch of plush toys as christmas approaches as a celebration of 100 years of animation wish isnt awful just underwhelming it feels like a blast from the past with both eyes on the past and none on the future richard crouse shares a toast with celebrity guests and entertainment pundits every week on ctvs exciting talk show pop lifesaturdays at 830 on ctv newschannel midnight on ctv
Nov 24 2023,neutral, as a short film that aired before a more thoughtful feature it wouldve worked but as a standalone story  even a short one at just 95 minutes  its transparently thin 
Nov 24 2023,positive, unfulfilled potential is a powerful theme for a story making disneys choice to explore what might happen if an entire kingdom of subjects surrendered their chance to fulfil their destinies by entrusting their deepest wish  and every memory of it  to their king an intriguing premise is it better to live with the hope that one day your wish may come true or to hold that dream close to your heart and let it guide your lifes path well never know because sadly the house of mouses hundredthanniversary offering fails to interrogate its own themes choosing to bimble about looking pretty it is very pretty ticking off generic highs and lows in the place of real plot points and making knowing nods to animated features past instead leaving us to gloomily ponder what might have been asha ariana debose is a tour guide in her beloved mediterranean home rosas the starry eyed 17 year old loves her family her loyal group of friends and the beauty that surrounds her big of heart and overflowing with imagination she cant think of anything more wonderful to mark her grandfathers victor garber 100th birthday than witnessing his longsurrendered wish finally coming true perhaps her interview for the role of apprentice will help tip the scales in his favour king magnifico chris pine is the keeper of every residents wish and the only being in the kingdom who can ever grant them together with queen amaya angelique cabral he has established a sanctuary far removed from the trauma of his past and he takes pride in safeguarding his subjects even from their own desires his mastery of sorcery makes the monthly wish ceremony a spectacle for all even if only one wish at a time can come true but magnificos dark history has begun to blacken his soul and rather than the hero she expected to impress and serve asha is shocked to find a selfish hoarder under the glittering crown threatened and insulted by the girls innocent request for her grandfathers wish to be chosen at last the king lets his mask slip and irrevocably alters ashas destiny her late father raised her to believe in the power of the stars and that night  as she confides her pain to those glittering lights in the sky  one descends to offer a remarkable reply after a nostalgic start that throws open a storybook and twirls us back into bygone fairytales wish falters and never really finds its dancing feet again and a major culprit behind the stumble is its unforgivably forgettable songs following encanto was always going to be a challenge but though dave metzgers score is sweet enough julia michaels and benjamin rice fail to captivate with their jukebox musical numbers all dissolve from memory like candyfloss in the rain as the credits close the star that comes to earth to help asha enlivens the narrative and the soundtrack by enchanting the forest creatures into speech letting alan tudyk unleash his compulsory comedy animal appearance as pet goat valentino yet even star fails to truly sparkle ironically for a feature which has worked so hard to create a whimsical watercolour world and evoke the retro handdrawn aethetic we all love its magical element looks awfully like a fisher price emoji somehow in building a world which pays homage to so many films from the studios past jennifer lee and allison moores screenplay fails to create a believable place in which to anchor wish most notably missing is a captivating opening song or meaningful conversation to tell us who asha is and open up her singular world its hard to care about anyone we meet because we have nothing to connect to instead we are given the underwhelming welcome to rosas whichhas some jaunty guitars when shadows overwhelm the king and he gleefully embraces the darkside star is the only hope for the fragile wishes under his control ashas fractured friendship group with one notable exception reunites to join the fight and determine their own fates at last they dont actually have personalities so it feels arbitrary to name them however you might enjoy spotting the characteristics they allegedly share with snow whites seven dwarfs to pass their screentime tonally inconsistent musically meh and generally lacklustre wish isnt going to ascend to the giddy heights of the classics it references it is nice enough to look at gifts us with some fun chris pine scenery chewing and leaves on a fairly heartwarming high ultimately though directors chris buck and fawn veerasunthorn couldnt extract a narrative with the cojones to gaudily celebrate a hundred years of entertainment in style from their sea of sparkly wishing balls
Nov 24 2023,positive,not the animated gem that presumably the studio wished for its 100years celebration but a serviceable dose of magical star dust that will surely entertain kids and satisfy disney super fans full review in spanish

Nov 23 2023,positive, according to disneys 1950 classic cinderella a dream is a wish your heart makes when youre fast asleep in the studios latest animated extravaganza wish wishes are dreams better left to be protected by a powerful sorcerer and forever forgotten by the person who originally gave them life much like this new films determined heroine asha voiced by ariana debose i like that former option better too shes the one who accidentally discovers that the sorcerer in question the seemingly benevolent ruler of rosas king magnifico chris pine actually has almost zero intention to grant the wishes hes extracted from his subjects over the decades frankly hes afraid of them a personal tragedy forever coloring how he looks at allowing people to attain their most fervent desires instead he looks at it as a kindness that hes taken these aspirational longings away from all adults 18 years of age and up and the fact theyll never know what theyre now missing keeps magnifico firm in his belief hes doing the right thing asha disagrees now that shes witnessed the beauty of what the king is keeping all to himself and knowing firsthand how the extracting of wishes has changed many of her friends at their very core essentially making them a hollow shell of who they were the teenager becomes determined to do something about this singing to the heavens above for a little help a happygolucky wishing star comes to her aid the peppy magical entity descending into ashas arms to help free all the wishes from magnificos grasp im a big proponent of judging a motion picture for what it is and not what i wanted  or even think  it should be wish makes doing that difficult in and of itself the film is perfectly fine its beautifully animated debose and pine shine it has a handful of terrific songs and directors chris buck frozen and fawn veerasunthorn keep things running at a satisfyingly brisk pace there are a couple of lovely set pieces not the least of which is ashas interview with magnifico to become his apprentice in which the two share a musical moment with the wishes and the former discovers the latter isnt the leader she thought he was i was never bored at any point yet it is also abundantly clear that disneys newest release is designed to help the studio celebrate its centennial anniversary and pay homage to over nine decades of featurelength animated history there are continual callouts and injokes referencing everything from 1937s snow white and the seven dwarfs to last years strange world to all points in between its a fantastical musicaltheater collage of disneys greatest and even its notsogreatest hits and if i were back in college id take bets someone would have come up with a drinking game involving every allusion to a disney tale during this storys brief 95minute running time this creates an oddly uncomfortable imbalance inside the narrative things are simple they are very straightforward little kids are all having a wonderful time but the filmmakers keep spotlighting similar disney efforts that took greater risks ones that didnt mind offering up complex concepts for younger viewers and their parents to dissect and discuss afterward case in point king magnificos big villain song it happens right before the sorcerer falls off the deep end and embraces his dark side and its a catchy little number that pine performs rather splendidly but its style and its placement directly recall similar moments in films like beauty and the beast the lion king aladdin and even the hunchback of notre dame and it immediately pales in comparison the song is toothless and as such is oddly forgettable similar moments just like this one are littered throughout the production i do love the look of wish the animation is some watercolor cg hybrid that gives things a surrealistic aesthetic thats frequently lovely theres also an underlying metacommentary on the white savior trope that comes amazingly close to saying something substantive close but not quite because like almost everything else here even this element is played so safe it becomes more frustrating than it is praiseworthy even so if i judge disneys latest for what it is and not for what it may have been i find it very difficult to tell potential viewers to stay away its well made and suitably charming best of all asha is a divine heroine and that wishing star is a lovable goofball younger kids are going to go nuts over but its immediately obvious wish has loftier ambitions ones it refuses to rise to and annoyingly undercuts at every opportunity the

Nov 23 2023,positive,stunning that this is getting negative feedback  this film seems like a culmination of everything disney has given us for five generations and what is necessary in a holiday movie a retreat from the sorrow in the world if we just wish upon a star
Nov 23 2023,negative,wish might just be the most generic movie ive ever seen
