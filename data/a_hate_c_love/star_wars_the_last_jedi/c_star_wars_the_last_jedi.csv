Jul 24 2023,positive, synopsis luke skywalkers mark hamill peaceful and solitary existence gets upended when he encounters rey daisy ridley a young woman who shows strong signs of the force her desire to learn the ways of the jedi forces luke to make a decision that changes their lives forever meanwhile kylo ren adam driver and general hux domhnall gleeson lead the first order in an allout assault against leia carrie fisher and the resistance for supremacy of the galaxy i am an authentic fanboy of the star wars saga and i loved its return two years ago when the force awakens was released everything looked better sounded better and the story certainly didnt disappoint me so obviously i was extremely looking forward to the last jedi apparently critics love episode viii but fans not so much me well i dont love it but i do enjoy it very much i do think it is a bit below the previous films overall quality since it definitely has some issues the first one did not i am also confident that i know why the fans are not loving this movie and i will explain that after a few paragraphs this time i am going to start at the other side of the spectrum i will begin my review with the films problems because i do need to get them out of my mind especially this one the subplot involving finn john boyega rose kelly marie tran and dj benicio del toro some of the few new characters added to the franchise completely ruins the movies pacing and its narrative is such a tremendous deviation from the main story it is by far the worst issue i have with the screenplay because it does not work as one single problem it creates a whole other set of them the first acts pacing is really fast since it starts with tons of action sequences however the second act decreases the rhythm and it is more storydriven full of mysteryunlocking and characterdevelopment scenes finn and roses nonsensical adventure just turns everything slower and even strange it ends up needlessly extending the runtime the film could have easily been 15min shorter and worse possibly creating a love triangle with rey i am not even going to discuss this apart from this major issues i have some minor problems general hux is a strong candidate to become the most annoying character in this newgeneration trilogy gleeson is fine he actually achieves a good overthetop performance but his character is just tumbling off the rails also on a more technical aspect the writing does not flow as well as it did on jj abrams screenplay there are a lot more exposition scenes which also does not help the pacing at all i wrote earlier about the fans reasons for them to be disappointed and well the marketing for the movie did not lie they do take a lot of chances with this one  rian johnson delivers a lot of twists and shocks throughout the whole runtime and it is impossible to assume that every single one of them is going to be mindblowing and unanimously accepted i do not want to give anything away from the plot so i am just going to write that most of the choices and paths they choose for each character i either simply accept them or i truly love them as for the rest i am at most underwhelmed yet i trust and understand the decisions they went with people need to learn how to deal with their own expectations if you expect something utterly absurd and nonsensical to occur and then it does not you cant blame the film for not following your crazy idea so please dont start blabbing any movie is bad or disappointing because it didnt fulfill your ridiculously high expectations even if they are grounded and thoughtful you have to embrace the productions approach to the characterstory if it makes sense then it is as valid as any other theory it might be underwhelming if you have high expectations but it is still a serious take on whatever you are thinking  this is why i think fans are not loving the last jedi the production takes a lot of risks and some of them dont work with everyone mostly due to fans radical theories that dont have a place in the film i think most people might change their initial opinion after a second viewing myself included some things just need more time to process or even a whole rewatch since i do not have time to do it before the years end i am going with what i have switching to the light side i do enjoy this movie a lot every cast member that was great in episode vii transcends themselves in this one daisy ridley is superb as rey she has such a massive range of expressions and i am sure her successful future as an actress is surely guaranteed from the most emotional and somber moments to the most epic action scenes she is awesome her characters mysterious backstory reaches a whole new extent and her interactions with kylo ren and luke skywalker inflict chills all over my body mark hamills comeback cant be any more amazing than it is he delivers a fantastic emotionfull and very compelling performance it is even more unbelievable knowing that hamill had strong personal arguments against the directors interpretation of what was better for luke if he is this astounding working against his own idea of who his character really is then i must praise his exemplary working principles luke and rey spend a big chunk of the runtime training on an unknown island and i love every single second filmed on that piece of land i have to admit that i am a bit frustrated because i think the film should have more time with these two but due to the issues mentioned at the beginning of my review the runtime cant be much more stretched i love what they did with luke even if some fans are going to go insane with his journey adam driver as kylo ren the undoubtful star of the whole show driver is becoming a menace to every actor working today because he is flawless he has a powerful dark mysterious compelling and commanding display as one of the most complex and multilayered characters of the star wars saga rens conflict inside his mind and heart is the most captivating feature of his story and his interactions with rey are so jawdropping spectacular that i cant even describe them properly john boyega is once again great as finn even though he is part of that horrible subplot boyega delivers a convincing performance and finn shines through some awesome action set pieces kelly marie tran is actually good as rose it is just a pity that her character suffers from the narrative even though her backstory is pretty touching chewbacca joonas suotamo and the porgs the new cute animals implemented in the star wars universe have all the funny scenes plus some action here and there oscar isaac is quite lucky because poe dameron unquestionably has the best subplot of the movie isaac offers a very passionate display as poe goes through some significant character development his impulsive instincts to attack the bad guys always have consequences and he is put in check by leia during the whole time it is a very interesting and twistful story that elevates the films main plot carrie fisher is elegant and beautiful as leia a character that has a lot more screentime than what i expected i always love seeing fisher on the screen and she makes everything a bit more realistic to me andy serkis is remarkable as supreme leader snoke but his character is yet another plots detail that fans are not going to appreciate so much i still feel underwhelmed by snoke in this movie for several reasons but after some thinking i do understand his role in the film and his moments are indeed intimidating and dominant rian johnsons work as the director is better than his as the writer the visuals effects continue to be wonderful and the practical settings are beautiful once again there is a lot less cgi than you probably think excellent cinematography and john williams score induces enormous levels of nostalgia and excitement the action sequences are mindblowing the stunt work is phenomenal and there are tons of pure epic and awesome scenes the main plot includes a very dark and mysterious side to it that i thoroughly love a lot of unexpected twists and turns make the last jedi more original than the force awakens even if one or two plot points might be underwhelming and it also has a very wellbalanced tone finally a thrilling breathtaking actionheavy third act ends the film with magnificent glory and with many heartfelt moments all in all star wars the last jedi delivers something that i can be proud of experiencing terrific performances from the cast but a flawlessly powerful display from adam driver as kylo ren steals the spotlight rian johnson takes a lot of risks with decisions that will make the fanbase debate for years and while i find most of them truly jawdropping a few left me underwhelmed the main story keeps its obscure mystery while packing some jawdropping epic action sequences and excellent characterdevelopment scenes nevertheless it departs from jjs visual storytelling delivering a more expositionheavy screenplay and some pacing issues bring the movie down largely due to the unnecessary detour of the subplot involving finn and rose in the end it still belongs to my top half of the saga fighting for the 4th spot with return of the jedi and rogue one
Jan 9 2023,positive, rian johnsons star wars the last jedi is an emotionallydriven culmination of all that came before it and an adoring love letter to george lucas  in 2015 after a decade of lying dormant the star wars franchise came roaring back to the cinema screens with star wars the force awakens it was a massive success upon release breaking numerous box office records and getting met with nigh universal acclaim from fans and critics alike and with that under their belt lucasfilm creatives turned their attention to its sequel rian johnsons star wars the last jedi a bolder and infinitely more unique film that capitalized on the solid groundwork laid in the previous movie in massive ways johnsons the last jedi is a genuine masterpiece   if the force awakens was the result of abrams professed love for 1977s a new hope then the last jedi is the result of johnsons professed love for george lucas as a filmmaker the force awakens made a concentrated effort to keep the memories of lucas controversially received prequels at bay deliberately harkening back to the aesthetic and narrative sensibilities of the original trilogy conversely the last jedi embraces the entirety of lucas saga prequels very much included as well as the films that inspired lucas in the first place films like akira kurosawas rashomon orson welles citizen kane and michael curtizs casablanca are just as much a part of the movies visual grammar as flash gordon or buck rogers are with johnson finding the meaningful ties to these stories present in lucas work and elevating them to the forefront   that is very much a recurring theme in johnsons work despite what some particularly rabid corners of the internet might have viewers believe the last jedi is actually a sublime sequel to the force awakens it takes every development of the force awakens story from the introduction of new characters to the establishment of core beats like lukes exile in earnest and builds organically upon them characters like hux and snoke who were little more than abrams surrogate tarkin or palpatine respectively are fleshed out into fully formed characters of their own the previously plotdriving factor of lukes exile on ahchto is also authentically interrogated and given character motivation and emotional resonance none of this is johnson rewriting or trampling over developments from the force awakens but rather the opposite with the last jedi elevating these elements with startling clarity and retroactively strengthening abrams film   and it is with this same adoration and articulate eye johnson approaches the story of the star wars saga at large the last jedi builds beautifully upon threads from previous films in a deeply affecting fashion as lucas famously said of star wars storytelling its like poetry it rhymes and johnson demonstrates a profound understanding of this rhyming stanza lukes exile on ahchto is deliberately reminiscent of yodas exile on dagobah with both characters disappearing from the fight entirely in the aftermath of their own perceived failures in revenge of the sith one of yodas final lines is into exile i must go failed i have after he lost his duel with palpatine yoda feels his own hubris led to this destructive result with nearly all of his students dying and the jedi order he oversaw crumbling before him lukes arc in the last jedi is a rhyme of all of this down to blaming the death of his students on his own hubris   but wonderfully johnson doesnt stop there the stanza culminates with yoda and lukes conversation in which yoda says the greatest teacher failure is and we are what they grow beyond that moment brings 40yearsworth of storytelling to a head  bringing yodas story from the prequels full circle providing an emotional epitaph to luke and yodas relationship in the original trilogy and serving as a resolution of lukes internal conflict across force awakens and last jedi all in pure lucas cinematic storytelling fashion   the last jedi is full of meticulously constructed thematic threads like this that are immensely emotionally satisfying rey and kylo rens relationship is a rhyme of anakin and padmés with johnson and editor bob ducsay cutting their force connection scenes to invoke both anakin and padmés connection in revenge of the sith and luke and vaders force connections at the end of the empire strikes back finn rose and dj donning first order garb to infiltrate the supremacy is also a rhyme of the original trios infiltration of the death star in a new hope used to emotional effect in pointedly challenging finns beliefs by reimmersing him into the system of corrupt power even kylo ren revealing reys parentage to her is a rhyme of vader doing the same to luke in the empire strikes back and the reveal itself directly taps into the core thesis of the joseph campbellpenned works which so heavily inspired lucas   one of the most impactful instances of this thematic rhyming scheme comes with lukes final stand at the battle of crait the entire theme of lucas a new hope is that of technology versus spirituality luke is put squarely in the middle of this theological conflict with obiwan on one shoulder preaching the spirituality of the force and han solo on the other telling him that hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster it culminates with the death star trench run as luke lets go of his conscious self and embraces spirituality turning off the targeting computer and saving the rebellion   in the last jedi the battle of crait comes down to the first orders latest technological terror  a siege cannon  and the literal spirituality of luke skywalker by force projecting himself to crait lukes spirituality saves the resistance in an entirely pacifistic fashion that not only sees johnson bringing lukes franchiselong arc full circle in an unexpected way but it also sees luke laying down his life to become an embodiment of the very ideology that the jedi have sought across the entire saga a true guardian of peace and justice   rian johnsons the last jedi is a miracle its a bigbudget franchise movie that feels like a profoundly personal passion project lucas mentor francis ford coppola often spoke of making his one for them films be one for you by imbuing them with immense personal stakes and that is a lesson johnson has taken to heart the last jedi is a deeply personal love letter to not just star wars but to george lucas as a filmmaker which internalizes the thematic works of all that came before it in the name of delivering an immensely satisfying culmination that builds upon all of it  the biggest jingle all the way fan you know will jones came onboard with cbr in 2022 after having previously worked at sites such as whatculture and bigshinyrobot parasyte the grey season 1 has a warridden ending that focuses on heidi suin and kangwoo trying to fend off aliens and chois pack of hunters
Aug 25 2022,positive, the mammoth success of 2015s the force awakens shouldnt have surprised anyone star wars fans had ten years of anticipation built up since the last movie and when disney purchased the property from george lucas they immediately began touting a new installment now just two years later not counting last years standalone film an incredible 450 million for the latest episodes opening weekend indicates the fire hasnt died down one bit the last jedi is the eighth film in the series proper the ninth star wars film overall and while it has been intensely popular and profitable the reactions have been all over the map some have heralded it the best star wars film since empire while others are petitioning disney to have it removed from canon regardless of where you land everyone has to agree that the last jedi continues the franchise trend of epitomizing the space opera concept jj abrams hands over the reins to rian johnson who both writes and directs episode viii johnson has shown himself to be an intriguing filmmaker as evident by his movies brick and the scifi mindbender looper but a star wars film is an entirely different animal heavy with high expectations and an extremely passionate and vocal fanbase johnsons story offers franchise fans plenty to smile at and just as much to chew on several scenes call back to the original trilogy and the inspiration is undeniable the force awakens not so subtly but effectively followed the blueprint of 1977s a new hope you could say johnsons film is a melding of the empire strikes back and the return of the jedi the structure of some scenes are so similar you cant help but recognize it but fear not this is no copy and paste rehash johnson has numerous fresh strokes and narrative angles that makes the last jedi feel completely of its own some of johnsons decisions have stoked the ire of certain fans but hes clearly trying to develop his own take on the universe because of this a couple of characters handed off by abrams dont quite get the attention is it because they dont completely fit within johnsons vision im not sure the force awakens ends with rey daisy ridley finding luke skywalker mark hamill on a remote island johnson drops his anchor and spends a lot of time on the island with rey trying to convince luke the rebel alliance needs him she also seeks his help in understanding the force and the powers she has discovered but luke has become a disillusioned hermit conflicted about his own legend and convinced the time of the jedi has passed hamills performance may be his best yet and ridley is such an asset the two share several good scenes  some funny and some emotional elsewhere in the galaxy the young rebellion led by general leia carrie fisher is forced to evacuate their base after kylo ren adam driver and the menacing first order arrive the pursuit that follows takes a big chunk of the film and includes the return of impetuous hotshot pilot poe dameron oscar isaac former stormtrooper turned resistance superstar finn john boyega and droidofalltrades bb8 fisher brings out a whole new layer of humanity to leia thats hinted at in the previous film but truly realized in this performance sadly her last following her recent passing speaking of new layers kylo ren has several of them and johnson has made him into the most intriguing character of the new series the last jedi is the longest star wars film by a good 15 minutes and unfortunately you can tell the first half has some big moments but its also a bit slow getting its footing johnson spends a tad too much time on the island only giving us baby steps of progression with luke and rey until finally getting in gear in the second half the pursuit segment also has some stumbles particularly involving a side mission with finn and a new character rose kelly marie tran aside from some pretty obvious logistical issues their mission lacks energy and only exists because of a pointless story angle involving another new face admiral holdo laura dern she is without question the most poorly conceived character of the new trilogy this mission also features a pretty bad cgiheavy chase sequence that felt completely out of sync with the rest of the movie at the same time there are many more things johnson gets right especially in the second half where the intensity really amps up i especially love the stress on characters and the personal bonds many of them share and there is also the connections between the old and the new ill be intentionally vague but this can be tricky ground for a filmmaker johnson nails it and none of these moments feel contrived or meaningless some had me wanting to cheer others brought tears to my eyes the film also ends with an exhilarating final sequence that leaves the story in an interesting place ready to be picked up in episode ix i can certainly understand fans having a lot of questions i do myself but thats a big part of the fun when it comes to a star wars movie  wondering and speculating the last jedi has some early pacing issues and a few things that simply dont make sense but its still a fantastic star wars experience filled with excitement emotion and nostalgia it also features a few of those truly great moments that franchise fans will forever link with this film i know i wont forget them and my inner fanboy is getting a bit giddy just thinking about them this one will keep people talking for two years until the next episode  im pretty sure not all the talk will be supportive  obviously the crazies will be out en masse  with resentment and ridiculous demands  i thought almost everything with luke rey and kilo ren worked everything else was hit or miss ill need a to see it again to help me process i am a diehard star wars fan but dont agree with a lot of the outrage lots of the anger seems to be centered around the handling of luke i actually liked it and thought it added an interesting dynamic to that character almost tragic in a sense and mark hamill really dives into it my only gripes deal more with holes in logic and some early pacing issues otherwise its a fun installment seeing it again tonight this time with the family interesting take on it i never found any of the heroes to be cowards i think the film does a good job relating genuine conflict within them thanks brittani seeing it again in a few hours really anxious to see if my handful of gripes hold up because like you i like it more just thinking about it im in the camp that really liked it as i dont understand why people complain about the length  i found it a bit refreshing as it wanted to take some risks in exploring themes and having characters embark on different adventures to see that there is so much about the galaxy that is complicated  especially as theres an air of cynicism about war  the casino sequence is excessive but i think thats the point because it is this decadent world full of people who dont really care about who wins or loses just as long as they make money out of this conflict  i think this will be the most polarizing film for now as im sure the third will get fans more riled up  at least its not the fucking prequels which insults you with a lot of heavyhanded ideas about politics and other kinds of bullshit i have no issue with it being long my issue was that i could tell it was for me luke and rey spend too much time on the island several of their interactions in the first half do little to move their story forward and i dont mind stories branching out i kinda like that but aside from some logical gaps i felt the whole casino world mission was the weakest part of the film and it did no favors to the finn character and the excess of the haves is a nice touch but the glaringly obvious cgi space horses were too much for me  nice review keith  i really enjoyed the last jedi  i liked the force awakens but that film was essentially a remake of the original  although last jedi does cobble some parts from both empire and return of the jedi its plot feels more original than tfa and its ending more deserved  im eagerly looking forward to the next installment just got back from seeing it a second time i still by my criticisms but i found them to be less of an issue there are a couple of story questions i simply cant reconcile plotholes perhaps but overall it is even better a second time through i dont hate it but i was a bit disappointed  i was not completely on board with the story of luke at all  having said that  hamill acts with relish and saves it for me  i was frustrated with the snoke story and the mystery we were led to believe from awakens and then just tossed aside  then reys parents were just a bunch of addicts more or less  ok  i can live with that but once again  i think there is clear continuity issues from awakens  but it also appears that there really was no mapping out a basic 3 stage story arc and its flying by the seat of its pants  then the introduction of rose was like why  i didnt find her compelling at all and the whole casino scene seemed pointless and was cringeworthy during the stupid chase scene  i also was not pleased with the new admiral justing showing up and i found her annoying her sacrifice meant nothing to me  it should have been admiral ackbar and would have given fans a hero we knew and felt something for  instead of just killing him off screen  another scene i was like what  was mary poppins in space with leia  where i was sitting there were a few other fans that chuckled as well  then that general hux  was he like comic relief or what it was too long  some of the humor was dumb and poor finn and poe  poe came across as an idiot and finn was underused plus another irritant could we not have had at least a memorial of some kind for hans  i would have preferred that instead of the casino scene  what saved the movie for me was hamill  driver and ridley  all stellar performances so my score runs like this 6 for the movie 9 for the performances mentioned with an average of 75  thanks for the thoughts tlj definitely has a lot to unpack just a few things i liked the luke angle simply because it showed a deep scarred humanity to him i like how it subverted expectations of him as legendary the jedi master the snoke story is a puzzling one im not sure if snoke simply doesnt fit into johnsons vision i do like how it propelled kylo who i think is the most compelling character in the new series also i really like that rey isnt linked to han luke or leia i think having her parents who they are could have some serious impact i liked rose better the second time i saw the film not an exciting character though and i absolutely agree about the casino world chase scene ugh also agree about laura derns character just popping up and suddenly given command it seemed completely out of the blue i did appreciate her sacrifice but 100 agree about akhbar hasnt he done enough to deserve command and how about this why didnt the admiral tell poe about their plan she kept it hidden from him which led to a mutiny think about it if she had told poe when he repeatedly asked about a plan finn and rose wouldnt have sought a codebreaker wouldnt have met dj and wouldnt have been betrayed the transport ships could have made it to the planet also the mutiny slowed down the transport launch enabling the first order to get the information and blow several transports out of the air anywayi actually like hux i find him a punching bag but also a bit maniacal i like the struggle between his militaristic vision and the siths also as a han guy i would have loved to see a little more of a tribute the dice were a nice touch though i think at the end of the day  this movie will leave many hardcore fans very unsatisfied  my problem with hux is he felt like almost a different character than compared to awakens   the dice were a nice subtle touch but man  one of most iconics star wars and scifi characters and no a proper salute still gnaws at me  i really wanted to love  this movie but i really think johnson could have introduced some new twist without deconstructing much of the mythology of star wars i think this movie will end up tied with revenge of the sith in my star wars list   the best of the prequels  i will say my excitement for  the next one has been dampened but wait and see jj correct some of what i think were misfires by johnson  its definitely been interesting watching the range of opinions i did think about something wasnt akhbar killed in the incident that incapacitated leia that would explain why he wasnt given command it was a bummer that he was basically killed offscreen i definitely agree that the movie was slow getting its footing the a b and c plots were totally obvious and the c plot finn  rose at the casino was kindof pointless although i did think the film was remarkably shot and i truly appreciated the story i enjoyed tfa more but i think tlj is a better film for its originality among other things great review thanks for the comments i watched it a second time last night and found myself more impressed with what johnson does it does look incredible and those big moments are just fantastic i still have the same frustrations after a second viewing but they arent quite as pronounced as before really like this installment oh thats great i need to watch it a second time before i write my review youre right about those big moments the opening sequence was remarkable i cant wait to see what abrams does for the last one  ohh i didnt notice that but that makes a lot of sense why that would be ill look out for that in my second viewing  awesome review keith i feel you pretty much nail the head on the last jedi  im supportive of some of the creative risks johnson took and thats certainly needed in any longrunning franchise but part of me does feel that the force awakens was stronger overall there were some incredible visual treats but im with you on the pacing it felt like there at times momentum was gathering only to be lost in the next moment  the finnrose side mission didnt help glad someone else thought the cgi chase was a bit off  also some of the humour felt forced and unnecessary could this be the disney effect the same thing seems to bother me with the marvel films in the original trilogy those moments were actually funny and never felt out of place but not so much here thanks chris definitely some pacing issues and some logic problems that i just couldnt reconcile still a good installment and ill give it credit i did seem to enjoy it even more during my second viewing ive heard that quite a lot i likely wont catch it again until the bluray release but its always encouraging to hear that a movie improves with subsequent viewings what were your thoughts on the luke treatment it seems many people were upset at how he was written personally i liked it it showed the humanity of luke and since jedi are taught to suppress emotion it makes sense for him to cut himself off from the force considering the deep emotional impact of what he faced i too was fine with it keith wed already had lukes journey as a hero in the original trilogy and i felt it was right to do something surprising and unexpected with him  as you point out the way he was depicted in tlj made him more human and relatableeven a jedi can be fallible and have regrets much has been written concerning lukes journey in this movie but the only thing that saves this whole thing for me was the force of hamills performance he comes across as coward selfish and woe is me at the beginning by cutting himself off from his sister  friends etc more or less by running from the mess he made  now johnson has every right to take him there  its his story but for me it doesnt fit right with the luke of the past  i have zero issue with him being conflicted  guilt ridden etc but that whole story felt off  hamill even felt so  although he has back tracked  but i will attempt going forward to stop thinking about it because the more i do sit around with other star wars fans  the more we begin to really pick it apart lol  but that is the passion of fans concerning anything i guess  thats interesting i never saw him as a coward or selfish i saw as broken and disillusioned i saw him as someone who was overwhelmed by the emotions of the situation he endured and since the archaic jedi system he had been taught in failed him he cuts himself off from the force i really liked the mental and emotional complexity hes fighting  i noticed one or two possible issues with the story when thinking about it later one of which  finns and roses mission turning out to be pointless  i actually thought rather clever  and i didnt get why admiral holdo looked like someone out of the hunger games  on the whole though i had very few issues with the film for me the the entire finn and rose mission was completely pointless it didnt need to even happen one reason it did happen and another major issue i had was holdo her character made no sense to me whatsoever of all the times to suddenly feel you needed to teach poe a lesson why on earth wouldnt she tell him of their plan i also wasnt crazy about leia pulling a mary poppins in space something about that didnt click the mary poppins bit didnt entirely click with me either although i didnt really mind it too much i loved the lukekylo ren confrontation mark hamill really threw himself into his role and the direct the film shifts the franchise in
Mar 16 2022,positive, star wars episode viii  the last jedi arrives with a measure of freedom being disencumbered from the responsibility to restart the franchise that beset and some would argue hampered its breezy predecessor director jj abrams the force awakens rather than dwelling on nostalgia or trying to recreate our fond memories of the original trilogy with blatant parallels to george lucas 1977 original the new film carves out its own identity in fact that very notion finds a thematic strain in the narrative as several of the films characters place a distance between themselves and their earlier counterparts in a key scene the temperamental kylo ren adam driver destroys his helmet which he crafted to echo that of darth vader vowing to uncouple from the lingering associations between himself and those who came before him a similar act of symbolic detachment is carried out by rey daisy ridley after finally learning the truth about luke skywalker mark hamill indeed while the last jedi is brimming with adventure and the spectacle of its swashbucklerinspace roots more importantly its a sweeping melodrama that contains no end of deconstructionist ideas about what makes a hero the force and the jedi religion for all of its revisionist thinking inevitable comparisons will be made between the last jedi and the empire strikes back since this second entry in disneys new trilogy contains many of the same story elements that defined the second chapter of lucas original trilogy it expands on the mythology of the series in theatrical ways the story breaks up the main characters for smaller individual missions the central hero trains on a faraway planet under the tutelage of an old master the young trainee sees herself in a quite literal dream secondary characters engage in a more militaristic mission a few shocking turns and doublecrosses occur and some familial revelations will surprise viewers perhaps it goes without saying at this point but many of the films most significant developments will be discussed in detail throughout this review consider yourself warned regardless of the last jedis structural similarities to the empire strikes back rian johnsonthe first solitary writerdirector to tackle a star wars film since lucas was credited as the originals sole writerdirectordelivers a different kind of star wars film on purely formal and narrative terms having tested his hand in emotional complex sciencefiction with 2012s superb timetravel mindbender looper johnson has gradually developed from a lowbudget filmmaker his breakthrough brick an inventive highschool noir from 2005 began a career that has continued to advance with every project into a key player in disneys future star wars films he has been commissioned to start an entirely new trilogy in this universe independent from the tales involving luke leia rey and kylo teaming with his longtime cinematographer steve yedlin the last jedi looks like one of johnsons films but it also looks like a star wars film and perhaps that says something about his passion for the franchise the film opens just after the events of the force awakens as the resistance led by general leia the late carrie fisher attempts to escape the clutches of the evil first order during the escape hotheaded pilot poe dameron oscar isaac goes against his orders by launching a smallscale attack that when backed by the few remaining resistance bombers gets a lot of rebel scum killed the last jedi alternates between the first orders pursuit of the resistance and rey training with luke skywalker rey has flown the millennium falcon to find luke in seclusion on the most unfindable place in the galaxy and johnson makes excellent use of that stirring last shot of the force awakens where rey hands luke his lightsaber by turning the moment on its head luke has lost faith in the force and he proves a reluctant teacher meanwhile the resistance tries to evade capture in a protracted chase as general hux domhnall gleeson has somehow found a way to track their convoy even after a hyperspace flight much of the second act drags and meanders proving unnecessary to the plot low on fuel and locked in a highspeed chase the resistance convoy keeps the first order at a relatively safe distance but leia is injured during the ongoing pursuit and replaced with the purplecoiffed vice admiral holdo laura dern with just a few desperate hours before theyre overtaken poe unwilling to follow holdos uncertain plans concocts a ridiculous scheme to send finn john boyega and rose kelly marie tran an impassioned rebel to a casino planet to find a codebreaker once they secure the codebreaker they can sneak onto the first orders ship and briefly disengage their ability to track through hyperspace this curious detour to a galactic french riviera halts the films forward momentum its as though one of the passengers in john fords stagecoach took a horse from the coach and went on a separate mission worse it ends up utterly pointless when their plan falls through and their stuttering codebreaker benicio del toro doublecrosses them the last jedis midsection may feel bogged down by a needless deviation but the rousing finale contains several impressive scenes of action and lightsaber dueling after learning about the force from her disenchanted instructorspecifically how the jedi are hubrisridden hypocrites to think theyre the only people entitled to wield a power that surrounds everyone and everythingrey believes she can turn kylo toward the light on her own a psychic rapport has somehow formed between them across an expanse of light years and they now have a conspicuous bond through telepathic conversations she resolves to confront kylo and with his help they destroy this films resident emperor supreme leader snoke andy serkis under a rubbery cgi motioncapture performance during a breathless sequence but this only emboldens and does not quell the monster inside of kylo realizing shes failed rey joins the resistance for the final battle on a nearby planet coated with salt which has a red soil underneath a striking image reminiscent of crimson peak kylo leads the first order against the last remaining resistance fighters and he faces luke in a tense duel that recalls the last living moments of obiwan kenobi in a new hope johnsons screenplay results in a mindwandering 152minute runtime that sags in the middle as suggested everything involving the casino planet and del toros character proves inconsequential to the plot nonetheless the writerdirector incorporates revisionist ideas about the jedi and star wars that go against what fans often celebrate about this franchise his characters observe how the past and its traditions do not matter despite the franchises ingrained mythology snoke remarks more than once that kylo has failed to become the next darth vader and perhaps out of his failure perhaps after killing his father kylo resolves to let the past die and become his own man elsewhere rey hopes to find a living legend in the jedi warrior luke skywalker but instead she finds a broken monk that has lost faith in his order finn and rose learn that anyone can become a hero no matter how insignifcantand several characters learn this same lesson when rey discovers her decidedly modest lineage combined with lukes skepticism toward jedi precepts it becomes evident that bloodlines do not make heroes a persons willingness to do what is good does johnson touches on themes that resonate in our present culture war infusing the last jedi with an overt ideological perspective although hardly intentional given that johnsons script was finished before the 2017 election the film opens in an age where controversial politics and nepotism go handinhand and associations cannot help be made between the trump family takeover of washington and the first orders leadership thus making the nazi parallels even more frightening johnson questions the authority of heritage suggesting that the force is something not exclusive to a noble few throughout multiple story threads he remains critical of the superrich and how they acquire their means as well as those who jealously hold onto their power johnsons film also calls for animal rights in a subplot on the casino planet where finn and rose liberate large racing dogs he condemns the eating of meat in a comical sequence wherein chewbacca thinks twice before chowing on a birdlike porg a resignedly cute trifle and he censures both slavery and childlabor as well to be sure this is the most political and socially reflective of all star wars films johnsons formal approach is also revisionist but fans may balk at alternative flourishes that threaten to betray the formal toolkit commonly used by filmmakers in this series and feel dissimilar from the standard formal model of a star wars film though the usual swipes and transitions remain intact take how during the initial resistance escape roses sister paige veronica ngo must release several bombs at the right moment johnson drops all diegetic sound and engages in slowmotion to heighten the tension a familiar device in many other action films but the tactic seems out of place in a star wars film johnson also plays with sound when he drops all audio except the dialogue in psychic conversations between kylo and rey similiar formal oddities appear throughout making the last jedi feel less connected to other episodes in terms of its technique consider when johnson interrupts the usual forward thrust of star wars films with a rare flashback or later cinephiles may note that the last jedi is the first episode to make direct reference to another nonstar wars film while other episodes draw inspiration from established films the most obvious being akira kurosawas the hidden fortress 1958 none has been so bold as to borrow exact lines from terry gilliams brazil in a nod to the dreaded form the 27b6 the last jedi alternates between material that either inspires celebration or feels strangely out of place if not inconsistent or overly cutesy fortunately theres more of the former category in the failing camp the inclusion of admittedly awwinspiring porgs to sell stuffed animals and videogames the slowmotion used throughout the film toadlike nuns used for comic relief the sudden disappearance of han solos charms in a universe where people but not inanimate objects fade into nothingness upon death leias return from the vacuum of space by way of her neveragainreferenced use of the force and the frustrating reality that snoke and his horrible facial scars will remain a villain devoid of any backstory obviously most of these observations are mere quibbles more triumphant are driver ridley and hamills impassioned performances the final lightsaber battle with kylo and rey the continued energy of boyega and johnsons investment in his films thematic and political integrity whatever issues this review may have explored or nitpicked the last jedi both honors and expands upon the mythology of star wars while also providing the necessary popcornmunching escapism the film even boasts some laughoutloud moments of wit and humorthe openers radio prank was hilarious even if it seemed illsuited for a star wars film the misplaced metahumor is a trend throughout the film but johnsons film supplies the requisite spectacle that casual fans expect while devoted enthusiasts have new complex ideas to consider for the franchises future the last jedi gives audiences much to think about unfortunately some of that thinking is done during the film instead of after it even so johnsons desire to push forward and alter the star wars universe in substantial ways remains brave and bold making the films uneven pacing and few missteps negligible next to the sheer scope acting prowess and thematic ambitiousness of the episode
Feb 18 2022,positive, over the past hour i have sat and contemplated where i even begin with the film i just saw star wars episode viii the last jedi is without a doubt the most anticipated film of 2017 and will quite possibly be the most talked about of the year as well over the past two years fans of star wars have been anticipating the direction of where their favorite characters were going thanks to writer and director rian johnson star wars the last jedi is one of the most original unique and best star wars film since the empire strikes back  without delving into any spoilers the last jedi picks up after the events of 2015s the force awakens after a successful assault on the starkiller base general leia carrie fisher and the resistance must now evacuate their current hideout before the first order arrives at their base to eliminate them meanwhile the end of force awakens showed rey daisy ridley having found luke skywalker mark hamill who had been in hiding since kylorens turn to the dark side as seen in the trailers rey hopes that luke will not only train her but also assist in helping her understand why she is so strong with the force and that he will give her an insight into her abilities that will assist her in her path to either the dark side or the light the basis of the plot noted the last jedi is a film that you must stop and think about after viewing it a film that while the longest in the franchises history at 2 hours 32 minutes is quite possibly its fastest paced in its 40 years from beginning to end rian johnson lays out a plot that keeps fans at the edge of their seats usually when glancing at my phone to look at the time its because of the lack of entertainment value however this goes the other way around this time i glanced hoping there was still more time left in this magnificent film outside of the empire strikes back the last jedi may be the best overall performances by the ensemble in its film history from the latest editions to the franchise daisy ridley adam driver oscar isaac andy serkis and john boyega to legends of the franchise carrie fisher and mark hamill the last jedis casts performances consistently maneuver from good to great as a big fan of the force awakens and i for one failed to join the club of those that felt it was a rehash of a new hope that being said while there were some callbacks to new hope in force awakens the last jedis only call back to empire was its darker tone other than that the last jedi goes in directions no one expected and i for one absolutely loved every second of it those who were bitching and moaning on social media about the lack of originality in the force awakens have already taken to social media about this film saying its not a star wars movie along with citing its weirdness and i find that quite adorable it truly shows that no matter what there will plenty of fans that will always find something to complain about a big bright spot for me was lucasfilm and disney having faith in rian johnson to not silence his vision directors tend to lose their voice in this bigbudget franchise entries and instead of going the formulaic route johnson is given the keys the kingdom and while some find his vision weird and different my suggestion is to not be so closeminded and pick up looper where johnsons brilliance is on full display the future is bright for the star wars universe with rian johnson at the helm as with every star wars film the last jedi is a technical beauty from its battles in space to its finale on crait the entire film continues the franchises recent streak of beautifully looking films visual effects sound mixing and editing oscar nominations should be in the films future speaking of an oscar nomination john williams should be in line for yet another nomination as he has done it again with his score for the last jedi its brilliant another notch to an already sparkling resume to the greatest film composer of all time in reading other critics reviews of this film most are not fans of the side story between finn and rose while considered filler i did not find it as distracting as most the force awakens had a similar filler scene with han and chewey and their smuggling adventures when first meeting rey and finn however finn and roses story had a purpose to the eventual end game of the film therefore it did not harm the film in my eyes finally we have come to the porgs i am happy to report that they are not the jar jar binks of the new trilogy quite frankly they are in just enough to stay adorable and become a fan favorite among the kids star wars the last jedi was everything i hoped for and more while rating it just a few hours after leaving the theater would be quite irresponsible on my part the film is certainly the best in the franchise since the empire strikes back and its twists and turns are quite frankly some of the best in the star wars lore
Dec 29 2021,positive, the best thing sequels have going for them are that a lot of the heavylifting has been done theyre free from establishing characters and winning over the audience the last jedi takes full advantage of its sequel status and delivers a followup to the force awakens that expands upon that films characters and stories in exciting and frankly shocking ways writerdirector rian johnson deserves immense praise for taking big bold moves with the narrative that feel subversive without being disingenuous to the story thats come before its a masterful balancing act in giving the audience what they want  a rousing adventure with compelling and fun characters  while simultaneously giving the audience what they need a story that doesnt adhere to predictability in order to please the widest possible audience but even then johnson delivers the crowdpleasing action endearing humor and epic scope fans want out of star wars freed from the more reverent and fetishistic tendencies of jj abrams johnsons filmmaking style feels more like a natural evolution of the original trilogy than the force awakens he still nails the grandiose moments like abrams does but he reserves being showy for moments that count and boy are there moments that count in the last jedi there are striking story beats that while they do echo the empire strikes back and even return of the jedi manage to twist those familiar bits into twists that had me reeling backward into my seat the last jedi goes places that feel like the end of a saga rather than a middle entry that actually helps make everything feel momentous and impacting instead of pulling punches for later entries johnsons script holds nothing back and it pays off in enormous ways there is also a real sense of darkness and complication at the heart of the last jedi this film explores the sacrifice of war in a personal way that rogue one didnt quite understand instead of drenching itself in griminess and a surface desire to muddy the moral waters like rogue one did the last jedi lets its complexities and dilemmas come naturally from the characters instead of the larger plot this also helps make some of the jawdropping moments hit harder i wont spoil any of the big stuff but i will say that as someone who considers luke skywalker one of his favorite fictional characters this movie more than makes up for his absence in the force awakens lukes arc in the last jedi is fraught with regret and despair and its great to see mark hamill return to the character with a new angle with which to play him it leads to some of lukes best moments in the entire series if i had one significant complaint its that the movie is a bit overlong there are some deviations the story has to take that feel like they could be trimmed without losing a whole lot of necessary plot points or character progression this is especially true of the section where finn and rose visit canto bight i dug this part for some cute bits and the plethora of alien species but it is the only part of the movie that starts to feel a tad sluggish its the best of the new wave of star wars films by far encapsulating everything thats great about star wars as a story hope friendship rebellion conflict and sacrifice without feeling like the 200 million dollar fan films that weve recently gotten rian johnson has given us a star wars film that actually is a genuine evolution of the series in style narrative and emotion never before have i been as excited to see where star wars will go next oh and you know that brand new trilogy rian johnson is working on just give him all the star wars just do it disney if youre listening give rian star wars please thanks
Sep 9 2021,positive, a line delivered to heroine rey by cosmic curmudgeon luke skywalker and a stark piece of advice to anyone who thinks star wars the last jedi will bend to their total will writerdirector rian johnson delivers through and through a spirited star wars film as star warsy as star wars can be but this ones got a rebellious streak that separates it from any other lucasfilm picture that came before it following the grander steps of the empire strikes back the last jedi throws a brick through the glass house of expectations built after the fervor of the force awakens whereas that film was a fantastic piece of fan service the last jedi simultaneously feeds the birds and finds new unexpected ground to fight on johnson has always relished the art of subversion and the last jedi is not spared his delight in disassembly this is how you honor whats come before by carefully setting the stage and blowing it all up to smithereens death star style in the rubble new life can grow to discuss the plot beyond the murkiest abstract should land anyone in a force chokehold so just know that everything picks up right where jj abrams left it two years ago from there johnson stops and starts with no warning of when things will slow down or when theyll go from lull to lightspeed its that playfulness in the pacing along with johnsons willingness to take the story in bold directions that makes every little twist and turn so unexpected and refreshing mark hamill whos back after his force awakens cameo digs his feet into the mud to portray a luke we really havent seen before he brings some real anger and weariness to the table a far cry from the awshucksy jedi apprentice from the original trilogy hes a grump with gravitas and hamills is the best performance in this jedi revival so far  though the delightful daisy ridley and austere adam driver give him a run for his money whats more after a calendar year of watching and waiting for the next worst moment to pop up on our twitter timelines the last jedi also stands for something we could all use a little more of hope moment in and moment out johnsons film finds ways to inspire and teach in these times of tumult as a sensational star wars vehicle and a pensive reminder of ideals for any age the last jedi holds its lightsaber high  a beacon for what these films can be and what they can impart
Aug 24 2021,positive, watching star wars the last jedi was bittersweet knowing the death of carrie fisher means that after this film princess leia will never grace the big screen again the character of leia has always been the one to hold onto hope even in the most desperate times she does so again in the last jedi i felt the thrill of being in a full movie theater as the previews ended and the lights went dim a hush settled in the room before the first strains of john williams famous music erupted and the familiar scroll began to roll slowly up the screen after the success of the force awakens the last jedi has a lot of expectations to fulfill and it does so with just the right mix of gravitas and humor writerdirector rian johnson crafts a story that begins right where the force awakens left off even after the destruction of starkiller base the first order has fought the rebellion to the point of extinction whats left of the rebels is led by the exquisite general leia organa carrie fisher together with her people shes trying to figure out how to overcome the power of the first order led by the pastyfaced slimeball general hux domhnall gleeson and directed by supreme leader snoke andy serkis in another cgi role meanwhile on the island in the middle of nowhere rey daisy ridley tries to talk luke skywalker mark hamill into coming back to help the faltering rebellion and discovers that she has a weird connection with kylo ren and appropriately brooding adam driver two new characters grace the story this time around kelly marie tran plays rose tico a talented rebel mechanic who teams up with finn john boyega on a mission that will hopefully enable the rebels to live long enough to fight another day she starts off as an overexcited fangirl of finns but embraces her mission with determination laura derns vice admiral holdo decked out in an amazing dress steps into an unexpected leadership position and has to deal with hothead pilot poe dameron oscar isaac who seeks permission for his crazy plans rian johnson brings freshness and originality to the last jedi while there are enough references to the star wars mythology to satisfy lifelong fans the film sets off in its own direction that will ultimately lead to the next chapter in episode nine the interplay between good and evil the dark and the light takes on a number of different forms in the last jedi there are internal struggles temptations to be overcome sacrifices to be made in the face of the evil of the first order the remnant of the rebels still have hope that the light will come out on top it may not look like it right now but as long as there are people to hold onto the light the darkness will never overcome it sister hosea rupprecht is a member of the daughters of st paul a religious community dedicated to evangelization with the media she holds a master of theological studies degree from the university of st michaels college in toronto and an ma in media literacy from webster university in st louis  sr hosea is director of the east coast office of the pauline center for media studies based in staten island ny and speaks on media literacy and faith to catechists parents youth and young adults together with father chip hines she is the cohost of searchlight a catholic movie review show on catholic tv sr hosea is the author of how to watch movies with kids a valuesbased strategy released by pauline books  media  for the past 15 years she has facilitated various film dialogues for both children and adults as well as given presentations on integrating culture faith and media our mission the daughters of saint paul are an international congregation of women religious called consecrated and sent to evangelize in the spirit of st paul through our lives and all forms of media we are present in 50 nations with over 2500 sisters carrying out the pauline mission around the world 
Aug 24 2021,positive, the force awakens was a fine reentry into the world of star wars even as the film seemed to be a beatforbeat copy of a new hope but while the last jedi is definitely reminiscent of the empire strikes back particularly in its training scenes and return of the jedi in a scene i wont spoil this finally feels like a filmmaker putting his stamp on the series rian johnson has been one of the best american filmmakers of the last decadeplus hes also the last of the class that had to make a few indie and modestly budgeted features before getting called up to the big leagues but his three features prior to this  the high school noir brick the caper comedy the brothers bloom and the scifi thriller looper  were all special in their own ways but with a focus on excellent writing that both served the story and subverted our expectations and while the last jedi absolutely does that it has one thing johnsons movies never had before bloat at twoandahalf hours this is the longest star wars movie to date and while the emotional stakes of the story as it plays out supports that scope its pacing makes it feel at least 30 minutes too long the story such as it is is basically one long chase the rebels are on the run from the first order trying to find a planet where they can hole up and send a distress signal meanwhile rey is still trying to convince luke skywalker to train her and also return to fight the new incarnation of the empire this isnt going to turn out the way you think he tells rey at one point and for the most part hes right the last jedi is as much into demythologizing the force as it is relishing in its fantastic fight choreography and intergalactic dogfights one of my issues with the force awakens was that i never bought the scenes of emotional weight there was never enough context to believe kylo rens struggle in particular that problem has been taken care of here as the battle for his soul is placed front and center with brief but crucial backstory filled in the same goes for rey whose past has been the subject of countless speculation and reddit threads the answers here are both simpler and more complex than all that guessing blockbusters comparing themselves to classic films is nothing new but the film i was most reminded of during the last jedi was the dark knight both films are willing to kill off major characters for actual emotional resonance and not just for shock value both films let trustworthy characters obscure the truth for a larger purpose both films are probably too long and might have been better served by putting their last 30 minutes into a third film but both films also have endless possibilities for where the series can go from here lets just hope episode ix ends better than the dark knight rises
Jul 28 2021,positive, austin texasit may come with resources you cant find anywhere else but helming a star wars film is no walk in the park to start it involves skyhigh expectations continentspanning production schedules and perhaps unrivaled levels of fan obsession including possible russian social accounts lobbying for general hux to live seriously the house of mouse now also looms over everything inevitably demanding a certain box office bottom line thats a daunting task for even the most established of hollywood creatorsbut its especially herculean for a relatively unknown filmmaker and that evidently made rian johnsons intergalactic debut with the last jedi the perfect opportunity for a fulllength behindthescenes documentary the director and the jedi im the newbieevery department head has done a movie of this size before johnson says as he sets the stakes early in the film producer ram bergman and i are the outsiders who have infiltrated with every decision im laying down my chips in front of these great poker players and trusting just a little tingle in my stomach its terrifying johnson bergman mark hamill and documentarian anthony wonkie came to the south by southwest conference to present the world premiere of this unprecedented look at the lucasfilm methods and during the postscreening qa johnson told the crowd he was inspired to agree to it due to his own childhood fandoms there was an amazing return of the jedi thing about the creature work on jabbas palace and that had a great impact on me he said and the doc on magnolia the paul thomas anderson film i love docs that really get you into the process rather than promoting the end result the director and the jedi probably wont be technically meaty enough to similarly inspire the next generation of blockbuster filmmakersit runs for roughly one hour and 45 minutes but the film jumps between many topics and though we get glimpses of life with the costuming stunt production design vfx and creature departments this new documentary has other stories in mind among them the scope of a production like this must be seen to believe120 sets 100plus days of filming but budgets that cant quite fit every single desired drone and unesco heritage site set location take rogue one and the force awakens put em together this is double in size says creature supervisor neal scanlan newcomers like johnson and bergman or kelly marie tran rose have entered into this hallowed and established universe with unorthodox ideas a casino in star wars for the franchises traditionalists and as the title may imply the dynamic between the new creator and the old star has its own heroes journey to progress through before opening night the documentary might have been better served by selecting the most compelling of those subplots editing down closer to the hour mark and maintaining a narrower but deeper focus ultimately it does the opposite still this new documentary does have merit beyond opening up new marketing and revenue opportunities for lucasfilm in particular somehow this film about the new era of star wars feels like a fitting sendoff for the series pioneers there arent many franchises around where the central characters and the actors behind them still participate beyond mere cameos some 40 years after debut but its yet another unique aspect that makes a star wars film a big ask of any director take hamill as evidence when i called i said ill do it the new trilogy and i have two requests the actor recalled during the qa i dont want a cameo and i want a real trilogy role even though harrison ford is obviously not involved the director and the jedi acts as a nice postscript farewell to many of the original star wars icons the film reveals that more than 100 individuals auditioned for the voice of c3po in the new trilogy for instance but none felt right and thus anthony daniels came out of retirement and while many of the vfx folks anticipated yoda would be done via cgi this goround the emotion necessary in that characters last jedi reunion with luke skywalker meant coaxing frank oz back to set the puppet itself may have been new but the ilm team even created this version by first acquiring the original wooden model molds and building from there kathleen kennedy appears on screen a handful of times too and though we never see him george lucas presence is certainly felt early on we see the beginning stages of script trials as johnson invites hamill and daisy ridley to read in a living room at pinewood studios later in that very sequence someone breaks into the room with a message for the new director some of the best parts of the director and the jedi come from johnson exploring the old star wars world as if he were merely a kid in a candyst err as if hes a kid on the set of a freakin star wars shoot when he meets oz johnson asks to try on the yoda puppet and lets out what we learn is his signature giggle of joy when he sees the new creatures neal scanlan and team bring to life johnson cant hide his enthusiasm either given that he grew up with some of these films its no wonder the director came prepared with as defined opinions on sea cow bellies as he does kylo rens scar makeup when youre a little kid the jedi and the myth of the clone wars and the mysticism of yodathat connects to something within you johnson told the sxsw audience that makes it scary coming into this but i cant imagine making a film without thatif you dont take the force the jedi and luke skywalker seriously then whats the next step in this perhaps johnsons reverence for the franchise comes across best in this documentarys most human scenes its perhaps no surprise to any longtime star wars fans that the most genuine onscreen emotion happens when carrie fisher and mark hamill get involved on the tension front hamills initially blunt frustration with the last jedis new direction for luke may be the only real conflict within the entire documentary my character always represented hope and optimism and here i am pessimistic and disillusioned and sort of demoralized hamill says i told him i fundamentally disagree with this concept and how you use this character but ill do everything in my power to fulfill your vision this character doesnt belong to me they just let me rent him out so no matter how it comes out if its wonderful its because of him if im horrible its also his fault the majority of the postshow qa stayed on the relationship between hamill and johnson given that the documentary leaves audiences wanting more of that dynamic the most recent films title literally comes from johnsons new luke skywalker direction after all and one of the best moments in this doc comes when the director reveals his title idea to hamill for the first time as carefully curated as youd expect this disneyapproved documentary to be carrie fisher both shares and elicits what seems like the docs few truly moving moments we see her interacting with ridley and laura dern younger actors approaching fisher with reverence both on and off screen and moments later when the first lady of this franchise is asked how johnson is fitting into the directors seat and handling the canon she doesnt hesitate to flash the personality fans have grown to adore hes an asshole she quips prepping the insightful compliment to come rian has a very specific vision but hes not like that when you first meet him he doesnt have a dominating effect he has a dominating vision the off camera mechanics behind the last jedis leialuke reunion are later explored speaking to that johnson vision that combines reverence with new energy it was the lone documentary moment where it felt like the entire audience silently caught themselves welling up the movie wasnt meant as a goodbye johnson notes but hopefully there are a lot of scenes that will give people scenes that will feel good to see for diehard fans of the star wars franchise the last jedi or johnsons work in particular the director and the jedi qualifies as mustsee you may not get all the process you want but youll leave with a sense of johnsons persona behind the camera and his particular approach to the unique challenge presented to him with the last jedi for everyone else youll probably enjoy the experience toojust know youll likely glance at your phone or second screen a few times the last jedi this is not but its more than that films bluray extras too the director and the jedi is set for wide release on june 27 naturally as a behindthescenes featurette on the last jedi video release no information on additional screenings is available at this time
Apr 29 2021,positive, fun as it was the force awakens was star wars by the book it replayed the plot of a new hope with enough tweaks and loveable new characters to come off as affectionate homage rather than big ol ripoff it was a safe but highly successful reintroduction to the galaxy the last jedi blasts the rule book to pieces sending the skywalker saga in unexpected directions not all its risks pay off but its biggest wins outdo anything in the previous film for fans there are many many moments that will leave you cheering or weeping possibly both at once after a featurelength tease jedi brings luke mark hamill to the fore rey daisy ridley is trying to cajole him into training her in the ways of the force but luke is resistant after his failure with kylo ren adam driver hamill slides back into his defining role like hes never been away angry funny and still with traces of the whiny farmboy he gets to shine in a way he never did when he was in han solos shadow elsewhere leia is leading the dwindling resistance which is rapidly being picked off by the first order as a goodbye to leia director rian johnson does the late carrie fisher proud shes wise quiet leader and occasional action hero one of her final scenes is the most emotional in the entire series its not a neat end to the character or the one deserved but a respectful farewell the one story strand that doesnt land is that with new character rose kelly marie tran a plucky engineer tran is terrific but shes stranded in a dreary sideplot with finn john boyega on a casino planet which has the stale whiff of the prequels the flatness of those scenes is not enough to derail an otherwise thrilling instalment rian johnson conjures astonishing space battles fills his script with genuinely excellent jokes and has deepened the characters significantly special mention to adam driver who has helped make kylo ren the series mvp with all the surprises here weve honestly no idea how this trilogy will conclude but the wait to find out is already too long
Feb 16 2021,positive, that line spouted in pained fashion by luke skywalker stood out in the intriguing trailer for star wars the last jedi it felt like more than a suggestion from disney aka lucasfilm aka director rian johnson that the second film in the newest star wars trilogy would not follow a familiar template as many have accused its predecessor the force awakens of doing lukes words would turn out to bear fruit in a film which feels both like the box office shattering ultimate expression of hollywood blockbuster it no doubt will be and at the same time something wilfully subversive johnson started with small beginnings with a precise and almost poetic lowbudget modern noir and you can still feel the pull of a director who wants to do things his way doing things your way as a creative force on a series like star wars is no mean feat despite how marvel have dominated the cinematic landscape in the last decade star wars has no equal in terms of scope scale and fan anticipation when disney bought the franchise from george lucas in 2012 with the intention of relaunching the saga it was the biggest news in filmmaking for many years considering it was originally just three space fantasy movies and subsequently three maligned and illjudged prequels from lucas the fact star wars as an entity has never left the public imagination or consciousness speaks to its power not everyone loves it but those who do understand star wars has a special alchemy no other franchise can boast the last jedi is rian johnson asserting himself in striking fashion with a script and story which determine to rip up the star wars rule book and potentially set the franchise in a bold new direction while still honouring what came before the fact producer kathleen kennedy and those at lucasfilm loved johnsons take so much that he has now been gifted his own unique star wars trilogy to devisenot just film trilogyshows they too are keen for star wars to spread its wings and embrace the future  the last jedi doesnt entirely detach from the mythological themes and fantasy tropes lucas movies and indeed the force awakens played with  but it feels like the start of a brave new world star wars at its heart has always been a metaphysical philosophical story about contrasting balancing forces waging within the human soul represented by the iconic idea of the force  its why the universe may be filled with strange alien lifeforms and reliable droids but the spiritual conflict has always been with characters who look and sound very human despite star wars taking place long long ago in a galaxy far far away george lucas originally rooted this battle in judeochristian terminology with characters such as luke discussing villainous father darth vader in terms such as there is still good in him come the 2000s and the prequels lucas was attempting to convert the metaphysics into a level of magic science with terms such as midichlorians and the like come the force awakens when an older leia is discussing her wayward son kylo ren aka ben solo her description from the pen of jj abrams and lawrence kasdan is there is still light in him good and evil become light and dark the old testament becomes a far more philosophical buddhist concept of duality and spiritual dichotomy star wars approach therefore to the underpinning religious constructs inside its world and mythology have evolved over the last forty years changing to edge away from a harder line delineation of philosophical ideals to a depiction of the force more in line with far eastern ideas of body and soul this feels important to the last jedi because johnson truly attempts to explore just what the force means where lucas felt more inclined to try and explain what it is in his prequels johnsons message very much seems to indicate the force is whatever you want it to be and crucially its for whoever you want it to be this feels at odds with lucas central messages within his original trilogy and especially the prequels whereby anakins skywalkers luciferlike fall from the heavenly jedi chorus was framed in concepts of destiny as if his transformation into vader had long been preordained the force whether good or evil or light or dark was for a chosen few the biggest thing johnson does is call bullshit on that higher order idea  star wars is done playing with prophecy johnson actualises this through rey our erstwhile female protagonist she grated a touch in the force awakens an earnest tomboy stray who did little except run around like a headless chicken and emote quite expressively daisy ridley isnt exactly an awardwinning player in the making but johnsons script gives her more heft by grounding her on ahchto island and developing the two key relationships central to her in the film  her dynamic with kylo and her dynamic with luke what johnson does and one wonders if this was a change in direction from abrams vision is take away the very idea rey is special and has a destiny by pulling the ultimate flanker her parents set up as mysterious abandoners in the previous film were nobody when we all expected them to be somebody heres the rub and the central key to the last jedi  you dont have to be anyone in order to be someone it doesnt matter if reys parents werent jedi or sith or gifted of some powerful history or destiny kylo throws this back in her face when he lands the revelation on her about her family which she already deep down knew suggesting youre not part of this story johnson almost reaches out here from behind the lens and shouts  it doesnt matter lucas original tale was all about a special gifted destined family with a royal entitled lineage who provided balance to the force both light and dark but rey breaks that cycle she is just a girl from a nowhere planet and nowhere parents who happens to be one with the force star wars cant be the same after this evolution having the force be accessible and open free of destiny or royalty or even the jedi order opens up a mountain of possibilities this is what luke comes to understand through a character arc which carefully avoids him becoming obiwan kenobi which he so obviously could have been r2d2 showing him the original help me obiwan hologram of leia from a new hope as he sits inside the millennium falcon underscores this very point  luke may be old may rock a beard may have gone into hiding in a cave after watching the jedi almost destroyed around him but he isnt guarding or protecting anyone waiting for the new saviour to emerge luke begins this film fundamentally convinced there is no hope lukes nihilism born out of ben solos fall to the dark side and the destruction of lukes attempt to recreate the jedi order is taken further by johnson than you suspect abrams and definitely lucas ever would have dreamed johnsons open egalitarian world where the force could be in anyone is a world where characters are encouraged to reject history and reject myth many fans had heard luke was seeking a jedi temple and almost everyone expected the last jedi to see luke uncover jedi secrets or arcane knowledge that would help save the day  almost nobody would have expected luke with the help of yoda no less to burn that knowledge and those secrets to the ground and extinguish the jedi of the past doing this was perhaps the films bravest choice bear in mind just how much the jedi religion and idea has become an iconic piece of pop culture and to an extent has grown beyond star wars itself people dont dress up as random sith lords but they do dress up as jedi knights in the uk on a religious census jedi was written by so many people as their denomination that the government had to officially recognise it passing the required 100000 signatures were talking about a fictional code which if not practiced by film fans and children the world over is certainly revered and honoured by millions the word jedi would be known to almost everyone in western society irrespective of whether they know star wars well or not to fundamentally change the paradigm of how the jedi work is a striking move luke spells this out when lecturing rey in why the jedi need to die reminding her it was their hubris and arrogance which allowed darth sidious to turn the republic into an empire and subsequently see the extermination of much of the jedi order while this is luke to a sizeable degree abrogating sidious and vader of responsibility in the choices they made and it all does come down to choice his point is given context and clarity by yoda the jedi doesnt have to exist in the form it did for millennia in order to survive much like the star wars franchise itself the jedi can themselves evolve in purpose and form and this plays greatly into johnsons other major level of commentary sociological class in the star wars universe a tonally jarring sequence it may be and perhaps an indication of one of johnsons weaknesses as a filmmaker his own looper has the same problem but finn and roses sojourn to the canto bight casino and races planet reveals the major schism and dichotomy which has always existed in the star wars universe but johnson writs large  the lower and upper classes which make up the galactic framework rose seems like a needless additional character but her purpose is abject her essential skills are the final expression of a crucial part of the resistance and fight against tyranny despite her coming from nothing much like rey she was one of the servants and slaves who feed the rich gamblers and dilettantes which fill canto bight people who became rich off the first orders rise to power this too has to be a pointed level of allegory in johnsons writing which is interesting as star wars doesnt often tend to stray too heavily into an allegorical framework of storytelling much as lucas apparently read the original 1977 movie as an indictment against vietnam with the united states as the evil empire the commentary here is clear  the 1 of super wealthy are serving a dark fascist tyrannical force who want to be the ultimate boot in the face of the little people by giving the force back to this underclass the rebellion of the original trilogy and the resistance of the sequel trilogy are framed in a new context the revolution johnsons final shot of a young impoverished child looking up at the stars wearing a resistance sigil and holding his broom like a lightsaber after hearing stories about luke and the jedi sells it the force is with everyone and woe betide a fascist dictatorship who underestimate them naturally you can apply the iconography and visual style of the first order with the nazi party abrams made this very clear in the force awakens but is johnson making quite pointed parallels to the modern republican government and the increasingly fascist direction of donald trumps presidency possibly not pointedly but the inference is certainly there the fact those young children are telling stories too is crucial because it reframes the myth and legend johnsons script is keen to snuff out or at least redefine without the historical names and touchstones characters in the star wars universe and fans outside of it are used to johnson clearly sees legends in a different way to abrams the latter feels theyre important and venerates them  you only have to look at reys excitement when she first meets han solo in the force awakens and the hushed tones of myth when luke is referred to this is exactly how we the audience consider these characters and the force awakens indulged our euphoria at being in their presence once more the first thing luke does when we meet him in the last jedi is disdainfully toss away the lightsaber which itself became legend  the lightsaber that fought vader which cut off lukes hand in the empire strikes back to all of us its a symbol it was almost the mcguffin of the force awakens johnson tosses it away like its nothing like its a falsehood legends are earned not simply made and set in stone kylo ren certainly comes to understand this and quite early on its telling how johnson has him destroy the very mask he created to try and emulate his grandfather vader that was a visual piece of original series iconography in the force awakens abrams honouring the legend of vader but when supreme leader snoke mocks him for wearing it kylo destroys it and never wears a mask again his central inner conflict across the last jedi is no longer about trying to be vader its deciding where his destiny lies kylo believes himself part of the skywalker path he mocks rey for not being part of but hes choosing to repeat the cycle of the original trilogy he chooses not to blow up leia or kill snoke instead of rey that choice wasnt the same for vader when a very similar situation played out in return of the jedi the emperor actively wanted luke to kill his father to complete his training in no small part because part of him undoubtedly knew vader could be more powerful than even him snoke doesnt consider kylo in the same terms he thinks him weak and feeble for much of this and doesnt even countenance the possibility he could be bested johnson sets up an episode ix which explores the concept return of the jedi never could  what if vader had chosen to kill his master and become emperor instead of dying regretting his dark path kylo actively chooses this path even if he doesnt choose the direction indeed kylo is as keen to redefine everything as luke is remember how he asks rey to join him but not in the same way vader asks luke to join him in empire vader wanted to continue the empire wanted to reaffirm the status quo as a family hereditary honoured royal destiny but kylo wants to let it all burn  not just the jedi but the order he wants rey to join him and start again redefine what the dark side could mean johnson doesnt even use the words dark side across his script another rejection of the previous terminology and tropes which define the star wars universe sides arent as clearly defined in the last jedi there is room for manoeuvre kylo almost becomes the new supreme leader by sheer happenstance once he puts general hux in his place story therefore is key to the last jedi and how it inverts what we expect from star wars indeed theres a clear level of selfmockery going on with quite how star wars tells its narrative how johnson plays hux as a fascist buffoon for comedy is telling from poe damerons early joke about not being able to connect and a wonderful moment when hux shouts an order again that kylo has just given  theres a wonderful glance by kylo as if to say i just said that what are you doing this subverts the very earnest way admirals and commanders often with cut glass british accents would repeat and deliver orders in the original trilogy often thanks to lucas quite ripe dialogue johnson seems to understand the silliness inherent in star wars while honouring and revelling in everything about it the last jedi could well end up being the most polarising star wars film ever made its a touch too long has tonal problems feels like it has two distinct endings rather than just one and it lacks the sheer joie de vivre of the force awakens but intentionally so its the middle part of a story where the heroes take a severe beating at the hands of a seemingly unstoppable undefeatable force to an even greater degree than they do in the empire strikes back this is a resistance taken to the absolute brink of destruction and saved only by the power of the force let loose from the restraints of the jedi there are plenty of moments of levity nods and winks to previous films and lots of loveable droids and cuddly alien creatures hello porgs but the last jedi by default has to be a story where victory and resolution is far from the characters grasp where it will divide opinion is just how it approaches the star wars universe attempting to redefine and reconstitute some of the key central concepts which have made the franchise and the mythology ingrained within such a revered success for forty years rian johnsons film will potentially reward repeat viewing in a way certainly the force awakens doesnt and the last jedi leaves a returning jj abrams with some oddly big shoes to fill because his successor has changed the very manner in which the star wars universe considers itself 
Jan 27 2021,positive, cleveland ohio  in the runup to this weeks mammoth release of star wars the last jedi director rian johnson and company have been selling fans an idea that the latest film in the saga is unexpected unpredictable and unlike any other episode that came before it the last jedi is at once a thrilling space adventure and an emotional roller coaster of a film with just the right amount of nostalgia thrown in its simultaneously dark and funny with more twists and turns than a ride aboard the millennium falcon clocking in at two and a half hours the last jedi is a dense film full of characters scattered across the galaxy and put through the wringer theres a lot to get to the action begins with the evil first order in pursuit of the freedomfighting depleted resistence but the film really gets off the ground when the story shifts to the island planet ahchto and the moment where star wars the force awakens left off fans have been waiting for two years to see what luke skywalker mark hamill does when rey daisy ridley a girl strong with the force but a mystery to him presents him with his old lightsaber this clearly isnt the same luke we last saw in 1983s return of the jedi the confident wise legendary hero of the rebellion is gone lost and replaced by a broken shell of the man he once was a failure in his own eyes for not stopping his nephew kylo ren adam driver from turning to the dark side get over the fact that yep thats mark hamill up on the screen as luke skywalker once again and youll find a skilled actor channeling his inner shakespeare in a performance that is tortured and inspired hes a relunctant yoda to reys aspiring jedi an experiment that doesnt go all that well leave it to an old friend no spoilers here to set him straight if skywalker is at the emotional center of the film rey and kylo ren serve to deliver its underlying message of letting go of the past in order to find yourself the two have developed a connection since we saw them last she calls him ben and helps him deal with the death of his father han solo he knows stuff about her parents is their bond strong enough for one of them to turn that is answered rather compellingly in a jawdropping sequence highlighted by one of the coolest lightsaber fights youve ever seen indeed this is not going to go the way you think in their scenes together ridley and driver fully inhabit their characters who refreshingly arent the classic archetypes of good and evil were used to seeing ridleys rey is strong compassionate determined optimistic and yet temptable drivers kylo ren is as complex as he is conflicted that ever elusive villain with nuance you just might find yourself rooting for his performance is that good thats not to say it all works while finn john boyega and poe dameron oscar isaac are given plenty to do their stories dont really go anywhere lingering questions about the evil snoke andy serikis are left unanswered in her final appeance as leia carrie fisher is largely kept on the sidelines and some fans might even find one of her early scenes to be frankly ridiculous if domhnall gleesons performance as general hux was any hammier you could serve it at thanksgving the films new additions namely kelly marie tran laura dern and benicio del toro carve out their places in the galaxy far far away just fine the standout is tran whose plucky mechanic rose steals every scene shes in among the nonhumans you might cringe at the first sight of a porg that is until chewbacca tries to eat one and then youll fall in love with the furry little creatures bb8 is so cute and resourceful here the round mound of the rebellion might as well be an ewok threepio is well threepio r2d2 gets a moment to shine for old times sake by contrast the films final showdown is undecidedly unrestrained one that forces you in the famous words of darth vader to search your feelings once again the ragtag group of rebels finds itself facing incredible odds against the heavily armed forces of evil their battle is as exhilarating and epic as anything weve seen in a star wars movie but as it tends to happen in these films the last jedi comes down to a lightsaber duel but trust you havent seen one like this before as johnson delivers the goods with an ending that is surprising satisfying and even hopeful one that is sure to make even the most stoic

Dec 5 2020,positive, upreme leader snoke andy serkis and his first order minions commanded by general hux domhnall gleeson continue to take military control over more and more planets their only real opposition is the resistance led by general leia organa carrie fisher who faces dwindling numbers of soldiers and ships as well as nonstop confrontations against an enemy of vastly superior strength as huxs fleet steadily closes in on its prey resistance heroes finn john boyega and poe dameron oscar isaac along with newcomer rose tico kelly marie tran devise a precarious plot to evade their first order pursuers meanwhile rey daisy ridley a strongwilled orphan powerful in the force locates longmissing jedi master luke skywalker mark hamill hoping to persuade him to both train her and aid in the resistances plight but after his previous failure with kylo ren adam driver a former student who turned to the dark side the reclusive tutor becomes insistent on not repeating his mistakes with rey when the rebellious young girl discovers an unnerving connection to the dark jedi she determines to face ren once again even if it means surrendering to snoke himself the last jedi begins like the empire strikes back before quickly turning into return of the jedi its surely purposeful for this latest chapter to pay homage to its predecessors but theres a limit to the nods which shouldnt be surpassed for fear that it succumbs to the main criticism of the force awakens that its essentially a remake but writerdirector rian johnson doesnt seem too concerned in order to fuel the nostalgia factor to an extreme degree the film opts to recreate many familiar storylines and scenarios from the original trilogy forgetting that the world is so expansive that it wouldnt take much to concoct something entirely new instead a disgruntled luke exists in seclusion on his own equivalent to dagobah and must train a fresh apprentice as if to become a less mischievous version of yoda a rebel base is evacuated as enemy ships prepare to wipe it out a sequence that boasts substantial comedy which feels unnatural elephantshaped tanks slowly saunter across a bleached battlefield and yet another iteration of mos eisleys tavern of decadence furnishes strange creatures and odder aliens the first twothirds of the last jedi focuses heavily on old routines trivial side missions are derived spontaneously to give certain sets of characters extra adventures  and to draw out an already long running time in fact one of the major components of the film is a slowspeed chase which is so lengthy that it allows numerous other ministories to play out to their conclusions including a hunt for a codebreaker preparations for abandoning the fleet and reys jedi training  all before a dreadnaught warship finally catches up to the cruiser it was pursuing much of this picture involves space battles which while exciting in the moment has very little lasting power they also contribute to an overwhelming number of closecalls  ones designed to drag battles out to the last second where tensions can build with ample manipulation when plot lines choose to follow this course they generate a sense of blind luck most of the rebels are unable to accomplish their tasks perhaps due to poor planning or trusting in the wrong allies but they rarely perish in logical ways martyrdom tends to save them all even when luck falters theres still conflict in him numerous lines are delivered with strained sincerity especially as a subplot to find the remaining strands of good left in ben solo  and to turn him to the light side  begins to resemble return of the jedi a bit too much adding to that comparison is snoke an elderly robed wrinkled lightningspewing inexplicably evil entity who exactly is he supposed to be zero answers were given in the force awakens and this followup remains comparably tightlipped  pointlessly his involvement and storyline are indicative of too many creative visions continually altering or revising key concepts but despite the vagaries and vagueness and repetition the visuals are stunning new spaceship designs are appropriately menacing special royal guards in shiny red armor wield lightsaberlike weaponry and a mining facility sits on crimson dirt blanketed by glowing white salt countless other sequences brimming with explosions and action and computeranimated monstrosities will remind viewers that the star wars franchise has few limitations when it comes to visual effects at the end of it all the last jedi is still a middle chapter which means that it doesnt tell a complete story and leaves many questions unanswered but a few major surprises and some jawdropping showdowns are thoroughly entertaining  especially for audiences who arent too caught up in the series insistence on revisiting so many recognizable themes and ideas designed by mike massie   20062024 gone with the twins  all movie related images  their respective owners

Sep 24 2020,positive, it wasnt anything but star wars there wasnt any such thing as a new hope in my 12yearold mind i wasnt entertaining any notion that this amazing universe unfolding before my eyes would have sequels or become a yearslong saga  i was a 12yearold boy an outcast in virtually every area of my life i was a young boy with a disability and star wars in some weird way gave me a place where i felt like i belonged  i loved everything about star wars i loved the heart and soul of these relationships between princess leia luke skywalker han solo r2d2 c3po darth vader and all the others i loved the adventure i loved the humor heck i was only 12yearsold but i even loved the incredibly chaste romance  the same was true maybe even more true for the empire strikes back which has long been my favorite amongst the star wars films though im certainly far from alone in that opinion while what we now call a new hope started it all the empire strikes back is the film that truly made me fall in love with this universe and these characters and their stories after the empire strikes back these star wars films became more than just a couple hours of escape to me  they became in ways im not even sure i can explain a way of life  i thought about all of these things as i sat back in my seat and became enveloped in the worlds manifested in rian johnsons latest of the star wars entries the last jedi  while the force awakens brought the series back from the brink of prequel devastation the last jedi brings back the heart and soul of star wars in ways id feared impossible and in ways that took me back to those days when i was an absolutely enthralled 12yearold staring up at the movie screen imagining myself immersed in these remarkable worlds  this is not to say that star wars episode viii  the last jedi is a flawless film its not a flawless film but if not flawless its a near cinematic masterpiece that should have id dare say will have audiences falling in love all over again with star wars and these new adventures and adventurers and the ways in which rian johnson has masterfully incorporated faithfulness to the films legacy with a unique vision that is woven into the fabric of the star wars universe to near perfection  the challenge and im trying desperately here is to share my immense joy with the film without providing spoilers along the way because indeed there isnt a scene that unfolds here that i wish to give away i want you to experience it for yourself  the last jedi offers something for everyone in its increasingly complex and shaded portrayals of rey daisy ridley and finn john boyega its reverence for luke mark hamill its respectful yet somewhat slight embrace of the now deceased carrie fisher as leia or simply the ways in which johnson has found to create action sequences that are familiar yet fresh tasked with finding life within this middle film within a trilogy johnson has done more than bridge two bookends he has created an adventure that ripples throughout the universe while adding in a few of his own flourishing touches  there are certain story threads of the last jedi especially those connected to how the force awakens unfolded and ended that are simply brilliant in the ways in which they add layers to the existing universe it is much to his credit that johnson has found ways to both honor that connectivity while adding layers to it and characters that are no longer simply blackand white but several shades of gray  despite having achieved near superstardom in star wars theres a reason that mark hamills film career never came close to achieving the heights of fisher or ford the truth is he was always the weaker actor a charming kid who never stopped playing a charming kid until he was finally too old to play a charming kid its damn near miraculous what johnson has pulled out of hamill here a melancholy and soulful performance that emotionally resonates and feels like it belongs here he has attained the status of legend here yet its a status he doesnt want from a life hes long since left behind how this all plays out between he and rey is beautiful to behold on this tiny island where he has secluded himself amidst the lively inspired creatures weve come to know and love from the star wars universe  of course kylo ren adam driver is back hes scarred now a physical memory left over from his epic the force awakens battle with rey and hes still the same ragingly immature young man who is both a conflicted villain and a dastardly one who feels and acts even more evil here paired up with general hux domhnall gleeson it feels inevitable that his evil will grow and that somehow he and rey will deal with one another again and again  there are others of course poe oscar isaac is relentless in his efforts to go facetoface with his enemies while newcomer laura dern shines as viceadmiral amilyn holdo finn finds himself teamed up with rose a rebel engineer played expertly by kelly marie tran as the two embark on a codebreaking mission that looks familiar yet has been designed impeccably  benicio del toro is here as well in a relatively brief appearance and the film features many of the others familiar within the star wars universe and more than a few pleasant surprises along the way  at 152 minutes the last jedi goes on for a bit too long and tries to tell us too many stories but these truly are minor quibbles for a film that is relentlessly captivating magnificently produced and utterly immersive from beginning to end johnson has not only mastered abrams return to technical precision but hes also embraced the heart the humor the depth and the hope that we all felt when all of this began in 1977  star wars episode viii  the last jedi may not be a flawless film but its amazingly close to everything that i wanted it to be with strong layered and more authentic performances from its ensemble cast and a universe that will make you feel like its a place where you belong the last jedi becomes one of the most satisfying star wars films to date perhaps second only to the empire strikes back and a film that will make you want to watch it again and again and again 
Aug 26 2020,positive, it may not be the greatest star wars film ever  that mantle still resides with the empire strikes back and naturally it will take time preferably a second watch to see how this film will rank overall  however star wars the last jedi might be the most significant in the franchises history the last major release of the year and the last jedi is a milestone release for a few reasons  the most obvious of course is that it follows on from the highly enjoyable the force awakens  director rian johnson receives that challenging baton to pick up the where the story left off  but in the larger context 2017 has brought back the art in films where directors have used the medium to deliver unconventional films that have gone against audience expectations and taken us out of our comfort zone  weve seen it in logan dunkirk blade runner 2049 war for the planet of the apes baby driver wonder woman get out and detroit the last jedi naturally belongs on that list  to paraphrase obi wan in a new hope  this was not the star wars film you was looking for the last jedi is far from perfect  no film is  does the runtime feel a little excessive  yes  the ending felt a little tact on when it already had a natural resolve and could have been saved for the next film  could the pacing been a bit better  yes  are there a few ott moments which are cheesy  yes  is it clunky at times  yes  could some elements of the story been handled better to give it some tonal consistency  absolutely for all the love i have for the force awakens its hard not to see the obvious connections to a new hope  that is not a criticism but a common observation  as mentioned in my review the force awakens uses a new hope as a guidance to shape the new trilogy  it is specifically designed and constructed to introduce the next generation of strong characters in rey daisy ridley finn john boyega kylo adam driver and poe oscar isaac  but the force awakens is steeped in heavy nostalgia reminding the audience why they fell in love with the franchise as if we magically became children again  seeing familiar things like the millennium falcon the droids and all the familiar faces from that universe are the equivalent of buying and listening to a greatest hits compilation  again not a criticism but it helps build a context for the last jedi because it is the stonewall opposite of that the dangerous thing about nostalgia is that it can eventually become predictable and safe because of the lack of engaging challenges or fresh new stories for its audience  its the surreal sense of deja vu and like comfort food it relies on the same clichés and tropes to tell a story that remains within that unadventurous status quo  rogue one largely suffered in that respect  it sadly doesnt hold up after repeated viewings because of the high level of distracting fan service and not enough character development to flesh out a real and genuine purpose for the rebels to fight against the empire  the film was clunky saved only by the incredible battle on scarif  weve already seen in other franchises such as alien pirates of the caribbean and terminator on how tired that repetitive formula can be for franchises to have a chance at survival they eventually need to evolve  otherwise they stagnate or in the worse case scenario die as a consequence however rough around the edges this film was and possibly could have done with another written draft if the force awakens showcased that original nostalgic innocence where it was allowed to be fun and energetic then the last jedi is arguably the most layered adult and grown up star wars film ever made that is one of the most surprising elements  star wars is meant to be a rapturous feeling of childhood excitement fistpumping hype and expectation but the last jedi delivers something unexpected  this is a film that took a risk with the star wars mythology by challenging those sacred and conceived notions  as controversial and upsetting this may sound for diehard fans but the last jedi doesnt deliver on fan pleasing moments revelations or cliffhangers both in the cinematic fashion or literal fashion with luke in the force awakens just to satisfy an audience  this is a film that was bold enough to make a challenging statement to propel the franchise into uncharted territory where you have no idea what is going to happen next given the amount of fan theories and indepth discussions that developed in between the new films its a nice feeling to be suddenly kept on your toes and freed from the compartmentalized beliefs  because ultimately that was the danger with episode 8 long before the famous a long time ago in a galaxy far far away faded onscreen  maintain the status quo and accusations of a lack of originality would have been fierce  we would have been back to square one in questioning the repetitive direction  but from a cinematic experience who would want to go to a cinema and already know the outcome of the film at the heart of it the last jedi is more of a character driven movie which again is another welcomed surprise  similar to what twin peaks the return did the more the last jedi is analysed the more it serves as a brilliant running commentary about the legacy of franchises and how we interact with them  were all guilty of it  theres always an element of heroworship where characters become a source of inspiration and motivation  we put them on a higher plane where we can look up and believe  it also creates a celebrity head canon and culture defined by our own fantastical expectations  yet similar to denis villeneuves blade runner 2049 the last jedi cleverly dissects the idea of the hero complex by subverting the traditional story construct were use to  it embraces a nuance that is explored not as simplistically as good versus evil but something far more complex blurred and inbetween  what writer and director rian johnson achieves are characters which are more human grounded and real its not done in a disrespectful way  the classic and faithful homages are present and acknowledged  there are emotional scenes which recognise the symbolic connection of the journey started forty years ago  but the last jedi also rips up the rule book on what was done before to journey into the beyond  that aspect of the last jedi was the most liberating how often do you see a star wars film where the rebels are really up against it and on its last knees  suddenly you slowly find yourself watching a bleak situation and the opening battle is one of the best moments in the film  its not to say that this aspect wasnt explored before in previous films but the last jedi gave us something more visually indepth instead of the 2d characterisations that rogue one or the prequel trilogy suffered from at times  its the exploration of the human struggle the sacrifices and the highly charged conflicts that rose out of those battles  as the tide kept on turning the weaponry for the fight back becomes limited as if the first order are apple to the rebels windows 95  our heroes are under severe pressure and theres a consequence to these actions  thats what kept the film interesting and emotionally dramatic  suddenly you felt an endearing care for characters because of their own personal story arc  like a crossgeneration divide between the old and the new everybody eventually learns and develops from their actions to become better leaders that speaks true of rey and kylo ren  their parallel story involves abandonment and trying to find a belonging in this vast universe  in a seminal way theyre both looking for acceptance from their surrogate fathers which naturally plays along with the standardise thinking of the light and the dark side  but in the particular case of kylo arguably one of the best wellrounded villains created for the new trilogy his desperate emulation to be darth vader 20 is ridiculed as a childish exercise by supreme leader snoke andy serkis  the emotional conflict that resides between the two characters is their ultimate desire to live up to their influential legends and the last jedi becomes the realisation that they are stronger than what they think they expect of themselves  theres a beautiful line which sums up that evolving trajectory  we are what they grow beyond but its also how the film deals with the old guard  we see general leia the late great carrie fisher vulnerable and scared of the consequences as she counts up the losses  luke skywalker a brilliant performance by mark hamill is not the cleancut hero you thought he was  hes tired old frustrated and a recluse  whilst that may split the opinion of the fan base the positive argument that is established makes him more human  time has become a factor and the galaxy has changed allowing these characters to grow  we get to see them in a new light faults and all  it may go against reason but it also allows characters to escape that bubble and redefine who they are on a path to a peaceful redemption  its different but it is a positive different but the best of that improved characterisation is how it moves away from a singular you are our only hope perspective to a collective ideology  again nothing new in the star wars world but its always pined its hopes on characters bringing balance to the force  the chosen one  yet the turmoil has previously ended the same way with the balance ushering in a fascist totalitarian and autocratic power  nobody does the battle alone like a god like saviour and its how johnson found that aspect of the story to tell a distinction between the past and its upcoming future rian johnson excels in showcasing a visual poetry  jj abrams started this trend in the force awakens freeing the camera from the static nature from the original to a barrelrolling effect making us feel were right in the thick of the battles  but for the last jedi the visual storyline is all about the emotional impact directly connected with the choices made by characters  johnson intentionally slows down the action and cuts the sound as if there was a vacuum in space and it removed all the air  on hindsight it may have contributed to the slow pacing of the film but to see this subtle effect is new for the franchise reinforcing that mood of action equals consequence  on the planet crait the blood in the sand effect acts as a psychological reaffirmation of war and its sacrificial nature without showing actual blood onscreen  every soldier is like a dead person walking towards an impending doom  the visuals also extends to the production sets which are beautiful in particular snokes red room and his guards through the visuals director rian johnson finds the time to explore the political aspect of the last jedi  star wars has always been political with arguably the prequel trilogy closely mirroring todays world of rightwing nationalism rising up through a democratic society  but in the last jedi the first order is made fun of and domhnall gleeson as general hux comes through as the best of how seriously he believes in the first order and how others mock him  again it contributes to the pacing of the film but introducing canto bight also highlights the dividing difference between the wealthy rich and the slave poor and the blurred lines that has a direct relevance with the world today the star wars universe is vast with so many potential stories to tell  the last jedi met my expectations because it was an attempt for the franchise to do something different that most blockbuster films struggle with  it had the audacity in its attempt to break the mould and break out of a repeating cycle that had become far too familiar and predictable  this is not the empire strikes back in the franchise but a progressive move forward to shape its own new legend and that recognition and understanding will take time  its hard to see what path star wars will take knowing that this is the second film in the saga  but it will be interesting to see how jj abrams will complete shape and refine those changes for the untitled episode 9 it will be during this time when people will look back on the last jedi not with a petition loving hatred but with an appreciation for the risk taken in the first place  that should be congratulated regardless excellent review you have captured it perfectly i thought this was an exciting and risky film and i commend disney for being gutsy enough to break away from the expected narrative and risk angering fans i too believe that when some currently angry fans look back especially after ix theyll like this film more than they do now it has a few flaws although these bothered me less on second viewing but it is a powerful film that really moves the characters forward portraying luke as a broken man opened the door for mark hamill to give us a more nuanced performance and i loved that this movie did not go the way i thought it would my greatest fear is that disney will overrespond to the backlash and create a safer film for episode ix i really dont want that i want them to keep pushing the star wars universe in new directions financially was never going to be a problem with disney and the star wars franchise but the fan backlash can still have an impact on episode 9 and the other potential risks they may want to do with the franchise  i dont think it will happen but anything is possible
Jul 23 2020,negative,in terms of directing the last jedi shines in terms of storytelling it meshes together a lot of elements that have so much potential but that potential is left untapped
Jul 17 2020,positive, ever since a new hope was released in 1977 every star wars film followed the same basic formula operatic space battles between good and evil with a central character being pulled in both directions whose final choice could decide the fate of all from the original trilogy to the prequel trilogy and now with this latest iteration the different variations havent moved all that far away from the basic outline why is that because the outline works this is a proven equation with generations of fans and financial profits as evidence if it aint broke dont fix it right thats the feeling i get when i watched star wars the last jedi 2017 on the surface this is a slickly made production helmed by writerdirector rian johnson everything that youve come to expect from the franchise is here bridging the past with the present much better than the last entry the force awakens 2015 where the force awakens relied heavily on fan service and nostalgia as a crouch almost to detrimental ends the last jedi attempts to use the past merely as a steppingstone to build its own identity even the inclusion of mainstays luke mark hamill and leia the late carrie fisher isnt for simple cameos  they play relevant factors into the narrative but lets be honest with ourselves just as the marvel cinematic universe or the bond series has to maintain a certain brand type so does the star wars universe a new hope and perhaps more so with the empire strikes back 1980 was revolutionary in blockbuster storytelling the force awakens and rogue one a star wars story 2016 felt like they needed to stick to the script at the very least johnson was able to make the last jedi feel as much of a rian johnson film as well as a star wars film this is much looser than past entries taking twists and turns that may or may not work for audiences but the fact that it took those risks is worth admiration the plot is split into three different sections taking place almost immediately after the events of the force awakens poe dameron oscar isaac along with general leia lead the small remaining fleet of resistance fighters as they try to escape the first order headed by kylo ren adam driver and supreme leader snoke andy serkis while thats happening finn john boyega  whose development from the last film i will not get into  teams up with new comer rose kelly marie tran  in an attempt to help the resistance escape and finally rey daisy ridley spends the majority of her time on an isolated planet with luke begging for his tutelage and to help the resistances cause while rey has been set up to be the key figure of this current storyline kylo ren has emerged to be the most interesting character just as luke was torn between the light and the dark side kylo ren also has conflicting emotions on where his morality stands he sits right on the fence where his admiration of darth vader and the power of the first order contrast with the goodness in him calling out he and luke share similar emotional arcs  where luke was on the side of good but was tempted by evil kylo ren initially starts off in darkness and is tempted by the light the choices he makes often appear hypocritical but i dont necessarily see that as a detriment but more as the actions of a person who is at war with himself i dont know if kylo ren being the most fully realized character so far is a good thing given that rey is thought to be the central character of this trilogy an issue is that her back story was first shrouded in mystery with one of the biggest question marks being who her parents are the fact that we havent learned much of her  at least up to this film  makes it a little more difficult to connect to her than to kylo ren sure she wants to find meaning to her life and her place in the universe but those are very broad motivations take the interactions she has with luke where rey goes there to learn and find purpose its luke who comes out of it as the more developed character this isnt just because luke has been around longer he has a concrete arc here that takes him from one place to another psychologically its perhaps hamills strongest performance in the franchise  instead of a wideeyed kid hes become a cynical old man whod rather spend his days as a hermit than a hero compare that to rey who has not been given enough material for us yet to gravitate toward her in terms of production can you expect anything less from a franchise like this the space battles individual fight scenes and special effects all work incredible well the sound design specifically works to amplify key moments during a scene when the sound completely cuts out the deafening silence made what we see on screen all the more impactful another highlighted aspect is how spacecraft jump into and out of light speed this isnt used just for window dressing there is a specific reason for it and the payoff turns out to be one of the major high points we get i mentioned earlier that the looseness of the narrative allowed johnson and his team to take the story in directions we may not be anticipating on the flip side it also makes the structure a bit messier other than kylo ren luke and maybe poe and leia the rest of the characters and story beats operate to varied success unfortunately finns storyline dragged everything down taking an upbeat pace and tossing it into the mud where he goes and what he does felt irrelevant and the dynamic he shares with rose was more of an awkward plot mechanic than a natural progression the character of snoke is also a missed opportunity just like rey we have a character that is intriguing on the outside but whom we learn nothing about what snoke does and where he ends up could leave audiences disappointed the last jedi is like that updated toy or gadget that you get for christmas it has all of the stuff that you liked in the older versions some new tricks thrown in to keep you satisfied and just enough features left out to keep you eager for the next one while those who desire to see something entirely new and different may walk away wishing for more those that are bought in will embrace this with open arms
Jul 17 2020,positive, a long time ago in a galaxy far far away seeing those words still brings a chill whether on a tv or in this golden new age up on the silver screen once again with the original star wars being the first film i ever remember seeing in a theater at the impressionable age of three this franchise has been a major part of my entire life seeing that sentence with its extradotted ellipsis in front of the last jedi brings equal parts overwhelming nostalgia and nervous anticipation at whats to come general leia organas carrie fisher resistance has been forced to evacuate their base and they incur a number of casualties in the initial attack by the first order fleet poe dameron oscar isaac and finn john boyega along with a new friend rose tico kelly marie tran have devised a plan to disable the main first order ship because of poes rash decision making their standing in the eyes of the resistance leadership has diminished so they must execute their plan in secret meanwhile rey daisy ridley has found luke skywalker mark hamill what began as a mission to convince luke to join the fight soon becomes a journey of selfdiscovery for both rey must figure out what this power is that she feels inside her and why it keeps connecting her mind with kylo rens adam driver luke must try to reconcile his feelings about the history of the jedi order and his own place in that story all while attempting to show this girl what it means to be connected to the force the last jedi is not only the longest entry in the saga clocking in at two and a half hours it is also the densest in relation to story being essentially the bridge film for this trilogy a lot happens building and expanding all those characters we were introduced to in the force awakens so much is going on in this film at times that it may feel like you need more than one viewing to really take it all in and figure out everything thats not a bad thing since writerdirector rian johnson looper brick has given us a breathtaking visual spectacle to go along with his plot one which respects the viewers intelligence and doesnt just handfeed you its not just the characters that get a dose of expansion but the saga as a whole we are treated to new ship designs new species and new locations all of which serve to give a broader sense of what goes on outside the tiny capsule of conflict it reminds us that what were used to seeing in these films is only a tiny section of a vast universe as jj abrams did with the force awakens and a new hope johnson liberally borrows from the previous films he mostly takes elements from the empire strikes back this entrys spiritual cousin but also includes parts of return of the jedi also like the previous entry this doesnt detract from the film as johnson reworks these pieces of the story and rearranges them in a clever way he also takes full advantage of the how far visual effects have come over the years george lucas has mentioned he took inspiration from several places in creating the jedi to me the one on that list that has always stood out as the main influence was the samurai johnson appears to feel this as well taking cues from classic japanese films this is not only used during the studentmaster sequences between rey and luke but also when he gives us a fantastic take on the samurai vs ninjas fight scene the way only a star wars film could in the end the last jedi answers many of the questions brought up in the force awakens while creating some new questions of its own first and foremost where does the story go from here hearst television participates in various affiliate marketing programs which means we may get paid commissions on editorially chosen products purchased through our links to retailer sites
Jul 1 2020,positive, after the shameless remake of star wars 1977 aka star wars episode iva new hope that was star wars the force awakens 2015 aka star wars episode viithe force awakens which came roaring into theaters with a bad aftertaste of manufactured pr the newest installment offers the world an actionpacked technically excellent mythically present humorous and never thought id say this of a star wars film thematically radical entry in the fourdecadeold original space opera saga     at least thats how i thought id be starting this review as i was walking out of the cinema star wars the last jedi 2017 aka star wars episode viiithe last jedi is a great film but is it a great film is that even a fair question to ask of just oneeighth of an epochmaking tour de force of imaginative worldcreation and archetypewielding narration in other words how fair can you or i consider this review to be given that merely reading the opening crawl had me in tears and that id been following the youtube press tour so closely that i kept thinking of the onscreen characters by the name of their actors vice admiral who richard brody arthouse champion and bugbear of the popular cinema calls this film an elaborate feat of fan service and hes not wrongeven the newfound humor just reveals it to have gone allout marvel hes not alone matt zoller seitz in his masterful review at the roger ebert website also mentions fan expectations and makes a marvel reference editors note so its ironic that apparently half of the fandom hates its guts the bigger question though is where you would find someone who cares about this eighth out of nine and possibly twelve films who isnt a fan a similar question hovers over brodys conclusion that in its militaristic upholding of the virtues of hope freedom and resistance the film is formally closer to the fascist new order again right on the money but as revolutionary theorists from lenin to badiou have pointed out rebellions against authoritarian or monarchical dictators prevail in the face of long odds primarily on the basis of their discipline and conviction dunno if thats a contradiction but its history so the film is ineluctably constrained by its genre and universe conventions and so plotcentric that i kept waiting for the inevitable cliffhanger ending à la the empire strikes back 1980 aka star wars episode vthe empire strikes back also kylo ren adam driver kills supreme leader snoke andy serkis using occlumency prove me wrong i dare you but the film fills up all the available space within these boundariesand even breaks through a couple times brody mentions the mirror scene and carrie fishers performance perhaps out of respect for her he skips over the part where the shot composition of leias return to the carrier first resembles superman in space absorbing the rays of the sun before quickly devolving into a 2d platform shooter the biggest bravest and most radical thing the film does though is that it embodies the lesson that yoda frank oz imparts to luke mark hamill embrace failure the entire film is premised on a retreatdunkirk in space if you willand of all the schemes and plans and subplots and sidemissions that are played out the only one that succeeds is reys daisy ridley bringing luke back into the fight kylo ren is still on the dark side finn john boyega and rose kelly marie tran are captured and betrayed by benicio del toro whats his characters name again no resistance bases are left standing the only ship still spaceworthy is the millennium falcon which wasnt part of the resistance convoy to begin with and even luke enters a higher realm read dies at the end and we dont even have carrie fisher anymore all of this just adds ladles of emotion to the final line having lost so much leia consoles rey by assuring her we have everything we need camera pull upward though for my money the absolute handsdown best line in the film is when luke guides rey to truly understand the force for the first time and he asks her in between everything what do you feel and she says i feel    a force its a new hope all over again
May 29 2020,positive, by dan tabor film critic with thursdays release of star wars the last jedi  director rian johnson picks up the reigns of the space opera megafranchise left by jj abrams  given the bleakness of looper and cleverness of brick i was more than a bit curious to see what johnson would do in the disney sandbox surprisingly enough not only did johnson make it through making the film without being fired  no small achievement that  but he turned in a film that feels very much like a star wars adventure while adding a muchneeded layer of complexity to the characters we met all too briefly in the force awakens since the decimation of the republics capital at the end of the force awakens the first order has established dominance over the galaxy when we catch up with the final remnants of the republic  the de facto resistance  led by general leia organa carrie fisher they are on the run from the ominously reptilian supreme leader snoke and his terrifying star fleet of megadestroyers who are on the cusp of wiping out the resistance once and for all in a plot point that feels cribbed from an episode of battlestar galactica the first order now has the ability to track the rebel fleet through their lightspeed jumps making it only a matter of time before the resistance fleet runs out of fuel and is overtaken by the first order its a race against time as poe dameron oscar isaac  finn john boyega and newcomer rose tico kelly marie tran cobble together a plan to sneak onto snokes ship to shut off the tracking device just long enough for the resistance fleet to slip away in the meantime daisy ridleys rey finds she has a much more daunting task ahead of her trying to convince luke skywalker  who fed up with intergalactic warfare has selfexiled to the last redoubt of the jedi on the oceanic planet ahchto   to help the resistance and train her in the in the ways of the force its very apparent rian johnson was having the time of his life here the film is pure visual spectacle with bigger space battles more lightsaber duels and higher stakes all barbed with a razor sharp humor i can also see why mark hamill probably sat out the first film he is a formidable presence on screen and here he often eclipses the young ridley with his darkly humorous take on the exiled jedi master this dynamic plays into how we come to see this war between the rebellion and the first order and the conflict between jedi and the sith its not simply black and white but shades of gray and sometimes the good guys do bad things the film begins with a tragic example as poe damerons ego leads to the death of hundreds of rebels when he disobeys orders and takes on a massive first order dreadnought these sentiments are later echoed by the career criminal dj benicio del toro who revisists the twitchy incomprehensibility of his breakout performance in the usual suspects who lets our resistance friends in on a little secret there are those that have been profiting obscenely off of this war selling arms to both sides who have a vested interest in keeping it going as long as possible after that aforementioned spectacular opening battle sequence the last jedi stumbles a bit trying to find its footing and advance the narrative all the while tying up all the loose ends left over from the force awakens once the film digs in however it delivers a story that proves to be more original and satisfying watch than its predecessor it almost feels like rian johnson had most of the same issues with the force awakens we did  that it leaned too hard on the fan nostalgia crutch  and nowhere is this more apparent than when snoke  who looks like a burn ward victim in a fancy bathrobe  berates kylo ren the always excellent adam driver for failing to vanquish rey in the previous installment belittling him as a vader wannabe jj abrams is slated to direct the final installment in the star wars reboot trilogy but after seeing how impressively johnson coursecorrected the series and cleared the board for the imminent endgame of the skywalker saga id rather see him finish what hes started the last jedi isnt perfect but is easily everything a star wars fan could want that expands the sw universe into bold new realms while deftly invoking the films we love and remember from a long long time ago in a galaxy far far away
May 20 2020,positive,writerdirector rian johnson has done a remarkable job making the last jedi a film that somehow both stands on its own and fits wonderfully into an ongoing journey
May 15 2020,negative,this felt much more like a kids movie to me
May 15 2020,negative,this felt like paint by numbers
Feb 14 2020,positive,go see it on the biggest screen possible and let the little kid in you enjoy every moment of it
Feb 10 2020,positive, as satisfying as the force awakens was as the dust settled it became clear than jj abrams had basically remixed a new hope for a new generation without bringing new ideas to the fore heck abrams went for yet another death star the most cumbersome of weapons considering this development concerns over the last jedi being another empire strikes back werent unfounded enter rian johnson the writerdirector behind the brainy indies brick looper and the brothers bloom explores corners of the star wars universe never seen before on screen without breaking the mold chief among them a scenario beyond the battle between good and evil that has characterized the saga johnson also takes full advantage of the visual possibilities and deliver the most uniquelooking episode of the franchise without becoming a cgi hodgepodge like the prequels i wont be spoiling the plot here suffice to say the resistance is in shambles even without a massive impractical weapon able to destroy planets the strength of the empire is overwhelming there is also conflict within each side kylo ren adam driver has fallen out of favor with supreme leader snoke following his defeat at hands of rey daisy ridley among the rebels leia carrie fisher and poe oscar isaac cant agree over the best way to avoid annihilation with general hux domhall gleeson breathing down their necks meanwhile rey struggles to get luke skywalker mark hamill to rejoin the fray the jedi knight is not over the events that led to kylo ren switching teams and is not particularly inclined to go through the same motions with another gifted unruly student unlike previous episodes the last jedi relies heavily on the performers and boy do they deliver maybe its because of the goodwill generated by her untimely demise but carrie fisher is phenomenal as leia the leader of the resistance is burdened by casualties but her resolve is unshakeable mark hamill is asked to bridge his brash younger self with a cautious misanthropic present and pulls it off of the new generation adam driver is the mvp more comfortable in kylo rens skin driver makes the characters tortuous journey believable even relatable the movie goes out of its way to present rey and kylo as sides of the same coin they may be in opposite corners but they recognize in each other a kindred spirit a connection that pays off tenfold there are several of these dichotomies peppered through the film which serve to explore the nature of power the darkness inside all of us and the generational divide the last jedi has a conflicted relationship with the past both at internal and meta level there is a desire to break with it but at the same time an acknowledgement of its tremendous power the tension that comes from these opposing forces serves the movie well  whatever side you stand you can see the appeal of the other the quality of the space battles has improved exponentially rian johnson who has already been tapped for a new trilogy set in the star wars universe brings new elements to skirmishes between rebels and the empire the opening dogfight is one for the ages overall this is a profoundly satisfying episode without apparent weak spots its a notch disjointed but nothing unbearable youll laugh cry and be in awe which is more you can say of any movie out this decade there is a question the last jedi presents that has escaped every other star wars installment who benefits from the conflict between the empire and the resistance the answer is as pedestrian as is topical and has the potential to blow the franchise wide open four out of five planets
Jan 16 2020,positive,it is the most visually stunning of the eight star wars films the characters speak with the elegance and wit and the acting is often outstanding it is exciting funny cute tense melancholy smart goofy unexpected and occasionally profound
Jan 10 2020,positive,most fans will enjoy the last jedi but it wont be for everyone while well crafted the current batch of main storyline sw films feel a little hollow
Dec 24 2019,positive, undeniably the most divisive of the star wars franchise the last jedi sought to challenge the very foundations of the property building off of the events of the force awakens director rian johnson chose a different path than many of the films that came before yet at the same time his mechanisms for crafting the story created the rhyme that remains essential to the franchise discarding the planetdestroying monstrosities that have plagued most of the franchise he instead focused on character development and philosophy this empire strikes back illusions are heavy throughout the film especially as the characters are pulled in different directions however the kill the past message reigns supreme throughout the film how that message has been interpreted is another matter entirely but it provides the groundwork for a future star wars with incredible hope the last jedi begins moments after the force awakens poe oscar isaac leads a raid on an imperial dreadnaught taking down a dangerous weapon for the first order as general leia organa carrie fisher looks on she orders the evacuation of the other ships in the fleet among those evacuated are an unconscious finn john boyega and a young engineer named rose kelly marie tran the first order led by general hux domhnall gleeson tracks the resistance through hyperspace leaving the resistance on its last legs supreme leader snoke andy serkis continues to spark hate in kylo ren adam driver pushing him to his emotional limits meanwhile rey daisy ridley has found luke skywalker mark hamill on a distant planet unfortunately he refuses to train her in the ways of the force the emotional core of the film comes from ridley and johnson quickly establishes an unconventional nature to her side of the story he fully embraces the luke parallels within the character including her ambition and excitement to receive training he knows that ridley comes across as an infectious performer she needs to belong to something bigger than herself and having the ability to utilize the force has always sparked an internal examination its only fitting that reys involve the biggest hole in her heart and wanting to belong can often stem from knowing where you come from johnson cuts the core with the answer of no one a liberating and emotionally devasting choice all at once yes it means that reys central quest to find her parents will never be solved however it means she can be free to pursue her own destiny one that means she can define herself by those she loves and those she chooses in a more practical sense it means that anyone can a savior anyone can be a hero you dont have to come from privilege or legacy to pave your own way forward in an age of populism this particular story rings true it also builds upon a heartbreaking choice from the phantom menance it does not say that midichlorians are necessarily irrelevant but it does not mean that only the select few in the galaxy can use the power of the force meanwhile driver delivers the best performance of this franchise to date as ren while i saw him as an unstable and broken character for most of the force awakens driver transcends the story in last jedi rocked by a master that still sees him as weak his connection with rey deepens both characters you can see his manipulation at work showing how his pointofview diametrically opposes the truth yet driver turns on the charm hes slick and raw johnsons choice to dump the kylo mask means we actually get to see one of the most emotive actors deliver emotional dialogue he knows he must standin for vader so his physical presence can overwhelm the screen drivers textured take on a man broken from his own actions seeking someone to understand him becomes empathetic but he always comes home he may not be beyond redemption but he also holds an unsafe level of influence over our hero that makes him the most dangerous man in the universe returning to the role of luke hamill gives the most introspective performance of his career he locks into something beautiful about the character at the edge of the world he has followed the footsteps of his masters and like both yoda and obiwan he chose exile over facing the problems headon after freeing the galaxy he plunged it back into darkness his failure destroyed everything his friends had lived fought and died for hope has been extinguished and for the entirety of the film hamill gets to charm his way back into your heart even as grumpy and frustrated force wielder he remains funny and weird he was never the traditional hero but a nerdy kid who starred into the suns hoping to find something better for himself he was the embodiment of george lucas as he created the franchise a young boy in california who would rather work in movies than for his father like lucas he created something reviled something inherently broken and was forced to leave it all in the hands of someone else yet failure does not stop a legend from continuing to be a spark for hope johnsons dissection of luke reminds us that while the worlds and stories we create can be inspiring the important thing is for the next generation to build on what weve built we do not ignore what came before and instead use that failure as a way to push beyond what weve accomplished just as luke learns from the failure of vader rey too must learn from the failure of luke the films dialogue never disposes of the past but reframes the way we look at what came before and the exciting prospects of what can come next its an eternal message one that deserves to be delivered by one of the great cinematic characters hamills pathos and heart can be read on his face throughout the film and while he struggles with his own failure you can see the hope reborn his final moments onscreen feel impossibly beautifully impossibly sentimental and fit the rhyme of star wars no character in the franchise has ever received a more impactful farewell on the flip side the resistance does its best to survive regardless of where you sit on the leia utilizing the force sequence a scene that feels like weve been building towards since return of the jedi this section defines why we fight against oppression simply painting the world as good guys and bad guys do not create personal stakes for our characters isaac begs the audience to see him as the new han solo but he needs to grow into the role before this moment weve barely even met him and allowing him to contrast himself with hondo and leia offers that growth meanwhile finn has never given a reason for why he would join the resistance the only motivation he reveals throughout the force awakens comes from his feelings for rey he was 100 against the first order but he was never for the cause the scenes with rose especially those at canto bight snap several political realities into place first it directly pushes up against the idea of the rich or in many cases corporations caring about the cultural ideologies that play out in public anyone can sell anything to any side after all republicans buy sneakers too its a harsh reality but one that feels undeniable as consumerism and activism continue to blend boyega owns the transformation becoming a movie star in the process his line reading of rebel scum will always be his defining moment to me in the trilogy tran does not get the strongest dialogue but her ability to ground the story creates its own benefits shes someone who grew up hearing the stories of rebellion and has actually felt the costs firsthand she believes in heroes and puts herself on the front lines its an admirable character one that is slightly diminished by a onesided love subplot that does not diminish the earnest nature of her role which in many ways in a nonforce sensitive version of rey yet her message of love and togetherness feels essential especially as political divides grew deeper within american politics finally the technical aspects of the last jedi far outpace any previous entry in the franchise while the original trilogy did not have the technology to create the images this one does the creativity johnson showcases throughout the film creates dozens of brilliant setpieces the red room fight remains one of the greatest fight sequences of star wars history the holdo maneuver took the breath out of the theater creating a visually spectacular shot the dreadnaught fight and the battle on crait provide their own brilliance even the little crystal foxes and porgs deserve credit johnson unleashed one of the most spectacular visual feats within the star wars universe the use of unique sound visuals and production design sprinkled throughout the film makes this one stand out
Dec 20 2019,positive, in the runup to the release of star wars the rise of skywalker and the end of the skywalker saga we will be taking a look back at all of the saga films and reevaluating them and their legacy as a whole either a reaction to the creative choices of the force awakens difficult given the production schedule or an incredibly timely bit of synchronicity the last jedi takes a full look at what star wars without its originator could be but is hamstrung by an inability to make up its mind and creative decisions inherited from the previous film the sequel trilogy was and is weighed down by the desire to both guess what its creator would have done and what its fan base would have wanted trying to thread the needle between the two created a backwardlooking experience in the force awakens which kept that film from being able to take full advantage of what new things it did invent  the other side effect of lacking a single guiding hand behind the story is that each new filmmaker has free reign to make their episode what they want it to be something entirely novel in the series working on his iteration simultaneous with jj abrams production the last jedi writerdirector rian johnson essentially tackles the same questions at the same time and comes to very different conclusions let the past die says kylo ren the focal point of johnsons thoughts on sequels and franchises a character who existed in the force awakens largely to both impart a darth vader vibe to the new films and give han solo a dramatic arc in the last jedi he comes into his own as a fascinatingly compelling character  through him johnson smashes some of the repetitive fan services of the force awakens usually literally and makes clear that he understands what lucas understood  the only way a longform story can survive is if each edition is intentionally different from the others frequently that means taking big whacks at the story structures brought over from the force awakens in order to leave something new for the next person coming down the line this creates other problems not the least being that no overriding dramatic structure exists across the three sequel films because no one knows what is happening next or has the time to worry about it all they can do is leave bread crumbs for the next person to follow and hope they do the heroic rebels are nearly wiped out after the flaw of hopeless last stands and reckless plans becomes apparent the grand leader of the villainous first order is simultaneously expunged as johnson realizes the crutch using expys of previous characters is in their place johnson takes time to delve deeply into what makes rey and kylo ren tick and build a fascinating relationship between them the downside of all of this is that it also weakens the structures the last jedi itself is relying on with so much time spent on a new character dynamic there is less for recurring characters finn and poe who himself is dramatically increased in presence and what time they do have is focused on the last jedis thematic pursuits primarily failure and how it can be learned from  which means that they fail again and again and again its fascinating but also unbalanced with little in the saga that doesnt get subverted as owen gleiberman noted at the time of the films release the problem of taking all the legs out of your mythology is that it will not be there to prop your story up when it is needed but the real issue the last jedi has is that it ultimately lacks the courage of its convictions as often as it speaks of doing away with the past or simply realizing the past has no power over the present it refuses to follow the idea to its logical conclusion the problem is epitomized in the climactic confrontation between ren and rey and supreme leader snoke when the two misfit outcast jedi seem on the verge of leaving the galaxy to its problems and finding their own way a truly momentous and unprecedented turn in story which would have left untold options for the final film  but at the key moment they dont instead they merely act as all previous versions of their characters have because they must otherwise there would no longer be scruffy rebels fighting stormtroopers and then what would star wars be about johnson is canny enough to realize one day we will have to find out but he is not prepared to make the last jedi the film that does so this is its fatal flaw as it attempts to have its cake and eat it too that problem can be clearly seen in its design elements as well some of it is fascinatingly expressive in a way no one but lucas and kershner really tried with the series in particular the focus on the color red within the palette  sometimes overt and sometimes subtextually  representing the strong emotional ties love and hate tugging at kylo ren and driving the story of the sequel trilogy  the return of master yoda was conceived in johnsons words so that it could exactly replicate what was seen in the original films his other new design elements also replicate those older choices  a particular ask was to make the new vehicles look like they could have been from return of the jedi if the exterior visual vision for the film is kept chained to a certain frame how can the interior vision grow and change when its all stemming from the same point of view the sequel films helmed by those who grew up with the series are trapped in the worship of its iconography but that kind of worship does not allow for change and reacts violently when it is attempted a fact both the prequel trilogy and the last jedi ran powerfully in conflict with lack of change freezes the narrative and leaves filmmakers rearranging deck chairs rather than moving the plot forward which is how something like the last jedi could end basically how it began the resistance in a spaceship running for their lives with only one film to go to somehow tie up all loose ends perhaps if the force awakens had been more daring the last jedi itself would have been even freer to experiment instead the expectation was set for nostalgia and safe choices with the shortterm success of that leading to longterm troubles dangling plot threads that would have been poisonous to future installments if drawn out  the unknown and unknowable snoke the missing luke skywalker the secret of reys parentage  became grenades johnson had to throw himself onto in order to leave a clear trail for whoever followed him well never know and its entirely possible the answer would have been pretty much the same because this is what happens when an auteurs vision is turned over to his fans more than any of the other postlucas films johnson takes that bull by the horns and truly thinks about what could be different and why but when the climactic choice comes the last jedi like kylo ren in the throne room reverts to old habits let the past die it says but not too much joshua starnes has been writing about film and the entertainment industry since 2004 and served as the president of the houston film critics society from 2012 to 2019 in 2015 he became a coownerpublisher of red 5 comics and

Dec 20 2019,positive, now having seen the final entry in the skywalker saga the time is now to look back on the new era of star wars films and see how they hold up in recent years constant controversy has stalked the online fandom for star wars with a sudden backlash to rian johnsons film contrasting to the love from critics was just the start then came solo a star wars story and now the rise of skywalker i have no interest in such puny squabbles of fans preconceived notions of what star wars is judge a film on its merits and a filmmaker too its their choices and its a continuation so changes to lore are valid youve always got the old films if you disagree with new choices made i am a selfproclaimed star wars mega fan i was brought up watching star wars and therefore i believe there can be some trust put into my thoughts coming ten years after the last star wars film jj abrams the force awakens was a nostalgic return to george lucas beloved world the film is a great success it captured the feel of the originals while evoking and creating new ideas however the narrative feels a little recycled in that its very familiar to that of a new hope the force awakens is grandly entertaining and riveting with the piercing new visual and sound effects of the lightsabers it acted as a surge of star wars excitement it isnt nearly the best star wars entry it is of middling ground  which says a lot considering how great most of the series films are another success was the introduction to a whole new series of beloved antagonists and protagonists notably rey daisy ridley finn john boyega poe oscar isaac and kylo ren adam driver whilst visually it has some intrigue i believe the biggest flaw is the direction of abrams it seems sloppy at points especially in comparison to watching the last jedi after in conclusion the force awakens is a brilliant return to star wars that evokes extreme nostalgia and led to a spark that led onto one of the best entries in the skywalker saga the last jedi the second entry into the new skywalker trilogy stirred intrigue after its release and has been much debated for the past two years bouncing off from jj abrams ending this film sees rey attempting to console training with jedi master luke skywalker mark hamill upon rewatching all these films backtoback you can truly see the mastery of rian johnson and his direction the last jedi is not only a fantastic film but one of the best star wars films and could go toetotoe with the empire strikes back and a new hope  there is something quite poetic to its somewhat relaxed form of storytelling there is a philosophical aspect to its attempted themes it feels more like the approach of the originals think remaster yoda consoling with luke in the empire strikes back  the interest in building character over bombastic action which it does have is something of an admirable quality shot by rian johnsons goto cinematographer steve yedlin the images they create are sincerely breathtaking and beautiful the careful and calculated touch of their collaboration when seen in comparison to the more blockbustercoveragetype style of shooting in the prior film clearly shows a mastery in visuals that the last jedi has rian johnsons film is clearly superior in filmmaking and upon rewatch holds up incredibly well as a film but also as a star wars entry its beautiful breathtaking and poetic in execution clearly marking the best in the new trilogy the final entry in the new trilogy has arrived and the rise of skywalker is a great end to the new saga taking a little while to get used to the overload of exposition and changes made at the very beginning it gets better and better it is perhaps the most star warsy film since perhaps the prequels it is nostalgic touching and headturning in the crazy steps taken it represents a progression in jj abrams touch on star wars its directed better than the force awakens whilst bringing back some errors that johnson eradicated in his tenure the matter of its cinematography with the sometimes sloppy style of coverage shooting shows less control compared to the last jedi but lessso than the force awakens that being said it has quite frankly some beautiful and chilling imagery that will send surges of chills down your spine the scope of the film is frankly very vast in that it has the challenge of creating a satisfying end for all the films not just its own whilst it has occasional vivid scripting errors and the somewhat rushed beginning exposition it delivers a mostly great storyline of clarity that becomes more and more clear as the film progresses some shots will have you screaming in that they really did that delivering extreme doses of nostalgia that honestly ends quite perfectly despite its flaws the rise of skywalker is a fitting end jj abrams improves on his prior work in creating a packed finale that is sure to make fans go wild on a personal standpoint it has been a pleasure to wait year to year for each new entry it really works as a trilogy and rian johnson must be applauded in creating a film to rival the original trilogy whilst also jj abrams for lighting the spark that ignited this new reign of star wars
Dec 14 2019,positive, two hours and eighteen minutes into the last jedi luke skywalker mark hamill projects his avatar from across the galaxy to confront kylo ren adam driver and save the resistance both times i saw the film theatrically once in mumbai and then in new delhi a thousand miles away the image of luke floating crosslegged deep in meditation was met with thunderous applause this wasnt just a clever twist for fans of force magic for many eastern audiences the image of the jedi levitating crosslegged above a mound evokes depictions of siddhārtha gautama the first buddha in sculptures and paintings across the centuries  the climactic reveal of luke lost in deep meditation on ahchto the site of his selfimposed exile where he lives a similarly materialfree life takes the place of the typical cowboy shot where a subject is framed from the thighup as they grab their weapon from its holster  a technique star wars has used in the past instinctively most audiences in the west know what this image means whenever it appears especially if its accompanied by the camera pushing closer for emphasis as it does on rey when she first wields her weapon in the force awakens its a precursor to heroic action scenes a familiar visual shorthand that tickles the senses as all genre tropes do but in the last jedi as the camera pushes in on luke the shorthand of the climax is an image more familiar to viewers in south and southeast asia for me the image recalled an enormous statue of the buddha in the ajanta caves a series of rockcut buddhist monasteries built as far back as the 2nd century bce  crosslegged depictions of the meditating buddha are most often depictions of the revered monk achieving nirvana a form of deep spiritual understanding in south asian religions like hinduism jainism and buddhism the latter now the worlds fourthlargest religion is believed to have been founded in the 5th century bce by siddhārtha gautama who most historians agree renounced the material world before embarking upon a journey of learning and teaching until his eventual death more specific details are harder to verify though most biographies cite his birthplace as lumbini  modernday nepal in buddhist traditions that arose in subsequent centuries nirvana  or the great quenching became one of buddhisms central tenets an escape from cycles of death and rebirth achieved through deep concentration helping others and a state of peaceful desireless living  however the contradictory behavior of the jedi would come to light in return of the jedi when obiwan insists that in order to defeat the emperor luke must vanquish darth vader in an act of physical dominance this course of action would require luke to detach himself emotionally from his own father but it also contradicted the very things yoda had taught him a jedi uses the force for knowledge and defense yoda said never attack by the end of the film luke rejects both extremes of the force equation neither buying into the visceral hatred of the dark side nor following the dispassionate jedi dogma that wouldve also lead him to violence after pummeling vader in a fit of rage luke tosses his own lightsaber aside and offers him a path to redemption by the last jedi luke has cut himself off from the force having failed to exorcise the darkness in his nephew ben solo in flashback we see luke momentarily tempted by both sides of the equation once more the violent potential within him that the dark side could draw out and the jedis dogmatic call to ascetic detachment in order to vanquish evil in this moment as in the moment luke nearly took vaders life the dark side and the ways of the jedi are one and the same luke thinks about and nearly acts on killing ben he doesnt follow through but its too late the betrayed ben denied the road to redemption by his own uncle is set down on a dark path of his own a second skywalker villain is created by jedi zealotry  with his mind thus concentrated purified and bright unblemished free from defects pliant malleable steady and attained to imperturbability the monk directs and inclines it to creating a mindmade body  he appears he vanishes he goes unimpeded through walls ramparts and mountains as if through space he dives in and out of the earth as if it were water he walks on water without sinking as if it were dry land sitting crosslegged he flies through the air like a winged bird the last jedis cut away from the duel to lukes crosslegged meditation signals the achievement of a greater clearminded understanding the concept of nirvana ties back to the central buddhist idea of escaping cycles of life and death or attaining moksha ie salvation from pain what pains luke it would seem is the guilt of his failure in buddhism in order to attain this moksha one must ascend  as luke does  from cetovimutti a state of simple desireless living to paññavimutti the escape from physical suffering through vipassana or meditation the term nirvana when literally translated means blowing out as in a candle as luke fades from physical existence backed by the sundrenched horizon his life ends like a fading flame  fittingly lukes enlightenment and his rejection of jedi dogma mirrors the rift between two major sects of buddhism theravada or the school of the elders and mahayana or the great vehicle theravada the oldest and most orthodox form of buddhism teaches the path to nirvana as a strict endeavour embarked upon only by chosen monks living according to a rigid monastic code whose enlightenment takes precedence over helping others in response mahayana which arose cir the 1st century bce introduced newer more lenient teachings considered inauthentic by many theravadins it allowed laypeople the chance to walk the path to enlightenment and placed a greater emphasis on helping struggling humans even if it meant delaying ones own nirvana in order to do so mahayana as it happens was also the origin of zen buddhism this divide also echoes the paradigm of the new star wars films which dramatizes the tensions between the rigidity of bloodline legacy  from vader to kylo ren  and the arrival of an outsider rey who uses the force and upsets the established order rey is also a key fixture in the films use of buddhist imagery her own moment of enlightenment while searching for her parents identity in the cave on ahchto comes in the form of gazing into infinite mirrors in some sects of buddhism the mirror is considered a point of spiritual reflection seventeenth century zen master hakuin ekaku considered the mirror a false or illusory reflection of reality similarly the truth rey seeks in these mirrors presents itself first as illusion  two silhouetted figures perhaps her parents walking towards her  before finally reflecting the reality of the world as it truly is in seeing these two shadows merge into her own reflection rey the girl who raised herself on jakku begins to accept that its neither the phantom parents she clings to nor idols like luke or han to whom she runs nor kylo ren by whom shes tempted that will show her her path its something she must forge herself  rey isnt the only important outsider in the last jedi either rose trần loan and finn john boyega help a young stable boy temirlan blaev on canto bight the casino city frequented by the galaxys war profiteers the capital is a nexus of violence and materialism in contrast with the buddhist tenets of ending suffering dukkha and detaching oneself from the material desires that cause it samudaya at the end of the film a young slave boy who finds inspiration in a rebel ring given to him by rose as well as in the legends of luke skywalker appears to use the force in an immediate sense this child is a symbol of the continuing rebellion the birth of a new generation of jedi and like rey a spiritual successor in the skywalker story but where does the force go from here after lukes ultimate rejection of violence and the jedi dogma with few answers from the rise of skywalker the answer may partially lie with the new liveaction star wars shows planned for disney plus weve gotten a little from the mandalorian and grogu this mute infant of the same species as the yoda we know exhibits sensitivity to the force and in his innocent moments tries to use the force to heal the mandalorians wounds the force as a means of physical healing is a concept yet unexplored by star wars though it feels tethered to lukes use of the force as a great vehicle for spiritual healing in the last jedi when the film begins luke has taken a dark path akin to yodas didactic prophecy many years ago fear leads to anger anger leads to hate and hate leads to suffering but by the end luke breaks this painful cycle by finding an alternative to yodas threepronged mantra one that echoes the four noble truths of buddhism the core of the buddhas teachings suffering exists it has a cause it has an end and there is a noble path to ending it the future of the force it would seem lies in the ending of suffering rather than in answering the call to violence or as rose puts it not fighting what we hate saving what we love the saga thus far has woven a harmonious fabric in which luke skywalker the young farm boy from tatooine who just wanted to be part of something greater fulfills his destiny by becoming one with the force hes helped along his path by none other than master yoda whose own enlightenment has seen him become one with nature we are what they grow beyond yoda tells him of their jedi students that is the true burden of all masters as the saga leans further into mahayana tradition the goals of its wise jedi and its older generations are to guide these new heroes  and outsiders  toward their own forms of spiritual understanding  luke does not appear in front of kylo ren to fight but to guide others to safety when his astonishing new abilities are revealed they are a path to salvation  for kylo for the entrapped rebels and for the jedi master himself  instead of bloodshed when luke is revealed floating on the mound the awesome power audiences applauded was not violent fantasy but a path to peace
Oct 18 2019,positive, star wars the last jedi is so good that it will thrill and surprise everyone from the first generation of fans to its newest recruit it reaffirm to all the power of the force this film as written and directed by rian johnson moves the saga forward dramatically but in truth it is all about character its best not to discuss any plot points fans already know luke skywalker is in the movie because hes the biggest character on the onesheet poster  audiences will learn more about the characters theyve always known and loved and more about both the sophomore and freshman classes  as to those from a force awakens poe rey kylo and finn equally get their chance to shine and show the complexity and motivations of their characters  there are also some great new additions to the cast  most notable is kelly marie tran as rose tico and the dynamic she brings to her scenes with john boyega in an interview tran talked about why from the beginning we clicked during the audition process i dont think theres a better partner anyone could have when youre going into a movie like this  their chemistry is undeniable kelly marie tran also talked about the continued theme in the star wars universe of having strong selfaware female characters  from the beginning the star wars films have always been groundbreaking in that way  what keeps people interested is they continue to do so  another new strong female character portrayed by laura dern has a very interesting arc we see unfold in what almost feels like real time  the potential for spoilers dictates no more is said about her role or that of other star wars newcomer benicio del toro but they fold themselves and their storylines convincingly into the saga  with all the newer members of the cast lovers of the franchise can rest easy about the old guard  carrie fishers leia is luminous as always  her swan song took a 1977 ingenue albeit fearless princess and turned her into both a general and a powerful wisewoman   even at that it is lukes story that is most enriched having several wow moments that legitimately rival the last act of a new hope  as to the expanded diversity in the last jedi its not something that hits the audience on the head but really feels right  in a story where there is conflict and resistance it makes sense that those who believe in freedom and equality would be coming from every perspective and gender as well as a wide variety of alien species  visually the audiences are brought through everything from cityscapes to deserts vast galactic spaceships and desolate island landscapes some of the most exciting scenes of dogfights in space take us through such spectacular environments they will make your eyes pop  also as one would expect there are some spectacular sets and as has always been the case for the films of star wars there is a great balance of the real and the digital  says johnson we had a huge amount of practical sets for this film part of the livedin feel of star wars is something we really wanted to capture  at the same time the other end of star wars is constantly pushing the envelope in terms of special effects   rians script at first count had something like 160 sets said production designer rick heinrichs pirate of the caribbean beetlejuice but they wound up with around 125 sets where it was filmed at pinewood studios in england as well as other locations around the world  for example they built a cave that was changed and relit to work for three other settings theres so much going on its almost impossible to remember the entire story not that it would be shared in this review which of course may be a ploy to get audiences all to see it multiple times  at 2 hours and 23 minutes it is definitely on the long side and there are so many plot threads it feels like they could get knotted up in the viewers brain   its possible theres an even better movie that could have been carved out in the editing room  however  a shorter film might have sacrificed the strong character development which is what will remain with fans long after the credits roll lovers of star wars are incredibly lucky to have johnson at the helm who is clearly a superfan of the saga he took the stories archetypes and mythology and expanded and enhanced it in nearly every way 
Oct 10 2019,positive,get ready to buckle up for plenty of action tension twists and surprises in this second installment in the trilogy that picks up from the force awakens without missing a beat
Sep 26 2019,positive, star wars the last jedi picks up immediately from where its predecessor the force awakens left off but its attitude and intent could hardly be more different the force awakens had an almost slavish reverence to the past but the last jedi elegantly unburdens itself from such reverence in order to stake out its own identity and explore the greyer shades of war failure and the stories we tell ourselves and each other writerdirector rian johnson is a risktaker so when familiar beats happen its less like repetition and more like a carefully laid out trap in which the filmmaker can land a good sucker punch some will hate the creative choices made some will love them  some wont know what the heck to make of them doubtless that the last jedi will reward or punish multiple viewings and yes its still a sugar rush its a crowd pleaser its star wars at its star warsiest most remarkably though is that its subtle brilliance blooms the more you ponder on it and all this without the film itself languishing in heavyhanded ponderousness where the last jedi could have easily fallen to such a dreary ponderous place is in reys storyline in which the young adept seeks guidance from the exiled jedi master luke skywalker far from being the spirited hero we knew he has been eroded by time shame and regret mark hamill is simply wonderful as this different luke skywalker and its difficult not to feel a huge rush of affection the few times hamill drops the surliness and reveals hints of the brighteyed young skywalker who redeemed his fallen father and saved the galaxy adam driver and daisy ridley along with hamill make for a fascinating and psychologically troubled trio upon which an entire fate of a galaxy depends as star wars has always been about the interplay between light and shadow tyranny and rebellion so it is that for as operatic and dramatic as the series can get its often selfdeprecatingly funny too the impish sense of humour is a welcome aspect in this most violent instalment of the series yet whether it be luke skywalker sarcastically fucking with rey the twisted supreme leader snoke cruelly chastising his brokenspirited apprentice kylo ren take off that ridiculous helmet or that the fascistic toady first order general hux is often the butt of a joke the last jedi keeps a sense of humour amidst the carnage and desperation though its thematically necessary a slapsticky detour to a casino setting undeniably hurts the films almost perfect pacing and tone nonetheless i loved the last jedi i loved its willingness to go to places that will surely anger legions of fans i loved that it deepened the charismatic archetypes by exploring their hurts and haunts with deftness and humour and i loved that carrie fisher saved her best for last
Sep 2 2019,positive,brilliantly mesmerizing with a dazzling use of color the action sequences are perhaps the best theyve ever been and the comedy in the film made a guy who generally rolls his eyes at everything laugh like a fool for two and a half hours straight

Aug 5 2019,positive, spoiler alert im not holding back on any plot points based on the box office though it seems like everyone has watched the movie already  30second review admittedly i was never a huge fan of the star wars franchise i always appreciated its place as a corner of modernday cinema and believe that the empire strikes back is one of the greatest scifi movies of all time but ive never been a fanboy the force awakens was a fun space romp that was well made but further highlighted my issues with the franchise issues that competing franchise star trek seemed to solve a long time ago in a galaxy far far away however rian johnsons the last jedi doesnt only give me a new hope for the franchise it raises the bar for blockbuster filmmaking the same way that mad max fury road did a few years ago and blade runner 2049 did this year the difference is that no matter what any star wars movie is going to be seen and its going to be seen by a lot of people whether or not johnson considered this when crafting the narrative i dont know but he has moved the franchise forward in quality and perspective before continuing i want to say thank you to johnson and kelly marie tran for the first time in my life i felt like an action hero continuing in the spirit of the franchise the last jedi picks up immediately after the events of the force awakens rey daisy ridley continues to do great work has found luke mark hamill on an isolated island looking to bring him back to the waning resistance to help empower their forces and to further explore her newfound power with the force much of this sounds like the empire strikes back retreaded but johnson constantly upends expectations in a way that constantly keeps you guessing  hamill has never been better as luke he was also great in brigsby bear this year refreshingly hes not the hero that he once was hamill famously was unsure about the direction of the character but eventually came around i understand why he was concerned for years he was sold as the undisputed hero of the series and in this film that is the legend that has persisted but as the old adage goes never meet your heroes  the scenes between rey and luke dont work as well as the rest of the film however the theme of the storyline is one that the series has never addressed what does it mean to be a hero rey wants to be a hero but luke doesnt quite believe them anymore its incredibly mature storytelling for a series that has mostly kept its themes surface level the rest of the resistance is engaging in only what i could call a mad maxstyle chase with the first order the theme of what it means to be a hero carries on here but it also points to a new direction for the series star wars in spite of its title has never felt like a war movie last years rogue one came close but the last jedi is the first movie to completely feel like it completely embraced the title the action sequences which are beautifully directed visually and structurally feel like war battle sequences  however i want to pay specific attention to the opening battle this is the kind of battle that george lucas would end the movie on its a triumphant victory achieved in spectacular fashion instead johnson focuses on the losses of the battle in particular he focuses on one resistance fighters attempt to drop bombs on a first order dreadnought her ultimate sacrifice is what drives the movies narrative not her specific sacrifice but the reason shes doing it johnson is a superb visual storyteller and he makes these scenes feel like they can stand alone of course that emotional arc pays off in the form of rose kelly marie tran a revelation and breakout fewer characters were introduced in this film but of all the new characters in this trilogy she may be one of the best not only does she have a backstory and a complex character arc shes an asian woman diversity has never been star wars strong suit thought the force awakens did a great job in adding some to the cast but rose feels different of course this is coming from someone who is filipinoamerican still ive never felt like i could be an action hero however her inclusion points to another improvement for the series for the first time each character feels complex and like they have to make decisions that have consequences for the entire running time the resistance has their backs against a wall which adds stakes to the story something that the previous movies never had the last jedi is easily the most consistently exciting film in the series for fans of battlestar galactica it is reminiscent of the series premiere where fleet must constantly evade their enemies through a series of jumps through hyperspace johnsons direction of the sequences are sensational and the effects are among the strongest of the year however what is more interesting is general leia carrie fisher  she gives a performance that reminds us how far presence can get you in a scene and her attempt to save what is left of the resistance poe oscar isaac who seems to be the new han solo has the shoot from the hip attitude that got our heroes out of more than one sticky situation in the original trilogy instead johnson makes it a point to highlight the strategic side of the fight at one point leia becomes so angry at poe taking the heroic path rather than the strategic one that she slaps him and delivers the soontobe iconic line get your head out of your cockpit thematically the film explores what it means to be a hero through poe and his contentious relationship with admiral holdo laura dern a standout more interestingly though it also blurs the line between good and evil as a space western the star wars films have always felt like good vs evil the last jedi explores what it is to be good or evil as rey and kylo ren adam driver become linked to each other through the force by supreme leader snoke andy serkis which culminates in one of the best lightsaber battles in the series history johnson elevates the design of the universe by showing us corners that weve never seen before the casino that rose and finn john boyega visit is a highlight and in the final battle sequence the salt planet serves as an incredible backdrop for the rebels last stand its that kind of visual innovation that the series lacked in the force awakens which just felt like more of the same even if that same is delightful coming from a background of appreciation rather than complete adoration i never understood the undying love for the series well the last jedi made me understand it i felt emotional during the hero moments because i felt attached for the first time partially because i got to know them on a deeper level but also because people of color and women got a chance to have those hero moments  they truly saved the day will that anger some fans yes but objectively the last jedi is the best star wars movie to ever be released that fact cant be disputed it may not be the star wars you remember but change in the end is good and to the fans that are unhappy about the changes or the diversity i leave you with this were going to win this war not by fighting what we hate but saving what we love

Jul 21 2019,positive, when star wars the force awakens debuted exactly two years ago its detractors groused that it was a timid and lazy movie insofar as it never deviated much from the template established by the original star wars back in 1977 i would counter that this isnt exactly true  while it did borrow plenty of plot points from george lucas first baby it did so in imaginative and exciting ways  but never mind star wars the last jedi likely wont be dismissed with similar charges even if one sizable chunk feels like a rehash of the empire strikes back written and directed by rian johnson the last jedi is very much its own entity exploring new routes as it teases out themes that have always been present in the skywalker saga its a bold and challenging work  exactly what we would expect from the auteur of brick and looper in the debit column its also a tad bloated and it contains an almost risible number of false endings  admittedly not as many as the 42 or so that closed the lord of the rings the return of the king but enough to draw attention the last thing anyone would want in a review of a new star wars movie is spoilers so lets tread carefully shall we as we saw at the end of the force awakens new jedi on the block rey daisy ridley has finally made contact with luke skywalker mark hamill whos been hiding out on an island populated by porgs this movies equivalent of those infernal ewoks though thankfully employed only sparingly meanwhile in another part of the galaxy general leia organa carrie fisher is doing her best to keep the resistance from being crushed by the first order in other story strands the bravery exhibited by poe dameron oscar isaac is weighed against his recklessness finn john boyega finds a new friend in maintenance worker rose tico kelly marie tran and kylo ren adam driver continues to fret and fume and throw tantrums with the best of them actually the character arc given to kylo ren is an excellent one marking him as one of this entrys most intriguing players yet the greatest appeal is in watching hamill and fisher again explore and expand upon their iconic roles fisher delivers a commanding performance in both senses of the word and knowing that her tragic death means this will be her final appearance further lends the proceedings a somber and bittersweet tone as for hamill this might represent his finest work in the 40yearold franchise johnson allows the character of luke skywalker to evolve in some startling and unexpected ways and hamill is with him every step of the way contributing a turn thats weighty and wonderful at 152 minutes the last jedi is the longest of the nine star wars films to date  its also the only one where the length is felt that riveting trade federation chat that opens the phantom menace though while all the scenes involving younglings should have been deepsixed the rest of the fatty tissue can be forgiven since it simply meant johnson wanted to make sure fans were saturated and satisfied yet there arent many vignettes that couldnt have benefited from a judicious trim here or there still this is a minor quibble when placed against the magnitude of the movie between its acute attention to character growth the excellent effects that serve rather than dominate and the poignant moments that tie back to past entries a particular scene that employs a snippet of vintage footage is nothing less than glorious its easy to imagine true believers emotions hitting hyperdrive as they anticipate the concluding chapter thats landing on december 20 2019
Jul 17 2019,positive, in the lead up to the star wars the force awakens release two years ago most excited fans ignored the studios chosen title for the film and just referred to it as new star wars but it wasnt not really the force awakens was an artfully curated exercise in weaponized nostalgia designed to reintroduce a beloved mythology to brand new audiences it mixed the old and the new well enough to function but jj abrams was tasked with recontextualizing a new hope more than he was with creating something brand new seeds were planted for the future but revisiting the film now it doesnt hold the same power it did opening weekend the last jedi actually is new star wars with the groundwork laid to rest in the previous outing looper writerdirector rian johnson is free to plot a new course resulting in a film that is very recognizably star wars in tone and scope but executed with more sound filmcraft than its predecessor since its act two of the new trilogy some expected this new chapter to rhyme with empire strikes back and hew darker in tone with a more downnote cliffhanger conclusion but johnson has created a star wars film that balances heavy stakes with light hearted frivolity that couches disturbing revelations within refrains of hope whether its the best film in the canon is sure to be a tiresome debate but its easily the most exhilarating blockbuster experiences of the year as everyone behind the film has gone to great lengths to protect the films plot details a rundown of the last jedis narrative would be a disservice to anyone who wants to see the film blind episode viii takes place not long after the closing moments of the last film with rey daisy ridley seeking out help from luke skywalker mark hamill general leia carrie fisher and the resistance want luke back just as badly as supreme leader snoke andy serkis and the first order want him dead so the mystery of why hes gone full hermit drives much of the films story the other two thirds of the new trilogys holy trinity finn john boyega and poe oscar isaac each have their own thrilling bplots that run parallel to reys quest but another major player rose tico kelly marie tran emerges as a compelling lead equal to the others in emotional resonance even if she receives less screen time than the conflicted kylo ren adam driver every single cast member avails themselves quite nicely but its tran who steals the show for the newer characters shes impossible not to fall for as for the old guard the realization that this is the last well ever truly see of general leia is disheartening but fisher is as great as shes always been however this trilogy ends up turning out knowing the next film was intended to be her big showing the way the force awakens was hans will always be its greatest tragedy this films core performance though must be hamills this man has waited years to get this shot and he knocks it out of the fucking park delivering the best turn in his career and reinventing luke as a man wrestling with his own legend so much of the film is about burning down the past and forging ahead anew and no one embodies that more than luke this being star wars and not intergalactic conflict the battle between good and evil right and wrong has to be writ large all encompassing with everyone in the cosmos choosing a side more than ever this outing seems the most concerned with each individual characters fluid alignment for and against the central cause of resistance in the macro one of the films weaknesses is its inability to clearly define its villains and the real power behind their motivations but on a micro scale all the films central figures are given recognizable arcs that tie together thematically johnsons script while on the bloated side especially the latter half of the third act is remarkably character driven with the prime players and their decisions informing the direction of the story rather than shoddy plotting and the necessity for regularly timed set pieces but when there is an action sequence and the film houses many theyre immaculately arranged segments of cinema that make it clear why johnson was the right man to helm this film his prior work shows an artist with a shrewd appreciation for visual storytelling so blowing up his style to the size of imax means his work retains its necessary clarity resulting in one of the few big budget ip exercises that would function just as well stripped of its nostalgic brand recognition solely on the strength of its potent building blocks its imperfect yes and theres a few wrong notes throughout that will surely stick out across its two and a half hour run time but this is a film that works the writing direction cinematography score editing and performances are firing on all cylinders in concert the last jedi runs like such a well oiled machine that its forgivable sputters and false starts stick out more than they might in a lesser film upon first watch few will find much to dislike about this movie and the realization that abrams is returning for episode ix will make most long for this trilogy to be over so johnson can come back and kick start the next one but after a week or two of think pieces and countless writers trying to ascribe the films aspirational statements about the nature of hope and the necessity of resistance to our depressing reality will ignite any backlash this crowd pleaser ends up receiving the last jedi has quite a few potent moments the kind of heart soaring peaks pop art popcorn flicks so rarely seem to achieve anymore within the nebulous somewhat illdefined world of star wars morality these cinematic aphorisms have weight but those wishing to pluck them wholesale from a galaxy far far away and into the all too chilling world we actually live in will find them wanting at its core johnson can only push the disney machine so far this is still a cash cow designed to sell merchandise anyone going in thinking someone has finally cracked the monoculture code and created one film to rule them all will be disappointed but for a damn good time at the movies bolstered by a buoyant sense of hope for a darkened world nothing else in 2017 will leave you feeling like theres still a chance even if life after the credits will do its damnedest to convince you otherwise early water doesnt have much of an arc  after all its a rehearsal tape but it does have a surprisingly plentiful array of textures and transitions within its somewhat narrow parameters 
Jun 21 2019,positive, note the original headline read star wars the last jedi frustrates as much as it thrills  upon a second viewing i felt it necessary to edit my review ill admit as a lifelong star wars fan a release of a new film always puts me on edge i can admit when im wrong and the last jedi is a thrilling chapter in the star wars saga the second time around most of the flaws held true but overall the light side far outweighed the dark my original review can be found unedited at the bottom of this article  theres a moment in the last jedi where the villainous kylo ren adam driver smashes his helmet in a fit of rage after being belittled by supreme leader snoke for his costume rens get up was as much an ode to the characters idol darth vader as it was a throwback to the original star wars trilogy the latest star wars adventure seeks to destroy the past a theme in the filmby attempting to avoid the critiques of 2017s the force awakens being simply a retread of the 1977 original while jedi certainly is not a riff on the empire strikes back it does feel like writerdirector rian johnson culled sequences from empire return of the jediand even takes a few cues from the maligned prequel trilogyand rearranged them at random if the force awakens was the film to get older fans back in the saddle the last jedi is made for the generation of star wars fans that were introduced to the dysfunctional skywalkers through padme ani and qui gon jin that said theres enough of those terrific classic star wars stylingsa dirty lived in universe frontier style landscapes and a brisk sense of funto satisfy the old timers as well featuring slambang action lots of quick and witty dialogue and some terrifically memorable character moments the more modern in style last jedi is certainly overstuffed at times exhausting and even unsatisfying but remains a thrilling star wars adventure the film opens what feels like days or perhaps hours after the climax of the force awakens with the resistance on the run from the evil first order the opening space battle is thrilling and compellingly shot director rian johnson gives the audience a real sense of space never crowding the screen with too many ships and giving a real sense of urgency and emotion to the action as hotshot flyboy poe dameron oscar isaac takes on a dreadnaught star destroyer on his own the last jedi then makes way into an extended chase sequenceowing a bit to mad max fury roadthat extends through most of the films almost three hour run time the film hits the ground running and keeps running the last jedi feels like its rushing towards the finish line never slowing down enough to give the characters a real chance to breathe and get to know one another and by that allowing the audience to do the same the runtime of the film leads to pacing issues sometimes there can be too much of a good things and sometimes johnson doesnt know what the good thing is one of the most entertaining tropes of the series is when the characters get to explore fantastic new worlds the heroes split up with luke skywalker mark hamill training rey daisy ridley on the misty planet of ahchto dameron dealing with a power struggle with vice admiral holdo laura dern while on the run from the first order and finn john boyega and newly introduced freedom fighter rose kelly marie tran on a mission to a casino on canto bight canto bighta sort of monte cristo meets french rivierais a stand out in the last jedi the audience is introduced to the 1 of the star wars universe arms dealers decked out in evening wear and sipping on champagne featuring inspired classic scifi style costuming on its police force that recalls the old marvel run of star wars comic books and ralph mcquarrie concept art unfortunately for as much as johnsons camera sweeps around the planet and the interior of the gambling parlor the audience never really gets a chance to take in the surroundings the film almost cutting away each time things really seem to be getting interesting in the sequences between rey and luke it feels like they barely get to know each other much less have her trained to use the force theres so much intercutting going on between the heroes and the villains that kylo renarguably the most interesting and complex character of the new filmsgets the short shrift adam driver mopes and mumbles throughout the film and really only gets to come alive in the third act when ren becomes unhinged while star wars is best told in broad strokes lending to the imagination of the audience it helps to slow down and look around as a result the film feels disjointedthe last jedi is made for a different generation of film fan than the original series its pacing having more in common with a marvel superhero story harry potter or lord of the rings particularly with its multiple endings the telepathic conversations between kylo ren and rey especially feel clunky telling the audience big bits of exposition rather than showing while a star wars filmor any actionershould indeed move quickly and keep the audience entertained the last jedi feels more like a collection of momentsalbeit genuinely exciting and visually impressive momentsrather than a complete story while the plotting of the film may be halfbaked the characters come alive in the last jedi propelling the film john boyega shines as does kelly marie tran together they supply the film with that camaraderie one expects  and wants from a star wars film they join the lineage of great onscreen duos from han and luke to threepio and artoo theres an easygoing natural chemistry between the two actors that translates to the screen and the characters there is even a hint of romance that was sorely missing from the force awakens and spinoff film rogue one tran brings a depth and coolness to her character that makes it impossible to take your eyes off her whenever shes onscreen their storyline leads them to master hacker dj played with genuine gusto by benicio del toro the villains remain the most interesting and complex characters of the new trilogy and its terrifically fun to watch kylo ren and general hux domhall gleeson jockey for control of the first order while its wonderful to see carrie fisher and mark hamill again this film really does belong to the new characters which is a double edged lightsaber older fans are going to leave wishing they spent more time with luke and leia but this isnt their story this is a modernly directed star wars tale for the next generation and the film focuses on the new crew of heroes theres a brisk sense humor that flows through the last jedi when the jokes hit they hit hard like they came from the lawrence kasdan playbook particularly poe dameron tooling with general hux in the films opening but some of the one linerscribbing from the quippy style of joss whedons avengers films and the marvel cinematic universedraw attention to themselves and cut down the soapy drama that has propelled the star wars series since empire theres a particular crack from daisy ridleys rey about a shirtless kylo ren that while funny really doesnt have a place in the scene and in turn kills any dramatic tensiontheres also an abundance of slapstick thatwhile always a part of the seriesseems to have more in common with jar jar binks than artoo and threepio sometimes it plays more often it doesnt not everything needs to be gritty but the last jedi could have benefited from leaning into some darker places the film does tie up loose ends and attempts to give payoffs to the hanging threads not only from the force awakens but luke skywalkers personal journey from the original films there does seem to be an attempt to squeeze the best elements of empire and return of the jedi into the film the problem is some of it feels unearned as theyre happening just too soon in the series ridley driver and andy serkis as snoke do command the screen when theyre together bringing a real sense of pulpy drama to rehashed empire strikes back via return of the jedi bits one of the best is the confrontation between finn and captain phasma having been expertly and simply built upon from the force awakens the audience hasnt spent enough time with these characters for the pay offs to carry any real weight and on the flipside luke skywalkers arc feels a touch unsatisfying but at the same time perfectly fits in the theme of hope that has flowed through star wars since 1977  hamill delivers a great performance but his character feels lost in the shuffle hamills reunion with artoo is a stand out in the film filled with so much emotion despite the fact that hes talking to what amounts to a prop its a perfect blend of characterization and nostalgia for long time fans the last jedi thrills far more than it frustrates theres so much good in the film the set design and costuming are spot on from the beat up leather jackets to the samurai influenced praetorian guards and an ultra cool luke skywalker in jedi garb there is a gangbusters lightsaber battle thatwhile not as rough and sweaty as this reviewer would have likedis an all timer and the reveal of reys lineage is smartly written by johnson and wonderfully played by driver and ridley john williams score is arguably the real star of the film this time around  expertly weaving new themes with the classics that have been rattling around in fans brains for forty years and johnson pulls off some truly beautiful shots unfortunately with a star wars film being released what will probably be every year until we all become one with the force there will be more pretty ok ones than truly great ones the last jedi sits somewhere in the middle as a very good entry in the star wars series johnson takes some risks with the storymaybe not enough of them to truly make the last jedi a classicand some of them pay off and some of them fall flat or feel like cheats with jj abrams coming back in the fold for the trilogys conclusion perhaps his more traditional approach to filmmaking can provide a satisfying conclusion to this interesting new saga theres a moment in the last jedi where the villainous kylo ren adam driver smashes his helmet in a fit of rage after being belittled by supreme leader snoke for his costume rens get up was as much an ode to the characters idol darth vader as it was a throwback to the original star wars trilogy the latest star wars adventure seeks to destroy the past a theme in the filmby attempting to avoid the critiques of 2017s the force awakens being simply a retread of the 1977 original while jedi certainly is not a riff on the empire strikes back it does feel like writerdirector rian johnson culled sequences from empire return of the jediand even takes a few cues from the maligned prequel trilogyand rearranged them at random if the force awakens was the film to get older fans back in the saddle the last jedi is made for the generation of star wars fans that were introduced to the dysfunctional skywalkers through padme ani and qui gon jin while infinitely more enjoyable than the prequel trilogy featuring slambang action witty dialogue and some terrifically memorable character moments the more modern in style last jedi just misses the mark feeling overstuffed and at the same time more hollow than audiences expect from star wars the film opens what feels like days or perhaps hours after the climax of the force awakens with the resistance on the run from the evil first order the opening space battle is thrilling and compellingly shot director rian johnson gives the audience a real sense of space never crowding the screen with too many ships and giving a real sense of urgency and emotion to the action as hotshot flyboy poe dameron oscar isaac

Jun 18 2019,positive, 5  i think its superneatocool that you have spent the last two years talking about how you didnt like the force awakensand thus arent looking forward to the last jedibecause you thought it ripped off a new hope using that logic computers ripped off typewriters and the internet totally bogarted the encyclopedias jam building off things while improving on them is apparently only unnatural to creationists and og star wars fans going into any installment of any series primed to hate it only makes an ass out of u and me or something like the storied legendary oracles en vogue once said free your mind and the rest will follow 4  the last jedi not only doesnt care that weve spent the last two years agonizing over certain mysteries backstories and destinies it actively lols at us for doing so the way luke mark hamill reacts to rey daisy ridley handing him his lightsaber is like a rickroll from a long time ago in a galaxy far far in your face writerdirector rian johnson immediately establishes that he is the first director interested in using the most beloved franchise in film history to actually share a timely thematic message and say something and what he says will shock you youve got to see whats number one below sorry the impending loss of internet freedom after the fccs net neutrality vote has me feeling a little clickbaity 3  the last jedis first half is clunky finn john boyega gets paired with rose kelly marie trana kindly rebel grunt who is easily my favorite new character in this new trilogyto get a code or something to shut something off or something the character dynamics work but that subplot substantively does not poe oscar isaac is paired with leia carrie fisher in a subplot about the future of the resistance while luke and rey invert expectations about jedi training and the very nature of the force if george lucas shat upon the sanctity of the force with the prequels johnson scrubs it clean and holy again it all culminates in a breathtaking finale that blows every death star kaboom out the damn water 2  before we get to johnsons inspired poignant message let me say that benecio del toro needs to stop it he needs to stop it right the hell now ever since the usual suspects we have quietly enabled him to do goofy dumb shit with his voice pretending it was cool its not cool benecio its never been cool youre just bored and its weird i barely noticed the gaping plot hole your character created because you were so busy having tiny seizures or picking your teeth with your uvula or whatever that fake stuttering crap was you were doing 1  the last jedi simultaneously condemns the notion of importance by virtue of birthright and elevates the power and responsibility inherent in the masses in the span of one film johnson has deemphasized the central conceit of the first seven star wars moviesthat a powerful chosen few are key to our collective futureand replaced it with an emphasis on the specialness of the unspecial the best climax in a star wars movie is followed by one of my favorite endings to a blockbuster film ever which underscores this theme with bold strokes its almost impossible to rank a film in this series after having only seen it once but this is closer to the top than it is the bottom except for benecio del toro serously man knock it off
Jun 8 2019,neutral, well as writerdirector rian johnsons star wars the last jedi unfolds one might wonder if the resistance needs a better marketing department because  yet again  they are greatly outnumbered by the draconian downright awful first order  the first order whose members sport pitch black threads and their faces wear scowls coupled with occasional smirks are simply not easy to like but the resistance  like the rebel alliance before it  is facing overwhelming odds against a superior military and legions of bad guys   maybe someone in the resistance should form a promotions department or at least print up some fliers because they seem to be missing an opportunity to recruit new freedom fighters johnson must have recruited a talented film crew because his movie looks absolutely stunning  mixed with some new mechanized ships weapons and contraptions and along with some fearsome familiar ones the battles on land and space spectacularly strike the right science fiction escapist tones that both children and adults pine for during a star wars picture  the film offers about a halfdozen takeyourbreathaway moments and credit johnson for thoughtfully constructing these particular sequences that will steal a collective bit of oxygen from the lungs of theatre audiences  on the other hand the sluggish and very mechanical main plot thread the surprisingly undeveloped relationships between key characters and a few headscratching choices which i will not reveal construct a questionable foundation that the aforementioned visuals and assorted heartstopping minutes cannot conceal meanwhile the first order  led by general hux domhnall gleeson and kylo ren adam driver  is in relentless pursuit of leia poe oscar isaac finn john boyega and rest of the resistance who continue to experience their numbers problem  with a highly intriguing mix of old characters and relatively new ones rey poe finn hux kylo ren and more and brand spanking new ones  played by laura dern kelly marie tran and benicio del toro  johnson holds the ingredients for a complex characterdriven story to match his visual storytelling  sadly that never materializes as he appears content to highlight long stretches of uneventful exposition instead  with rey and luke johnsons script offers some scarce table scraps of new facts and  like two people staring at their individual cell phones during a nice meal on a saturday night  their time feels completely wasted on the island  admittedly rey and kylo rens verbal duels do raise a new hope pardon the pun for a warm détente and also a fear for a dark turn  i will not reveal the results of their particular encounters but  stylistically  their engagements play in the same ballpark as the artless highly criticized exchanges between anakin hayden christensen and padme natalie portman in star wars episode ii  attack of the clones 2002  although they are not quite that bad outside of some longwinded talk the picture contains three extensive physical clashes between the baddies and the good guys but the biggest conflict in the movie is finding enough screen time for the very worthy characters  except for the opening 15 minutes poe is really given nothing substantive to do  for laura derns character who i will not name or describe johnson presents no backstory or establishing scenes so her few onscreen moments do not generate enough gravitas  somehow chewbacca must have learned magic in his spare time because he pulls off a tremendous onscreen disappearing trick  he is barely in the picture  in fact when he suddenly reappears in the third act this particular critic actually forgot that he was starring in movie as the screenplay treats him like a bit sideshow player like some of the new star wars creatures  the porgs who look like cute little penguins and a pack of albino wolves who may have accidentally stepped into a glitter factory finn and a resistance fighter named rose tran do chew up lots of movie minutes on a special mission but their tangential side project feels recycled as just a vehicle to show off a new planet all of this and more fill a very long 2 hours and 32 minutes but with only a fraction of the swashbuckling fun of star wars the force awakens  sure the 2015 picture might be a fraternal twin to star wars episode iv  a new hope 1977 but it recaptured that magic those goosebumps that a great star wars film can give  despite meticulous efforts mammoth productions striking locales some enjoyable fanfriendly moments and about six explosive swathes of celluloid star wars the last jedi is missing that goosebumpsfactor  the 152minute picture felt familiar and not nostalgic but repetitive within its own narrative  it is not the worst film in the series but perhaps the biggest waste in terms of advancing the 9part storyline  of course casual and diehard star wars fans should see this film and many many audiences will hopefully and probably walk out of theatres with big smiles because it is a rare treat to experience a brand new movie from this iconic franchise  unfortunately this particular critic walked away with a lengthy list of the films missed opportunities while also wanting to help jumpstart the resistances nonexistent recruiting campaign  jeff  a member of the phoenix critics circle  has penned film reviews since 2008 and graduated from

May 16 2019,positive, note this review is spoilerfree however to talk about the movie we do need to talk about the plot even if it is the vaguest terms so if youre someone who wants to go in knowing absolutely nothing the first line is a short thesis for the review then the small amount of story details are after the director and summary star wars the last jedi is the best kind of entry into a franchise that takes unexpected risks keeps you on the edge of your seat and is emotionally moving in a way that will be leave fans stunned director rian johnson summary having taken her first steps into the jedi world rey joins luke skywalker on an adventure with leia finn and poe that unlocks mysteries of the force and secrets of the past in one of the many trailers for star wars the last jedi we hear luke skywalker mark hamill say this is not going to go the way you think that is a pretty fair description of the experience of watching the last jedi fans who think they know what to expect from this movie are going to be have those expectations blown right out of the water when they get into the last jedi our story follows three basic plot lines rey daisy ridley tries to convince luke to return to the resistance because they need his help finn john boyega is joined by newcomer rose kelly marie tran to try to save the resistance from impending doom kylo ren adam driver is still struggling with the conflict within himself from killing his father in the force awakens there is obviously more to all of it than that but this is spoilerfree and going in with as little knowledge as possible makes for an optimal viewing experience there has been some worry among fans that lucasfilm wasnt giving their directors and writers any room to create their own movies while many agreed that the force awakens was good it did feel very similar to a new hope the last jedi is nothing like empire strikes back and in fact feels very much like rogue one in that its extremely different it takes risks from the first moment and opens up new doors in what the mythology of this world really is this is a character piece and the moments of building are subtle and lovely to watch we see our main heroes each go through new trials and tribulations that help shape the people they will become in future movies  in both good ways and bad directorwriter rian johnson doesnt just take risks he does things with this movie that could easily be considered unsafe for brand management and no one at lucasfilm seems to take issue with it there is a reason they gave this man his own corner of the star wars universe the cast continues to be the best part of this entire franchise any moment carrie fisher is on screen is just a reminder of what a wonderful actress and person we lost it makes every one of her scenes that much more moving and heartbreaking hamill shows us a new side to luke skywalker and proves that he can take this character in new and believable directions ridley is a powerhouse in the role of rey as we watch this young woman struggle to find her place in this world boyega and tran are a great duo their story is fun and engaging to watch with tran clearly becoming the new heart of the series oscar isaacs poe dameron grows in beautifully subtle ways and continues to steal every single scene hes in newcomers laura dern and benicio del toro dont have a ton of screen time but dern in particular is handed one of the best scenes in the movie driver and domhnall gleeson as general hux continue to play wonderfully off of each other to the point where you want to ask them to lay their lightsabers on the table and get out a ruler to clear everything up its not an entirely perfect movie to be fair there is a bit of clunky dialogue at times and the structure is a little weird when you think about it too much its also a long movie and there are times when it feels that way which is usually indicative of a pacing issue these are nitpicks though and hardly dealbreakers when it comes to the final product star wars the last jedi is an emotional roller coaster of a movie it fakes you out with what you think is going to happen and then completely flips that on its head it expands the scope of what we think is capable from the force in this universe it sets up a new dynamic that is going to prove fascinating to watch in future movies this is not going to go the way you think is the best possible way to describe this gift of a film
May 9 2019,positive,lets not mince words this will be remembered as one of the best science fictionfantasy movies of all time and this backlash simply must stop because thats no way to treat a nearmasterpiece
May 8 2019,positive,unnecessary the longest star wars film to date but has some of the most epic groundbreaking moments in the franchise
Apr 28 2019,negative,a lot of the films ideas i like in theory but it was not executed well the more i thought about it the less i liked it
Apr 25 2019,positive,rian johnson succeeded on a lot of levels i feel like there were a lot of other levels that didnt work as much
Apr 16 2019,positive, the force awakens brought a new generation of lovable characters together the last jedi breaks them apart the result is the richest most epic most emotional star wars movie so far  general leias rebel forces flee the enemys military might a side mission to a shady city brings intrigue and betrayal and a powerful student learns the ways of the force from an aging jedi master  at the heart of the film is the plotline following troubled apprentice rey as she joins luke skywalker to dive into what it means to be a jedi its a joy to watch mark hamills and daisy ridleys characters wrestle with the true nature of the force and the moral and spiritual questions at the heart of the star wars phenomenon then when this compelling strand intertwines with adam drivers tortured villain kylo ren last jedi reaches levels of intensity never previously seen in the entire    star wars  saga a key revelation halfway through turns everything you think you know about luke upside down fueling a soulstirring climax except that isnt even the end as the film slips into an even higher gear for an epic final crescendo alternating gutpunching emotional beats with airpunching action set pieces its glorious to behold  fans might spot one wrinkle however its understandable that this second film in the new trilogy might be influenced by the empire strikes back the second film in the classic star wars series and the movie widely considered to be the best in the saga  if not a contender for best sequel ever but it isnt far into the last jedi that you begin to see parallels and even individual details copied and pasted from the empire strikes back  rose an upstanding rebel mechanic played by kelly marie tran is a delight to watch she embodies the indomitable moral spirit of star wars with her cleareyed determination to do the right thing and amusingly sparks off john boyegas finn  another storyline in which dashing pilot poe dameron attempts to protect the rebel fleet is also undercooked manufactured conflict cant disguise the fact that poe played by oscar isaac doesnt have much to do but spin his wheels and yap at his superiors luckily those superiors are general leia and admiral holdo played by carrie fisher and laura dern who could teach master classes in cool commanding authority  truly funny moments balance the intense emotional ones general hux played by domhnall gleeson is the butt of most of the gags but luke skywalker also brings tragiccomic laughs bb8 is a onedroid hilarity machine and only the hardest heart could resist the penguinlike porgs which thankfully are more tribble than ewok 
Mar 2 2019,positive, i have to admit that my life has been so hectic lately i havent really had time to anticipate any films this holiday season like i normally do but when the press screening invite came out for the last jedi i actually got more excited despite only having seen only one trailer well im glad that is the only trailervideos ive seen of the film its best to see it blind knowing as little as possible i dont write reviews very often anymore so indulge me when i go a bit longer with this one force awakens is more nostalgic and an homage to the original from jj abrams and while the last jedi also still has to tread on familiar grounds it somehow feels fresh and new there are quite a few surprises that thrills delights and tugs my heartstrings ok granted im more of a casual star wars fan so i dont have the depth knowledge like ardent aficionados but i was quite caught up with the journey of the main characters the story pretty much picks up where the last film leaves off with a literal cliffhanger as we saw rey daisy ridley meeting luke skywalker mark hamill up high on a cliff by an ocean  but before we get there the film drops us straight into an intergalactic space battle of the resistance fighters led by general leia organa carrie fisher against the reigning first order i enjoy thrilling aerial battles and the sfx is off the charts in a film of this magnitude but im glad theres more to this movie than just action action action what i really enjoyed most from the film is the quieter more talky scenes between rey and luke writerdirector rian johnson delved deep into the sagas mythology and jedi philosophy about what the force really is the real power of the jedi etc those are the real appeal of this enduring franchise and what makes me go ok i see why people love this saga so much and why it appeals to multiple generations there are fans who might not like the direction of luke in this film even hamill himself reportedly told johnson he fundamentally disagreed how his character was written but i personally love the deconstruction of such a titular character why is luke such a legend just what exactly is the force and who gets to have it how does luke himself sees his own power and its effect in the universe its always intriguing to learn just what the fuss is about luke especially given how he was talked about in virtually every scene in the force awakens yet we only got to see him for mere seconds i love the grizzled curmudgeon luke like hamill was channeling the real harrison ford the salt  pepper longish hair and beard makes him look even more distinguished the scenes between him and rey are definitely my favorite this is not going to go the way you think luke says at one point its not a spoiler as its in the trailer and all over its promos and you know what the film actually delivers on that sentiment the film is divided into three major scenarios in which each team has to fulfill a certain task if you will all happening around the same time my main quibble with the movie is that the transition between one scenario to another feels disjointed at times one scene would be solemn and intense then itll switch to something more mischievous and funky and then its fullthrottle action perhaps its to be expected when you have such a vast narrative involving so many players but it couldve been done more smoothly that said though the film has enough going for itthe energetic action lively humor and genuine emotionthat i didnt even mind the 25 hours running time obviously the strength of this space saga is the characters people truly care about over the years i feel like theres a proper balance a word thrown out a lot in this film between the iconic characters and the newer ones that expand the story the emotional tug of war between rey and kylo is the heart of the story here and both adam driver and daisy ridley are absolutely terrific ive loved ridleys spunky rey from the start and i find drivers kylo even more magnetic here and not only cause hes got such great mane yes hes a grandpa vader wannabe and hes still got serious angermanagement issues but theres much more than that and the internal conflict within him is palpable poor domhnall gleeson though a terrific actor whos relegated to being the comic relief as the overthetop general hux on the resistance team pilot poe dameron oscar isaac not to be outdone by adam in the sexy hair department gets more to do here i wouldnt mind seeing a poe solo movie with the ohsocharismatic isaac hes just a cool guy with a reckless energy a la han solo theres less bantering between him and his bestie fin john boyega instead fin is paired with another spunky maintenance worker loyal to the resistance rose tico kelly marie tran bb8 is still an immensely fun droid to watch while the new avian creature porg likely only appeals to little kiddies im glad to see two new female characters with a proper arc one is rose and the other is vice admiral holdo played by veteran actress laura dern theres a pretty intense exchange between her and poe but im not even going to spoil it for you what its about one thing i can say is the scenes of carrie fisher is truly bittersweet the film is dedicated to her naturally but the whole film gives a proper homage to such an iconic character it was cool to see yoda making an appearance here with luke on the island as luke struggles with destroying the ancient jedi text yoda just made it go kablooey its not particularly a highlight for me but its cool to see the apprentice and the master reunited another reunion that made me tear up is luke and leia especially when she gave the han solos dice he grabbed from the cockpit of the millenium falcon i love when leia said luke i know what youre going to say i changed my hair ha it feels like something carrie fisher herself would say when luke said to her about han hes never really gone it feels like how carrie herself is to the sw family and the fans her spirit will always be with the franchise  now for those whove seen this who do you think the last jedi is is it luke or is it rey thoughts on the kid in the last scene that hints hes got the force with him my initial reaction after i saw this is its currently one of my favorites in the franchise well after four days seeing it i still stand by it in fact i dont mind seeing this again by years end its really got everything thrilling action check intense lightsaber battle check witty repartee check emotional struggles check the action punctuates the story and thats how it should be unlike the overwrought and mawkish prequels rians script has zest and wit and also unafraid to poke fun at themselves i also marvel at the cinematography by steve yedlin a longtime rian johnson collaborator so many iconic visuals that truly took my breath away especially those on the island filmed in county kerry ireland and of course john williams iconic epic score still gives me the chills by the time the end credits roll i am already excited to see how the story goes from there its great to have a filmmaker who evidently has been a fan of the franchise since he was a kid but still also an outsider who dared to take the 40yearold saga into unexpected paths the force is certainly strong with rian johnson so i have no problem having him do the next star wars trilogy i think time will be kinder to the last jedi than some fanboy star wars critics have been theres an apparent backlash to this film from the very same people who criticised jj abrams for remaking a new hope for johnsons deviation from what fans wanted whatever that means i loved the film despite a few niggling issues  the gambling planet for example was utter meh and cannot wait to revisit this one multiple times to dig deeper into it hey rodney i actually like the gambling planet scene yeah people are gonna always complain about something its either too much of the same or too different you really cant please the fans ahah i feel the same about this film as with the force awakens i enjoyed it but it seemed to me they introduced too many questions that may or may not get answered in the final film ill probably see it again just because it looks great on the big screen for some reason i enjoyed this more than force awakens i just think its more engaging overall and yes it does look amazing on the big screen great review ruth i thought the last jedi had flaws but on the whole it was a good star wars film and i do like and fully support some of the unexpected creative choices made  rian johnson delivers some incredible visuals and gives this entry its own unique flavour without seeming out of place in the overall canon hi chris glad you dont mind the unexpected creative choices sounds like were in the minority amongst fans this time im with the critics in that i think this is a great film and i for one dont mind rian in the director chair for future sw films ugh your review makes me wish id liked this movie more than i did it just dragged for me and i felt bored and antsy i loved the force awakens but this installment just didnt sell me the ju ju i needed to feel fulfilled and im not even a fan boy wtf right hi courtney hey its ok that we disagreed on this i wasnt bored for the most part despite the super long running time i guess i didnt know what to expect but really enjoyed rians direction im not a fangirl at all i guess i might just happen to be in the right mood when i saw it  i came out of it giving it a 5 out of 5 but ive since brought that score down to a 4 after thinking about it a bit more and talking to others about their reaction i do feel i need another viewing and im eagerly anticipating one but regardless i really enjoyed it i thought rian johnson did a terrific job just as jj abrams did in the last one there were moments fleeting i must admit when this film featured some of the best bits of star wars ever  that opening battle wow i could quibble about some of the humour and its hammy delivery by hamill or the feeling like abrams effort this is a reimagination of empire strikes back or the point plotwise of the gambling planet apart from spoiler coming the kid at the end and the connotations of his actions but all in all i really did enjoy it and thought it an ideal entry in the star wars saga film is in my blood love movies of all genres from jane austen to james bond official blogger for the twin cities film fest tcff ive written and produced my first short film  hearts want in 2017 and currently working on developing the full story as a feature film
Feb 8 2019,positive,its a visually stunning movie finding moments both macro and micro to highlight the beautiful imagination that star wars can evoke
Feb 6 2019,positive, star wars the last jedi came in with some really high expectations star wars the force awakens evoked a lot of questions and the last jedi trailer stirred up even more questions  as a matter of fact we came up with the top 5 burning questions for star wars the last jedi for your viewing pleasure after viewing the last jedi i think its fair to say that the film exceeded and circumvented my expectations all at the same time now just so you know star wars the last jedi has a ton of surprises and twists with that in mind as i have always tried to provide spoilerfree reviews ill try to be even more spoilerfree as possible i understand some people still want to get a taste of whats to come worry not because in just a few days you can tune back in to this post to watchlisten to my spoiler discussion of the film when the opening credits roll it almost feels like youre being transported back into time with the classic star wars music blasting and the intro opening text that sets the tone for the nice amount of nostalgia the film creates fortunately the movie doesnt entirely rely on the nostalgia factor as much as the force awakens while there are obvious callbacks to previous characters and such the last jedi does not become a modern day version of the empire strikes back not only that but there are so many climatic moments that will leave on you on the edge of your seat theres a nice balance of suspense action drama and humor star wars the last jedi credit lucasfilmdisney motion picturesdirectorwriter  rian johnson deserves so much credit and praise for this film i can see why disney has entrusted him to take on the new spinoff star wars trilogy one of my hopes with this movie was that it would really start to create its own original path in the star wars movie franchise johnson successfully does that by avoiding almost all expectations star wars fans may have had going into the film  with the way the movie ends the field is now wide open with where the next star wars movie can go johnson did stay true to some classic star wars elements one of those elements was to ensure that the last jedi was full of those star wars life lessons i thought it was brilliant how the film brings about a number of different lessons and themes through each of the experiences of the individual characters the overall cinematography of this movie must be praised as well the amazing visuals were simply captivating in this film maybe im being a prisoner of the moment but i cant recall a more visually stimulating spaceship battle the usage of the environment and terrain was stunning in some scenes and without question theres one particular scene with a spaceship that can only be described as epic that scene is so jaw dropping  that the sound is masterfully muted to match the level of suspense that the audience is feeling at that time youll know it when you see it but i can honestly say ive never seen a spaceship do what was done in that iconic sequence beyond even that the last jedi will challenge what we thought we knew about the force i thoroughly enjoyed the radical new ways that the force could be used in the film star wars the last jedi credit lucasfilmdisney motion picturesas previously mentioned johnson included the infusion of so much more humor compared to other star wars films for a moment i almost thought i was watching spaceballs 1987  i dont want to say that the movie was comedic but it did have some funny moments sprinkled throughout i think the reason why this worked was because the humor made sense within the story the humor was not shoehorned in nor did it completely really distract or disrupt the tonality of the movie star wars the last jedi credit lucasfilmdisney motion picturesnow lets talk about some of these great characters in my opinion the supporting characters seemed to have outshined the main leading characters i absolutely loved kelly marie trans performance as rose she was a very unexpected character in a supporting role that simply delivers to the very end of the film the most touching performance that will hit you right in the feels will be carrie fishers role given her unfortunate passing it was wonderful to see her in the role of princess leia as she displayed a beautiful blend of strength leadership and love through her character when it came to snoke i first of all liked the fact that the cgi was handled very well we absolutely got to see more of snoke and even better we got to see his power on display i thought his demonstration of power was extremely effective at showing just how much of a threat he can be probably one of my absolute favorite characters had to be that of poe dameron played by oscar isaac poe probably displayed the most character development of all the other characters last but not least bb8 is just a ton of fun and awesome  star wars the last jedi credit lucasfilmdisney motion picturesas for the heavy hitter characters i think the one that stood out the most was mark hamill as luke skywalker as you could see from the trailers luke skywalker isnt the happy golucky optimistic jedi that we knew from the original star wars films without going into spoiler territory i really appreciated how his character had to go through his own journey in this film another kudos to rian johnson has to be mentioned here yet again we have probably the most epic moment in star wars cinematic history unfold with lukes character in the last couple of scenes of the film luke shines so brightly that im sure itll have the internet buzzing for years to come disclaimer before any die hard star wars fans want to come for my head let me just say that these bad critiques are incredibly mild they do not kill the film or anything but they still have to be noted star wars the last jedi credit lucasfilmdisney motion picturesfirst off this movie feels every bit as long as the 2hrs and 32min run time states dont get me wrong there arent really any slow or dragging moments in the film that make the pacing feel too lengthy rather there are a number of moments where it would appear as though the film couldveshouldve ended we have a few big climactic scenes where you really think the movie is going to stop but it only continues into another side story then that happens again and again fortunately every time you think the movie is about to end they still give you another set of scenes that keep you entertained and intrigued to see more however you still will notice at the very least the prolonged time youve been sitting in that theater chair star wars the last jedi credit lucasfilmdisney motion picturesokay i feel kinda bad for going here but ive got mention that i was not a fan of a particular scene with leia ill just say that the scene is a bit of a reach and doesnt have a good enough contextual basis for the audience to connect with in order for this very particular and standout scene to make sense you have to jump through some mental hoops first you have to  recall the previous original star wars films and then youll have to make a huge assumption just for it to make sense to me it just needed a smoother transition for her actions to be a bit more believable if you listen to my spoilerdiscussion i dig a bit deeper into this i think one of the bigger issues that happens in this film is what appears to be the stagnant character development with the two leading characters of rey and kylo ren compared to the other side characters who have some major challenges and internal battles to overcome it didnt appear as though rey nor kylo ren actually progressed very much as characters let me be clear about this im not saying that nothing happens to them or that they dont make certain decisions along their personal journeys what im saying is that each character seems relatively the same as they were compared to the force awakens you cant say that for a character like poe or even luke for example star wars the last jedi is probably the best star wars film that we have to date hold on pick up your jaw and put your eyeballs back in their sockets i should say that star wars the last jedi is the best star wars film we have to date by default this film is a natural progression of the star wars films because it incorporates all the good things we loved about the previous star wars films even better this film drizzled a lot of originality by dismantling the star wars cinematic formula  going against the grain of what star wars fans may expect makes this film such a surprising and refreshing viewing experience if you couldnt tell by now i absolutely believe that this was better than the force awakens star wars the last jedi credit lucasfilmdisney motion picturesif youre considering to watch this film in 3d feel free to do so the movie is visually stunning and there are a number of intentional visuals to keep the 3d popping in various scenes personally id recommend seeing this film in dolby atmos if your local theater provides that the sound effects and musical score are something to experience in a theater setting star wars the last jedi is an absolute must watch in theaters go see it and may the force be with you you know i had to slip that in somewhere star wars the last jedi will be in theaters december 15th  be sure to follow emans movie reviews on facebook subscribe on

Jan 31 2019,positive, in 2012 disney bought lucasfilm in a 4 billion dollar deal that had the potential to change the entire entertainment landscape overnight five years and three movies later they are on the cusp of making back that initial investment in a resurrection story for our times star wars was a spent moribund franchise one with no foreseeable future other than endless rereleases it has been rebirthed as 21stcentury mythos with a new set of films our original beloved trio of characters grew up to become the elders we respect while our new characters give fans a new set of archetypes that respects our intelligence this winters star wars the last jedi directed by rian johnson may be the most divisive film in the canon so far some of those who hate it claim that johnsons film killed their childhood and guess what theyre right when the original trilogy came out in the 1970s and 1980s many current fans were children childhood was a time for simple answers good and bad were unequivocal wins were forever and everyone lived happily ever after when someone felt a decent impulse and followed it they automatically became a good character ie han solo when a bad guy felt a decent impulse and followed it they were no longer evil ie darth vader in return of the jedi but thats not the way life works good people do terrible things and bad people do small acts of kindness heroes arent perfect  they can be as weak and small as everyone else there is no such thing as happily ever after when the prequels ended in 2005 star wars was all but dead the reviews and fan reaction to the turn of the century films had been scathing the only ones who had enjoyed them it seemed were those aged 714 without meaning to lucas had taken his original childlike trilogy and made it a series that really was for kids this reorientation of star wars for children wasnt a complete disaster for lucasfilm together with warner brothers they followed up with a cartoon film star wars the clone wars that begat a tv show of the same name which then begat the current star wars rebels cartoon but in the world of 2012 where star trek had just been rebooted game of thrones had solidified its position as hbos new flagship show and the avengers had opened to worldwide box office success a few childrens cartoons werent going to cut it enter disney their first move was to establish the new trilogy as successful it needed to be familiar but not too much they turned to jj abrams who had proven his rebooting talent by remaking star trek for a 21stcentury audience some complained that the result star wars the force awakens was a little too familiar an onthenose a remake of the original 1977 film but 2015s the force awakens was an outofthebox success that brought in 2 billion dollars at the box office most importantly it established a new model to build upon star wars has always been at its core a story of archetypes theres a hero a princess a scoundrel and a villain our new protagonists had these features and were diverse to boot the chosen one was finally female heralding a wave of women taking the forefront in longstanding fantasy properties but these werent the clearcut archetypes of the original films rey wasnt a spoiled kid with dreams of adventure she was an orphan whose need to survive accidentally leads her to the resistance finn wasnt the scoundrel with a heart of gold but an abused kid trying to learn to be brave the villains  kylo ren and his sidekick hux  were just angry young men playing with fire not all the motifs were so changed of course leia was the mon mothmalike wise rebellion leader luke was the yoda jedi master and han solo grew up to be of all things the next generations obiwan kenobi abrams setup of this complex world allowed the franchise to branch out the first standalone rogue one a star wars story took the next step back in 1977 characters didnt die in films other than a few extras the 21st century changed all that with bloody highturnover ensemble shows like game of thrones and the walking dead rogue one directed by gareth edwards gave star wars a chance to prove it could do the same this was a big risk and there were many at disney who feared the audience response as a result the movie was a mess a mashup of six partial films with far too many cooks still the ending maintained the new models main lesson changing the world is a slow process and although most of us wont live to see the ultimate victory the forgotten fallen are still critical rungs on the ladder our new characters once again rebuff easy categorizations just because two of our heroes undertake a daring mission doesnt automatically mean theyll succeed just because the rebellious character thinks hes right doesnt mean he knows whats going on the smuggler doesnt have a heart of gold but his pockets are lined with it by the end of the film this time our older heroes are allowed complexity too luke is a man of many sides a hermit in the middle of nowhere who chose to go to a place where fish caretakers wait upon the jedi like a luxury hotel hes selfrighteous yet has made mistakes with galaxylevel consequences the simple hero he was all those decades ago was always a myth one he even bought into  to his everlasting regret leia is still a selfrescuing princess but now shes showing layers of jedi ability weve never seen and putting down mutinies from her sickbed in may of 2018 the next star wars standalone will arrive focusing heavily on the backstory of han solo then in 2019 disney will followup with the nowmovedtodecember episode ix which will complete lucas original skywalker saga will these movies continue to push this more mature narrative forward like rogue one the han solo a star wars story film is trying to change something about the originals something that made disney executives nervous all over again to the point that they replaced directors midstream abrams will return for episode ix we can only hope the result is slightly less messy than rogue one and at least as subversive as the last jedi meanwhile rian johnson has been put in charge of creating the next trilogy the first not to feature skywalkers at all johnsons last jedi killed our childhoods because 2017 wasnt a good place for children but its likely the next decade wont be either we have to grow up and take our place in history with johnson at the helm it seems like star wars could finally be coming along with us for the ride it may not be the reboot everyone wanted but its the one we deserve ani bundel is a cultural

Jan 30 2019,positive,the film is a great reminder to listen to your elders full review in spanish
Jan 30 2019,positive, for 40 years now star wars has been an icon of blockbuster filmmaking both for good and bad at its best it delivers deep emotion and spectacular action at its worst it delivers bungled dialogue and nauseating setpieces but the shackles of the past were thrown away with 2015s the force awakens and the franchise was back to its best with the introduction of a new writerdirector rian johnson theres a sense of trepidation going into the latest chapter the last jedi you can rest easy hes delivered the goods the franchise is in safe hands with johnson crafting a bold new vision for the saga unlike anything weve seen before while pushing further towards a future free from the constraints of its history the film still wisely keeps one foot firmly placed in deep admiration of the past you cant make a star wars story without respect to whats come before an enthralling and gripping piece of cinema thats both sublimely moving and visually beautiful the last jedi while flawed is a breath of fresh air you will want to experience again and again so how to summarise this films plot without spoiling anything too major well its best to stick with what you probably already know from the trailers expand on that slightly but leave the biggest surprises for your own viewing pleasure picking up shortly after the events of 2015s the force awakens the dastardly first order led by general hux domhnall gleeson continuing to chew every piece of scenery is now in the midst of an allout assault on the dwindling resistance led by princess leia carrie fisher may she rest in peace after a swarm of star destroyers discover the rebellions secret location right in the middle of their mass evacuation leia and her rebels find themselves sitting ducks out in space and quickly running out of fuel meanwhile on the island where we left rey daisy ridley and longlost jedi legend luke skywalker mark hamill rey is desperately attempting to recruit luke to restore hope to the rebellion cause and join his sister leia in her fight against hux and the evil supreme leader snoke andy serkis but our dear luke has long parted ways with the force after his failure to stop kylo renben solo adam driver from turning to the dark side left him broken and defeated and yes  the island happens to be populated by the porgs youve seen in the trailer and at every toy store lately im happy to report they are devastatingly adorable sparingly used and not at all the franchises new jar jar binks phew as for our other heroes rebellion fighter poe dameron oscar isaac and his brash and bold ways ie he cant follow orders are causing clashes with leia and her new offsider admiral holdo laura dern a purplehaired senior member of the resistance who takes a particular disliking to the triggerhappy poe defected stormtrooper finn john boyega has awoken from his coma and quickly made a new friend in rose kelly marie train a scrappy resistance pilot whos rather dazzled by finns heroic reputation as the pair head off on their own sidemission they may just be the key to saving the day for the desperate rebel fleet thats really all one can say without giving too much away you can pretty much guess theres plenty of huge space battles dazzling lightsaber fights epic moments of joy and sadness and a whole swag of genuine shocks and surprises all woven into these barest of plot details for those concerned writerdirector rian johnson would cheaply deliver a simple remake of the empire strikes back rest assured that is not the case at all johnson has crafted something that of course pays deep tribute to the original films but boldly carves its own path stamped with the directors indelible and unique style and vision with films like brick and looper johnson has shown his flair for a more avantgarde style of filmmaking doted with offbeat humour surprisingly disney has allowed him to inject the star wars franchise with plenty of moments of his surrealist talent one scene involving rey a mirrorlike alternate dimension and a simple click of her fingers is truly beyond what were used to from these films and yet it somehow works completely the humour can feel somewhat trite at times and a little unusual for a star wars film but in a narrative with a rather bleak tone its desperately needed and the jokes thankfully work more often than they dont in saying that the screenplay is far from perfect particularly around the films middle act where the action almost grinds to a halt and plods along rather frustratingly of particular frustration is a rather unnecessary sequence involving finn and rose travelling to canto bight a casinoesque city where rich and glamourous citizens gather to berich and glamourous its here the film gets a little preachy as it rather pointlessly attempts to provide biting commentary on notions of greed excess class status and even animal cruelty its admirable to see johnson exploring themes unfamiliar to this franchise but it feels so jarringly outofplace ultimately briefly pulling you right out of the story if it doesnt i suggest you check out netflixs okja which handled these very themes far more cleverly but all is forgiven with the films incredible final act featuring some genuinely gripping and tense moments and a beautifullyfilmed battle on the planet crait with its surface covered in crusted salt over crimsonred soil the bloodcoloured trails created by the action on the planets surface are downright stunning and leave an impression like few other visuals in this epic film for all of johnsons quirky storytelling he still knows how to deliver the action and the spectacle the mix of cgi and physical production is seamless and the space battles are thrilling and spectacular the lightsaber duels are some of the best weve ever seen all choreographed with such wondrous precision and intensity as a visual piece of cinema its another triumph for this franchise the action is terrific but the focus on character is the films crowning glory johnsons screenplay creates multiple narratives within narratives but hes a filmmaker who knows how to handle them perfectly and nothing with our returning cast ever feels underdeveloped as a writer hes taken the foundations of our characters set by jj abrams and takes them into deeper and sometimes darker territories the evolution of the strange connection between rey and kylo ren is a particular highlight and both ridley and driver take their characters to wonderful new levels ren is still heavily burdened by the deep conflict he feels between his past and future and driver superbly handles the psychological torment his character constantly struggles with for those who had reservations about his performance in the force awakens prepare to be blown away by the films conclusion poe is given far more to do in this film and isaac runs with the opportunity to take his character further particularly towards the films climax his comedic interaction with general hux is another of the films highlights and hux himself gets far more great moments than he did in the first film finn suffers with the least character progression which is a damn shame as boyega has proven he is worthy of a great storyline maybe next time and sadly once again captain phasma gwendoline christie is completely wasted while we may find these characters in the same place we left them in the force awakens they all ultimately wind up in very very different places over the course of the film setting up an incredible closing chapter to this trilogy in twoyears time and then theres our beloved original siblings luke and leia as difficult as it is to watch knowing its her final performance the film is a beautiful tribute to both carrie fisher the film is dedicated to her which elicited huge applause from my cinema and princess leia as always fisher gives such gravitas to her performance and leia will always stand as her immense legacy to cinema hamill is sublime as the bitter and defeated old man luke has become his character arc is ultimately the films glory and its a beautiful journey to travel on he delivers such deep complexity and tragic pain to luke and its a staggering difference to the hero we once knew when brother and sister finally reunite its genuinely cinematic magic bring the tissues unfortunately the same cant be said for the new additions to the existing cast of characters rose is rather adorable both instantly lovable and endearing but outside of a brief plotline involving her sister theres barely any character development for our plucky new rebel regardless its impressive to see an asian heroine front and centre in a star wars film even if theres perhaps a hint of ulterior motives behind it cough chinese boxoffice dollars cough  admiral holdo may be shrouded in mystery for most of the film but shes a fairly unnecessary addition to the story and the less said about benicio del toros completely useless new character dj the better both actors normally so great are relatively wasted and underused and they ultimately steal focus and screentime from far more worthy characters in terms of its technical achievements it should come as no surprise the film looks and sounds phenomenal composer john williams is his typical best injecting his score with both nods to the past and creations of the future its the kind of stirring score we always expect from the master film composer and it never feels too familiar or overdone steve yedlins cinematography is truly gorgeous as is the production and costume design from rick heinrichs and michael kaplan respectively the film is perhaps a little too long and editor bob ducsay could have been a tad more generous with his trimming especially around the middle portion of the film but its a minor quibble in such an enjoyable and entertaining piece of cinema for all its issues rian johnson has delivered something entirely fresh to a franchise now in its eighth film that in itself is a remarkable achievement that has to be admired hes taken great risks and made some incredibly bold choices to deliver something that feels both touchingly familiar and daringly original its an evolution of star wars to new places yet still remains authentically grounded in a universe beloved by so many every bit as enjoyable and entertaining as the original trilogy the last jedi is not exactly perfect but it gets damn close
Jan 29 2019,positive, the stylish episode viii of the star wars franchise the second of a trilogy that began in 2015 with star wars the force awakens was given the title of the last jedi and keeps dividing audiences worldwide while its visual impact is undeniable old and new characters work together to infuse zest and grittiness in an impetuous inspiration by rian johnson brick looper who penned and directed with equal doses of passion and fascination the director actually captured the tonal spirit of the preceding episodes and elevated it through bold and fresh ideas however this spacial opus could have run shorter than the two hours and a half without major loss the spectacular battles between the dominant first order an evil military junta commanded by the supreme leader snoke andy serkis and the resistance led by general leia organa carrie fisher are in the center of the attention however and because this is far from being a tacky tale one can find a decent emotional side attached to it as well as a winning humor which associated to speedy action scenes regales with an inviting diversion in this episode rey daisy ridley travels to the secluded planetary island of ahchto where luke skywalker mark hamill a jedi master turned hermit decided to hide six years before she wants to convince him to join the resistance after the initial stubbornness and refusal luke ends up accepting the challenge and even teaches her the ways of the jedi as he sees a lot of courage righteousness and skills in her that are so characteristic from the force however rey communicates telepathically with the venomous kylo ren adam driver son of leia and han solo whose ambiguous behavior and sly intentions will drag her to snokes den on another front we have the former stormtrooper finn john boyega teaming up with rose tico kelly marie tran a maintenance worker for the resistance that appears for the first time in the series i dont see her as a super strong character though also the often funny xwing fighter pilot poe dameron oscar isaac does what he has to do for the sake of the light with fearless bravura even if he needs to confront his inflexible stern superior the vice admiral amilyn holdo laura dern  as a bold director johnson didnt turn his face to risk or experience and his efforts become successful the stunning teteatete between skywalker and kylo ren was the most exciting moment of the film culminating in a sophisticated artifice of teleportation it felt like i was in a video game without being able to control it star wars the last jedi was dedicated to carrie fisher who died of cardiac arrest on december 15 the last installment of the trilogy will be released in 2019 having jj abrams once again in the directors chair
Jan 26 2019,positive, hey its time to review the new star wars a movie youre probably going to see anyway as someone who really doesnt hold much affection for the star wars franchise my love of the force awakens really shocked me not only did it end up making my end of the year 10 best movies in 2015 but it also was what i still think of as a pitch perfect blockbuster  one that breathed new life into that universe introduced nuanced and compelling characters and looked pretty terrific while doing it i couldnt have imagined a situation where i found myself caring about where the plight of the jedi and their ragtag companions could possibly go but yet somehow jj abrams kathleen kennedy and company all pulled it off in the between time i had to suffer through rogue one but it was okay because i knew rian johnson would be at the other end of that tunnel to cradle me in his bearded embrace his the last jedi which picks up literally within moments of the end of the force awakens paints a picture of a struggle that never took a breath the resistance led by general leia find themselves in the middle of a back and forth with general huxs first order hux truly the bitchiest member of this new iteration of the empire gets into a humorous bit of dialogue with a solo poe dameron scouting just ahead of a charge of bombers who are attempting to lay waste to the first orders colossal dreadnought while this event will set the stage for what drives poe finn leia a few new additions to the cast and the entire resistance itself its also probably the last time audiences are held subject to the standard light and dark side debate that has populated these films as a rule it was the accepted line of thinking that the guys dressed in black are bad and the scrappy underdogs in white and various lighter shades are the good guys well mr johnson was going to have none of that as the last jedi is a film all about the debate of what lies between those two extremes not every character necessarily approaches moral grey tones but even those characters that are what we deem to be inherently good or bad are faced with conflicts that drive a question into the morality of their cause a daring choice for the worlds most popular blockbuster series but when johnson who both writes and directs here centers in directly on that theme the last jedi does something that is all too rare for the star wars series introducing new notions within the sphere of its seemingly impenetrable worldview and new ways of how we might conceive the two warring factions and the people that have to work for them and the little people who find themselves under their boot heel but as a caveat the further away the filmmaker gets from this novel approach the less effective the film becomes this can be seen clearly in the division of narrative between the three major protagonists of the force awakens each hero from that last outing rey finn and poe are given their own slice of the film within which to work and its clear where in each of the three that johnsons interests chiefly lie reys storyline the most effective of the trio finds her making contact with the longlost luke skywalker in an attempt to bring him back into the fold of the resistance and in turn determine her own place within it and the force itself additionally this is where kylo ren the wayward son of the now deceased han solo and leia is directly involved  and if this series does nothing else it absolutely 100 proves to me that he is the most unique and welldeveloped character of the star wars universe here he is basically the mouth piece for johnsons vision of this struggle and every scene he and rey share outshines everything else that surrounds it we knew adam driver was a compelling and nuanced actor even before this film began to roll but the surprise here is just how well daisy ridley is able to match drivers wellknown intensity luke plays a sort of middleman between them and its not a stretch to say this is surely mark hamills best outing in the role hes given a good deal of meat to chew on as a bearded reclusive version of the previous trilogys central hero the most welcome element on hand is just how effectively hamill carves out this elder version of the character and stands separate from any temptation to make him the obi wan of this entry from the emotional beats he presents and the general sense of stubbornness throughout you can conceivably believe this is the man that luke grew into oscar isaacs poe dameron gets a lot more to work with this time around rather than just being the very likable handsome pilot guy hes now the commander of the resistance fleet and our pov within the machinations of their operating order through his story we spend most of our time with leia as well as lauren derns purplehaired vice admiral amilyn holdo in this way poes end of the tale works as a counterpoint to the ongoing struggle between hux and kylo ren in both cases we see the innerworkings of office politics and their respective power struggles poe is faced with issues related to the chain of command especially in times of crisis  theres a not too subtle influence of battlestar galactica present here it is an arc that is mostly effective though somewhat truncated by its proximity to the least compelling storyline of the film which brings us to poor old finn finn who occupied an exciting space within the force awakens that of the faceless stormtrooper turned hero is saddled with what is basically a gigantic fetchquest and the onboarding of a new character in kelly marie trans rose tico a member of the resistance who volunteers to help him on this sidemission that feels like it lasts 10 years not only are the sequences they are involved in the least exciting of the entire affair but they also are the stretches that rely the most on green screen and iffy special effects neither of which are johnsons specialty one of the troubles here is that finn basically is static throughout and hes grafted to what is basically a nonentity in rose a character who in theory fits right alongside the themes that are being developed in all three storylines to some degree but the execution of the character is the thing and rose never seems to grow beyond earnest with a connection between these two that feels rushed to say the least theres a lot of tell here and nowhere near enough show and to briefly get back to the subject of carrie fisher her return here is bittersweet as her passing last year does indeed echo within every scene she appears but thankfully she is the centerpiece of two of the last jedis most touching moments one that is especially artful and the other overflowing with emotion striking a nerve in a moment that is sure to choke up audiences despite the scripts occasional lapses there is at least some worthwhile study for the cinephiles in the crowd as the stark contrast between the abrams approach with his wide environmental vistas and shots that are mostly at eyelevel with his actors vs that of johnson who takes a slightly more up from the ground viewpoint with much of the action occurring inside somewhat claustrophobic settings makes for a unique point of comparison between two very different filmmakers its not that i expect much auteur imprint but its nice to get a hint of the artist behind the camera which is apparent in both instances and likely where a lot of the rewatch value will be found where this reviewer is concerned star wars the last jedi is a tale of one really great a plot and character progression and a pair of solid and undercooked storylines respectively that are tied together as a sortof b and c plot the good news is that by the time the movie enters its climatic final moments it hits a pretty good groove before the credits though the way it comes together isnt exactly graceful on the whole its an outing that could have done a little more with less and while johnson and company are bursting with ideas some of which defy expectations they dont all work and the overly bloated running time of 152 minutes is a testament to that fact the truth is theres an entire segment of the film that could have been excised completely from the script and not much would have been lost when it works it really works but the fat overwhelms it all too often johnson acts as a sort of caretaker to the concepts and characters introduced in 2015 and to his credit he gets them from one end of the film to the other without any major hiccups save for finn but with that said i find myself far more enthused to see abrams pick the baton back up for episode ix and close out what he started they should have gone with the novel approach in the sense of setting the trilogy in the existing movie and novel canon that already existed give us new legends  ill see it anyway to see carrie fisher one last time and for hamill in a meaty role no idea if ill see any more sw i have no interest at all in the young han solo movie i figured reviews like mine are deep in the minority as im seeing a lot of effusive praise in my immediate sphere and a pretty high rotten tomatoes score fwiw though i havent had time to go scouring to really get a sense of the consensus  thought my tastes must be the inverse of yours when you said you love tfa but didnt like ro but i saw tlj last night and couldnt agree more finns storyline is actually pretty dire comparing the pretty awesome into sequence to the pointless nonsense of the casino planet is like night and day  also the constant sappy mottos the spark that will relight the rebellion and inorganic dialogue relating to good vs evil seriously hurt the conversations both the serious tone and jokes worked well but sometimes the comic diversions got prequel trilogy levels of silly the inconsistent flow of time was a constant irritation some plot details like roses medallion or holdens withholding of her plan were frustratingly stupid i never cared about the stakes and its a film with no ending  some amazing parts too the intro and the storylines of rey luke and kylo were ace and the final battle was in parts quite cool overall though not a great film there was a good hour in the middle that i wouldnt want to watch ever again i dont know why anyone would be surprised that the force awakens is a really good movie its essentially a remake of the original and that is a flat out great motion picture not a great scifi or nerd flick its a legitimately masterful exercise in storytelling the last jedi can be no worse than the fifth best star wars flick because theres some genuinely good stuff in it and none of the bad stuff is shoved down your throat as hard as it was in the prequels this movie is not going to age well though and its so fundamentally flawed that i cannot comprehend the amount of worshipful praise its received from a lot of critics saw it yesterday its a good but not great movie hamill is excellent the fraillooking carrie fisher is touching all the acting was at least competent rose was a good addition to the cast i was glad that  spoiler alert  rens parents turned out to be nameless nobodies that was realistic maybe now people can stop speculating that luke is her father i was pretty satisfied overall i could probably nitpick over things and probably will later at least it was better than rogue one 2 hours of boredom capped by an exciting battle i was never bored during last jedi
Jan 26 2019,positive, its 2017 and its time to write about luke skywalker being a showstealing character its one of the many weirder things about star wars being back but im happy to see the character get to put in another great appearance the film overall can be summed up like this great opening great ending dull middle two out of three aint bad lets take a closer look then only general leia organas band of resistance fighters stand against the rising tyranny certain that jedi master luke skywalker will return and restore a spark of hope to the fight rey daisy ridley  rey has come from obscurity to realise she has a strong connection to the force she has found the legendary luke skywalker and hopes he can help point her in the right direction luke skywalker mark hamill  luke failed his own nephew ben solo and has since ran off to hide wishing to die amongst the ruins of the first jedi temple can the recently visited rey change his mind rose tico kelly marie tran  a lowtier member of the resistance who idolizes those at the top the first order took everything away from both her and her sister and she is happy to help fight them any way she can vice admiral holdo laura dern  a vice admiral gasp in the resistance she can be a little standoffish a little hard to crack but does have the resistances interests at heart the first thing that pops into my mind is luke skywalkers arc mark hamill has never been better which is good because the material hes been asked to act has never been more complex lukes a broken and bitter man when rey first meets him and to eventually hear him talk about the old jedi order and himself as arrogant shortsighted and pretty much stupid was an eyeopener he was right though he momentarily had a moment of weakness when he felt ben solos darkness growing and thought to kill him in his sleep and this lead to ben waking seeing what was going on and eventually go crazy just one tiny thought and it cost him everything instead of blaming snoke who was manipulating bens darkness and fight him he ran in shame heavy stuff not very luke skywalkerlike as i mentioned in force awakens but writerdirector rian johnson made the best of a bad situation when rey goes off to fight he gets visited by yoda who pretty much tells him he was right mistakes have been made in the past but forget about the old order and use your mistakes to teach oh whats that the rest of the movie right well the relationship between rey and kylo ren was great in this the two become connected via the force able to speak and even touch each other halfway across the galaxy despite everything the two form a bond with rey believing that ren can be saved she goes off to meet him and ends up in handcuffs and brought to snoke who for the record orchestrated all of this this plays out almost exactly the like the scenes between the emperor luke and vader in return of the jedi except ren sneakingly kills snoke and then battles his guards alongside rey it was a great moment mostly because of how snoke felt ren about to ignite his lightsaber and strike down the one he wants to kill but didnt realise his apprentice was manipulating lukes old lightsaber that was on snokes throne rather than his own one leading to his end a very clever scene and the battle between rey ren and the guards was great sadly for rey kylo ren now claims hes going to tare down everything old and rebuild it anew and wants rey by his side to do it which of course rey wants no part of the two fight over lukes old sabre before being blown backwards rey escapes and rejoins up with the resistance and kylo ren becomes the new supreme leader setting up a big battle between the two in episode ix its a very fun dynamic one of the best scenes has to be vice admiral holdo and her suicide ship ram basically snokes impossibly gigantic ship is looming over the remains of the resistance fleet so she alone on the cruiser points it at the superlarge vessel and lightspeeds through a good portion of it it was so beautifully shot as soon as it happens all sound cuts out and your treated to a light show as the ship explodes and nearby star destroyers are lit up by it its such a great moment i also have to say that this film does a great job of making the resistance out to be against the wall thats for sure they lost their entire governing body in episode vii here they lose a bunch of ships and soldiers in the opening battle including admiral ackbar no and every other highranking general in the resistance barring leia and eventually are down to one ship then just a group of them in a small factory on a salty planet talk about underdogs okay so this film isnt perfect it really sags in the middle after the resistance start to pull away from the enemy fleet they two sets of ships get into some sort of space lock thing where the first order cant catch up to the resistance ships so just slowly barrage their shield for the hell of it and wait for them to run out of fuel this is the set up for like over an hour of the film possibly an hour and a half during this we get some good luke and rey training scenes but we also get a subplot of finn and rose going to a casino planet and trying to find a codebreaker then freeing a bunch of tamed and mistreated animals make their way back get on board snokes ship get caught and escape all of which has no effect of any of the plot its complete filler with the possible exception of getting rose and finn close for presumably romantic purposes in episode ix but you could literally cut that whole thing out and it would make no difference captain phasma who literally did nothing of note in force awakens returns  and gets swiftly beaten by finn and seemingly killed in minutes jeez why bring her back at all although i get you needed someone to manipulate ben solo and command the first order but snoke in the end was pretty pointless he was a means to give kylo ren powers and then thrown to the side when it was time for ren to take command im sure hell have a good backstory in expanded media but still seems like a waste especially since i actually liked his cheesy evil ways in this film even though i liked his death scene hmmm kind of a mixed bag this one well then as i summed up in the opening paragraph this film starts off great and ends great but sags in the middle that being said im almost tempted to give it 5 stars for giving such a great send off to luke skywalker although im sure hell be back as a force ghost and throw in the great reykylo ren stuff erm hmm nah i still cant quite give it 5 during the dull middle i was metaphorically checking my watch to see how much time had passed waiting for something exciting to happen no matter how fantastic the bread is i cant forgive a disappointing filling still well worth your while going to see i didnt quite buy luke drawing his sword when he did so in return it was under a much more intense situation and luke would have likely developed at least somewhat more control as time passed i can see the thought crossing his mind but theres a difference between that and actually drawing your weapon all in all it just didnt work for me
Jan 19 2019,positive, star wars the force awakens and rogue one were both boxoffice successes and heralded as the return of the blockbuster franchise king but both have a similar longterm problem they hang onto nostalgia for the 1977 classic for dear life my review of the force awakens called it the first ok star wars movie alys review of rogue one called it flawed but enjoyable i still rewatch them the characters in awakens especially are dazzling but after two movies that so directly called back to star wars a new hope it was natural to start wondering if disney only had one trick up its sleeves with this new set of films so  star wars the last jedi has the unenviable task of proving whether the star wars franchise still has meaning and it manages to with tremendous success deeper broader funnier and more thrilling than its predecessor the last jedi isnt only the best star wars movie since the empire strikes back its the first star wars movie in 30 years to truly feel like an evolution of the franchise it may also prove to be one of the most controversial films in the series the story picks up where awakens left off separating our core trio of heroes  rey daisy ridley finn john boyega and poe dameron oscar isaac rey has travelled to the ancient jedi temple achto to meet luke skywalker mark hamill in hopes of luring him back into the resistance to retaliate against the evil first order led by supreme leader snoke andy serkis hux domnhall gleeson and kylo ren adam driver finn is unconscious in a medical bay after a battle with kylo ren and poe is helping lead the resistance evacuation in classic star wars fashion their stories separate and converge at different points it creates an odd but not unfamiliar pacing dynamic that writerdirector rian johnson navigates as gracefully as he can slowly building thematic resonance between their separate adventures strength of theme is where the last jedi separates itself from the other movies and where it is most similar to the empire strikes back while it moves the overall story of the trilogy further it also exists within a selfcontained unit of story that explores several specific ideas the nature of war the meaning of the force what legacy means each of the characters individual stories play off these ideas and all of them contribute to the films final statement yes there are space battles lightsaber fights and other dramatic reveals but beneath it all is a story of a galaxy at war and doing the absolute best you can do under the circumstances its a much more contemporary understanding of war than the original trilogy ever provided in that it understands conflict is perpetual and difficult to definitively divide into good and bad as the originals reflected world war ii and the prequels reflected vietnam and iraq this tale borrows from our globalized millennial understanding of war as a condition and collapse as ongoing it is marvelous the performances are all as good as theyve ever been  particularly hamill whose reprise as luke is everything you can ever expect and maybe more ridley driver boyega and isaac also bring real humor and depth to their characters given far more nuance here than in awakens the standout here though is the late carrie fisher whose general leia more than gets her due its a stark contrast from jj abrams direction of fisher in the force awakens in which he seemed unsure how to light or even shoot the actress johnson knows what fisher can do and he lets her do it its a tragedy that we will never see another star wars film with her actually in it but its also a wonder we ever got this one there are many plot twists in the last jedi that im hesitant to spoil but its worth addressing how deeply controversial many of johnsons decisions may prove to be the fact is that the star wars franchise has always been and may always be about that core mythological story contained in the first three movies a new hope the empire strikes back and return of the jedi are the great 20thcentury american mythology their prequel films are meant to be watched after them that whole machete order bull about watching them between empire and return misunderstands how storytelling works and their expanded universe of novels comics games and tv shows all are meant to be enjoyed in the orbit of those three movies the new disney era has so far churned out a remake of and a direct prequel to a new hope the prequels were three movies all leading to a new hope the last jedi is the first star wars movie in years to feel like it exists in a moral and philosophical universe that expands upon rather than takes comfort in that first movie it takes its time in the middle doing the hard work of setting up stories for every character that all pay off in the final act part of this is because the force awakens did a genuinely poor job creating threads for this movie to pick up another is that rian johnson is interested in telling a story that echoes through each individual arc its a movie that wears its ideas and cinematic influences on its sleeve a movie that aims for something higher its about hope in the darkest of times  you could argue thats the core thesis of the original trilogy and certainly rogue one and you would be right but its more than just that its about the legacy of hope the imperfection of heroes the passing of knowledge down from one generation to another in the name of something better it captures the eternal struggle  not between good and evil but within the lived experience of individual people faced with their own conflicts and hurdles beyond skywalkers vaders and redemptions jedi sith and empires legacy is the buzzword for reinvigorated franchises these days and many use it as an excuse to ramp up the same old stories with mere window dressing the last jedi is something new something beautifully realized that plays off what came before while finding a new direction you cant destroy the past you can only learn from it for the first time it feels like the star wars saga truly has
Jan 10 2019,positive, it is a fair criticism to say that star wars the force awakens is very similar to the original star wars and there was some concern that its successor would be a repeat of the empire strikes back while the two films share some of the same themes for instance the last jedi is certainly a much darker film than the first in its trilogy and it offers a different and muchneeded perspective on the star wars universe however it is still a fun and wild ride that could leave the viewer breathless depending on how willing they are to embrace a new kind of story in a muchloved world with a running time of 2 hours and 31 minutes it is no surprise that a lot happens in the last jedi there is very little filler and the story is jampacked with character development longawaited reveals and story progression the film takes place over only a few days and it is tightly focused on giving a full accounting of all aspects of the story the film picks up where the force awakens left off with rey daisy ridley handing luke mark hamill the lightsaber while elsewhere the rebels flee the impending threat of the first order  while i dont want to give away any plot details i will say there are some very satisfying answers given regarding character backgrounds and motivations that may be divisive among fans but i found most of them appropriate for the time we are living in and this version of the star wars universe the original cast members play bigger roles than in the previous film but they are for the most part passive and allow for the next generation to take up the mantle of leadership the last jedi is visually beautiful with incredible detail and tastefully used cgi but even the most fantastic of the many fights and space battles take a backseat to the characterdriven story where the force awakens dipped its toes into the pool of diverse casting the last jedi makes a spectacular dive and provides a wide range of characters most of the new people who are introduced are people of color andor women and they are given the roles of heroes and villains instead of sideline supporters carrie fishers leia is finally given the scenes she has always deserved showing her skill at leadership and giving us a hint at how she has kept the rebel alliance together all these years the subtle complexity of vice admiral holdo laura dern is the perfect example of how this film is an expansion of all the previous entries in the star wars universe rian johnsons script uses several callbacks to both the empire strikes back and return of the jedi but subverts them in a way that is rarely seen in franchise films instead of using them as nostalgia triggers the last jedi reminds viewers of what has come before and then purposefully diverges from those choices to illustrate the danger of repeating our mistakes our three main characters rey finn john boyega and poe oscar isaac drive the story with their hope their failure and their desire to make the world a better place that is where the difference between this film and all the others is the most striking it explicitly states that their struggle is not just about defeating the bad guy but about forging something new and better for those they love and those who will come after the last jedi is by no means a perfect film and your enjoyment of it will vary depending on your reactions to the plot and certain changes that are made to previously established rules but it is told with an incredible skill and is riveting to watch the information that has been revealed allows for intriguing possibilities and the implications for future installments will provide ample fodder for discussion the last jedi is disneys best contribution to the star wars canon so far and we can only hope that the final film of this trilogy will live up to the new standard an unrepentant feminist and lifelong nerd kt writes about everything from british weird fiction to the latest big budget superhero movie a midwestern childhood filled with star trek batman and classic 60s folk music has lead her down this dark path to the world of writing on the internet you can find her on twitter ktschaefer probably tweeting pictures of her animals substream magazine is a forward thinking lifestyle and media outlet that focuses on discovering and sharing the best in new music film pop culture and entertainment since 2007 substream has helped break artists and launch cutting edge content our writers and staff are located all over the world and are passionate about music and pop culture
Jan 8 2019,positive, star wars the last jedi has finally hit theaters but who is the last jedi really and what to make of the longest running star wars film in the franchises history one thing is certain regardless of how much you enjoy the film as a whole star wars the last jedi is designed to wring out every possible emotion from its audience that it can there is much at stake and director rian johnson knows this knows that the films emotional core is going to be the primary takeaway no matter what happens on screen he does everything possible to make certain that there is always something to feel even if there isnt always something to track logically the biggest problem with the last jedi is that there is far too much packed into it the longest star wars film before episode viii was episode ii attack of the clones which was mired with pacing issues and last jedi is unfortunately no different it somehow manages to have even more story threads going than any installment of the prequels ever had and is incapable of shepherding each of them to a satisfying conclusion there are a few diversions too many while the central storyline surrounding the fate of the resistance and reys time spent with luke skywalker needs a sharper focus the new characters that johnson introduces us to shine brightly but need more time to grow laura dern is spellbinding as amilyn holdo but the characters history needs more context for her overall role in the film to make sense she is featured heavily in the ya book about leias early days in the rebellion leia princess of alderaan but you barely get a sense of that past with her role in the film kelly marie tran flipping sparkles in her role as rose tico resistance maintenance worker who sticks to finns side but she deserves more attention than the film is capable of giving her particularly given how important she is to the overall plot benicio del toros mysterious turn as dj is an odd extra bit of casting that reads as though johnson just really wanted the guy in the movie and basically let him do whatever he wanted hes fun to watch but its still a bit confusing as to why hes there there are some clever curveballs that johnson throws into the tale while much early speculation from fans spouted the common suggestion that the last jedi would likely mirror the empire strikes back theres far less of the movie in there than one might have anticipated instead there are several places where this film holds narrative hands with return of the jedi often in the most unexpected ways occasionally the pieces where you can spot connections to the original star wars trilogy are incredibly jarring but episode viii has far too much going on in it to feel like a solid rehashing of previous films most of the overstuffed issues of last jedi come down to extra locations that we dont need or attempts to lighten the tone that dont fully succeed it reads as though johnson was concerned about leaving the film without enough laughs but many of the jokes are oddly out of place the muchanticipated porgs are cute and actually pretty fun to watch on their own but why they needed to be in this film in particular is anyones guess the detour to canto bight the casino world full of highrollers that was previewed heavily by vanity fair before the films release is a very distracting bplot that fails to pay out dividends in the films larger scheme making it a confusing and lengthy diversion but despite the unevenness of the film overall the last jedi succeeds in the places where it needs to the most specifically in reintroducing audiences to luke skywalker giving more background on ben solos fall to the dark side and allowing rey to continue to continue her journey in this story mark hamill has been waiting for this since he stood on a cliffside in the force awakens and didnt say a word and he gives everything to the performance luke skywalkers presence carries the weight of this massive tale in most respects and that presence forces the audience to ask important questions about the nature of this galaxy far far away the idea of what balance in the force truly looks like the difficulty of inhabiting a legendary figure who is still a fleshandblood person the true purpose of owning ones failures the pain that comes from bearing the skywalker name for both luke and leia is not made simple for the purposes of this storyanakin and padmés children have suffered dearly for their legacy and its clear that the galaxy overrelies on them to that end the knowledge that carrie fisher is gone is the sharpest sting of watching the last jedi and it cant help but stand out in light of the movies arc when these films started the plan was to have force awakens focus on han last jedi focus on luke and the final film focus on leia the events of episode viii offer a perfect bridge to that arc begging questions about leias way forward and the extreme personal sacrifices that can accompany being a leader and a literal embodiment of hope the greatest loss that we suffer in the last jedi is the knowledge that we will never see the episode ix that could have been we will never watch our general complete her story still the saga continues and this chapter ends with the sensation of a freshly opened wound its hardly surprising for the middle chapter of a threepart story but all pain is unique the force awakens came for your heart but the last jedi is here for your spirit with stakes that high episode ix is a frightening prospect indeed for the sake of allowing others to enjoy the film we ask for no spoilers to be given about the last jedi in the comments emmet asherperrin kept all of her feelings out of this review and will proceed to eat a million cookies in selfcongratulation you can bug her on twitter and tumblr and read more of her work here and elsewhere there is an art to smiling in a way that others will believe it is always important to include the eyes otherwise people will know you hate them
Dec 17 2018,positive, two years after the force awakens star wars is back with the last jedi rian johnsons take on the franchise and the eighth instalment in the saga given johnsons penchant for characterdriven movies and his sharp eye for a beautiful visual anticipation was high for what he could do in the galaxy far far away  and given the incredible success of the marvellous the force awakens the pressure was on and the stakes were high the republic has been decimated and the ragtag resistance is on the run from the actually massive first order and their deadly duo  kylo ren driver and supreme leader snoke serkis having secured a huge victory and then suddenly suffering a massive defeat general leia organa fisher poe dameron isaac and newcomer vice admiral holdo dern are left to rally the beleaguered troops elsewhere having found jedi master luke skywalker hamill in exile force strong rey ridley struggles to convince him to return to the battle for the galaxy the depressed and lost master is struggling to reconcile his failures in resurrecting the jedi order and now questions the jedi religion as a whole speaking of struggles kylo ren is struggling to let the dark side consume him fully  with snoke in his ear and rey having a larger than expected effect on him the conflicted expadawan and filthy han solo murderer is desperate to find his place in the galaxy just like rey finn boyega returns from his spineslashing during the force awakens and buddies up with resistance technician rose tran in order to infiltrate the first order and give the resistance a chance to simply survive let alone win the fight  and with the shady dj del toro and murderess captain phasma christie in the picture nothings going to be simple my first concern going into the last jedi is star wars movies without han solo tend to fall more on the side of average rogue one aside and secondly would this just be the empire strikes back in a new hat thankfully both of these concerns have been well and truly dashed are there similar beats of course but there are similar beats to many other movies out there too  one criticism that cannot be levelled at the last jedi is that its a duplicate of empire in the same way that the force awakens riffed off the original trilogy pretty heavily its also the longest star wars movie of the saga leaving johnson enough time to squeeze in as much story and beats as he possibly could and for the vast majority of the time it all works  compared to previous instalments this movie certainly takes a lot more risks  in terms of the perceptions of the jedi and the force visually its strikingly different the nonstandard narrative flow character motivations it feels a lot more ambitious than whats come before certainly since empire and its refreshing to see a new direction being taken its fair to say that the force awakens was a more fun movie more of a crowdpleasing movie though the last jedi has plenty of levity attached to it throughout performancewise the level is staggeringly high for a franchise not always associated with highclass acting after recent appearances in kingsman and brigsby bear mark hamill delivers the finest performance of his career as the embittered and exiled jedi master and carrie fisher rip also hasnt been better before the returning cast  ridley boyega driver  all show greater signs of maturity in their abilities and have grown significantly into their characters whereas oscar isaac is generally always good of the newcomers kelly marie tran shines brightest as the technician thrust into the fight and bright lights of casino city canto bight and is highly endearing with her performance andy serkis is badass as snoke period visually the movie is beautiful to look at similar to the force awakens and rogue one this movie is jampacked with stunning memorable shots and some fantastic as per usual visual fx the space battles pop with colour fire and expansive wide shots of massive star destroyersdreadnaughts and the more meditative moments allow for greater nuance in cinematography as a motioncapture creation as opposed to a huge hologram supreme leader snoke looks unnervingly genuine here as andy serkis works his wonder once more the sound design is also impressively handled especially in the stranger moments within the movie  as is john williams score which feels more accomplished this time around compared to the force awakens in terms of story the last jedi is full of twists and turns that will surprise and engage you in equal measures again the vast majority hit their mark as intended though a couple dont quite connect as well as johnson maybe intended space floating anyone its not bad it just looked slightly bizarre  the heavier emotional beats were delivered brilliantly however theres no one moment that steals the movie a la i am your father and the revelations are sprinkled through and the major reveals are handled just right especially within the third act with so many plot points being covered its inevitable that some moments werent as compelling as others and the casino arc was probably the weakest moment in the movie whilst still remaining a strong component some of the humour was illplaced at times and could take viewers out of certain moments but the vast majority is great also the porgs have i mentioned them arent the new ewoks thankfully and their small screentime is utilised just right there are some great space battles and incredible fight scenes also one especially that is a joy to watch  choreographywise and the location create a rewarding action scene crucially the stakes feel high as well it doesnt really ever feel guaranteed that the good guys will prevail  it certainly puts the war in star wars the last jedi is certainly an adventure that will pull you this way and throw you that way but never ceases to be anything but star wars  as different as it is in comparison to the previous efforts it stills retains the core essence of the saga it certainly will prove to be divisive but hey so was the empire strikes back when it was released way back when buckle up and get ready for a wild ride
Dec 13 2018,positive, the themes of this film are layered and have multiple facets to them one of them is to let the past die this message goes for the film but also the audience the last jedi respects its historic past addresses the legends of its lore and takes into account the events of the previous films but makes you think about them in a bold new way over the last two years weve heard every fan theory speculation and prediction possible for this film and rian johnson accomplishes to circumvent all of them and give the audience a film they werent expecting the second the film picks up from where the force awakens leaves off it instructs you to expect the unexpected from luke skywalkers demeanor and actions to rey and kylo rens arcs everything is given room to breathe and isnt spoon fed to force you into one particular way of thinking what rian johnson did is challenge these characters and challenge the audience of their preconceived notion of these characters like any middle point of a trilofy should rian johnson did not give us empire strikes back 20 instead he took what made empire special its unpredictablity and used it well for the middle point of this trilogy the characters all impressed in this film this mostly extends to three characters above all luke skywalker rey and kylo ren all three were used well and serviced in a way that adds to the lore of star wars and history of these iconic characters mark hamills performance as luke is nothing short of spectacular starkly different from his joyful and unyeilding hopeful nature of the original trilogy we meet luke in a broken state haunted by the past and afraid of the present while audiences might be wary of seeing an iconic character like luke in this state it is precisely why this characterization was so great it was a challenge to the audience and a challenge to the character to find his way back to the light luke had an arc that impressed me and his legendary status in star wars lore has resounding development without spoiling my favorite scene in the film was one involving him rey and kylo two sides of the same coin are developed well in this film both go through a soul searching arc that arrived to an interesting and unexpected destination  daisy ridley and adam driver are impressive and have developed right alongside their respective characters both moved significant steps in their respective arcs and im very excited to see where abrams and terrio take them for the final entry of this trilogy poe finn rose and bb8 are all serviceable and did their required jobs in the story as secondary characters while i felt the story thread with finn and rose in particular dragged a bit it didnt hinder the film much poe was developed well and is on a clear emotional arc in this film that will surly be developed and concluded in the final entry of this trilogy original trilogy icons leia chewy c3po and r2d2 showed up in true form and carrie fishers leia gave a resonant powerful and emotional performance as the princessgeneral it was a bittersweet but inspiring to see her and she had some of the best moments of the film rip rian johnson filmed one of the most beautiful films in the star wars saga filled with impressive striking and beautiful shots the last jedi is a constant eye pleasing beauty all backed behind john willaims iconic and powerful score overall the last jedi is great it challenges the characters challenges the audience and challenges the actors in the end it transforms into a film that will stand the test of time and rank right up with empire strikes back and a new hope rian johnson has proved his potential with this franchise and i look forward to what he does with a clean slate trilogy the last jedi is the best way to handle the middle point of the trilogy where the force awakens is feel good and nostalgia filled start the last jedi breaks new ground and moves the story in a bold direction that is healthy for the franchise in short the last jedi is a powerful emotional and ambitious film that makes for one of the best films in the series
Dec 8 2018,positive, here we are again for the third christmas season straight moviegoers have been treated to what once seemed unthinkable more star wars last year we were treated to the gareth edwardsdirected rogue one a star wars story the lost story that told of how the death star came to be and of the rebels who fought to find a way to destroy it i reviewed that film for geeks under grace and love or hate the story it undeniably allowed a trip back into the look and feel of the original films that hadnt been done for decades two years ago we picked up decades after the original trilogy ended with the force awakens episode vii for those keeping count directed by jj abrams whereas rogue one filled in gaps between the prequels and the original saga the force awakens plotted the course of a new trilogy of films with both familiar and new characters in a tale that was also both familiar and new how forgivable that sense of familiarity was depends on who you ask in it we found out the whereabouts of han solo luke skywalker leia organa chewbacca c3po r2d2 and more but we learn those things through a new tale focused on new characters like rey finn poe kylo ren general hux captain phasma supreme leader snoke and lest we forget bb8 seen by most critics as a fun return to the universe we love it ended with many unanswered questions now two years after that we begin to get some answers from episode viii directed by rian johnson ill begin by saying that this film has no problem with bucking conventions reacting to the line we hear from luke in the film we can correctly infer that surprises are aplenty with a fanbase locked and loaded with two years worth of theories and ideas of where things are headed rian johnson iced most all of them down like a hoth battle and just when you think oh wait this film has a snowcovered hoth battle too he explicitly has it stated that the similar look is only that and that it is all salt instead im sure that salt will be a good descriptor of the reaction of many who have their feelings hurt after their theories are torn to shreds but only time will tell anyway i wont delve into the plot other than saying that all the primary players are pushed into new more complicated directions trailers divulge that rey daisy ridley seeks the tutelage of luke skywalker mark hamill now embittered and in selfimposed exile for mistakes of the past those mistakes center around his past instruction of kylo ren adam driver himself now struggling further under the direction and expectations of supreme leader snoke andy serkis finn john boyega has recovered from his wounds but after reviving he is sent covertly by a desperate and disgruntled poe dameron oscar isaac with another resistance enlistee rose kelly marie tran to find a way to destroy the tracking mechanisms of the first order without these systems disabled the resistance leadership including general leia the late carrie fisher and vice admiral holdo laura dern will be effectively neutralized by the pursuing general hux domnhall gleeson and company while that may sound like too much information please know that i withheld far more than that and within those plot threads many many secrets will be answered and new questions will be posed while the force awakens played very closely to what came before it not just in look and feel but in actual storytelling elements the last jedi is very refreshing for the saga there was a boldness that came within those original films of fighting against conventional thought on what a scifi film could be here we see that coming against what we think a star wars film can be does every new introduction land flawlessly no but that boldness to try is a great thing to see play out one can tell that rian johnson is a true fan of it all and knowing that he is now entrusted to tell a new set of tales in a future trilogy is an incredible thing to look forward to i felt in this film that anything could happen and in this age of spoilers its quite the feeling do all you can to keep secrets just that and enjoy this film on its own terms back to johnson he crafts shots and sequences that feel unique to what we expect of star wars that will likely divide people but no one can fault the beauty of it all the middle films  tend to deal with some dark themes and that does find its way into the look of the films as well the same holds true in the last jedi the cinematography is absolutely gorgeous here and whether it be a lingering shot or a frenetic action sequence there are many of both extremes it is all a moviegoing pleasure to witness i watched the film in 3d but i am certain that the richness and pop lies more in the choice and execution of shotframing than it does in any postproduction tweaking for the 3deffect we go to new locales here that feel truly special the opulence of the space casino of canto bight in particular is like no place weve seen in a liveaction star wars film i cant wait to revisit those scenes again and again crait the red crystalline planet blanketed with white salts provides the basis for contrast that has featured so heavily in the films marketing and really those colors extend into the themes handled here as warfare ravages the surface the white is disturbed to reveal the red and it is effective symbolism like this that runs throughout this is a film that will be watched again and again as we expect of the saga but i do believe that we will appreciate these touches more and more as time goes on now watching the film again and again might prove to be a problem in ways for many up to its release it was reported that this was the longest star wars film yet and i have to say that it does feel like it as well thats really too bad because long films dont always fall victim to this had the film been engineered a little differently in ways i believe that it all could have clipped a little better for audiences and avoided critique in this area still i hesitate to say that because it would have likely truncated or eliminated some of the new characters in the film each of whom including the quirky slicer dj benecio del toro contribute important pieces to the tale being told even with the bloated runtime this film with all of its philosophical eccentricities and complicated motivations really does have things to say alongside some other relevant messages there is a central one of hope and heroism amidst dwindling circumstances that comes through strongly sure it is as on the nose here as it was in rogue one but it all does seem to be about inspiring some kind of social or societal outlook in ways that i havent seen before in any of the other films moreso than the force awakens there are some bold new points made that will surely inform all the films following and the force seemingly felt to be known and understood inside and out by the audience is shown to be even more surprising than we ever realized these elements will likely be divisive amongst fans but all in all its exciting to go along for the ride of it all all of the primary actors returning from the force awakens step up their game here and the new additions all do their part as well to make impressions alongside them ridley and driver are becoming the center of it all and each are making this new saga more and more interesting boyega and tran develop a connection that is fun to see and follow isaac is such an able actor and seeing him so desperate to lead and protect as poe is great knowing that the original intent for the character was to die early on after his introduction sadly my favorite new character from the force awakens maz kanata is used so inconsequentially here that i would have rather not seen her at all john williams brings all the right musical cues here with his score even if like the force awakens it isnt all exactly groundbreaking i do hope to hear him at least conclude this trilogy but at this point we wont likely hear sounds that approach his earlier works quality and inventiveness contentwise we get about what you would expect from prior installments some mild language intense sequences moments of violence chaotic warfare explosions and death mentioned or played out throughout that said these are films made to inspire audiences young and old and amazingly those qualities come to the forefront in this film in particular it leaves us with exciting possibilities moving forward especially as characters are played by actors and actresses of multiple ethnicities for christians in particular though i must say that some elements of the film may rub some of us wrong the jedi are referenced as a religion here and while that inference is nothing new it does invite critique to our belief system as well as others the film examines a questioning of ideals held throughout the ages a deconstruction of what we know and hold dear i believed this to be so long before release and i even wrote a piece on it then when the first trailer hit while this can open up some great faithbased discussions postscreening with believers and nonbelievers alike be prepared that the film operates as critique and go from there as always people will draw out or read into this film lots of religious parallels as is often the case with the star wars mythos still the messages i highlighted earlier are good for our time where many feel hopeless and inconsequential all in all i was entertained greatly by this film it did feel long but so many huge things occur that it all feels somehow justified with the crazy things we see done by starpilots and force users now is as much of a time of discovery as it is enjoyment i along with millions eagerly await the continuation of the stories of these new characters as they have taken their place as the primary players in this saga now they are inspiring children of all ages now just like the characters of past films have done before and thats an amazing legacy to see come about i eagerly await jj abrams conclusion to this trilogy knowing that rian johnson raised the bar even higher than what abrams had set until then i have a few more theater visits to plan and a bluray to preorder oh and yes porgs are awesome
Nov 19 2018,positive, star wars the last jedi changes up the franchise formula its longer than any of its predecessors and its uneven tone sometimes doesnt fit the series itself however the excitement remains with a plot that works commendably well in moving this story in a different direction in 2015 star wars the force awakens ended on a cliffhanger literally the film concluded with the idealistic rey daisy ridley meeting the elusive luke skywalker mark hamill the latter character appeared only for a moment before the credits rolled failing to utter a single word the anticipation about his characters evolution has only grown since then and the last jedi resolves that cliffhanger with unexpected results it was inevitable that some fans would be disappointed with the followup installment of this series considering the build up to it star wars the force awakens which featured some great new characters and a strong story struck more of a familiar tone to longterm fans in many ways it was very similar to a new hope which launched the franchise in 1977 the last jedi which also introduces some great new characters features some major twists that fans likely wont expect in that way director rian johnson takes this series in a new direction while keeping with some of the wellknown star wars story beats reys storyline for instance features her training under skywalker similar to how skywalker trained with yoda in the empire strikes back at the same time she communicates secretly with kylo ren adam driver the sequences featuring the duo communicating through the force create an intriguing dynamic between them showing the dichotomy between the good and bad sides of the force vice admiral holdo laura dern a new character here has a solid storyline as well one of the rebel leaders she faces off against hotshot pilot poe dameron oscar isaac who was introduced prominently in the force awakens the introduction of rose tico kelly marie tran as a young rebel also adds a new hopeful tone to the story in many of the individual stories though there are tonal distractions that stand out as obvious miscues an early scene featuring princess leia carrie fisher after an attack feels like it was ripped from another film scenes featuring luke surviving on his planet and milking an animal also has an effect of distracting the audience these are moments that never fit nicely into their stories and feel unnecessarily silly one of johnsons strengths here is also one of his weaknesses it oftentimes feels like he doesnt want to hew that closely to the stories that came before a common and valid criticism of the force awakens was that many of its story points were reminiscent of ones from a new hope the last jedi avoids that criticism by surprising audiences especially in the dramatic third act the last jedi isnt what you would expect in the star wars universe characters that once seemed domineering fall to the side concepts that were planted in the force awakens are shortchanged these elements are interesting because they show that this series wont only go in expected directions but not all of the choices that johnson makes work thats why even though the story works well enough this latest installment isnt the home run that the force awakens was
Nov 15 2018,positive, the wait is over for star wars fans everywhere as is tradition join us for over an hour of our initial impressions of the last jedi and stay tuned for part 2 dropping early next week
Nov 13 2018,positive, if jj abrams the force awakens was an exercise in nostalgia rian johnsons the last jedi is an experiment of expectancy it pushes the boundaries of its characters its audience and the franchises capacity upending our expectations even as it fulfills ones we never knew we had there are new worlds new characters and important new questions both raised and answered to put it simply this is a hopeful film it is moving into the future of star wars even as it honors the past the last jedi picks up right where the force awakens left off with exstormtrooper finn john boyega recovering from his battle with the darkly unstable kylo ren adam driver as maverick poe dameron oscar isaac and his resistance fighters try to make their escape from the nefarious first order all this occurs as the intrepid rey daisy ridley hands a lightsaber to luke skywalker mark hamill in an attempt to bring him back to spark hope in the rebellion even as she eagerly desires to learn the ways of the force from the jedi masterturnedhermit for all its parallels to the empire strikes back in structure themes and existential crises the last jedi is the funniest of all the star wars films not including the unintentionally funny star wars holiday special its also the most narratively complex with a cast of new significant characters including laura dern as resistance leader admiral amilyn holdo and kelly marie tran as rose tico a resistance mechanic who finds herself caught up with finn in an eleventhhour plot to save the resistance from total destruction a few of these narrative beats feel like they elongate the plot too much one such sequence on a casino planet think mos eisley meets las vegas frankly doesnt affect the final outcome of the plot machinations though it does provide for some humorous action sequences and character development still for all the narrative threads and various characters johnson has crafted a wellpaced thrilling star wars film filled with interesting characters and some rich ideas to explore there are a number of surprises and twists here ones which dont feel hokey or a ploy but which genuinely add to the development of key characters its not only the characters who grow in their capacitythe mythology around the force expands as well at one point luke asks rey what she really knows about the force her answer though innocent and simple also proves her naïveté and ours as the audience the force truly was awakened in episode vii in ways we can finally experience crossing the planes of time and space with a sense of purpose johnson utilizes the cinematic language to frame these force awakenings particularly in the editing and framing of characters in various conversations the planetary environments are also unique and interesting from the casino planet mentioned above to the redandwhite salt flats of a rebel base the cinematography is also rich and wellcrafted some shots still linger in my mind even now and one actually made me gasp in the theatre at its brilliance in the midst of silence with both visuals and soundthe john williams score is as wonderful as ever herethe last jedi certainly leaves its impact the last jedi also raises the question of politics economics and justice in ways previous star wars films havent broached as deeply while the political procedurals about trade routes in episode i are still painful in memory the politics im speaking of here have to do with class structures markets and systems of power and oppression we get to see just what the resistance are resisting and why the first order might be orderly only for those who wield power through wealth and violence we know why theyre rebelling and we can see the impact when liberation occurs for those enslaved supreme leader snoke andy serkis is more than a shadowy hologram we see him in the flesh albeit cgi flesh sitting on an enormous throne with a long golden robe these ostentatious signs of extravagance and greed along with the first orders military quest for power and snuffing out any sense of a republic and one doesnt have to do much mental gymnastics to make the leap to presentday political realities as one character quips its all just business in contrast to such notions johnson has crafted a sympathetic and affecting film one which truly values and humanizes the characters even the nonhuman ones did i mention bb8 or porgs or the other residents on lukes island or the lightsaber battles chewbacca the millennium falcon more porgs theyre all here in the last jedi and theyre wonderful i havent delved into the films specific plot details and i wont for now apart from one carrie fisher as general leia organa is far more present in the last jedi than i anticipated with her tragic death nearly a year ago and the ghastly cgi leia in rogue one i was hesitant that her role would either be too brief or cgiinfused i can say that not only is fisher a significant character here but she gives a remarkable performanceto the last shes fully alive hamill is significant here too as luke and imbues the character with a weightiness and maturity not yet seen in star wars id be hesitant to say its his best performance as luke but one could argue for it and i wouldnt disagree indeed the last jedi is one of the better additions to the saga in terms of form and direction its the strongest since empire strikes back as a cinematic experiment of expectancy it met then far exceeded all my expectations
Nov 6 2018,positive, granted youve probably never heard of the 44yearold director unless youre an ardent fan of his indie noir feature brick or his timetraveling action adventure looper but moviegoers everywhere are familiar with johnsons latest work the longawaited eighth episode in george lucass space opera epic star wars series the last jedi has brought in over 220 million domestically since it opened thursday making it the second highest grossing film on an opening weekend of all time behind 2015s star wars the force awakens its easy to nitpick such a broad bombastic film series but the last jedi seeks to please many masters most of whom have widely varying opinions about what a star wars film should be some will say its too long that it tries too hard to be humorous that it isnt funny enough that there are too many characters or not enough of insert your favorite character here everyone is right and yet everyone is wrong at the same time more so than any other film franchise star wars is a series widely open to interpretation as moviegoers we are allowed  and outright expected  to make each and every installment our own that there is a place for all of us in the star wars universe its the same notion that makes us question whether or not we like the last jedi because it isnt what we dreamed it would be and thats okay the eighth episode picks up right where the force awakens left off with leia and her resistance fighters on the run from the first order and emerging leader rey seeking out a now mythical luke skywalker to turn the tide of the war in what will be likely her final appearance on screen carrie fisher gives a measured layered performance as former princess turned rebel general leia the warmth and gravitas shes able to bring to the role grounds the last jedi in a firm sense of place giving johnsons film unanticipated but much appreciated emotional depth the same can be said of mark hamill in his return as luke skywalker like fisher hamills performance in the role gets better with age and his reluctant mentorship of daisy ridleys rey provides several of the films best moments for as iconic of characters as luke and leia are neither has been portrayed as carefully or with as much forethought than in the last jedi the three main heroes from the force awakens  ridleys rey john boyegas finn and oscar isaacs poe  all return for this installment and do solid work however pedestrian storylines for boyega and isaac leave the talented actors with little to work with and marginalized compared to ridley on whom the franchise has rightfully placed all their hopes while ridley does solid work as the young defender of the light side of the force reys dark side counterpart kylo ren proves to be more than formidable in the always steady hands of veteran character actor adam driver given more to work with in his second time as the heir apparent to darth vader driver does the best work of the entire film as the eternally conflicted yet increasingly evil son of leia and han solo johnson serves his film well by removing kylo rens vaderinspired mask allowing audiences to see the external and internal scars on drivers face theres so much rage in pain within drivers eyes his complex performance leaps off the screen at every turn while ren projects strength and brash selfconfidence the conflict within betrays him the nuance displayed by driver especially when paired against ridley is stunning it could very easily be the best cinematic villain since heath ledgers sinister joker in 2008s the dark knight johnsons film could rightly be accused of needing some extra time in the editing room the last jedi races off in several directions all at the same time and pingpongs back and forth between them at a frantic haphazard pace many of johnsons unique visual choices however will soon go down as iconic moments in the history of the franchise most notably a stunning battle sequence inside a first order ship and the films climatic ending which may leave viewers simultaneously in awe and in tears its highly doubtful that the last jedi will make much of an impact come awards season though this doesnt mean at the latest star wars film isnt a contender for one of the years ten best in the hands of a decorated auteur like johnson the last jedi is proof positive that cinematic creativity in blockbuster filmmaking can enhance a films quality without jeopardizing the bottom line audiences will laugh theyll cry and they may even complain a little or more realistically a lot but this isnt to say that star wars episode viii doesnt deliver on the promise that the force awakens started
Nov 3 2018,negative, synopsis rey daisy ridley attempts to convince luke skywalker mark hamill to train her in the ways of the jedi while various resistance fighters try to stay out of the clutches of the first order review although not plumbing the anomalous depths of rogue one rian johnsons the last jedi the eighth episode in the grand saga is a serviceable star wars yarn at best and ive a strong hunch that when the hype dies down in the months and years to come it wont be viewed in the same league as the original star wars trilogy and possibly even its predecessor the force awakens one potential criticism that the last jedi by and large bypasses is in being overly manufactured as a direct homage to the original trilogys middle child the empire strikes back just as the force awakens seemed a very canny repackaging of a new hope there are some visual motifs and pictorially similar scenes to the empire strikes back but theyre different enough in a chronologically jumbled order and completely inferior anyway so comparison feels by the by where the last jedi suffers more is from its plotting and structure it features at least one act too many has a surplus of action sequences and arguably loses its sense of denouement with that elongated feel a problem that carries over from the force awakens and becomes more evident here is the sense that the villains and villainy in general have been weakly determined its even betrayed by the way this trilogys plot arbitrarily accelerates the first order into a position of complete dominance from the off its an admission of a lack of confidence in suggesting the rise of the villains malevolent stranglehold plus that the producers wanted a dialectic exactly like the empire versus the rebels from the original trilogy snoke is a terrible villain in visual conception and dramatic execution and perhaps these issues with snoke are inadvertently acknowledged by a surprise scene midway through the film also kylo ren though a good character in his own right and well incarnated by adam driver is too aligned sentimentally to the resistance from the getgo to have the same purely evil gravitas of emperor palpatine or darth vader  two characters or spirits that this trilogy sorely lacks my final quibble would be that the last jedis use of flashbacks and outright telepathic conversations feels like the sort of narrative cheating that the original trilogy would never have done in its similar moments of jedimythic exposition and the use of yoda is particularly contrived and shallow here
Nov 1 2018,positive, star wars is and always has been an underdog story an actionpacked intergalactic odyssey about small legions of rebels rising against seemingly insurmountable adversaries star wars is rooted in an idea of hope against all odds and you dont need c3p0 on hand to butt in for that calculation after the politicallycharged prequels the force awakens and rogue one returned to this central conceit of a sisyphusian struggle  toil in the face of utter improbability  depicting new characters taking their turn against a tyrannical empire its limitless armada and impossibly supercharged firepower and with star wars the last jedi hope has never seemed so out of reach and victory so unachievable  starting back on the cliff that jj abrams hung his last shot in the most onthenose cliffhanger of the century the last jedi picks up exactly where the force awakens left off the newfangled core trio of rey daisy ridley fin john boyega and poe oscar isaac are as splintered as its legacy characters of whom han is now no more as fin recovers from battle wounds sustained in the prior chapter poe finds himself back in the cockpit proving his title as the rebellions best pilot but taking unnecessary risks for the sake of macho heroics think luke running his t16 down beggars canyon chipping at romp rats much to general leia organas carrie fischer chagrin meanwhile rey tries to convince a cantankerous and unwilling luke skywalker mark hamill to give her some much needed training in the ways of the force so that she can face down sith patricide kylo ren adam driver while the last jedi isnt a mirror image of the empire strikes back in the same way that the force awakens was to a new hope there are intentional parallels between the sophomoric chapters in these respective trilogies with rey training with a reclusive jedi master on a largely abandoned planet and our other heroes on the run from the empires imposing star fleet the similarities are obvious fortunately writerdirector rian johnson looper brick exploits our expectations as often as he can feeding an also decidedly onthenose narrative about destroying the past to make way for the new though dynamics look similar beneath the surface rian is often busy turning the norm on its head and here the last jedi succeeds we see glorious plans end in failure great hopes dashed and familial reveals that can be painful for all the wrong reasons unfortunately the last jedi has almost as much attack of the clones as it does the empire strikes back in that its overlong underedited and has at least one particularly longwinded cgi flurry of a sequence that harkens back to the darkest days of the franchise theres no whining about sand getting everywhere and the acting is really strong across the board hamill is particularly great back in jedi robes ham and all but the last jedi could definitely have used a second editorial pass more than one character is treated to a subplot that amounts to nothing more than a drawnout red herring with a copious amount of wasted time invested in easily editedout dead ends a scene in an opulent casino is easily the most painful yet in this new generation of star wars flicks eliciting images of the green screen busy set pieces of the early2000 franchise additions enticing to the youngest members of the audience who need their stories overly padded with shiny spectacle there are a handful of new characters including scoundrel code breakerlandostandin dj benicio del toro laura derns headstrong vice admiral holdo and the lowranking but highspirited rose kelly marie tran who makes the biggest impression of the new arrivals embodying the youthful glimmer of hope and rebellious spirit that once characterized a young luke even at over twoandahalfhours the last jedi doesnt have the room to do all of its characters justice with some internal transformations happening in a slapdash manner at plot convenience light speed the further stretching of the character stable comes at the expense of others usually on the villain side of the equation notably the pockmarked pinkfaced raisinette supreme leader snoke andy serkis domhnall gleesons puckered snarling and shouty general hux and chromedout bureacrat captain phasma gwendoline christie all of whose potential is again left wholly unrealized drivers kylo ren becomes an even more complicated character but even his true intentions remain a bit hazy and impossible to parse when all is said and done unlike previous installments the last jedi splits from its predecessors in taking a decidedly more nuanced approach to good and evil in the feature film continuity the jedi and the sith stand as polar opposites the later being a tempestuous pull towards absolute power but the last jedi further erodes the wall behind the two sides and brings to light the inherently problematic nature of the jedi order standing as some kind of moral superior luke goes so far as to call the notion of good and bad merely words questioning ethical supremacy in interesting and thoughtful ways that have only been hinted at in past installments but never to this level johnson proves more interested in the grey area than the stark light and darkness the exact divide that the jedi would like to prescribe to the breakdown between their kind and the sith morally ambiguity defines critical moments in the last jedi which makes for exciting and totally unexpected turns of tide but also draws characters to make shocking decisions that dont necessarily hold up upon closer scrutiny there are a handful of gotcha moments peppered through the last jedi that i wouldnt dare reveal here and though they make for huge audible gasps in the moment some left me wondering if they werent cheap solutions that only partially make sense in terms of character motivation a bond between two unlikely characters becomes the focal point of the moral ambiguity though the way that its ultimately resolved left me cold and unsatisfied as if johnson had written himself into and out of a corner by the skin of his teeth and then just left it to hang like a recently limbless luke dangling with little hope of rescue below though johnson tries to reach the emotional pinnacle of kylo betraying and killing father han he just cant manage the same goosebumpsinducing heights of the best moments in the force awakens much less the most iconic reveals among the franchises greatest hits thinking back on the last jedi less than 24 hours later there are really only a handful of scenes that stand out to me some glaring and unnecessary others wowing and extraordinary the new cast is generally more developed  its nice to see isaac get a much bigger character arc rey remains a standout and fin finds something to believe in  and fan service is kept at a manageable level but all and all the last jedi only has a handful of epic moments and theyre not enough to overlook its many shortcomings yes john williams score is powerful as a hug from a wookie  and the special effects are as stunning as hologram chess for the most part an apt blend of practical and digital but outside of the cold open i dont think anything really punched me in the gut the way that it was meant to like bantha fodder riddled with kyber crystals the last jedi is a jumble of really good and kinda bad with some rather harebrained plot holes and a saddlebagged second act that keeps it well outside the upper tier of star wars offerings for me expectations are a bitch and even though i tried to keep mine in check i couldnt help but expect more from a rian johnsondirected star wars movie jj abrams for his films many faults teed up what could have been a doozy of a sequel and though the last jedi is by many accounts a fine addition one with no shortage of laughs a bundle of warm fuzzies the divisive porgs are as adorbz as the ewoks without being anywhere near as narratively intrusive and oohs and aahs that moves the story forward in some genuinely compelling ways i cant help but express my genuine disappointment in the overall product but star wars is an underdog story disney overlords or not so

Oct 31 2018,positive, 2015s longawaited return to the galactic delights of the world of the light and the dark evoked a sense of unparalleled euphoria akin to no other cinematic experience a nostalgia machine it may be but the force awakens was exactly what the star wars franchise needed  a loving nod and reminder of why we still look to the stars 40 years after the first entry in the series the main criticism of episode vii was its glaring similarities to a new hopes plot  a sweeping statement but fair all the same however first time star wars director rian johnson is clearly one with the force as his bold fresh and ingenious ideas shine through this exceedingly better powerhouse blockbuster with the nefarious first order tightening their grip across the galaxy rey daisy ridley desperately tries to learn the ways of the jedi under the hesitant tutelage of luke skywalker mark hamill while kylo ren adam driver under the forceful command supreme leader snoke andy serkis seeks vengeance against rey and the resistance finn john boyega poe oscar isaac and leia carrie fisher must work to prevent their obliteration immediately following from the force awakens johnson demands your allegiance to the franchise in the sense that your hyperdrive should be primed to jump straight back in episode vii left us on an island with rey and luke the latter forlornly staring at his former saber the resolution of this moment is delightfully unexpected ringing true to the quote from the trailer this is not going to go the way you think this could be applied to the entire feature as from the getgo were thrown into a cataclysmic explosive space battle with an iconic dreadnought which emphasises the wars in the title in haunting fashion from here its an unpredictable emotional jump to light speed the setpieces throughout are elegant extravagant and exquisitely shot the lightsaber battles are kinetic and glorious to the eye johnson showing a keener aptitude for creating an epic bout utilising both extreme crystallit close ups and wide full body shots despite the problems with george lucas sacred prequels its a throwback to the exhilarating saber battles in those entries such as the legendary darth mauls its not bloody but its beautifully violent you feel the sizzle of every saber slash sometimes decapitating the opponent which brings out a joyous ohhh in the audience any sequence in snokes lair is a captivating red dreamscape that wouldnt be out of place in a windingrefn picture  the bravery in johnsons direction paying off in huge dividends through each scene whether it provokes intrigue or a smacked gob the anticipated proper return of hamill as the infamous jedi is a remarkable feat johnson takes the character in a surprising direction which in turns brings out a fantastic performance from hamill the force awakens use of han solo fuelled romantic memories but the last jedis use of skywalker is more similar to blade runner 2049s use of deckard shaw  hes central to the narrative with a few little nods here and there but mostly a beloved character whose tortured past is never in doubt drivers villainous kylo is developed far further surely becoming one of the finest foes in the series his performance perfectly captures his inner conflict the pull of the light and the uncontrollable rage of the dark leading to some unforgettable displays of emotion from the terrific actor when it comes to snoke the less said the better  not because hes bad but his presence is menacingly significant radiating terrifying power immediately johnson tackles a lot of narrative throughout the 152 minute runtime the longest star wars movie ever  yeeha rey and lukes relationship is a gripping focal point as is a new dynamic between her and kylo the plight of the rebels glows with hope with isaac playing a far deeper role this time round and turning into a firm leader its also a fitting tribute to the late carrie fisher whose inclusion here is mostly well executed boyega is a loveable hero and her new compadre rose kelly marie tran is a nice addition however as much as it isnt overbearing their entire subplot is when the adventure loses steam this moves the film away from where all the interest is  luke at this point it becomes a little disjointed and unnecessary never reaching a point of excitement required for a chunk of plot of this degree after this half hour passes and you desperately try to forget a momentously nonsensical leia scene the last jedi flies into perhaps the finest final hour in star wars history as much as it may be wonderfully different from the franchise norms it still feels unequivocally and truly star wars johnson gets it  whether it is through the both comedic and thrilling return of the charming bb8 the excruciating cuteness of the porgs or the visually poetic red dust from the salt landscape  its all an absolute treat wrapped up in a very tight package which gives nothing away for episode ix
Oct 31 2018,positive, theres one line in the film let the past die that defines the last jedis internal struggle one could look at that as a fairly ironic utterance considering the force awakens was essentially a remake of a new hope and that disneys star wars seems quite poised to never die but there is a sense of truth in this characters statement as the franchise tries to figure out its identity in a postgeorge lucas world star wars may look to its roots for narrative inspiration but it isnt quite sure what course to plot for its characters the last jedi does not have much of a plot without diving into too much detail the main conflict between the resistance and the first order bears more resemblance to oj simpsons slowspeed car chase than the asteroid field that han  friends had to navigate through in empire strikes back reys visit to lukes island dagobah fairs much better but theres still lingering questions as to what exactly happened to the world postyub nub that is never really answered i initially faced pushback for being critical of the force awakens lack of plot explanation from people who suggested that the film already bore the unenviable task of resetting the franchise after the prequels and couldnt be bogged down with too much exposition supreme leader snoke can be added to the list of things that are literally never explained the audience is never once told who this man is or how he came into power and yet the film goes on as if viewers should be expected to fear a villain who serves as little more than a cardboard cutout version of emperor palpatine darth vader is one of the most menacing villains in cinematic history while emperor palpatines machiavellian mechanics were largely saved for the prequels return of the jedi palpatine had the luxury of existing in a star wars world where the empire was the only big bad in town the last jedi is the eighth movie in the main series and yet it doesnt really have a single compelling villain kylo ren is neither scary nor convincingly evil captain phasma is the most useless character in the new trilogy and snoke is barely anything at all part of the problem is that the last jedi has a lot of characters but it never really seems all that concerned about doing anything with any of them original trilogy characters are used as little more than window dressings which id be more okay with if this new trilogy had big plans for its new leads director rian johnson has commented publicly on how this is reys hero story not lukes but this trilogy has never really been able to answer the question of what this story is supposed to be the basic questions that some people dont think need to be answered in the force awakens carry a lot more weight if this next film is the conclusion of this newer story it seems very possible that this new incarnation of star wars could end before the audience was ever given a reason to care we live in a world where big franchises are always playing for the next movie the last jedi forgets to live in the present audience members may identify more with the suave han solo or the powerful leia organa more than the whiny kid from tatooine but the original star wars trilogy belongs to luke skywalker this new trilogy does not make rey the focal point in quite the same way but its reluctance to commit to its new heroes forces one to question how old icons like luke and leia were deployed to serve the films purpose carrie fisher delivers an emotionally satisfying sendoff in her final role but lukes place in all of this is still treated in a fashion that its not his story never really satisfies some people waited thirty years to see this character on a screen again rian johnson tosses this notion aside without fully considering how fans might react in the absence of an alternative nucleus as someone who grew up a star wars fanatic who bought a sega 32x just to play star wars arcade and wrote poetry about chewbacca not getting a medal after the battle of yavin im increasingly okay with the fact that this disney version of star wars isnt ever going to be the thing fans spent decades speculating about rogue one served as the benchmark for how to enjoy a movie in a franchise i used to obsess about i wont be buying the expanded universe novels or eulogizing them should disney ever decide to retcon them again these are movies sometimes thats enough despite this fairly harsh assessment i did enjoy the last jedi i had fun sitting in a movie theatre for two and a half hours while some explosions happened and some people did some things a low bar that star wars cant help but hit when solo a star wars movie comes out ill go and see it ill write my review if only to reflect on the time in my life when this franchise meant something to me im not the person who needed every single incarnation of han solo action figure and star wars isnt the franchise that spurs debate over the ethics of blowing up the second death star the person in me who still puts boba fett in my mothers terrarium can still enjoy the franchise that still has a place for r2d2 i like that there are new star wars movies being told even if ill spend my review point out the very legitimate issues as c3po might say wonderful five year estradiol illusions anniversary ian talks about what shes been up to this year mostly writing and trying to get over yet another breakup life is a tricky game best to keep a stiff upper lip and get on with things thank you to everyone whos listened to the show over the past halfdecade we dont do as many new episodes as we used to but its always fun to catch up 
Oct 31 2018,positive, star wars is back and its probably not going away any time soon as much as both the force awakens and rogue one have received praise for recapturing the magic of the original trilogy in ways the prequels never managed they have also been criticized for relying too much on nostalgia instead of carving out their own identity as a result of this the last jedi has an incredibly fine line to tread on it has to move the franchise forward whilst maintaining that classic star wars feel the final result is probably not the movie you wanted but one that makes you realise what you wanted probably wasnt the best idea picking up right where the force awakens left off the last jedi wastes no time in getting the ball rolling on an extended but exhilarating and tightly paced adventure despite being the longest film in the franchise to date and filled with plenty of emotional character moments the film never feels like it comes to a complete halt much like the empire strikes back the film follows a multistrand narrative with our heroes off on separate adventures but all the storylines parallel and converge with each other much more smoothly they compliment each other in a way that makes the narrative feel more cohesive the second act is perhaps stretched a little too far especially in regards to finn and roses storyline but the movie knows when to cut away and progress another story when things start to drag but what really makes the last jedi stand out is how it plays with the core tenants of the star wars franchise making strong use of canon and nostalgia but twisting it to its own means rather than just making cute references it lovingly questions what fans know and have come to expect making it the first film in the franchise since return of the jedi where i genuinely didnt know where it was going you could almost say its intentionally unsatisfying in how it plays with your expectations but what it delivers in return is superior upon reflection and is ultimately what you really came for star wars for a new generation though some get more focus than others every major character in the last jedi gets a moment to shine and the entire cast puts in everything they have throughout daisy ridley gets ample room to explore the character of rey giving her an internal conflict far more intricate than any previous star wars protagonist and dissuading those mary sue arguments that erupted from the force awakens john boyega continues to excel as finn and pairing him with newcomer kelly marie tran as rose tico makes for a sweet new double act oscar isaacs poe dameron is given a more important role here and the character now feels fully fleshed out with a character arc unique to the franchise so far and promises that poe will continue to be a key player throughout adam driver really gets to sink his teeth into kylo ren proving himself to be easily the most complex villain in the franchise thus far not necessarily the most imposing or badass but that vulnerability is what makes him so fascinating the last jedi looks and feels like a classic star wars movie but rian johnson more than injects his own unique flavour into it the film offers far more new elements from a design perspective than its predecessor with unique planets new ship and creature designs and other aesthetics that feel fresh but still very much within the star wars brand the films cinematography moves and breathes on a different wavelength to previous films bathing the visuals with richer colours and playing with the camera work in a more modern but controlled way the sound design is absolutely fantastic using and revitalising classics sounds from across the saga whilst also creating new ones that slot perfectly into the canon john williams score this time around reuses a lot more themes from the previous films but they all have a new edge to them and all the new tunes are more memorable for the most part than his compositions for the force awakens star wars the last jedi does what no film in the franchise has done in 34 years it genuinely surprised me the film breaks many franchise traditions on all levels but it does so with a lot of respect and with the ambition to build something new and exciting from what remains it really is the empire strikes back of this new trilogy but not in the same way the force awakens was essentially a new hope it is structurally and tonally similar to that movie but the meat of it is wholly new material to the franchise its certainly the best film in the saga since empire and perhaps with time it may even surpass it rian johnson sets a new precedent for what you can do with a mainline star wars film one i fear jj abrams wont live up to in the next instalment but im excited for it all the same simply because we are now moving into uncharted territory the franchise no longer feels burdened by the traditions of the past and in a sense now feels truly reborn
Oct 31 2018,positive,if awakens was about the resistance and the first order repeating the cycle of the rebellion and the empire this one is all about how they have to become their own things and what the proper way to get there is going to be  and thats exciting
Oct 31 2018,positive, with star wars the force awakens the most signficant franchise in popular culture awoke from a deep slumber however it did so with a sense of familiarity that while perhaps necessary hurts the film in hindsight  but star wars the last jedi takes another necessary step that of subversion of the very things that the force awakens hinged on and in doing so the last jedi breathes urgent purpose into the new trilogy purpose it had yet to prove whats immediately evident about the last jedi  through a nailbiter of an opening sequence which includes an absolutely hysterical bit that tops poes opening of who talks first in the force awakens  is that this film is interested in people while some large scale action films focus on the spectacle writerdirector rian johnson and cinematographer steve yedlins camera situates us with the fighting the sacrificing and the dying that fuel those battles  when it comes to his focus on our main characters johnson succeeds in giving them all heavy deeply personal character arcs finn needs to learn how best to fight for the resistance poe needs to learn leadership that thinks ahead of the enemy that thinks of everyone that a potential failure in leadership might affect and john boyega and oscar isaac inject the same kind of charismatic vigor into their characters that made them so lovable in the first place but johnsons portrayal of luke skywalker this mammoth figure in pop culture is the films most dynamic feature and thats because johnson takes him out of the familiar out of what we know him to be essentially johnson dissects the legend of luke skywalker questioning that title by focusing in on kylo rens turn to the dark side years prior while at lukes jedi school it gives mark hamill new space to explore as a rehash of pure heroism wouldve failed to be profound and hamill offers up a hilarious pained tired and tender performance though the trilogy jumps decades we still get to feel the weight of those decades because hamill bares it tangibly and beautifully johnson intertwines lukes arc with those of rey and kylo in a way that challenges reys almost originaltrilogyluke sense of purpose and in a way that cuts straight to the heart of kylos lightdark conflict its a brilliant framework as the film adds new layers to kylo not only in the context of his turn but in the context of his purpose moving forward adam driver ingrains those emotions deep into his performance rendering him as one of the more complex villains in large scale cinema  the framework also places rey at the forefront mainly through her search for identity now that shes been thrust into the world of the force the films answer is decidedly feminist fitting into johnsons overall idea of who heroes are and daisy ridley capitalizes on the material delivering a performance that is appropriately searching yet also gripping in its painful anger and raw vulnerability the film is truly an ensemble piece even more so than most typical ensembles as theres a sense of individualized growth within nearly every character and the performances of the rest of the cast are wholly committed including vibrant work by newcomer kelly marie tran a towering presence from laura dern and a brave turn by the late carrie fisher  this is however where the film slightly falters as it becomes at times too stuffed with so much character work happening at the same time and in different places which impacts the films pacing certain moments such as when the plot needs to catch up happen too quickly or conveniently and other moments such as those of thematic significance feel a bit too drawn out the film also has four acts which is not unusual but it requires an extremely careful sense of flow and progression perhaps exemplified by the dark knight and while the flow from the third act into the fourth isnt terrible its unbalanced but the film despite its flaws is genuinely stunning johnson choreographs action  both in space and on the ground  with such rhythmic intensity and fluidity but also with an underlying grit informed by the films humanism and the settings within which that action takes place are so singular and transfixing often due to rick heinrichs spellbinding production design and steve yedlins soaring and awestriking cinematography especially in his long shots  the story while not perfectly executed also holds beauty as said before this film is about people and johnson engages with the political shedding light on the first orders impact on the poor and forgotten on those that come from nothing but a little bit of hope fascinatingly enough however johnson while portraying the resistance lovingly doesnt shy away from critiquing the larger notion of the machine of the resistance  but its those like rose tico marie tran someone who works alone in the dirty underbelly of a resistance ship and is not really a part of any machine who can embody a heroism in the face of tyranny that leaders of the resistance have yet to fully understand its heroes like rey who can represent the greatest that hope can stand for in that sense the last jedi is a new kind of star wars story along the way the film challenges a lot of what were familiar with especially in regard to the mythology of the universe at points the film almost feels satirical in how it critiques what we expect a star wars film to be  therein lies the films value more of the same especially in a wasteland of traditional unengaging hero stories wouldve been a shame it was necessary for the force awakens for that film to care about what we thought of it 
Oct 31 2018,positive,more than merely a continuation the last jedi is in many ways an ending to the star wars weve known and like many endings its anarchic and frustrating and poignant
Oct 30 2018,positive, after a couple of years of growing anticipation and rampant speculation rian johnsons highly hyped installment of the brand new star wars trilogy comes to the screen in star wars the last jedi the sequel is a whole lot of movie with a number of shocking moments interspersed between a lively and sometimes moving space adventure that builds upon george lucas modern mythology while forging its own path for that galaxy far far away whereas the force awakens leaned heavily on nostalgia with a story structure that mirrored the original star wars the last jedi sets its own distinct tone and structure that makes it entirely its own thing just to be clear im not going to give away any of the major revelations that occur within the last jedi if its included in this review you can rest assured dear reader that it is not anything that will affect your enjoyment of rian johnsons thrilling spectacle in the last jedi the resistance is struggling to survive as the nefarious first order led by supreme leader snoke andy serkis is preparing a deadly offensive that could lay waste the band of rebels snoke orders general hux domhnall gleeson to carry out the offensive while lambasting his sith apprentice kylo ren adam driver basically negging the young villain in order to better manipulate him the resistance is given a chance when ace pilot poe dameron oscar isaac leads a daring counter assault but the ensuing loss of resistance ships and pilots leaves the struggling rebels in a perilous situation with the first order tracking the ragtag resistance fleet across the universe there are few options for our heroes in order to survive the losses from the counterattack leave general leia carrie fisher no other option but to demote her ace pilot and later he will butt heads with vice admiral amilyn holdo laura dern in order to stop the first orders tracking of the resistance fleet poe dispatches finn john boyega and rose kelly marie tran a young and eager mechanic to travel to a distant planet and secure a codebreaker who can help the resistance free themselves from the shadow of the first order elsewhere rey daisy ridley has discovered the whereabouts of luke skywalker mark hamill though the oncelegendary jedi is disinterested in the ways of the force rey is attempting to pressure luke to come out of hiding and aid the resistance in their fight against oppression but the master jedi has no interests as hes haunted by the horrible events that led to the creation of kylo ren as rey learns more of the force her raw power frightens luke who sees the parallels between her and his nephew and those fears grow as rey and kylo interact with one another of course all these characters in different corners of the universe will find themselves colliding rian johnson wastes no time in establishing the tone that hes going to use for the last jedi the film opens with a sequence that is humorous in parts and absolutely thrilling visually providing us with a stunning star fight between the forces of good and evil what stands out about the last jedi is the way in which the film feels truly epic yet its story retains a certain intimacy the last jedi takes us to new worlds within the star wars universe that are fresh and lively rarely if ever mirroring places weve been before over the course of the previous eight films but the story is really contained keeping the resistance fighters on the run while rey and luke examine the nature of the force as much as we see old faces from star wars past the film never relies on nostalgia to make these moments work it creates new scenarios and conflicts that they must confront and the new characters continue to leave a lasting impression rose is a welcome addition to the sprawling cast and kelly marie tran gets some of the films most moving moments poe rey and finn are all added layers of complexity to their characters as they progress forward once again kylo ren continues to be the best star wars villain in the series history a character of uncontrolled rage amidst and ongoing internal conflict the characters go through significant changes over the course of the film theyre challenged and pushed into unexpected directions and then there are the delightful porgs and bb8 expands his skillset as a fantastic droid full of personality its important though to avoid any and all spoilers for the last jedi rian johnson takes the story in a number of unexpected directions often with jawdropping results so much of what occurs in the film carries great weight for the present and future of the series whatever the future holds for star wars the last jedi will leave a lasting mark on this legendary series with numerous moments that are shocking and powerful with just enough humor to cut the tension rarely if ever does anything in the last jedi feel predictable if jj abrams set the table rian johnson has delivered the feast now its up to jj to return to this series and deliver the dessert after such a satisfying meal as the last jedi jj abrams has got a lot of work to do satisfy the appetite of star wars fans an absolutely spectacular entry in the star wars saga rian johnsons star wars the last jedi delivers a thrilling experience full of eyepopping action moments of levity and shocking moments that will have people talking for years to come this here writing represents a symbol of sean mulvihills individuality and his belief in personal freedom hes also a hack writer who drinks too much and falls in love with girls
Oct 30 2018,positive,its safe to say the last jedi is one of the best star wars movies ever made its right up there with empire strikes back
Oct 29 2018,positive, the star wars franchise kicks into high gear with the last jedi the second installment of the reboot trilogy with director rian johnson taking the reigns from jj abrams and delivering one of the best films in the series johnson best known for the bruce willisjoseph gordonlevitt timeshifting thriller looper grabs the audience from the very first scene and doesnt let up guiding viewers on a thrill ride that will have audiences gasping laughing and perhaps even shedding a tear last jedi picks up where the force awakens left off with rey daisy ridley seeking help from luke skywalker mark hamill on a remote planet rey has been sent to find luke by general leia organa the late carrie fisher to help assist the resistances fight against the first order led by supreme leader snoke andy serkis and his protege and leias son kylo ren adam driver the rest of the story is best left unmentioned with jedi taking fans on twists and turns that are both nostalgic and full of wonder and discovery ridley continues to shine as the center of this trilogy a calm anchor in a universe full of chaos john boyega is also back as storm trooperturnedally finn making the most of his increased screen time the same can be said for oscar isaacs swashbuckling resistance leader poe dameron with isaac bringing a little of harrison fords han solo into his performance star wars veteran hamills increased role is welcome as well while fishers scenes take on an added poignancy since filming of jedi was completed just before her death in december 2016 the last jedi will draw plenty of comparisons to the empire strikes back and not just because both happen to be the second act of their respective trilogies like empire jedi explores some of the darker sides of the universes mythology with johnson who also wrote the film using the same creative arc that so perfectly connected empire to the original star wars and return of the jedi you can tell johnson has the same deep affection for the star wars universe as abrams did in the force awakens johnson fills his film with nods to the original trilogy but also offers surprising humor and a beautiful scope  from the battles to the details on the various planets including a sequence that pays homage to empires ice planet hoth johnsons visual flair as well as his ability to create tense taut action sequences really gives the last jedi its kick the cinematography is perhaps the best of the series with steve yedlins color schemes and details in every planet an incredible sight to behold at 152 minutes the last jedi might seem overstuffed on paper but its because the film has so much to say and so much ground to cover johnson does it almost effortlessly setting up the trilogys final chapter in fantastic fashion its easy to see why johnson has already been inked to do a new trilogy in the star wars universe after seeing the last jedi its a world full of imagination that johnson knows his way around if force awakens was the franchises revival then last jedi finds the series back in full swing with johnson delivering the best star wars entry since empire  to get micheal comptons review of the shape of water visit his blog at bgdailynewscomblogsreeltoreel or follow him on twitter mcompton428 email him at mcomptonbgdailynewscom
Oct 29 2018,positive, big bold and beautiful its hard to describe rian johnsons achievements here any other way this is the kind of star wars film that lives up to the grandeur of the title high stakes galore with whopping intergalactic conflicts no clean moral divides and drama within an inch of all lives depicted its a madder trickier vision than what j j abrams devised for the force awakens eschewing the nostalgic retreads that made that movie a little too familiar for its own good the last jedi decides to chart its own path oftentimes into territory this franchise has barely dipped its toe in most significantly the legend at its centre is no longer a tidy beacon of exalted heroism in his old age but a disillusioned hermit who knows hes responsible for a lot of the ill plaguing the films current climate i guess longtime fans would have reason to quibble with this sacrilegious treatment but these risks are warranted if this trilogy is to hold up down the road among the other things to like here the fact that the resistance is imperiled and on the brink of defeat for a good 95 of the film making it clear that theyre not impervious the interplay between rey and kylo ren which gives the latter more development than simply being a darth vader wannabe laura dern headlining the films defining moment those fabulous space nuns powerful women cutting poe dameron down to size though i still love oscar isaacs portrayal snokes cries and whispers red chamber the red salt planet whose bloodlike imagery feels like the perfect analog to this films métier and really those final 30 minutes which are so incredibly played by all involved like most im not a big fan of finn and roses side adventure which has the air of a spinoff story being tacked onto the main narrative probably to give finn a purpose since rey is doing her own thing with luke apart from showcasing the power of hope on a younger generation its not as well integrated into the seams of the larger story as it couldve been does it derail the film no it doesnt because the characters involved are still interesting and it advances finns personal development in a satisfactory way and truthfully id rather have finn do something than be incapacitated for an entire film another great thing about the last jedi it doesnt make guessing at episode ixs plot any easier the only certainty is that carrie fisher wont have new scenes in it and thats still a tough pill to swallow after her wonderful performance in this one a star wars film without its original three heroes is going to be a strange sight ive no doubt j j abrams will pull it off though
Oct 15 2018,positive, in 2015 the dormant star wars franchise was reawakened by jj abrams star wars the force awakens read the movies in focus review a gloriously faithful movie to george lucas beloved original trilogy the film featured many of the same beats as a new hope but it introduced a wealth of new characters to sit alongside fan favourites like han solo harrison ford princess leia carrie fisher and luke skywalker mark hamill the film ended with daisy ridleys rey standing on a cliff top on planet of achto bless you arm outstretched offering luke skywalker his long lost lightsaber the sequel was open to all possibilities  which brings us to star wars the last jedi rian johnsons film manages to be both brilliant and terrible at the same time a mix of classic mythos and insipid story telling the opening action sequence featuring oscar isaacs poe dameron is stunning a wonderfully presented piece of intergalactic battle illustrating that isaacs dameron is the heir to han solos laid back heroics we cut back to the finale of the force awakens where luke skywalker takes his lightsaber from rey and quickly tosses it over his shoulder like luke says this isnt going to go the way you think skywalker is to the last jedi what yoda was to the empire strike back  a quirky loner who doesnt want to train a young apprentice eager to use the force hamill gets to deliver a lot of great work here hitting comedic and dramatic notes with ease i would happily sit and watch a movie about skywalkers lonesome existence space survivor anyone away from achto the resistance fleet is on its knees running out of fuel and pursued by the first order and the dastardly trio of snoke andy serkis kylo ren adam driver and general hux domhnall gleeson it would seem that the plan for laura derns vice admiral holdo is to keep on running  something poe dameron doesnt do he sends john boyegas finn on a mission to sneak onto snokes ship and decommission a tracking device so they can make the jump to lightspeed and lose their pursuers its finns mission which takes the film off on a diversion where it didnt really need to go finn is joined by kelly marie trans rose tico a plucky mechanic wanting to fight the good fight against the first order together the duo visit a monte carlo type world freeing space llamas in the process before hookingup with benicio del toros mysterious criminal theres a lot of comedic hijinks involved in all of this which george lucas would have excised from the first draft of anything he ever wrote rey and kylo are also having some forcefulled telepathic conversations  you know the type i know theres good in you you will turn to the darkside join me etc most of this works and theres some nice stuff aboard snokes ship shade of return of the jedi which really works but sadly an editing fumble means that the payoff doesnt ringtrue in a film with a lot of extraneous scenes it feels like a disappointment when we dont get to see how rey escapes covering up a silly line like she stole snokes shuttle speaking of snoke hes offered very little back story and the character isnt really developed further that he was back in episode vii hamills luke skywalker is the highlight of the last jedi anchoring the film in the same way that harrison ford steadied the force awakens the late carrie fisher is given more to do this time around  but theres a moment in the film which could have been used as her swansong this wouldnt have had much of an impact on the main thrust of the story and it would been a powerful way to have her exit the franchise john boyega one of the highlights of the last movie is given a pointless plot thread that really has nothing to do other than keep ilm busy and isaacs cocky flyboy is grounded for most of the movie booking the movie with his piloting skills as a character it feels that ridleys rey is spinning her wheels a bit she gets some good moments with adam drive kylo ren a great villain but ultimately it feels like she spends every other scene being drawn to the dark sidelight side of the force theres more humour in the last jedi than previous star wars movies some of it hits some of it doesnt the much publicised porgs work for a moment or two but they outstay their welcome the film drew to a halt too many times to showodd cute creatures i didnt care for the crystal wolves during the climatic battle and the aforementioned space llamas feel like they belong in a disney movie wait this is a disney movie the last jedi has some great moments some of the best in the series but it also has some of the worst its better than rogue one a star wars story read the movies in focus review but it doesnt matchup to the original trilogy  or the much derided prequels in fact rian johnson commits many of the same crimes that george lucas did in those movies plot diversions silly humour cgi creatures but lucas handled it much better at 2 12 hours star wars the last jedi could have been tightenedup in the editing room cutting out that bloated middle section and removing things like maz kanatas cameo and the cute slave kids which feel like they dropped in from a totally different movie when it works it really works but when it doesnt it feels like bad fanfiction with a million dollar budget it will be interesting to see what jj abrams brings to the table when he returns for episode ix
Oct 11 2018,positive, synopsis having taken her first steps into the jedi world rey joins luke skywalker on an adventure with leia finn and poe that unlocks mysteries of the force and secrets of the past how about this take the force awakens is one elaborate schrödingers cat experiment as a bridge and a kind of reminder per the films director jj abrams the first rodeo in the galaxy far far away after a decadelong slumber sees two contrasting forces working in tandem  future and past new blood and old guard delicious uncertainties and foolproof guarantees rey daisy ridley is both facing luke mark hamill and her own reflection at the end it is both the studios new hope and a new hope that rouse the force by that logic a viewer can be pleased and displeased with episode vii but the last jedi isnt another lesson in sciencefact in every aspect conceivable the film no longer operates between two realms and the result is the most gratifying bigscreen star wars experience thus far while were at it shut down the another the empire strikes back line of thought too abrams in the same interview suggested the new trilogys remainders will be fullfledged pioneers the ones to see what the sagas tobecharted space of setting and storytelling has to offer now that is a seductive plug line one that is gladly not exclusively so as the decision to let midas touchready director rian johnson be in total control of the writing process he receives sole credit can attest personally the magic begins right after the opening crawl with a member of cinemas mostobscure demographic  asian

jedis runtime is but all are flashes once you completely let johnson be your guide other than the expected lift to great heights to flaunt the breadandbutter interstellar duels johnson takes us down  literally at one point  to star wars most universal and oftreferenced core the spirit while far from being an anomaly narrativewise this aspect has always left a vague and ultimately blank impression that ends here in wholesome fashion when reys search for the means to take down ragedrunk kylo ren adam driver in luke uncover startling revelations as if a disillusioned jedi master isnt shocking enough when the resolute finn john boyega grows increasingly so as he teams up with the spunky rebel mechanic rose kelly marie tran and when the directorships of both lavenderlaced wonder of a newcomer vice admiral holdo laura dern and everimpassioned general leia carrie fisher reach the pivotal hour in perfecting the element lucas conceived and rogue one fleetingly depicted johnson may have end the franchises search for a bonafide creative force emphasis on may  lets not take star wars down harry potters onedirectorallowed route eyeopening too is the films sets and look having been respectively built and photographed by newcomers to the star wars universe under tim burtons goto production designer rick heinrichs there is more than just splendoruponsplendor in the locale the

every medium shot the coastal city of canto bight despite its glamorous monte carlolights and creditdraining games is where abuse runs rampant a fact rose revealed to finn while theyre locating a techsavvy hvt benicio del toro with a stutter and regardless if its time for a stroll or a run johnsons regular dop steve yedlin keeps the flair high throughout an attribute that goes into breathtaking overdrive in act 3s threeway battle for three separate causes  survival hope and purpose cathartic is the prime directive here and so committed to that cause are the cast and crew that youll be hardpressed to not let out a clap a whoa a cheer or a yes as everything unfolds maybe a i want one too when the crystal foxes of crait a planet whose thematically apt crimsoncolored soil lies under a layer of blindingwhite salt scurry to not become war casualties if there is a flaw it would be bob ducsays editing that especially in the beginning stops key moments just milliseconds short from their emotional zenith but if this is a flaw it amounts to stardust much like what the cotton state did last night to the fabric of decency the last jedi is a if not the muchneeded adrenaline shot to the state of tentpoles in that spirit forthcoming star wars and what they have to share abrams with xi and johnsons returning for a new trilogy deserve to be greeted with open arms murphys law be damned for finally the tale can go where it hasnt gone before
Oct 10 2018,positive, if you ever saw a kids show during the aughts youll be familiar with the educational tactic of repeating a message over and over again throughout an episode before repeating that episode each day of the entire week this was a huge component of blues clues because it was proven to work theres no better way to ingrain a theme than by hammering it in until the viewer can no longer ignore it if heshe tried but while this is an appropriate technique for children with short attention spans not yet versed in the art of nuance the practice can be excruciating for any older siblings or parents made to sit and endure it too thats unfortunately the feeling i had while watching star wars the last jedi while this statement sounds damning however i enjoyed rian johnsons latest entry to george lucas skywalker saga nonetheless my issue is that it still finds the need to beat us over the head with the same emotional arcs weve experienced throughout two other trilogies despite being the eighth installment the internal battle between light and dark when will we be able to watch characters exist in this world as already drawn why cant we escape the repetitive excess and build something that acknowledges what it possesses without constantly reminding us as though anyone is using this specific star wars movie as hisher introduction to the franchise i love that johnson accepts the challenge of a ton of moving parts but every characters trajectory is more or less identical so even though the dude two seats over from me sounded like he was peeing his pants in excitement every time something awesome occurred what was the purpose of those awesome things i wish it was merely to be awesomeand some moments are im looking at you bad ass tenuous allegiance lightsaber fight but they arent they are instead a means to teach a lesson as they should but while it used to be just luke mark hamill leia carrie fisher and han harrison ford doing the learning or just anakin padmé and ben kenobi or just rey daisy ridley finn john boyega and kylo ren adam driver in the force awakens everyone is attending class this time around and the mirroring involved can be quite tedious because heres the thing the last jedi is a bridge between beginning and end in a way that empire strikes back wasnt it is quite literally the manifestation of moving pieces on the board to take them one step further than where they were and thats okay i dont have a problem with that we need to know what happens to the rebellion now that the republic has been destroyed we need to know what supreme leader snoke andy serkis will do to crush them with his apprentice ren and general hux domhnall gleeson we need to know if reys power will be enough to bring luke out of exile and help the cause but while the content of these story threads is dark the execution feels like blues clues rey is on a mission to discover who she is in the grand scheme of all things force kylo ren is too and they are psychically connected to do exactly that finn is on a quest to find the courage every hero needs to keep going with hope rather than despair poe dameron oscar isaac is too only conversely because he must find the caution to stop fueling his heroism with hubris rather than guts luke is forced into making a decision that will necessitate owning his failures and confronting his fears to teach rey what she needs to know through a grouchy grimace just as leia does the same to poe with a knowing smile it was all so obvious and convenient in its efficacious bluntness thankfully johnson is a master at supporting roles because he complements these six leads with a humorous bunch of misfits rogues and martyrs hes so good at them that i can only wonder what the last jedi might have been with finn and poe taking a backseat like how the latter was absent for threequarters of the force awakens so thirty minutes could be cut and the important stuff made tighter because there is a great film within whats ultimately a good one it has the elements needed in a star wars film without being little more than a virtual remake of a past chapter cough jj abrams cough it subverts the crucial plot points seen in empire perfectly it just shows its strings way too often the standouts are kelly marie trans loyal rebel with a purpose rose tico as the foil to finns im loyal to rey first and the rebellion second benicio del toros untrustworthy yet effective burglar dj and his disarming stutter and laura derns vice admiral holdo who delivers strength and regality despite her role being reduced to a teachable lesson in some way or another all three of these characters are teachable lessons but they entertain andor touch our hearts along the way its something i cant say about gwendoline christies captain phasma or gleesons hux however since they are formidable presence and sniveling sycophant respectively yet again theyre there to gaze at and despise as twodimensional villains much like the porgs and crystalline wolves are there to coo and every single one of those characters bolsters andor conflicts with finn or poethe lesser of the leads set upon their wartime journeys of the heart and plot threads of distraction at the end of the day however johnsons film lives or dies by rey and ren and thats why i can look past the noise and call it a success these two are phenomenal their captivating dynamic as dueling entities of light and dark discovering their place in a world that holds both equal proves more crucial than repetitive they are linked in a way vader and luke never were just as their idea of the force is presented as a metaphysicalspiritual one rather than based in science they could change allegiances and itd feel real that is johnsons greatest achievement no matter how righteous and evil rey and ren were in the last film respectively we could feasibly believe those roles might flip or join together on one side or the other the anger and sense of abandonment they share is etched on their faces when engaged in battle or pleading with the other to join himher things are muddier this time around and it leads to memorable surprises even if only briefly before the status quo returns ridley and driver are carrying this franchise on their backs whether boyega and isaac have their roles expanded by largely unnecessary subplots or not maybe thats why i feel as i do rey and ren are so good that were keenly aware when theyre absent it all leaves the last jedi in a precarious position of unfolding in a matteroffact way for children with heavier content that might very well scare them its therefore just as much a piece of the familyfriendly franchise disneys homogeneity machine spits out as it is a rian johnson project of singular intelligence pathos and wit the latter enhances the former just as the former waters down the latterthus is the state of cinematic universes embracing auteurism only as far as it benefits the bottomline johnson epitomizes that push and pull with enthusiasm and artistry he has put his stamp on the franchise and was rewarded with a trilogy of his own to craft if nothing else his work here has me excited for whats coming next
Aug 28 2018,positive, despite its setting in a galaxy filled with life both the original and prequel star wars trilogy  beginning in 1977s a new hope and ending in 2005s revenge of the sith  were surprisingly more or less about one bloodline the skywalkers george lucas improvised some of it along the way bending to the whims of fans by pairing leia carrie fisher and han harrison ford making her lukes mark hamill twin on the other hand the sequel trilogy that began with jj abrams the force awakens in 2015 has been making the case for a different kind of family as it pushes into the sagas inevitable future all the main characters  jakku scavenger rey daisy ridley distressed villaininmaking kylo ren adam driver and first order defector finn john boyega  in addition to the supporting cast of returning starkiller base hero pilot poe dameron oscar isaac and new entrant maintenance worker rose tico kelly marie tran  lack parental figures theyve either grown up without a family felt abandoned by their parents or lost them early on its why rey is so obsessed with finding the truth about them and why kylo ren is drawn to snoke andy serkis and it has laid the foundation for the new star wars the questions about reys past have also plagued the fans for the last two years who have wondered where she fits in the star wars universe and whether shes related to someone we know the last jedi  the second chapter in the sequel trilogy and the eighth instalment overall  doesnt shy away from tackling those demands head on while exploring and deepening the dynamic between rey and kylo ren the two share some touching moments through the film that hit upon the shared loneliness fear and lack of direction in addition to the bickering of their opposing ideologies and those wishing for a revisit to the abrupt end of their lightsaber battle from the force awakens will be served a return of the jediinspired treat with a clever twist abrams played it safe with his opening chapter partly because the star wars franchise couldnt afford to have another failure after the prequel trilogy and because it had to set up the new characters the story was about but now that thats out of the way his successor rian johnson looper can be bolder with the last jedi in many ways which allows him to push the saga in unexpected and wonderful new ways at the same time the film realigns expectations of fans who loved the original trilogy which were flawed and regressive in their own ways in fact there are moments where johnson nearly rewrites the rules of forcerelated capabilities which will no doubt be the cause of intense fan debate and uproar at the same time johnsons script takes narrative shortcuts and has a background plot mechanic that makes the first order feel stupid at times instead of the allpowerful entity that its made out to be when you get time to reflect on what youve seen  the last jedi is the longest star wars film at 152 minutes and it packs a lot in  youll inevitably be left puzzled or slightly disappointed by certain choices or in one extreme case wonder the implausible nature of the moment but his direction is steady and focused imbuing each scene with emotional resonance that the film carries you wonderfully from moment to moment while having the sense of making it an enjoyable ride with wellearned laughs drawn from new creatures yes porgs droids heroes and even villains in addition to a sprinkling of cool action moments for nearly every primary character in the last jedi bb8 is probably the winner overall star wars films are expected to deliver on the visual spectacle and johnson handles that expertly in the last jedi providing big space battles that allow you to feel the might of the first order and the nimble nature of small fighters the film is also inventive with lightsaber duels that showcase the clever side of the characters we admire and root for be it cooperation and outsmarting your opponent or a fitting tribute to lukes legendary powers late in the film in all this johnson is smart enough to reserve time for personal moments for the secondary characters as well letting old favourites such as leia and new ones such as rose shine whenever possible its easy to see why the last jedi runs close to two and a half hours since it has the widest focus of any star wars film with three different narrative threads for most of the runtime unfortunately the film is unable to properly serve most new cast members bolstered by the likes of laura dern  who plays vice admiral amilyn holdo and leads the resistance in dire times  and benicio del toro as dj a codebreaker star wars version of a hacker with no alliances both serve a part to the plot and though their actions have dire consequences it doesnt make them memorable in any way which is a shame with such talented actors their underutilisation does give the film more time to enrich and add layers to its two protagonists  or two halves of the same protagonist as johnson prefers it  rey and kylo ren if star wars fans were worried the last jedi would hew too close to the empire strikes back after abrams copied the structure of a new hope for the force awakens johnson instead ends up delivering a chapter in a galaxy far far away that borrows from both empire and return of the jedi the film closes storylines and provides catharsis in a way that would normally be reserved for the concluding episode of a trilogy which is currently in the works by abrams for a 2019 release thats why the characters in the film too talk about putting the past to rest over and over discarding everything theyve known and pushing into a future thats shaped by them and doesnt carry any of the baggage from the original trilogy its almost as if the last jedi embeds johnsons view of the star wars saga into literal dialogue smartly speaking to the millions of fans through a mightyexpensive studio vehicle for which nostalgia has always been the cornerstone all the way back to its origins when lucas infused goofiness into his admiration for akira kurosawas samurai movies to that end the last jedi forges a new path for kylo ren whom the force awakens made too easy a comparison to darth vader due to the filmmakers construction of him as a blackrobed guy in a mask who worships vaders burnt helmet and barks that he wants to finish his grandfather started here when snoke mocks him for his failures and the vaderinspiration in the last jedi he smashes the mask into pieces johnson shows that kylo ren is unlike both darth vader and anakin skywalker hes neither fullyformed like the former who was a calculating and menacing individual nor is he a man whos lost sight of what hes trying to be and gets pulled towards the dark side rather kylo ren is always in between the two hes a flawed human being whos always conflicted about what he must do and what he wants to being pulled in different directions by his mind and his heart to understand him is to understand that villainy isnt a switch and that realistic characters are driven by internal logic that results in what appear to be objectively good or bad choices depending on the circumstances the writerdirector brings that lens to the rest of the cast too though with mixed results at times in studying reys need for guidance and the deeper underlying issues owing to her upbringing the last jedi hits at the futility of running from what youve always known but she doesnt have any moments of utter vulnerability that plagued luke in empire and you might be left with the feeling that you dont see her character grow enough poe damerons hero complex is given a much better dressing down thanks to leia and amilyn and lukes brokenhero state and myth status gets a deserved deconstruction the jedi master has lived more than 50 years and knows a lot about the ways of the force but hes still no match for the infinite wisdom of say yoda who spent nearly 900 years living and learning moreover the audience hasnt been around for much of his middle life and the last jedis exploration of his worldweariness and his guilt are not just crucial to the plot  you know luke has to pull himself for the sake of advancing the story  but for answering the question posed by the films title and why its characters and the jedi order must move on for wisdom is in knowing that knowledge is everevolving for johnson the writerdirector charged with designing the next step of star wars that lesson can almost feel a little on the nose but the last jedi is so much more than that its proof that wellmade franchise stories  even in a studio thats been quite heavyhanded with its directors recently  can deliver a new engrossing chapter that respects the muchloved past while slowing closing the lid on it and steer the ship in exciting mature ways that push the boundaries drawn by its predecessors a different kind of star wars it is is star wars the last jedi the best movie in the series

Aug 28 2018,positive,star wars the last jedi works its macro and micro stories entertain either if youre predisposed to like what it has to offer or at least not actively resistant to it
Aug 27 2018,positive, within hours of the last jedis release a lot of internet discourse about the film turned hostile if you loved the movie you were a fake fan who you didnt understand star wars if you disliked the movie you werent smart enough to get it or you dared to have expectations and got upset that they werent always met  the fact that online discussions get ugly is hardly new but this was especially crushing given that one of the last jedis themes is the folly of fullthroatedly insisting youre right all the time sometimes youre right but sometimes youre wrong and its sheer hubris to insist otherwise failure as one unexpected character tells another is an incredible teacher  writerdirector rian johnsons star wars debut is a little of everything its long and cluttered and sometimes feels like two films mashed together its also emotionally resonant a beautiful vision of a more diverse galaxy  and a film that improves on second viewing when youre unburdened from any hopes or fears or expectations and can just watch the pieces slot together or in some cases jar and bruise  johnsons story expands on a notion the force awakens emphasized that the heroes of these stories can come from anywhere including the belly of a star destroyer but he takes it a step further asking us to dispose of or at least reconsider the notion of heroes and heroics altogether  luke skywalker is back  a surly resistant luke who tells rey daisy ridley to go away this is some of mark hamills best work his expressions and body language often say more than the dialogue general organa the late carrie fisher quietly demonstrates leadership to the young punks vice admiral holdo laura dern makes choices so contrary to the supposed behavior of heroes that hotheaded poe oscar isaac cant understand them  the actions that weve come to understand as heroic are called into question sometimes a grand sacrifice or risky plan works and sometimes running is a better idea what are the actions of heroes do we value them too highly as leias resistance shrinks battered by the greater might of the first order that question grows in the background why do we fight what are we saving the answer more even than in rogue one despite its repeated line about what rebellions are built on is hope these characters act on hope  not the sort of tragic hope that led rey to insist her parents would return but the kind that sent her offplanet to help finn john boyega hope leads rey to darker places this time and it brings her back when kylo ren adam driver misunderstands what drives her when holdo says theyre the spark its a spark of hope much of the canto bight sequence feels unnecessary but rose excellent new addition kelly marie tran and finns actions there pay off in a reminder that the resistance isnt just its leads its everyone in the galaxy who has something to fight for and so hope spreads the last jedi wants you to think about that about actions and consequences responsibilities and failures what you do and what you say and why sometimes the messages are muddled and not every narrative or thematic choice works but on many levels the last jedi is the antithesis of the virulent discourse it generates a reminder that flaws can give way to strengths that being willing to be wrong is a strength and that doing the work not getting the credit is what matters
Aug 27 2018,positive,whereas the first half is a sort of a convoluted mess the last jedi becomes a dark and exciting sequel that becomes the film youve been looking for by the 75minute mark
Aug 27 2018,positive, it doesnt help either when the film makers go out of their way to protect the good guys from lethal laser beams and sophisticated weapons that could easily have done in an army before the 94 rotten tomatoes score before the 81 metacritic rating the above quotes are what was initially said about the empire strikes back empire was not fully embraced or understood until the return of the jedi was released which effectively fixed most of the plot holes editing mistakes made the character inertia into grand character turning points and put to rest nagging questions the success of the last jedi like its father before it will most likely rest on the conclusion of the trilogy as a film in its own right last jedi is often weighed down trying to serve too many masters sometimes not fully developing characters pushing the boundaries of the force and has a few too many forced jokes yet manages to subvert the genre and add greater color to whats mostly been a paint by numbers universe the film is balanced through three separate plot lines reykyloluke finnrose and poe if i had to rank the effectiveness of each i would say that the reykyloluke portion was the most rey daisy ridley arriving to lukes mark hamill island waiting to be trained and encountering a moody and broken legend reminds us that characters arent static effectively last jedi is set around 2530 years after the conclusion of return bad shit happening to luke and luke not wanting to talk about it is one of the many examples of director rian johnson thrusting these characters beyond their pure archetypes luke being the equivalence of hope kylo adam driver is also further developed from a sycophantic shrine building why the hell do you have that mask villain for the most part kylo offers the most character development in the franchises history mind you this is the same franchise whose original idea of character development was taking a scruffy nerf herder and making him into a heroic scruffy nerf herder still kylos will he turnwont he turn subplot is the major drama of the film and probably inhabits the best portions this is in sharp contrast to the rosefinn combo finn john boyega as a character was definitely the most interesting of this new crop in force awakens here it mostly feels like between riding intergalactic horses trashing high stakes poker games and having little chemistry with rose kelly marie tran the writers are buying time and laying light groundwork additionally roses character needs more fleshing out and the success of the finnrose storyline is really contingent on the events of the final film lastly we get to poe dameron oscar isaac leaving the theater i thought poe was the worst handled of any of the characters in a way he is more reflective of solos role in return where it feels like lucas had run his course with the character scenes between him and vice admiral holdo laura dern a leia stand in carrie fisher who was given no backstory are some of the more awkward portions of the film too much of this section is trying to teach poe a lesson while sacrificing exposition the disappointing part is that i think this is the one portion of the film that cant be improved by a waitandsee approach nevertheless this star wars may be the most gif worthy especially the yodaimtrippinballs scene the rest of last jedi is filled with callbacks and gimmicky sometimes forced jokes especially the porgs however my favorite portion of the film has to be dj benicio del toro the slivering stuttering code breaker who provides what the previous incarnations lacked ambivalent villainy hes one more step toward evil than either solo or lando who at least had semblances of consciousness and in the end were only looking to protect themselves dj is an example of last jedi pushing the paint by numbers colorization of the universe as i said im a full believer that the success of the last jedi will be dependent upon the final installment yes the film is probably 1015 minutes too long yes snoke andy serkis was not given near enough explanation and phasma gwendoline christie was wasted yes the hyper jump scene was amazing blasphemy it was very star trekesk however this film could easily become the best film of the trilogy or the worst there is still plenty of time before anyone makes grand judgments or pits themselves into a corner as the above quotes should prove theres always time to turn
Aug 25 2018,positive, while it is indeed a star wars movie the last jedi is unmistakably rian johnsons work the stakes are smaller and more tangible than in the force awakens  this is more about the emotional toll that war takes on the characters the last jedi takes care to show the small moments of heroism and sacrifice that light the spark a rebellion like this requires in this sense it shares a lot of connective thread with looper both tackle structures of power cycles of violence and its effect on different classes yes really while toying with our perspective of heroes and villains that we know and love or hate if there had to be one criticism its that the running time can feel like a stretch when you wonder where all this is going  but the pieces come together and johnson sticks the landing this is all within a film that is the most visually striking that the series has offered to date there are weirder landscapes and locations bold splashes of colour and new perspectives of space battles and some of the most cheerworthy moments put to film this year speaking of which  ridley and driver continue to be the most compelling new characters putting in fantastic performances as rey and kylo ren move into territory previously uncharted by the other films mark hamill and the late great carrie fisher get more substantial roles and were better off for it  both carry an air of wisdom and sadness from battles fought long ago its the one weve been waiting for refreshingly idiosyncratic it could almost be called revisionist in the way it takes a torch to our expectations of a star wars movie the last jedi is weird wild and really fucking cool and yes youll love the porgs  synopsis rey develops her newly discovered abilities with the guidance of luke skywalker who is unsettled by the strength of her powers meanwhile the resistance prepares to do battle with the first order
Aug 24 2018,negative,its a twoandahalf hour movie it needs to be good in its own right not just setting up for the next episode a twoandahalf hour 200 million set up
Aug 22 2018,positive, we see the familiar words scroll up the screen stars in the background and notes of a recognizable tune blast  indicating that the saga of the empire versus the rebellion continues in star wars the last jedi episode viii as soon as we see the new characters we quickly have grown to love and the old ones we hold dear we are pulled immediately back into that galaxy far far away if only the trip wasnt so long we pick up right where the force awakens left off rey daisy ridley finds luke skywalker mark hamill on a remote island asking him to come back with her as he is the rebellions only hope meanwhile back on the rebellions planet an attack is becoming evident led by general hux domhnall gleeson under supreme leader snokes andy serkis direction and kylo rens adam driver lurking approval amid an onslaught of explosions zipping tie fighters and xwing aircrafts dodging blasts the heroes begin to meet their fate full force finn john boyega our newest hero is awakened and poe oscar isaac the blasthappy fly boy who ignores princess leias carrie fisher orders recklessly attempts to be the solar system cowboy and save everyone rey finn and poe along with his trusty sidekick bb8 are the team to give it their best shot at fighting the evil dark forces of kylo ren snoke and hux for fairweather fans of the original and all of its many many sequels prequels and prequel to the prequel it would be beneficial to rewatch the force awakens or at least read a synopsis who is related to whom easily can be confused reys haunting need to find her parents while also becoming a jedi awakens the force within although skywalker resists teaching her his last attempt turned out to be a bit of a failure aka kylo ren the connection between ren and rey builds as we see the strong yet blurred lines of good and evil we also find our own connections to all the old familiar characters such as r2d2 c3po yoda and more the story builds as new characters and connections add a bit of zip and spice to the film we meet rose tico kelly marie tran dj benicio del toro and vice admiral amilyn holdo laura dern similar to the force awakens an effort was made to have a plot line featuring strong female leads and this sequel continues to bring women to the forefront fisher steps up to the commanding leaders position but her reallife tragedy seems to cast a constant shadow on her performance ridley remains just as strong smart and brave in this version but it is rose that shines with personality she exudes humor and timing and i anticipated seeing her in each new scene holdo of course has a strength and wisdom about her character that radiates trust driver as kylo ren has stepped up his game and is a standout his portrayal of the betrayed son of han solo and leia is evident in every interaction we see his conflicted thoughts surface to his impulsive outbursts gleesons talent is immeasurable as he can fluidly transform himself from portraying the winnie the pooh author a a milne in goodbye christopher robin to an evil and frustrated understudy to ren he can almost elicit sympathy for his situation as he just cant seem to get ahead in the bad guy game while this sequel keeps the saga alive  and i give great credit for the strong female and minority leads  the story is just way too familiar and repetitive initially humor was laughoutloud but that concept must have been sucked into a black hole as the laughs quickly disappeared and with four different storylines taking place at the same time during the full 152 minutes the familiar paired with nonstop blasting explosions is jarring where the film truly shines is in the cgi and makeup departments  both absolutely stunning and mesmerizing serkis once again is completely unrecognizable as snoke his offset eyes creviced forehead and pocketed cheeks showing bones tendons and muscles are wonderfully distracting of course the film has a party scene as it always does to showcase bizarre creatures and this time its in a casino and lets not forget the puffinlike bird creature that will be showing up on every toy shelf just in time for christmas yes its adorable and its chewbaccas sidekick need i say more so heres the skinny on this 2hourand32minute star wars sequel if youre a fan youre going to appreciate the story continuing on and on if youre into makeup and cgi youll appreciate every minute of it if you havent loved the sequels recently avoid those comfy recliner seats for obvious reasons
Aug 21 2018,positive, a long time ago in a galaxy far far away myths about good and evil are being rewritten the eighth canonical installment of the star wars series winks and nods at the mythos that the franchise has been building for decades like princess leia giving an order to poe dameron it corrects course firmly but kindly in the direction of a more expansive and theologically interesting universe the last jedi picks up where the previous movie the force awakens left off the first order has destroyed the republic and subjugated the galaxy a scrappy band of resistance fighters struggles to keep hope alive an emissary has been dispatched to find the last jedi to rally people to the light we saw variations on this story in the first star wars film a new hope and again in the force awakens the cycles of the generations are hardwired into the star wars mythos luke skywalker son of anakin skywalker later darth vader discovers his parentage and becomes anakins only chance at redemption where anakin had turned to the darkness his son chooses the light marshaling the power of his bloodline while resisting its weakness this article is available to christian century magazine subscribers only to keep reading subscribesubscriptions begin at 695or log in thank you for supporting our publishing ministry
