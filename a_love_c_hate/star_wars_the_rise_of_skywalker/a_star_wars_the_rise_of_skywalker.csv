"Apr 8, 2024",neutral,"Der Film leidet vorallem unter seinen katastrophalen Vorgänger. Dennoch hat der Film viele Logiklücken und erinnert teils an ein Videospiel wo man verschieden Side-Quest erfüllen muss. Rey ist in diesen Film dann entgültig zu einer Mary Sue geworden und die wohl mächtigste Person die jemals in Star Wars gelebt hat. Palpatines Rückkehr ist unlogisch und irgendwie ist auch die Armarda von ihm auch komplett unrealistisch.

Der Film ist halt einfach ein spaßiger Trashfilm der viele Logiklücken hat."
"Apr 6, 2024",negative,"Disney lost me in the Star Wars franchise with this movie. Too many inconsistent and character motivations, force abilities, and implausible choices. Felt like new force abilities were being created out of nowhere to try and wow us. Problem is those abilities are unsustainably overpowered and ruin future storytelling. Would love to see  stories written as if each character were the main character of their own story. That is a high bar, though I believe you're very capable of it Disney!"
"Apr 4, 2024",negative,"While Last Jedi did more damage to the story, this movie comes out as the overall worst movie of the saga by a panic to over correct. Characters act out of character, whole plotlines come to an end abruptly and without any fan fare. Whole other plotlines are just retconned out. If anything, it retroactively makes the last jedi and the entire trilogy worse knowing that nothing led anywhere. Had they had the guts to stick with it, they could have smartly tied things together and even make us look at last jedi in a new and appreciative context. The final movie in the trilogy does away with any setup from the previous films to bring back palpatine, which cheapens the original 6 films, to try and get butts in the seat. Disney views this franchise as a cash cow, and they quickly realized that poor quality and writing doesn't equal lots of tickets"
"Mar 28, 2024",negative,"Visually stunning, action-packed, absurd, convoluted, shallow drivel. Flashy without substance. Amounts to bird droppings on the tombstone of Star Wars, which died with TLJ."
"Mar 25, 2024",negative,"At its core, Episode IX is an acceptable film. However, it's incredibly underwhelming for the last installment of the Skywalker Saga"
"Mar 21, 2024",negative,"As a generic Sci Fi film, The Rise of Skywalker works fine, but unfortunately, it is the concluding chapter of the 8 previous Star Wars films, in this case, this movie fails in almost every possible way to give the saga a satisfying ending. Yes, the movie does not bore you, it is action packed and moves at a relatively fast narrative speed, but there are absolutely nothing that makes the previous films special left in this film, it is terribly hallow. Characters that have enormous potentials like Finn and Poe does not get any attention in the film, and the main character Rey which trilogy spends two movie portraying got to be one of the most disappointing main character in any Star Wars Media, Daisy Ridley is a good actress and did the best she could with what she was given, but that does not change the fact that what she was given was a Mary Sue character who barley have any character development in any of the movies. Now to the antagonist, bringing Palpatine back shows that the producer does not want to spend any time on portraying a new character, but the reveal is not only poorly written(since the film never explained how he returned), bring Palpatine back basically means all the work that the characters did in the previous six films are worth nothing, cause according to the movie:""Somehow, Palpatine returned"". The ending of this movie is also terribly written, until now, 5 years later, I still does not understand why Rey was able to defeat Palpatine just because she got another lightsaber. Oh did I forgot to mention, there are no ending fight scenes in this movie, just a mary sue character reflecting lighting. Overall, if episode 8 is a movie that divided the franchise, episode 9 united the franchise once again, because of how disappointing it is."
"Mar 15, 2024",positive,"""Star Wars Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker attempts to tie up the saga's loose ends with epic scale and nostalgia, but falls short of delivering a perfect conclusion. The saga's end boasts impressive visual effects and thrilling action sequences, though its pace and convoluted plot leave little room for total closure. With strong performances from Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver, Episode IX closes on a relatively strong note, though leaving viewers with more questions than answers."
"Mar 13, 2024",negative,"It tried to repair the damage from episode 8 but ended up becoming overdone and childish. It assumes the audience will accept just about anything it throws their way, including the ridiculous reveal in the opening crawl. It's a fun movie, I guess, especially for young children, but it is not a good movie by any means. A disappointing end to a disappointing trilogy. I blame episode 8 for setting it up for failure."
"Mar 5, 2024",negative,"It was Terrible! not visually but the story was straight up taken out of a trashcan, nothing makes sense, they straight up forgot a LOT of lor and Rey is a Palpatine! NOT A Skywalker!"
"Mar 3, 2024",negative,"Some meme worthy scenes redeemed it from being unwatchable. But it is still pretty abhorrently peeved together, balanced try too hard of a movie. It felt a slap in the face if you look for depth in Star Wars stories in the new era, because it gave you the ending stage Naruto storyline, and little to none emotions, just cheap twists and thrills. Shame on you, SW franchise"
"Feb 29, 2024",negative,"Ugh this was a forgettable awful wrap to a forgettable awful trillogy. Big issues I had with it was in character development, lazy writing (palpatine died...), mcguffins (really a dagger that aligns perfectly with the wreckage of a deathstar.. that has a thing that comes out of the handle that points to the exact spot... contrived garbage that is so unbelievable it pulls you out of the film. Cheap laughs at the expense of degrading characters. It is flashy, but all the glitz cant hide the flaws. Garbage film making"
"Feb 19, 2024",negative,"When you finish watching this as the finale to the sequel trilogy, you really realise that the writers had no idea what they wanted to do with the film series. Such a shame they ruined the Star Wars reputation after the revenge of the sith masterpiece"
"Feb 19, 2024",positive,Absolutely loved this movie. A perfect way to wrap up the saga with great conclusions for the major characters.
"Feb 13, 2024",negative,"""Somehow Palpatine returned"" yeah... As someone who is a (pre-2009) Trekkie at heart and just a sci-fi lover in general, it kind of hurts my heart to see how a fellow Sci-Fi giant, will all the potential in the galaxy, fall so short of how it could grow and expand. The actors are fine, the franchise and the IPs involved are very loved. But it is the story writing that hurts this film the most and is the biggest thorn in the sequel trilogy (in my humble but widely shared opinion). This film hurts cannon and lore, and messes with loved and established characters. 
I hope the higher-ups at Lucas Film and Disney take more heart to what the fans are talking about, and to have more respect for the original source material."
"Feb 10, 2024",positive,"The visuals were really really cool. . . but the story was just macguffin to macguffin to macguffin all the way until the end. That being said, I was entertained."
"Feb 8, 2024",positive,"It's just okay. Not the best, but not the worst"
"Feb 2, 2024",positive,"Very nice watch, not as happy with the plot as i would imagine. Just too many things did not make no sense, or werent mentioned. Imagined Ben to have better ending...."
"Jan 26, 2024",negative,"The twist ending not only comes out of nowhere and doesn't land, but partly ruins the plot of the original trilogy, which is a huge disservice to fans. Rey continues to be a one-dimensional Mary Sue, and Finn and Rose are almost sidelined completely and their romance from the previous movie forgotten. There is little cohesion at all with the events of the previous film thanks to corporate interference and the changing of directors. The cinematography is great as us usual, but beyond the visual spectacle, this is a mess of a film."
"Jan 22, 2024",negative,"The story is just dumb.   Makes no sense, full of coincidences, and has no connection to the prior film."
"Jan 18, 2024",positive,okay this movie takes the cake  I love how this is the final movie of star wars it is epic how much I love it and the return of palptine and the return of the classic star destroyers it is a blast watching the movie but sad that they had to include carrier fishers death in the movie
"Jan 14, 2024",negative,"Not a good movie on any level. Convoluted plot, betrayal of the lore, poor acting, betrayal even of the trilogy it's a part of. Some good special effects, but not worth watching. Stupid plot twist... which is that... Palpatine is still alive. Rey's resolution is meaningless. Who's to say she won't just end up like Luke?
The movie can also function as a giant middle finger to Carrie Fischer. Total disrespect not only to the character of Leia, but also to the human being who portrayed her, as well as to anyone who ever appreciated her art."
"Jan 12, 2024",negative,"The second movie in the row to break pre-established Lore on what is and isn't possible in the setting, terrible payout, bad reused Gillian, unsatisfactory stakes due to people somehow appearing out of nowhere when there travel time would not allow. Ramps up the bad guy power creep with no build up, or reasoning that makes logical sense."
"Jan 11, 2024",negative,I have a rather large bone to pick with the new Star Wars movies and their lack of representation. This movie just felt boring and they essentially ditched Finn as a character. Also what's up with the random kiss at the end  between the two women that we know nothing about? I love to see LGBTQ+ characters but not if they're just there to check off a diversity box and  we don't even know their names!
"Jan 10, 2024",negative,"The whole point in making movies is to challenge the audience, create something unexpected and original. SW: TROS does not do this. This film grabs at the cringiest ideas of the fan base to appease people who have no grasp on what good writing is. It's hard to fathom that this movie exists in the same franchise as SW: TESB. And what's worse is that it leaves ""that thing Finn wanted to tell Rey"" as unanswered. The film also leaves the identity of Lando's daughter for the viewer to read on other media. As the ""conclusion"" of the Skywalker series, everything should have been answered in this installment. 

Largest points of awful writing (spoilers):
Snoke's origins.
Rey's origins. (Inconsistency)
Luke catching the lightsaber (inconsistency)
Hux being a spy.
Force Healing (too convenient, lazy writing, & creates plot holes throughout the entire franchise).
Kylo fixing his helmet (inconsistency) made his design look dumb. Should have just had more copies of the helmet."
"Dec 19, 2023",negative,"Terrible movie. Don't get me wrong, good action scenes, good acting and lots of plot twists. But that doesn't make a good Star Wars movie. A Star Wars movie has to be special and creative, and this movie lacks all creativity and specialness. I hate what this franchise has become and I hate how there was a director change midway through the series because now the trilogy is all over the place. I wish the makers of these movies knew how to read an audience and actually make a good movie."
"Dec 16, 2023",negative,"The Rise of Skywalker makes haste through what barely constitutes as a script. When it comes to tone, characters and story this is really just any rushed out action/space adventure, and the only thing that makes it Star Wars is the useage of familiar names and locations. In all honesty, this is barely watchable."
"Dec 16, 2023",positive,"I loved this movie. As a culmination of the Skywalker saga with Palpatine returning as the villain I was very happy. Brilliant performances from Ian McDiarmid, Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver."
"Nov 28, 2023",negative,Palpatine is my fave Star Wars character - but even he is butchered in this.
"Nov 28, 2023",negative,"Better, but the writing is still pretty bad."
"Nov 28, 2023",negative,"The final chapter in the Star Wars sequel trilogy, The Rise Of Skywalker sees J.J. Abrams back on directing duties since The Force Awakens as the story of new characters Rey, Finn, Poe and Kylo Ren draws to a close in typically epic fashion.

With the mixed reaction second chapter The Last Jedi prompted back in 2017, there seemed to be a conscious effort by Disney to regroup somewhat, especially after the disappointing reception of Solo: A Star Wars Story the following year. The Rise Of Skywalker had to be either universally beloved or, at the very least, satisfying as an ending to most Star Wars fans to make this regrouping worthwhile. From its opening text crawl, this sequel already appears to make a conscious jump past The Last Jedi and back onto more familiar territory with the reintroduction of Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) and Rey's plot focusing even more on her origins.

""The dead speak!"", we are told, moments before Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) travels solo to The Emperor's lair, an old-school mad scientist lab complete with half-finished Supreme Leader Snoke clones in water tanks (lol), screaming lightning (I'm not kidding) and big magnifying glasses everywhere (still not kidding). Palpatine is every bit as over-the-top as you'd expect and the overall tone here is reminiscent of old horror B-movies, which certainly could have been apt seeing as the likes of horror giants Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing were once a big part of this franchise. Unfortunately, the Palpatine scenes are where all this begins and ends, and all that remains is the nagging feeling that these tonal shifts and this apparently random reviving of Emperor Palpatine might not actually work.

""Somehow the Emperor's back!"", Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) exclaims at one point in the movie, with the word ""somehow"" doing a heck of a lot of heavy lifting here. And this is a good way to understand what's... off about this movie: somehow most of The Last Jedi isn't so important now, somehow Rose isn't a main character anymore, somehow Lando Calrissian's back and he has the entire world on speed-dial, somehow Force healing is a big thing all of a sudden, somehow The Emperor is ALL the Siths, somehow Rey has mastered every power by running in the woods, and so on.

Not that the film never explains anything but there is a lot it, indeed, doesn't explain and, in fact, the overall pacing of this installment feels extremely rushed and J.J. Abrams' erratic, perhaps more Star Trek-friendly, direction is mostly to blame for this. 

Fortunately, after a frankly clunky first act, we are given a solid second act that's genuinely entertaining and should keep the attention of even the grumpiest Star Wars fan. Rey wrestles with the good and the bad within her as Kylo Ren closes in, C3P0 (Anthony Daniels doing great work, as usual) becomes key to the Resistance's success, Poe reveals his darker past and there are some fun action sequences along the way. Fair homage is paid to the late Carrie Fisher and there are some enjoyable enough, if gimmicky cameos here and there. Sadly, brand new characters like Richard E. Grant's Allegiant General Pryde and Naomi Ackie's Jannah aren't given much to work with and the likes of Rose (Kelly Marie Tran) and Maz (Lupita Nyong'o) are criminally cast aside, as if there was never any plan for them.

The softening of The Last Jedi's bolder ideas hurts this movie which, too often, feels like a cowardly retreat into safer territory, actual drama be damned. There are elements explored here that do work, admittedly: the closing of Kylo Ren's character arc is mostly effective and it's rewarding to see Ben Solo being himself, even for a brief moment, while Poe and Finn collaborating as the new leaders of the Resistance makes sense. There are also some good ideas in there like Rey potentially killing Chewbacca by mistake or C3P0 tragically losing his memory to save his friends' lives but the film refuses to actually go there and undoes all this within minutes, perhaps for fear of offending a single die-hard fan who might tweet negatively about all of this or for fear of instilling real emotions into the movie.

Truthfully, this feels like a film based on an older script that was reworked much later on with lots of unclear ideas thrown in and shadows of better prior ideas still visible, but only just. The writing as a whole, by the way, is rather weak especially when it comes to the dialog, but we've seen this many times before in the Star Wars franchise so it's almost to be expected at this point. Though it's never all that welcome.

This is a fast-paced movie that does everything you'd expect in a Star Wars film, Ewoks even pop up briefly, but it doesn't so much feel like the end of an epic trilogy as it does the final breath of a rebooted franchise that was not carefully worked-out from the beginning and can't wait to end once and for all. Some of it is fan-service, some of it is almost stream of consciousness, none of it feels quite right but, at the very least, it's never dull. 

Missed opportunity, this was."
"Nov 26, 2023",negative,its funny really. the user score is opposite to the critic score. even when pretty much everyone agree this is a bad movie. and it is. but just because you hated last jedi and the critics loved it and now when the critics hate it you upvote this trash? lol. its really shows that star wars fans are man-babies. just because last jedi is bad does not make this one good. in fact. i would say as someone who only like force awakens that both this one and last jedi are bad. who is worse? this one probably. last jedi at least had some balls to its script. this one? ray is the granddoughter of palpatine? wtf? thats makes the star wars universe incredibly small. in huge galaxy its only the story of 2 families? lol. but yes there is some good one and that is rouge one. rouge one was pretty much the best star wars movie since revenge of the sith.
"Nov 25, 2023",negative,"Not just a terrible Star Wars film, but one of the worst movies I've ever seen."
"Nov 13, 2023",positive,"Mesmo sendo criticado por fãs presos a trilogia original, o filme tem uma qualidade ímpar em efeitos especiais e uma criatividade excelente no conjunto do filme!"
"Nov 5, 2023",positive,"I really liked the movie, only thing is that it was a bit confusing and often I found that they would find a problem, only to solve it in the next scene."
"Nov 2, 2023",negative,"I almost walked out of this movie. I've wonder why we have not seen any interviews with JJ Abrams since this movie. Maybe someone can point me in the right direction, I'd love to know some behind-the-scene details on how this movie got to this level of awful."
"Nov 2, 2023",positive,"Star Wars comes to an epic and satisfying
conclusion in The Rise of Skywalker
which has Rey facing Palpatine 
and Ben and Hux turning sides from the bad guys side.
A sensational desert chase you'll want to watch over and over!
Everyone has fun with their characters and locations are a sight!
The Rise of Skywalker is an adventure you'll want to experience again and again!"
"Oct 31, 2023",neutral,"In my honest opinion, this film does justice to the Star Wars trope of the final instalment being the best. Driver is great in his role. While other Star Wars fans might see the introduction of the main villain as a poor choice, I see these criticisms and put it down to awful execution. A good concept, but overall a bad film."
"Oct 25, 2023",negative,"The absolute worst. Inconsistent, unlikeable, no character growth."
"Oct 20, 2023",positive,"It doesn't do a whole lot for the already bland, unoriginal, plain awful new trilogy of Star Wars. But the increase in action and the return of a badass, terrifying villain did this installation a lot of good."
"Oct 19, 2023",negative,"A bad movie, with a bad plot, poorly written characters. The only reson Ray exists is to be a girlboss. She is shown as incredibly powerful with a lot of skill and expirence, even tho she never earned that. She never learned - she was instantly able to deafeat everyone. Zero character development."
"Oct 17, 2023",positive,"The characters aren't themselves, but It was an overall good conclusion to Star Wars."
"Oct 16, 2023",negative,This is easily one of the worst movies I've ever seen.
"Oct 15, 2023",negative,"Although episode 9 is more entertaining than the mess of episode 8, it is not so far from competing with the previous one mentioned for who is the worst in the saga.

If the previous one took away the development of the characters, in this one apart from that it also did it with the canon, how to revive Palpatine, that Rey without training is more powerful than the Jedi masters themselves, that she can now heal wounds with the force , that ghosts can touch things and use force and much more.

And not even the fanservice is well done, since only the voices of the ancient Jedi appear but not in ghosts, that Palpatine goes from starring in one of the best Star Wars deaths in episode 6 to the most pathetic and meaningless of the Saga , or that it was the ghost of Han Solo that convinced Kylo to turn to the light side, when it would be more logical for it to be Anakin...

And well, despite that I give him a star, because there was only ONE who did his job well, the great John Williams..."
"Oct 15, 2023",negative,This movie spat on the legacy of George Lucas and made the Anakin's sacrifice pointless. The only thing this movie succeeded at was being a complete disgrace from top to bottom.
"Oct 15, 2023",positive,"It is a decent movie, some things are messy indeed. But i loved it"
"Oct 15, 2023",positive,I was quite deeply upset with the Last Jedi it just wasn't a Star Wars movie and basically blatantly disregarded so much of the previous films. Rise of Skywalker fixed every mistake that was made in Last Jedi and has the perfect ending to the saga with just enough of a cliffhanger to keep the Star Wars universe open to new movies. I absolutely love the creative direction of JJ Abrams and obviously the entire cast are incredible actors!
"Oct 13, 2023",negative,"Easily the weakest film in the ""Star Wars"" saga so far. Abrams and company seemingly tried to make something that would temper the anger felt by some fans over ""The Last Jedi"" but trying to appease so many conflicting encampments while also closing out three whole trilogies (and introducing a major twist) means that there's no time to explain anything or let any emotional moments really land. Honestly I do not understand why they didn't delay this movie to put the work in that the screenplay clearly needed . . . I mean the answer is money but still."
"Oct 13, 2023",negative,"Malisima, nos regaló el peor beso de la historia, el más incómodo y el más innecesario, sin duda una de las peores películas no solo de Star Wars si no del cine de ciencia ficción de gran presupuesto."
"Oct 10, 2023",negative,The movie reminded me of a Road Runner cartoon.
"Oct 6, 2023",negative,"Somehow, this movie was made.

Seriously, I could not have been more disappointed. Even if it were a one-off film the story was flimsy at best and the fight choreography was weaker than some of the lesser clone wars episodes."
"Oct 6, 2023",negative,There are not enough rotten tomatoes to describe how awful this movie was. They killed the context of what a Star Wars movie means. This movie includes A very bad dialogue and boring new charters. But it ends with the same bad guy of all the previous movies. A failure of a great franchise.
"Oct 6, 2023",negative,This is nonsense unfortunately.
"Oct 5, 2023",negative,"So after destroying Luke, they made Anakin's sacrifice insignificant because at the end of the day Rey is the one killing Palpatine. And wow…. The poetic ending of Luke giving up and surrendering and refusing to fight in ROTJ immediately got trashed with all the Jedi telling Rey to kill Palpatine (I mean… even Obi wan told Luke to kill Vader but he didn't and that was the entire point of ""I'm a Jedi like my father before me""). The entire trilogy is embarrassing"
"Oct 4, 2023",negative,"I thought this movie ruined Star Wars, the writing and dialogue were shocking, and the actors tried"
"Oct 2, 2023",negative,A complete mess with no originality or stakes.  A betrayal to the Star Wars universe and it's baffling it has a higher rating then movies like ROTS.
"Oct 2, 2023",neutral,Bom mas podia ser melhor
"Oct 2, 2023",negative,"The first half of the movie is about searching for the sith navigation? Really? A whole hour for just that? Man, I never felt asleep in the first six instalments (include TFA) that's first seven instalments.

Too much emotional scenes those are not in necessary. Is this a space action-adventure movie or love story? Like a couple arguing between Kylo n Rey from the start to the end, I don't feel the excitement in the whole movie.

Finally, where is the epic lightsabre fight?! Their fighting styles are like chopping chicken with the sabre. Is there even a fighting art director?"
"Oct 1, 2023",negative,the ending its very bad why rey says that her lastname its skywalker that its not possible
"Sep 29, 2023",negative,"The effects were super, but to see a complete copy of the original Trilogy as overdosed cocain version was enough."
"Sep 28, 2023",positive,I had to cry it was so beautiful. I can't put it into words
"Sep 26, 2023",negative,"I'm being generous in giving this movie a 1.5 star rating because there was nothing Abrams could have done to salvage the sequel trilogy after The Last Jedi. Even taking that into account, this movie relies on contrivance and macguffins for nearly every plot point. And (spoiler alert), brining back Palpatine was both lazy AND decreases the stakes of his defeat in the original trilogy. I wish this movie could be retconned, but at this point, the damage is done."
"Sep 24, 2023",negative,One of the worst movies I've seen in my life.
"Sep 24, 2023",negative,"An honest attempt to rescue what Johnson ruined in The Last Jedi, and it wasn't pretty. Mindless exposition, a disconnected plot that lacks innovation, acting that borders on made-for-TV quality. Basically, Abrams just wanted to put out the fire, and he did, but that's all he did, leaving behind the the ashes of the Star Wars legacy. Mildly better than a trip to the dentist."
"Sep 23, 2023",neutral,"The best out of the sequels but still bad.
Great visuals but thats it"
"Sep 20, 2023",negative,"the fuck,86!?
why is it 86!?"
"Sep 19, 2023",negative,"good Special Effects, but as all  films from the last trilogy, its all a mess with poor characters development, Fin could be way more important in the series, Rey has a  poor development as a hero through the 3 films, Phasma could be a way more Valuable vilain too, a Buzz Droid and a Droideka has way more presence in the series,"
"Sep 18, 2023",neutral,"This one had a real shot at redemption. It looked for a bit as if Rey might turn to the Dark Side and Kylo might redeem himself by returning to the Light Side. Would have been a much better, more original and unexpected turn of events. The Star Destroyer fleet looked great. Honestly, I only went because 1. the kids wanted to and 2. I started this journey when I was nine so I figured I should see it through, no matter the cost to my childhood memories."
"Sep 18, 2023",negative,"So much potential wasted. Would've been far better if she had been a Palpatine as is her blood rather than this rubbish of her becoming a Skywalker, especially when Anakin was the only decent Skywalker character anyway. The way the characters of the Republic are just makes you want the Empire to win and come back to power and rid the galaxy of this nonsense. Would've been a better if Rey went to the dark side and her character probably would've become likeable. Shoddy storyline from the newest trilogy in my opinion and better writers are needed."
"Sep 18, 2023",negative,"Terrible writing, awful plot lines, and abhorrent massacre of the Star Wars franchise. The series would be better without this film"
"Sep 17, 2023",negative,No words can explain how stupidly written this movie is. Nor could they describe how insulting George must feel that this is what was made from the beautiful world he imagined. It's only completely aweful if you truly love the Star Wars Universe and understand the bigger picture of what is going on in the galaxy. Everyday folk who know nothing of Star Wars would probably find this movie mildly entertaining.
"Sep 16, 2023",negative,This really seems to have been more of a commercial in an effort to bring together a divided fandom when Disney didn't need it. (They were in the process of trying to attract people to Star Wars lands at Disney parks.)
"Sep 15, 2023",negative,I appreciate JJ Abrams' attempt to make a coherent story out of Rian Johnson's sludge filled disaster but the convoluted and creatively bankrupt ending fails to achieve satisfaction.
"Sep 15, 2023",positive,"seriously, to keep up with the prophets [and overseers + seers], star wars rather it be even star wars LEGO and the mandalorian and especially, most currently important: ahsoka, have been up to date with state of the art's metaphoric role playing and act describing.

if people ever discover why the story about ""ahsoka"" has postively forced me to break down in tears with controlled uncontrollable tremors in my stomach, they will how ever soon shortly find out why, they'll understand why ahsoka has been the absolute only best female jedi bounty hunter.  in fact, during battlefront 2, the storyline depicted that 1, of her near demeanorship descibed in graphics, had been murdered during battle...

i stopped playing battlefront 2 at that point which was about at the 75% mark of the total role play game... yet, it was indeed a replay about her [ahsoka] yet she was brought back to life [resurrected] after that murder after during 1 large ground battle that i really believed that if i had played the game more efficiently, and especially at THAT point, i could had prevented that murder against occuring.

she's absolutely the coolest, humblest and experienced female jedi knight [yet really, a female knight being a valkyrie] and as of 15 september 2023, without it being defined to me, i don't even know why yet, yet the entire thing has caused tears to surface from my stomach..."
"Sep 14, 2023",negative,"Really Disney, all you can come up with is zombie palpatine?!! No wonder, TFA started strong, TLJ was the the start of the crash, TRoS is the wreckage."
"Sep 14, 2023",positive,"In all my years watching the Star Wars franchise, I have never seen a movie quite like this. All of the action, and all of the suspense that has made this series a fan favorite has led to this moment. As the Skywalker saga comes to a close, there is absolutely no doubt in my mind that there will be more incredible adventures in the near future. With that being said, STAR WARS: THE RISE OF SKYWALKER will hold a very special place in my heart as a story that will never be forgotten. If there's one thing that I've learned while watching this franchise, it's that there will always be a very special adventure that can only take place in a galaxy far, far away."
"Sep 14, 2023",positive,"sOmeHow paLpAtinE reTurNeD.                                                                                                                   

It had fabulous features and a great finale but there were just some weird as characters and scenes."
"Sep 13, 2023",negative,"How does this terrible film have a high audience score? This movie almost ruined the Star Wars franchise, dumb sequels fans rate this movie appropriately for what it is. Cause it's terrible"
"Sep 12, 2023",positive,Decent enough but a huge step down from the previous installment
"Sep 10, 2023",negative,"This is by far the worst movie I've ever seen. Do you love Star Wars? If you do, do yourself a favor and don't watch this movie, it will ruin your perception of the franchise. Episode 6 was the perfect ending to the Skywalker saga, Anakin bringing true balance to the force in the perfect conclusion so there's no need to watch episodes 7, 8 and 9 and watch beloved characters drastically change their personalities off screen. Mark Hamill stated it best when he said that he felt he wasn't playing Luke he had to pretend it was a different character that he named Jake Skywalker. There's nothing that brings me more anger and rage than this movie, just thinking about it boils my blood, but if you like hearing a character yell REY repeatedly, ""they fly now…yeah they fly now"", seeing major liberties taken with the force to make you feel like you're in Hogwarts, and space horses then this movie is for  you."
"Sep 9, 2023",neutral,"Takes an upper hand against episode 7 and 8. Even though the rise of Skywalker is disgraceful at the end when Rey says she is a Skywalker, the movie still has some good elements. Such as, pretty well storyline, using Lando in a correct way,  good end fighting scene, the chemistry we've been waiting for with Rey and Ren, seeing Ren be more badass in the movie, etc. I didn't like how they had to rewrite C3POs memory when the dagger didn't even say anything that important…"
"Sep 9, 2023",negative,This entire trilogy was an awful mess.  I would sue if I owned stock in Disney for not representing the best interest of the shareholders.
"Sep 8, 2023",negative,"Despite the incredible special effects, there was no way of distracting from the poor storytelling revolving around a contrived fetch quest, with glaring plot holes and terrible character arcs.
How writers can take an absolute S Tier franchise with an already baked-in enthusiastic fandom of hundreds of millions and run it into the ground is beyond me."
"Sep 7, 2023",positive,"I enjoyed this movie, it was a good conclusion to the sequel saga. It could have been done better but considering it followed up The Last Jedi it was significantly better. The effects were great, and the Sith troopers were awesome, but I don't really like the ending scene where she decides she is a Skywalker, that was weird. It had great effects and a decent story (considering the other movies in the saga). They did a good job of working with what they had."
"Sep 7, 2023",positive,A great wrap up for the star wars movies. Sadly you can feel some of the rewrites regarding the fan backlash from 8 despite 8 being fresh and trying something new
"Sep 7, 2023",negative,The magic of Star Wars is gone
"Sep 3, 2023",neutral,"It was okay. But like so many films these days, it seemed like the film was more interested in asserting its ""woke"" bonafides than in presenting a believable portrayal or a compelling narrative."
"Sep 3, 2023",negative,"It's one thing when someone has no idea how to finish a series and makes a rushed and ham fisted effort to conclude it.

It is, however, an entirely different thing when a movie undermines ever single past instalment of the franchise, renders a hero's sacrifice meaningless, ruins a villains redemption and rewrites ever single piece of canon about its own universe, some of which were established or confirmed within the same trilogy, to deus ex machina it's way out of the corner it backed itself into. This movie makes every previous Star Wars movie worse by its very existence because it has completely undermined all of them. 

Anyone who says this is a good movie turned their brain off sometime between sitting down to watch it and the opening title screen. The story has more holes in it than the Nevada desert and is so clumsy it is a threat to its own health and safety. The supporting characters have been ground into fine dust and scattered about the scenery to just exist and fill the background. Any interesting ideas the previous two movies had have been dragged out back and shot. The main characters have been turned into 2D shapes with no depth or nuance. It's sanitized, watered down and sanded into a perfect sphere to avoid any sharp edges.

It wasn't badly executed. It needs to be executed… badly."
"Sep 1, 2023",negative,Absolutely awful. The prequels were better.
"Sep 1, 2023",negative,"The visuals and music is great, but the lazy story, terrible character arcs, endless plotholes makes for a very disappointing finale to the Star Wars sequel trilogy"
"Aug 29, 2023",negative,"After the polarizing Last Jedi, the goal of The Rise of Skywalker is basically to retcon the previous film and turn the trilogy back into the popcorn, family-friendly thriller ride The Force Awakens was. The problem is, Abrams doesn't do anyone any favors, including detractors of The Last Jedi, as most elements are poorly done and rushed; as the final installment of a trilogy, nothing really gets proper closure. In the end, its not a bad movie because it was very badly made; the movie is entertaining enough on the surface. The real issues are that the script, the characters arcs, and all closure are rushed, lack continuity when paired with the other movies, and ends up being incredibly dissatisfying on every level."
"Aug 29, 2023",negative,"All of the sequels have been bad and this was by far the worst. Terrible plot, terrible acting and it appears Disney have done everything they can to drain every last penny out of the franchise without actually coming up with an original story. Literally one of the worst films I've ever seen, if it was possible to give 0 stars on here I would have!"
"Aug 29, 2023",neutral,This movies is a disgrace to Star Wars some people are giving a 10/10 or 5/5 witch is observed but I did like the beginning was amazing just did not like then end
"Aug 28, 2023",negative,"This is the worst Star Wars movie ever the holiday special is much better in quality they don't even explain how palpatine came back in the actual movie I felt they didn't even know how he came back his return makes Vader redemption a lot less important and Rey is the worst character and the writing was embarrassing and the ending with ReY SkYwAlKeR was so bad and spits in the face of Luke and leia and why
Did my genaral hux a spy it didn't make sense and why did Rey say she's all the Jedi that's so cringe . In general it's garbage 🗑️"
"Aug 28, 2023",negative,"This appears as though there were too many cooks in the kitchen and not a clear direction of character, scene, plot, or acting."
"Aug 27, 2023",negative,The worst of them all.
"Aug 27, 2023",negative,"Terrible Overall and easily the worst of the franchise. The main issue that kills this is the terrible pacing. This movie never commits to ideas and is more concerned with throwing more and more nonsensical, incoherent, going against canon nonsense at you at a rapid rate. While the fast pacing worked for Force Awakens, it does the exact opposite here. From Rey being a Palpatine, Luke knowing she was a Palpatine and trained her anyway, Lando getting the whole galaxy together in a few hours, horses, Rey kissing Kylo, Saving Kylo, Giving Kylo a lightsaber telepathically, Finn never telling Rey what he wanted to say, The Wayfinder matching the destroyed Death Star II ruins in a very specfic spot, Millions of Sith, Chewies Fakeout, The Emperor just being back out of nowhere, none of it makes any sense. And as stylish, slick, nostalgic, and well produced production wise this is, it starts to slowly collapse under its own weight of incoherent ideas to the point this movie somehow becomes boring by the second half with no suspense. The editing isn't good either. While we say focused on the same group of characters after the first 20 minutes it follows them with just an illogical flow of ideas and telling of events that doesn't flow at all. The music is about the best thing. It's good but not up to par with the rest of the franchise mainly because of the inconsistent tone and inconsistent scenes. The cinematography is not good despite having all the production value. The CGI is decent but used in over the top, oversaturated ways especailly at the end, and the production value is used for nonsensical scenes. The acting is just ok. These are good performances but there weighed down by decisons and motivations that make no sense a lot of times and every so often espeically Poe they have to give long plot exposes to explain this mess as best they can. The Emperor should'nt have been here and feels so out of place. This never commits to ideas, ignores canon, and ignores things like Rose which was set up from the last film as being pivital. Skip this even though its the last one. It's a mess."
"Aug 27, 2023",positive,Um ótimo último filme para tribologia. Tudo ao ponto. Perfeito.
"Aug 26, 2023",negative,"So many bad things. They wanted to build something without a base because Part 8 barely left anything but they miserably failed with a bunch of plotholes, bad lines and lazy writing."
"Aug 26, 2023",negative,Didn't have high hopes for this pile of Disney/ Star Wars crap due to the previous train wreck and wasn't surprised. StarWars has consistently gotten worse & worse over the years. It's sad that Disney takes advantage of StarWars fans because they'll watch any pile of crap that's called StarWars. I don't even understand why people bother anymore.
"Aug 25, 2023",positive,"Um filme divertido, onde podemos vislumbrar pela última vez os rostos de nossos heróis da velha guarda e abraçar a jornada dos novos heróis. É sobre família, mas mais ainda, é sobre redescoberta, redenção e renovação. Rey e Ben são o ponto central do filme, e sua dinâmica foi o ponto principal dessa trilogia."
"Aug 24, 2023",negative,"Like trying to watch a drive thru Christmas light show at 60 miles per hour, this movie was jarring and hard to follow.  By trying to please everyone, the movie ended up pleasing no one.  The story makes little sense and is disconnected with its Disney predecessors.

I wanted to like the film, but I left the theater feeling conflicted.  I will not be watching it again."
"Aug 23, 2023",positive,One of the best and most underrated movies of all time this has so many amazing moments for example Rey Being a Palpatine Amazing General Hux being a spy amazing the final battle amazing the call backs to the original trilogy Amazing I can go on and on for hours about how amazing this movie is and it's really impressive that it turned out amazingly with the death of Carrie fisher and they did an excellent job with the little time that they had with Leia and Lukes redemption ark was awesome and the scene with Han Solo and Kylo Ren was one of the best moments in the franchise and Kylo REN's redemption ark was amazing and this also has all the emotions so it's without a doubt worthy of a 5 star
"Aug 22, 2023",negative,"Stereotypical characters, old, reused plot-lines, painfully boring and slow ""action"" sequences and dialogue so bad that it belongs in one of the direct-to-Disney+ shows are all the reasons why ""The Rise of Skywalker"" is ""The Downfall of Star Wars""."
"Aug 19, 2023",negative,"After the opening reveals there will be a lack of creativity, it's best to sit back and enjoy the laser show. Rise of Skywalker is mediocre story with excellent visuals."
"Aug 18, 2023",negative,Yeah I can say I wasn't a fan of this film and the sequel trilogy as a whole. Final 3 movies got worse as they went on and I wasn't a fan of how this film was paced.
"Aug 15, 2023",positive,It was definitely better than episode viii. God at least they tried to save what Disney had done to Luke Skywalker. I'm tired of the woke crap Disney tries to cram down our throats.
"Aug 14, 2023",negative,Star wars universe destroyed!
"Aug 13, 2023",negative,This movie ruined Star Wars
"Aug 13, 2023",negative,Seems like the entire movie plot was made up on the fly. Pretty awful movie
"Aug 9, 2023",negative,"The same story over and over and over. Rinse, repeat and add the nostalgia character s and you have you next Star Wars movie. This series has turned from the epic of generations into the laziest writing of all the IPs Disney has now has lay waste to. A monument to creative bankruptcy."
"Aug 7, 2023",negative,"Yet another Disney Star Wars movie sequel from hell.

This movie is so bad that I only got 30 minutes into the film before I turned it off. 

The only Star Wars movie I have never finished, although I wish I never finished The Last Jedi either.

I have loved Star Wars for over 40 years now, first falling in love with it when I was 4 years old.

Well, I'm out of love now and looking for a mistress."
"Aug 6, 2023",negative,It was alright but Rey ain't no Skywalker. Or the chosen one
"Aug 5, 2023",neutral,"Wait... this is the end? Typical nowadays Disney. Aside from some standout moments, this might be one of my least favorite Star Wars projects."
"Jul 28, 2023",positive,"The story is good, but bad explained. The return of emperor Palpatine is a good idea, but bad explained. The desintegration of the Galatic Empire after the episode 6 is because of the fact that the emperor want to became imortal e because of that he none designed a sucessor. But a error of the movie is not explained how the emperor back from the dead. The novelization of the movie explained that the emperor moved his soul to a weak cloned bodie, but the movie don't explained that. The fleet that comes to Exegol also are bad explained. Problaly the fleet is a fleet of free worlds citizens, sons of veterans of the rebelion, and civilians ships with weapons, but the movie don't explained that. The movie is good, but bad explained"
"Jul 27, 2023",negative,"An awful embarrassment of a film. It's the nail in the coffin of a once great story. Rey is in no way, shape, or form a character for the future of the franchise. She's dull and boring."
"Jul 26, 2023",negative,I thought I liked it in theatres but it turns out I was just high
"Jul 25, 2023",neutral,At least it's better than the Last Jedi.
"Jul 23, 2023",positive,"In an attempt to rectify the fallout from The Last Jedi, JJ Abrams delivers a visually impressive and action-packed finale, yet the film suffers from a convoluted and messy narrative that struggles to tie up loose ends, resulting in a mixed conclusion to the Skywalker saga."
"Jul 21, 2023",negative,"This whole saga was a complete waste of time, broke my heart."
"Jul 19, 2023",negative,"Star Wars 9 è una minestra colma di fan servive, trame sbagliate, incongruenze e cazzate"
"Jul 19, 2023",positive,"It was like watching a Michael Bay movie with a pointless plot and a bunch of Star Wars eye candy.  The Emperors role was forced *no pun intended… Where are all the answers to the bread crumbs in the first one and maybe to s lesser extent the second movie.  Who was Maz Kanata?? How did she have Luke's Light Saber? why was Ray abandoned?  Who the heck was the Emperors son and how was he conceived and why did they abandon Ray??? 😂.   It makes 0 sense… it was for her protection?? Who were the Knights of Ren?? They played no role as alluded to in Episode 7 TFA.  JJ did his best to salvage Episode 9 after a disastrous Episode 8 that crushed every in-road and 8 also did nothing to set up 9.   I still can't get over Episode 9 and literally 30 Star Destroyers appear outta nowhere fully staffed, fed and ready to conquer the universe lol?   The SITH stadium and the whole Mcguffins thing with the Exegol GPS… this movie is soooo MEH.  Id rather see a SOLO movie sequel **with a different actor playing SOLO."
"Jul 18, 2023",negative,"This movie was so disappointing and  i could write an entire book of how bad and why it is so bad. Please don't watch it, watching it was very painful to me. But instead of wasting even more time on that movie - I just end this review here."
"Jul 18, 2023",negative,"I believe the series hinged on this third act. Had they simply extended what was established by Ryan Johnson (in my opinion the best since ESB) this could have been a true expansion of the lore and universe. Instead of realizing why the Force ""Awoke"" into something new and necessary (evolved) and why it called a ""nobody"",  the powers that be retreaded on same ole story line of another kid having to clean up their Dad's mess. In this case her grandfather."
"Jul 17, 2023",negative,"damn ending, they look for the easy sense of nostalgia by putting a villain who just had to stay dead. Completely wasted on Snoke's potential as a villain, Rey forcing herself to go by the name Skywalker makes me pale with disgust. I sincerely hope that there will be a change of direction between creative directors and writers... cancel all this crap (TV series included, not all, but most) and give life to all those comics and books that were canon before, they would a lot of money, making the fans happy too. (hoping they are faithful to the content of the works)"
"Jul 17, 2023",negative,Only movie I have ever reviewed. My brother made me watch it with him. This movie belongs in a trash can
"Jul 16, 2023",positive,Seems like this movie was made in a hurry.
"Jul 14, 2023",negative,"The worse star wars of the franchise... They chasing an object come out of nowhere all the damn movie so it make episode 07 and 08 useless to watch... That mean they wrote them without knowing where they go. At the end, Rey Palpatine call themseft a Skywalker??? She also love and Kiss Kylo. #The worse bad boys of the galaxie!
Don't worry girl he will change for you.

Ignore post-trilogie and stick to the orignal."
"Jul 13, 2023",negative,If I could give this 0 stars I would
"Jul 12, 2023",negative,Filme absolutamente ridículo!
"Jul 9, 2023",positive,"If you go into this movie just looking for a good time, you will have fun. Of course, I love Star Wars and think that the sequels messed up the lore pretty badly, but I did enjoy this movie. It was dumb and a boring route for Disney to take, but hey, I had a good time."
"Jul 8, 2023",positive,"Even though they had to cut Leia out, the movie was very emotional so it was good."
"Jul 5, 2023",negative,"The build up of the movie is great, the emotionslos play a major role. But, the battles are bad, Snoke is killed of too easily, force healing wasn't used correctly and Palpatine returned for absolutely no reason."
"Jul 4, 2023",neutral,"A convoluted mess of a film 
It cares more for trying to course correct and please angry fans then it dose about staying true to the story it set up in episode 7
This did not feel like it was even connected to the originally trilogy or the prequels 
It was a stand alone story that could only have room to breath after it had killed off what came before only by killing the magic your left with a cast we are supposed to feel a connection too
Yet as the sun sets we see a stranger carrying the the legacy that once belonged to our dear childhood friends 
The villain who is used to wrap up the series is plucked out of thin air in terrible forced decision that comes across as insulting to  fan base and pleases know one resulting in everyone who has watched this Disney trilogy to feel very confused asa result"
"Jul 4, 2023",positive,Great ending and Daisey Ridley is just what the Star Wars franchise needed after the disastrous George Lucas prequel trilogy. I liked all of the final trilogy that took us back to what Star Wars was all about from the beginning.   Excited to see Rey Skywalkers next adventure.
"Jul 3, 2023",positive,"Where do I begin? 
Okay, its 100% the answer to The Last Jedi. If we remember correctly, TLJ left us asking more questions than not. So they made this movie to answer all the questions we were scratching our heads with. I felt like I was in a marathon, there was never a moment to breathe and take it in. So sad that Kylo Ren was having a time of redemption- but its like not talked about. I don't know, so many wrong. Otherwise, its visually beautiful."
"Jul 3, 2023",negative,"The creative treatment was fantastic with this trilogy. But as a lifelong fan who was 5 when I first saw Return of the Jedi and then watched the originals my entire life, I'm just so offended by what they did. First, Luke is not a quitter. Second, bringing back the Emperor (revealed in the 1st minute so nothing to spoil) -- after Darth Vader gave his life to save Luke's and bring balance to the force -- is so unbelievably offensive to me I don't know where to begin. Because it's as if it was all meaningless according to this movie. And we all know that's simply not true. LUKE is The Chosen One, and Princess Leia doesn't fly. She strangles Jabba the Hut's with chains, and if she suddenly learned the force then maybe you should explain to us how that happened. Anyhow, there was so much potential with these movies and Rogue One was the only one that got it right. So for this fan, Return of the Jedi will always be the true ending (I'm not a book or comic book guy, just the movies). And unfortunately, that invalidates this entire trilogy for me lol. But if you like it, that's cool. But Luke was our GenX god and this argument is my final battle."
"Jul 2, 2023",positive,"I Loved it. This made up for the Last Jedi. I was afraid to go see it, but it went way above my expectations "
"Jul 2, 2023",negative,A silly ending for a silly trilogy
"Jul 2, 2023",positive,Another excellent entry! Was a very emotional close to the trilogy
"Jul 1, 2023",positive,Daisy Ridley shines in her iconic role as Rey bringing jacked Kylo Ren back to the light as Ben Solo!
"Jun 30, 2023",positive,"When I walked out of the cinema and I had a huge, stupid smile on my face as I enjoyed myself a lot from start to finish. This Star Wars movie had everything and was as entertaining as return of the Jedi. It's a shame as the more questions you ask the more confusing and annoying it becomes  as things don't really make a whole lot of sense. That could be due to the last Jedi messing things up. This easily could of been two movies by just how rushed it all felt. I like Rey but I don't believe she should of been a palpatine, but I certainly liked the idea of them flipping it and her turning to the dark side (oh well)  The emperor was at his most menacing in this movie then ever seen before, even if bringing him back undone Luke and Anakin's story a little. This film is best when you switch off and enjoy the nostalgia and the epic moments it does have to offer. Visually the best Star Wars and also some brilliant acting. There's things we'd of all liked to see but this is what we got and it still doesn't touch the OT but it is easily the most entertaining of the 3 

Kylo Ren (Ben solo) cemented himself among my favourite Star Wars characters who easily had the best character arc."
"Jun 30, 2023",negative,"Horrible ending to an overall amazing franchise. The rise of Skywalker is a stupid movie, just let your Star Wars marathon stop at episode 6, because the sequels are just a waste of time."
"Jun 29, 2023",negative,A terrible ending to a horrible sequel. This trilogy killed Star Wars
"Jun 28, 2023",positive,"It was mid I enjoyed the acting the plot twist was like the inside of a wampa. Now don't get me started on the bloody force healing, but this movie was a big step up from the previous."
"Jun 22, 2023",positive,we watched it at theatre and for a STAR WARS comeback it was way to bad
"Jun 22, 2023",positive,"Has some great moments, but this movie seems to be trying to please too many people and subsequently becomes a bit of a jumble at times. A solid finale."
"Jun 19, 2023",negative,A disappointing conclusion to the trilogy. Just goes to show how Disney doesn't care for Star Wars.
"Jun 18, 2023",positive,"7/10
""Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker"" é o último capítulo da trilogia sequencial de Star Wars e, infelizmente, apresenta uma nota mediana devido a um roteiro mal executado. No entanto, é importante destacar os personagens cativantes e o potencial que a história tinha para se tornar algo grandioso.

Começando pelos aspectos positivos, os personagens de ""The Rise of Skywalker"" são indiscutivelmente um dos pontos mais fortes do filme. Rey, Finn, Poe e Kylo Ren continuam a ser figuras fascinantes e bem desenvolvidas, com performances sólidas dos atores que os interpretam. Suas jornadas pessoais e conflitos internos são explorados de maneira satisfatória, adicionando camadas emocionais e complexidade à narrativa.
No entanto, o roteiro de ""The Rise of Skywalker"" é o maior obstáculo para o sucesso do filme. A trama é repleta de reviravoltas apressadas e soluções convenientes que não se sustentam sob um exame mais criterioso. A falta de coesão e lógica interna enfraquece a história como um todo, deixando os espectadores com uma sensação de desconexão e frustração."
"Jun 18, 2023",negative,Waited all these years for Luke's return and this movie destroyed it. Terrible. Huge disappointment and a terrible movie.
"Jun 17, 2023",negative,"This  movie was a huge disappointment.  It has an overly complex and incoherent plot.  It replays scenes from other better Star Wars movies without bringing anything new.  If you haven't seen it skip it.

The heart of this last Star Wars  trilogy was the characters of Ray and Kilo.  This movie is filled with so many random side quests that the main characters feel lost.  They even introduce a ""new"" villain The Emperor instead of just going with the obvious: Kilo is the villain.  His story of redemption ( or the lack of redemption) would have made a great film.   This is a story we sadly will never see."
"Jun 17, 2023",negative,"Horrible, nonsensical movie. Worst of the franchise."
"Jun 17, 2023",negative,"This movie is one of the worst I have ever seen. Why? Because it shouts in your face that you as a viewer are dumb. The character arcs a non existent, to bring back Palpatine because they were unable to build up anything over the last two movies is just giving up and to make up for everything they present everything in a hilarious number.
SPOILER:
Instead of one Death Star we now have an infinite number out of nowhere, instead of a rebel fleet we now have a infinite number of random ships who just happen to arrive at the right time because it is written in the script and Palpatine is now all the sith and Rey is all the Jedi and that is an original quote. Face palm."
"Jun 17, 2023",negative,"This film was definitely… something. It felt really rushed and the plot is dumb. It's as if a kid was playing with Star Wars toys and they made this entire thing up. Also, Palpatine's return is unoriginal and it wasn't needed. Come on Disney you couldn't have come up with anything better? Approaching the finale, it didn't feel very impactful to me. I could definitely tell that Disney was trying to make the finale like an ""Avengers: Endgame"" moment when the Citizens' Fleet showed up. Clearly it was meant to be impactful but they couldn't pull off what Endgame did. Overall, this film felt rushed, stupid, and a disgrace to Star Wars. The sequel trilogy could've been something more but it simply doesn't live up to the other trilogies."
"Jun 16, 2023",positive,"One of the best Star Wars films, despite its flaws.  Saved the sequel trilogy as best as it could after all the damage caused by The Last Jedi."
"Jun 15, 2023",neutral,"So much missed potential. Too many rushed (but critical) scenes, then a useless waste of screen time spent a race of musical aliens to remind the audience about positivity, and the celebration of ""good""?!?? Yuck. Plus, there's just too many convoluted plot threads that don't add up, UNLESS...you happened to go to the theater with the novelization in your pocket.
Stuff happens that only makes sense. The viewer would need a pause button to sit there & fill in all the blanks, but there's no time because of the smash cut editing and pointless action. I feel awful for Finn's character (who is clearly sidelined here). Poe is downgraded to a silly sidekick as well. I'm not one of those fans who thinks they can write a better movie. I absolutely can't. But hey that's not my job. Disney has endless funding/resources and it was THEIR duty to end this 40 year saga with some integrity. And it's disheartening for the regular people (like myself) who love Star Wars to watch as this movie disregards the tremendous possibilities that the Skywalker saga presented. Wow, this film could've had some emotional heft to it. Abrams could've gut punched us with an emotionally explosive conclusion, but instead, it feels like Kathleen Kennedy was breathing down his neck, the whole time to NOT make the last Jedi, and bring the whole thing in under two hours and 30 minutes. There are LOTS of movies with a 3-hour run time, and this one could've easily used another 30 minutes of character development, smoother editing, and an epically emotional final act. If you think I'm wrong, sit down and watch Andor. That has  a perfect mixture of powerful acting, character development, special effects, and star wars vibes ."
"Jun 14, 2023",negative,"Break-neck pacing, too much happening at once with the plot or things happening too fast. A lot of things did not make sense because they are not developed. The movie (like the previous ones) fails to explain what was going on; how everything reached to this point and what motivates anyone to do anything here. (Other than to defeat the bad guys). It is difficult to get emotionally invested in most of the characters because there is so little development or substance to them. I think the only real protagonist you could follow and be interested in was Adam Driver's character. Another saving grace is Ian McDiarmid's performance is as great as ever.  And it is great to see Billy Dee Williams reprise the role of Lando. This movie would have been better if they cut it down and perhaps treated it as a contained adventure without all the bloated extras. The main battle is over the top, illogical and actually just a shoe-horn to get Palpatine back in. Glad this series is over as it was becoming less enjoyable as time went on."
"Jun 14, 2023",negative,"This film has more p(l)ot holes than the streets of Buffalo after a harsh winter.
This film tries to repair all the flaws in the previous two films. The problem is there are so many flaws to fix it's simply not possible.
Without a good story base of the previous two films the third can't really bring it to a close.
This film is like Titanic 3 - the ship has already sunk and is rusting but let's bring her up and continue the trip. Very disappointing."
"Jun 14, 2023",positive,First time watching a star wars trilogy and I thought this was a good conclusion to this trilogy. It was entertaining with beautiful cinematics although it falls short to the Force Awakens which was spectacular.
"Jun 11, 2023",positive,"I strongly disliked "" The Last Jedi"". It ruined the story for me. This movie made up for it, even though having Emperor Palpatine coming back I strongly disagreed with. The action, lightsaber battles were some of the best in all of Star Wars. Scenes looked really good, not as much CGI. Actors were on point with emotions, even C3PO.  Love Luke Skywalker catching the lightsaber. Always good to hear John Williams music once again ( he's in the movie as well). The story was definitely not perfect. It redeemed itself from the last movie though and was highly entertaining, emotional, and enjoyable."
"Jun 11, 2023",negative,"The plot was basically just made up by the writers beacause they were in a hurry, you can tell especiallt by the unexplainable plot twist, it clearly was not something they planned ahead, since we had no clue or reference in the previous movies that it was going to happen. I did not like the absurd absence of any sort of character development (except for kylo ren wich is the only remotely well written character in the triology), i did not like the settings, wich felt cheap (90% of the movies since Disney acquired the franchise are in deserts, landscapes, remote villages, wich are not that fitting imo), and lastly the finale was just a copycat of avengers endgame. I feel like the writers just took the insane amount of story telling potential this franchise had with (jedis, siths, mandalorians, criminal undergrounds, imperials, futuristic societies) and straignt up threw it in the toilet and flushed it, in favour of a decent low cost movie (for their standards of course) wich makes good profits. The only reason im not giving it less is the CGI wich wasn't bad."
"Jun 5, 2023",negative,"Terrible, Disney has destroyed another franchise."
"Jun 2, 2023",positive,"Somehow Palpatine returned, just get over it and enjoy the light(ning) show. 
Force dyads, dark side heritage, redemption, Sith wayfinders, Babu frikkin' Frik, etc. This movie flies high, just like the Rocket Troopers. (THEY FLY NOW?!)"
"May 31, 2023",negative,"Incoherent story that completely destroys all established star wars lore. The emperor was brought back in a Fortnite game ""somehow"" . They erased the whole achievement of Anakin's arc. Creative control was definitely held by people who did not care about star wars lore or world-building."
"May 30, 2023",negative,"Boring, predictable, (repetitive with the same 2 persons senseless fighting over and over)"
"May 28, 2023",negative,"in latin america we have a joke about who will inherit grandma's land, this is a bad joke of that joke going to far"
"May 27, 2023",positive,i liked very much this movie it was not of the best but it was awesome to me
"May 27, 2023",negative,What a terrible ending of a trilogy. It is obvious that nothing was planned and the audience is supposed to just suckle the blue milk. Rian discarded JJs ideas in the last movie and here JJ takes back control. The entire trilogy feels like 2 kids fighting over a toy in a sandbox. This movie is just fetch quest after fetch quest. Stuff just happens with no explanation. JJ must have really like Avengers Endgame because it's the same ending.
"May 26, 2023",negative,"Nothing new, sky walkers family again. Climax not as excited as episode one or six, not even close."
"May 26, 2023",negative,"El clavo en el ataúd del despropósito que fue la tercera trilogía. Ojalá paren con esta y no hagan mas, no mas destrozar de esta historia por favor."
"May 24, 2023",negative,This movie couldn't have been good. TLJ left the trilogy with nowhere to go and thats what happens when there is no plan and you let a self centered hack write the middle. Considering all this I can't imagine fixing the trilogy without having Rey wake up and the whole movie was a bad dream and then moving forward with the real one. So what did they do? A ridiculous mcguffin hunt that makes no sense to a 10 year old. An ancient artifact that points the way using a fallen star destroyer? A part of the death star that fell to a planet it wasn't orbiting and remained intact? A secret planet you can only get to with one of two wayfinders made for no real reason? Lando remaining on a planet for 20 years looking for a McGuffin without success only to have it found the same day the newbies show up? Just skip this dumpster fire.
"May 23, 2023",negative,"Better than Ruin Johnson's previous pile of dog crap, still not woth your time. Flimsy premise, bad acting, too many ""coincidences"" that solve plot holes, and it's from Disney and Kathleen Kennedy. So that should clue you in."
"May 23, 2023",negative,"So sensationally bad, not sure why the audience score is as high as it is. Spits in the face of George Lucas as well as destroys the Skywalker Saga. So much inconsistency and things that just don't make sense. How certain things progress seem very all of a sudden and not organic at all. The ending is complete garbage. This belongs in the trash, burned, taken out and buried at the bottom of the Mariana Trench."
"May 22, 2023",negative,Trying to fix the 2nd movie of the trilogy with the 3rd movie just didn't work. Long bouts of exposition. Handled so ham handed it's hard to believe the incompetence.
"May 21, 2023",negative,"This movie is a terrible fetch quest with no clue what it's doing.  It ruins Darth Vaders sacrifice to save Luke by killing the Emperor.  ""somehow he returned""..... LOL"
"May 19, 2023",negative,This is the worst of the sequels....The other two movies should not even have the Star Wars title...But this one....This is beyond a insult to everything that is Star Wars!!
"May 16, 2023",positive,this was a fun epic movie!
"May 15, 2023",negative,"This movie is wrong in many ways. Bringing back Palpatine ruined Anakin's redemption back in episode 6. Also, if I were Rey I would've been honest about my lineage. Yes, she doesn't want to be a palpatine, but she's not a Skywalker either."
"May 15, 2023",negative,This movie is a disgrace to star wars and cinema. There are so many plot holes and mistakes that it is hard to watch without wanting to kill myself.
"May 15, 2023",negative,Thats movie is a afront to the vision of Jorge Lucas!
"May 14, 2023",negative,"I love Star Wars, but this movie was a total waste of time. JJ Abrams destroyed the storytelling of basically all characters in this movie. There's no point in watching this since there's no decent story or characters."
"May 13, 2023",negative,Una buena manera de joder la saga entera de star wars
"May 12, 2023",negative,"The storyline made no sense
It made all of the previous movies pointless. Although the graphics were really good, the story writers didn't know what a Star Wars film is. I'm utterly disappointed as this could've been an amazing series finale. But unfortunately we got ""Palpatine returned"" and ""Rey Skywalker"".
Just completely devastated that this disgusting movie even exists"
"May 12, 2023",negative,Just Awful. One of the messiest films ever made and the worst Star Wars
"May 12, 2023",negative,It was really dissapointing to see that they just try to revive a character  that was already done and he also suddenly had a huge army that no one saw. The good thingof this movie is that they are done with this story. It's really sad to see how a really great saga is destroyed with a team just focused on winning money.
"May 9, 2023",positive,I believe this movie did the best it could after the tragedy of the prior film.
"May 9, 2023",negative,"Wow, Hollywoods best writers and they can still only polish up a disaster of an amazing franchise."
"May 8, 2023",negative,"(Spoiler free) Incoherent mess, attempting to undo what what already done. The plot is all over the place. It's too busy, there is no clear direction, and there are too many plot conveniences to let slide. There's little to no growth for the main characters, and it doesn't feel like they have any chemistry in their relationships with eachother. Truly, just no real depth to them and it makes it hard as an audience member to connect with the film. Visually, it's stunning, but that only takes you so far. The film feels like like putting make-up on a pig and then saying it's beautiful. There is not a single person that I've talked to online or in person that genuinely liked this film, yet there's a relatively high audience score, which make it seem like there was an attempt by Disney to skew the narrative in their favor, which works against them in reality."
"May 7, 2023",negative,Disney has absolutely destroyed Star Wars.  What an absolute tragedy.
"May 6, 2023",negative,"Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is a disappointing and underwhelming conclusion to the Skywalker saga. From the very beginning, the film feels rushed and disjointed, as if the filmmakers were trying to cram in as much fan service as possible without regard for storytelling or character development.

One of the biggest issues with the film is its reliance on convenience and contrivance to move the plot forward. Characters appear and disappear at random, and events unfold without any real explanation or context. This makes it difficult to become invested in the story or care about the characters, as everything feels arbitrary and meaningless.

Another problem with The Rise of Skywalker is its lack of emotional weight. The film tries to tug at the heartstrings with various callbacks and nostalgic moments, but these feel hollow and forced. There's no real sense of consequence or stakes, as the film seems more interested in checking off boxes and hitting familiar beats than telling a compelling and meaningful story.

Perhaps the biggest disappointment of all is how the film handles its characters. Many of the established characters are given short shrift, with little to no development or payoff for their arcs. New characters are introduced without much explanation or backstory, leaving the audience to wonder why they should care about them at all.

Overall, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is a forgettable and unsatisfying conclusion to the Skywalker saga. It fails to deliver on its promise of a compelling story and emotional resonance, instead relying on cheap gimmicks and nostalgia to try and win over audiences. Fans of the franchise deserve better than this lackluster effort."
"May 5, 2023",negative,How this movie has an 86% on this site is beyond me. It's so stupid and boring I thought I was being generous by giving it 1.5 stars.
"May 5, 2023",negative,The worst Star Wars movie ever made.
"May 5, 2023",positive,"It was decent, but the Palpatine storyline was questionable at best.  No thought was put into this trilogy ahead of time, and that is plainly seen as it wraps up."
"May 5, 2023",negative,"Somehow Palpatine returns?  This eliminates the sacrifice that Anakin has to do, including the death of Padme and also all the sacrifices and failures from Luke. 

Also, you don't become a Rey Skywalker, by just calling yourself that. Rey is and will always be Rey Palpatine.  
The writers didn't understand what Star Wars is all about."
"May 5, 2023",positive,Good action film but Rey calling herself a Skywalker threw me off.
"May 5, 2023",positive,it was entertaining at best
"May 5, 2023",negative,This movie was okay. But had many plot holes such as Rey finding her way to Exegol but then a million ships turn up with no way of finding it. overall this movie is pretty bad.
"May 4, 2023",negative,I think Palpatine's return explains my one-star review. (The guy got thrown into the void of space and is blown up moments later only to return to this random planet in pretty good shape. Likely story.)
"May 1, 2023",neutral,"Attempting to course correct from The Last Jedi, Rise of Skywalker manages to bring back the fun of Star Wars, making it slightly more enjoyable than the previous entry, but misfires with a messy story, and the most uninteresting return of one of film's greatest villains. Ultimately the most unsatisfying conclusions to any film series."
"May 1, 2023",positive,"This movie gets overhated. It's actually really fun. The return of the iconic Sheev Palpatine by Ian McDiarmid is great, Adam Driver nails as Kylo Ren and I just love the return of franchise characters in a closing chapter, it always gives me this feeling of joy. It's not the best Star Wars movie, but it's my favorite though..."
"Apr 30, 2023",negative,"The worst of all he SW films, so boring."
"Apr 30, 2023",negative,"This movie is rotten big time, due to „The Last Jedi"".
Alot of random Fan Services just to cover the fact they failed at the perfect opportunity to do proper Star Wars Sequels.
Shame."
"Apr 25, 2023",negative,Some how Palpatine returned. What more can you say about this movie? There is so much wrong with it.  I love Daisy Ridley but her character Rey hasn't earned anything in these past 3 movies.  Her managing advance force powers by accident is ridiculous. Finn was just trying to get Rey's attention through the entire movie. That was his character arc. They wasted Finn again and John Boyega's time! Oh by the end of this movie their is no Skywalker it's just Rey taking the name for herself. This is Star Wars at it's weakest and worse.
"Apr 24, 2023",negative,I just wish it would have all ended at ROTS if this is how it's going to be.
"Apr 24, 2023",negative,Worst Star Wars movie. It was completely dumb and made no sense. Broken chain of cause and effect.
"Apr 20, 2023",negative,"The Rise of Skywalker was an absolute disaster. The plot was convoluted and lacked any coherence, making it impossible to follow. The characters felt shallow and underdeveloped, making it hard to care about what was happening to them.

The pacing was frenetic and disorienting, with scenes jumping from one location to the next without any clear reason or purpose. The special effects were impressive, but they couldn't save this poorly written mess of a film.

The dialogue was cringe-worthy, with cheesy one-liners and forced attempts at humor falling flat. The ending felt rushed and unsatisfying, leaving me with a feeling of disappointment and regret for having wasted my time watching this train wreck of a movie.

""The Rise of Skywalker"" was a massive letdown and a disgrace to the beloved Star Wars franchise. Save yourself the trouble and avoid this film at all costs. (Still better than Last Jedi though)."
"Apr 20, 2023",negative,Disrespectful to Star Wars - should be retconned.
"Apr 18, 2023",negative,"Insult to the original trilogy, please remove these from history and do it again with Mark Hamill as the director"
"Apr 18, 2023",positive,"Beautiful ending to the Skywalker Saga. Don't listen to hater and ""critics"". Just watch the movies from 1 to 9."
"Apr 18, 2023",negative,I hate Disney they ruined Star wars this movie is a joke I literally walked out of it when they're riding horses on top of a star destroyer in space how can they breathe.. thanks jar jar Abrams for ruining the best thing about my childhood..
"Apr 17, 2023",negative,This entire sequel trilogy is the worst thing that has ever happened to Star Wars .. it managed to tear apart and ruin one of the greatest franchises of all time.
"Apr 17, 2023",positive,"I give this movie 3/5 stars for its spectacle, its nostalgia, and its humor. It is a film that tries to wrap up the Star Wars saga with a bang, while also paying tribute to the legacy of the franchise. The film also features some impressive visuals, exciting action sequences, and witty dialogue. The film also showcases some great performances from its cast, especially Daisy Ridley as Rey, Adam Driver as Kylo Ren, and Ian McDiarmid as Palpatine. The film also delivers some emotional moments and satisfying resolutions for some of the characters.

However, I also think that some aspects of the film are disappointing, such as the plot, the characters, and the music. The film sometimes feels rushed and messy, especially in its pacing and structure. The film also struggles to develop some of its characters and make them compelling and consistent. The film also lacks some of the originality and creativity that made Star Wars so captivating. The film also alienates some fans with its controversial choices and changes that undermine or contradict the previous films. The film also fails to answer some of the questions and mysteries that were set up by The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi. Nevertheless, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is a decent end to one of the greatest sagas of all time."
"Apr 17, 2023",positive,Better than the last one.
"Apr 17, 2023",negative,"Terrible, terrible terrible movie. Wasn't helped at all by the disaster of The Last Jedi. Incoherent storytelling driven by a series of coincidences."
"Apr 16, 2023",negative,"Many fans were upset and perplexed by the latest Star Wars trilogy. The plot appears confusing, and the return of Palpatine is especially difficult to comprehend given the lack of explanation as to how he was able to return. 

Furthermore, while several characters were introduced with the potential for substantial character development, they ultimately seemed to have no meaningful function in the tale. As a result, many fans believe that this marks the end of the Star Wars franchise."
"Apr 15, 2023",negative,"I appreciate all the actors for playing their parts and no disrespect to them. As an avid sw fan, this movie isn't getting accurately reviewed and deserves a lower score. I understand some people like these new movies, but not 86% of sw fandom. The original didn't make these movies or intended to make them, nor did the original's apprentice. All three are well funded fan films with ""subverted expectation"" dilemmas in story development. We aren't asking for much, make Jedi train to be good, dont disrespect established and well written characters, don't edit fight scenes by digitally deleting weapons from praetorian guard's hands, wtf is this animal titty milk scene"
"Apr 14, 2023",negative,"Felt like the movie was written by someone that hasn't watched a Star Wars movie but only heard what people say about it.

Movie flip flops on each scene. Characters change perspectives faster than they developed in any of the previous movies. Horses are better than ships. The Deathstar blew up why is half of it on a planet? If a moon sized object crashed into a planet all life on that planet should be dead."
"Apr 14, 2023",positive,A good end of story.
"Apr 14, 2023",negative,Very bad. They tried to fix the mistakes the last Jedi made but it made it worse.
"Apr 14, 2023",negative,Don't understand plot at all. And how did Emperor Palpatine survive...
"Apr 13, 2023",negative,Another boring sequel that doesn't bring anything new to the table. It seems like in The Rise of Skywalker they were trying to patch up all the cracks left from The Last Jedi. Which results in it being a somewhat of a mess. Adam Driver is brilliant and Daisy Ridley also does well with what material they have to work with. But I found the film very predictable and was never on the edge of my seat. Oh what could have been.
"Apr 12, 2023",positive,"The story was actually good. 

I watched it not expecting anything after how terrible episode 7 and episode 8 had been, but I was pleased to finally witness a good story and the essence of Star Wars in place."
"Apr 12, 2023",negative,The worst movie I have ever seen. I am a huge fan of Star Wars and this movie killed that for a while. Luckily it has been redeemed but this was not only a bad Star Wars movie it was just a terrible movie in general. No one had the courage to continue with plot points that were set up because some of the fandom whined so hard about The Last Jedi. Well this is what you end up with. Honestly maybe we deserved it.
"Apr 12, 2023",negative,"This would have played better as a cartoon since it's as believable as one. If you check your brain at the door and not think about anything, yeee haaa! Otherwise what a pathetic end to a once great story. It's also clear that anyone gushing about this film is a Disney bot."
"Apr 12, 2023",negative,Horrible.... many reasons.
"Apr 12, 2023",negative,"You must joking..

""Somehow Palpatine returns"" hundreds of clones of him and Snoke??

He had a whole world full of Star destroyers with Death Star capability??

The entire Universe then Hyper Speeds their way to the secret planet save the day??

Po and Finn go no where as characters.. Rey still acts as young and impulsive as she did in the first movie. 

Contrast that to Luke Skywalker in A New Hope to Return of the Jedi.. his composure and discipline showed he had matured as a person. A true and compelling hero's journey.. where have these story tellers gone.."
"Apr 11, 2023",negative,The biggest acomplishment of this movie is that it isn't worst than the last jedi and that's all. Horrible movie
"Apr 11, 2023",negative,"The right conclusion for a terrible trilogy that should have never be made: a pointless film that negates the very core of the 6 movies that came before, that was a bust at the box office and finally ruined Star Wars legacy. 
Thanks again Disney."
"Apr 10, 2023",negative,"I had no idea what what was happening the entire time. Jumping place to place and bringing back villains never mentioned in previous movies for no reason. The movie concluded with the most powerful man in the galaxy and beyond being killed when the main character picks up two lightsabers instead of one reflecting force lighting back into Palpatine's face. That isn't how lightsabers work at all. They even have the gaul to bot these reviews with the same ""loved Rey and Kylo"" and ""great ending to the franchise"" comments to boost the score. This film was a narrative nightmare with no direction that threw away the plot of the previous films leading to a disjointed mess that just gives the main characters what they need to rush though the story as fast as possible. It's not worth watching for first time viewers just pretend it ended in the last movie with the death of Smoke. Even with that movies flaws it's a masterpiece in comparison to this tragedy."
"Apr 9, 2023",negative,"Seemed rushed, and copied a lot of the story plots of the original trilogy."
"Apr 9, 2023",positive,"Star-Wars: The Rise of Skywalker isn't the most well put together film in the saga, but it does its job at finishing this amazing saga with a satisfying end.

Rating: 66%"
"Apr 8, 2023",negative,Dumb; Poorly written; Ridiculous plot. Overall just awful. Only episode 8 saved it from being the worst Star Wars movie.
"Apr 8, 2023",positive,"Yay, it's over!  Better than the last one."
"Apr 8, 2023",negative,"This is a casual fans' fever dream. The visuals, sound design, and score are spectacular. The fan service is everywhere, and everyone's favorite villain returns. JJ Abrams may not know how to make a Star Wars movie, but he knows tricks of the trade to keep any non-critical eye happy. However, this is not the case for the dedicated fan. There are many plot holes in this movie, with the two major ones being force healing and resurrecting an actual sith after the prophecy of the chosen one was supposedly fulfilled. On top of this it undoes the few good things the last Jedi did right. The last Jedi was not a good movie, but it was at the very least unique. If the ideas it introduced had been properly built upon, this movie could have been good. However, this entire movies' purpose is to retcon every single thing about the previous entry. The last Jedi set up that reys' parents were nobody. That's gone. The last Jedi set up that Kylo ren would be the main villain of this one. Gone. The last movie set up that nobody was willing to help the resistance. Gone. Then the cherry on top, the characters are STILL not interesting, after 3 whole movies. 
Some other issues that I don't care to elaborate on:
1. Plot contrivances
2. Minor dialogue issues
3. Essential things introduced in the last movie
4. Goonies fetch quest-style story
5. Power scaling
6. Rey skywalker"
"Apr 8, 2023",negative,"Absolute garbage, I am really dissatisfied with how this trilogy progressed. This was a disappointing end to a poor trilogy that just got worse with each installment."
"Apr 8, 2023",negative,JJ tries to cobble together a film from the shipwreck that was The Last Jedi. There are consequences to starting out on the 1st film of a new trilogy and the 7th of a franchise with no plans for where you are headed. These Disney films are not canon.
"Apr 8, 2023",positive,"The Rise of Skywalker significantly better than the prior film (The Last Jedi), which was absolutely atrocious.

The climax was exciting and it had appropriate conclusions for many of the main characters, without spoiling the film. As a minor Star Wars fan it was interesting through a great majority of it."
"Apr 7, 2023",negative,"Nostalgia cash grab. Retconned major characters, and more importantly, plot points. Actors did their best."
"Apr 7, 2023",negative,Bad storytelling and directing that is just lazy and a lot of plotholes and annoying carachters
"Apr 7, 2023",negative,"An improvement over Last Jedi, which isn't saying much."
"Apr 6, 2023",negative,"How on God's green Earth did people actually like this movie? It makes absolutely no sense and never had a plan. Hinted at many consequences for our hero (accidentally killing a major hero, potentially turning to the dark side, being unable to kill the antagonist for fear he would occupy her body, to name a few), none of which paid off or had any consequences in the least; completely invalidated the sacrifice Vader made to bring balance to the force in ROTJ simply because the creative team ADMITTEDLY had no plan going in; forced a cringeworthy kiss between the impossibly unchallenged hero and the psychotic galactic serial murderer, only to satisfy a select few theorists; completed Finn's arc as an utterly wasted character; gave us an impossibly poorly thought-out McGuffin that baffles my mind to this day (they had to stand RIGHT there for it to make sense??? How did they know what the Death Star debris would look like before it was even destroyed???); and arguably worst of all, introduced both an army of baddies that couldn't have possibly existed AND an army of good-guy helpers who took 10 minutes to assemble and have been suspiciously absent up until this point in the entire saga, just because they needed a big battle. To hell with actually writing a story that makes sense, right?

Everyone, Disney thinks we are all stupid, and they have forgotten how to tell stories. It's time to stop paying them. It's the only way they will learn a lesson and start hiring talented storytellers again."
"Apr 2, 2023",positive,"The conclusion to the Skywalker saga is epic! We learn Rey's past, Poe has really turned into a leader which completes his arc from the last jedi, and Finn has developed force powers. Kylo Ren was awesome as usual. Such a great movie!"
"Apr 2, 2023",negative,"I liked the Star Wars sequels up until this one. It either retconned or threw away all that The Last Jedi set up, just because the people behind this film cared more about pleasing angry fans than finishing up the narrative set up by the previous film. The Rise of Skywalker is sloppy, full of weird retcons and dumb fan-servicey moments."
"Mar 30, 2023",negative,"Terrible film, made absolute no sense, really showed Disney had no plan. Sequel trilogy is awful"
"Mar 30, 2023",negative,"Nothing like the original Star Wars trilogy. Way worse than the prequels.
Decides to kill of the remaining main characters (like Leia and Ben Solo)

The plot is a TOTAL mess. Characters are 1 dimensional.
Unimaginative, tries to emulate Star Wars: Dark forces comic books.

Would not recommend, especially to fans of original Star Wars trilogy, or prequels."
"Mar 29, 2023",positive,"I didn't really like this movie but it had it's good points like the last fight and it's CGI not only that during the last fight you could hear voices from past Jedi like Obi-Wan, Anakin, Mace, Yoda, Ahsoka, Luke, etc. Action, it great it could have been slightly better. Acting, is ok it could have been a lot better. CGI, is perfect no doubt about it. Villain, this is another reason why I liked the movie because it brought back Sidious and what's really interesting is why did the villains still exist even when Palpatine died in the explosion in Epi VI and this movie answers that question. Writing, I think that the writing was ok-good it could have been better. Story/Plot, it was ok and interesting. Casting is good-great. Characters, I think that the characters are great mostly because of the voices in Ray's head. Adventure, I think that the adventure was good like most Star Wars projects because we good threw and explore the galaxy and in this episode we traveled to the land of the Sith. Mystery, mystery is good because I always wondered what happens next especially in a movie like this bringing back the best of villains. Ending, in my opinion the ending was good but it does bring me to think No. 1 did Palpatine take over Ray's body? No. 2 did Palpatine die? And if my first theory is true than why isn't there an other Star Wars movie called ""Episode X"" to continue from Episode IX"
"Mar 29, 2023",negative,Makes The Holiday Special look like a work of art
"Mar 27, 2023",positive,Good omgggggggg so fun and great
"Mar 26, 2023",negative,"They had so many options to work with for the sequels. Dumping everything from legends for a definitely inferior and plot hole filled mess of a story is extremely disappointing. I personally have watched these movies only once and that will be it. I honestly refuse to accept this as canon and I have not purchased any merchanise which has anything to do with these 3 movies. You cheapened and damaged key and generation defining characters which even the actors have openly criticised.

Disney. Stop ruining a franchise which many people love and have shaped their childhood with your corporate rubbish."
"Mar 23, 2023",negative,"This is the worst movie i've ever seen in my entire life.
I'd rather watch peter greenaway artsy-farts non-stop, like in a clockwork orange, i'd rather see The Room everyday of my life forever than ever need to watch this piece of insulting and obscene sewage ever again."
"Mar 23, 2023",negative,"Souless nonsense, just like all the rest of the new star wars movies and spin off's"
"Mar 23, 2023",negative,"The rise of palpatine terrible movie, the story and plot was everything that was not star wars . Unwatchable. I'm keeping my kids away from star wars."
"Mar 22, 2023",positive,Why have I've watched the saga so many times for some many years I don't understand 🥰😂🥰🙏
"Mar 21, 2023",positive,Fantastic addition to the franchise. Had me in my feels the whole time! Thank you to everyone involved
"Mar 21, 2023",negative,"After the first film written by those who understood nothing about Star Wars, the second one written by those who hate Star Wars, the premises for another failure were all there. There was no time to understand the universe for which they were writing a new story, so they tried to figure out what the fans want. Incredibly they believed that fans still wanted to see Palpatine again, oblivious to the fact that for a true fan Palpatine has served his purpose, narratively speaking, and having him return is just a symptom of laziness and lack of new ideas."
"Mar 20, 2023",positive,I love this film 🎥 and I have nothing wrong with this film it's perfect and it's one of the best films of all time and one of my personal favorite as well I stand bye it and I always will I think it has great action great character arks and a truly satisfying conclusion to this amazing saga that did so much set up that when you get into the final battle it makes me feel like I'm in the world of Star Wars.
"Mar 17, 2023",neutral,Star Wars: Episode IX -- The Rise of Skywalker...Good.
"Mar 16, 2023",positive,Rise of skywalker is a masterpiece. Brilliant I must of rewatched about 500 times. Sheev was amazing
"Mar 16, 2023",positive,"After a disappointing Last Jedi this was fun to watch and brought back that star wars feeling, ending on a hopeful note."
"Mar 15, 2023",negative,"""Palatine has returned""

Kathleen Kennedy should be fired. If The Last Jedi was an insult to Star Wars fans, the ""Rise of Skywalker"" is like being shot in the head.

This movie offers nothing of value to the Star Wars universe, is full of plot holes and bad writing, and actually UNDOES the entire finale of Ep.6 by magically bringing back Sidious as villan. 

It was later revealed that Disney had no plan while making the sequel trilogy for any of the questions posed during the Force Awakens and that is not only disgraceful to Star Wars and it's fans but unforgiveable.

If you love Star Wars, or even just good story telling, avoid the sequel trilogy at all costs."
"Mar 14, 2023",positive,"Esta película estuvo mejor que la octava entrega y la verdad me gusto bastante el final que le dieron a la saga, aunque genero algunas dudas. La verdad tuve que ver toda la saga antes de ver esta última entrega y tuve que descifrar muchas cosas basándome en lo que se vio en las películas anteriores y así entender mucho de lo que parecía carecer de sentido. Además, encontré una explicación sobre porque Rei es una Mary Sue (alerta de Spoiler). La película revela que ella es nieta de Palpatine y creo que eso justifica porque ella tiene tanto potencial, ya que al ver todas las películas varias veces, empecé a notar que al parecer Palpatine era calculador y él pudo deducir de cierta manera mucho de lo que iba a suceder en la saga como si él hubiera planeado todo desde el principio y claramente el paso todo este tiempo en el planeta de los Sith mientras que el Palpatine de la sexta película no era nada más que un clon. Todo lo que se vio en la saga fue parte del gran plan de Palpatine y esta película revela eso de forma implícita. Incluso ya predecía de algún modo (en caso de emergencia) que si Rei no iba a tomar el mando, al menos ella terminaría lo que Palpatine quiso desde un principio y era la paz en la galaxia (como declaro en el episodio 3) y al parecer para conseguirlo, tanto los jedis, como los Sith y hasta el linaje de Skywalker tenían que morir y al final se cumplió ese objetivo. No por nada, Palpatine era el más grande Lord de los Sith porque su plan era perfecto, él era muy poderoso, lo cual lo hizo un Sith perfecto y no sería raro que esa perfección la haya heredado su nieta, ya que en el mundo real los nietos pueden heredar muchas características de sus abuelos, incluyendo la personalidad. En fin, creo que la saga termino bien, aunque quedaron algunas incógnitas que ojalá sean respondidas en las próximas entregas de la saga. Mi calificación para esta película es un 9/10."
"Mar 11, 2023",negative,Anyone who says they liked this movie is lying to themselves. You thought the prequels were cringe...oh boy just you wait
"Mar 10, 2023",negative,Terrible. Tried to fix a lot of the mess of The Last Jedi but the film was a convoluted mess. For the love of God Disney can you ruin Star Wars anymore?
"Mar 9, 2023",negative,"Well, apparently, studios disapproved the previous episode, so they chose to destroy it again and rebuilt it with plot holes, implausibilities, incoherences, and cheap plot twist. At the end, we have a unconsistent deformed trilogy, for (forever) very young kids only. Does it worth it? I don't know. 
Yet the pictures are beautiful"
"Mar 9, 2023",positive,I honestly really like this one. The action was cool and it had some nostalgic moments. I can defintly see the flaws. But its a guilty pleasure for me.
"Mar 7, 2023",negative,Not Star Wars. Not even good enough to qualifiy it as a cringie fan fiction legend.
"Mar 7, 2023",negative,"This one manages to be worse than the episode VII, as the license owner continues to try to transfer the brand equity to the new characters while killing the original ones. This trilogy should not exist."
"Mar 6, 2023",positive,"As the final installment of the new Star Wars trilogy and the conclusion of the Skywalker saga, The Rise of Skywalker had a lot of expectations to meet. While it was a visually stunning and action-packed film, it struggled to balance its many plot threads and deliver a satisfying conclusion.

One of the strengths of the film was its cast, with Daisy Ridley, Adam Driver, and John Boyega all delivering strong performances. The chemistry between the actors was also evident, providing an emotional anchor for the film. Additionally, the film's special effects and cinematography were top-notch, providing breathtaking visuals and exciting action sequences.

However, the film's plot felt overstuffed and rushed. There were multiple storylines and character arcs to follow, and the film struggled to give each one the attention it deserved. As a result, many plot points felt rushed or underdeveloped, and it was difficult to fully invest in the film's story.

The Rise of Skywalker also relied heavily on nostalgia and fan service, often at the expense of character development and plot logic. While some moments may have been enjoyable for longtime fans, they did little to advance the story or provide a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy.

In terms of direction, J.J. Abrams returned to helm the film after directing The Force Awakens, and while he was able to recapture the excitement of the franchise, the film suffered from a lack of cohesion and a clear vision. It felt like Abrams was trying to please everyone, resulting in a film that tried to do too much and ultimately fell short.

The film's score, composed by John Williams, was a highlight, as expected. The iconic Star Wars themes and motifs were used effectively, adding to the emotional weight of the film's key moments.

Overall, Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker was a flawed but enjoyable film. While it may not have been the satisfying conclusion that fans were hoping for, it was still an exciting and visually stunning adventure in the Star Wars universe."
"Mar 5, 2023",positive,"This was ok, but enough already. This was a good conclusion to this gargantuan series of films that simply MUST put in every single easter egg from all the other films into it, and then some. Rey amd company join forces, and then go all over the place to discover how to get to Darth Sidious's lair and kill him once and for all. Rey and Kylo Ren still dont have the best relationship, and many many droids are seen. A fun watch, but I was glad when it was over."
"Mar 1, 2023",negative,"A frustratingly mediocre conclusion to the Skywalker saga. Poorly written, mostly concerned with fan service and undoing everything the previous movie set up. Bringing back the Emperor is the Star Wars equivalent of ‘jumping the shark'. Shame we will never see ‘Duel of the Fates'. As much as I love the Original Trilogy, Star Wars as a brand has become overrated."
"Feb 28, 2023",positive,"I wouldnt say I HATED this, but it's the type of thing you're glad to see done with (I'm not bothering with the Mandolirian at all). Rey finds out more about who she is, Ben finds out more about who HE is, and everyone gets ready for the battle that will essentially be a do or a die for the rebel fleet. Old characters come and go, the dumb humor that seems to have taken hold and refuses to let go is well, still there, and in the end, well, you're glad to see it's done."
"Feb 26, 2023",negative,One of the worst films ever in cinematic history. I don't think ChatGPT could invent something worse.
"Feb 26, 2023",negative,"This may be the Star Wars movie with the worst script ever and with a payoff that's beyond disappointing.

We spend 2 movies only to see our heroes battling Palpatine...again."
"Feb 25, 2023",negative,Dreadfully bad.  Like a bad marvel comics movie.  The plot doesn't even make sense.  The pacing was awful.   I can't say just how disappointed I am on this one.   Pretty sure lots of fake reviews (Disney bots) on this one.
"Feb 24, 2023",negative,"Ruins the entire franchise of Star Wars.  Star Wars was my love and life growing up, but I have grown distaste of it since the creation of the Sequels.  Nothing but plot holes, bad writing, and some of the worst directing I've seen.  JJ Abrams should have his reputation ruined for having ruined arguably one of the greatest film franchises of all time."
"Feb 24, 2023",negative,Another terrible sequel.
"Feb 23, 2023",negative,Oh god no.  How you do Luke Skywalker dirty like that.
"Feb 21, 2023",negative,"A truly horrendous example of filmmaking.  Not only is it poorly written and directed, it effectively ruins one of the most important moments of the original trilogy where PALPATINE DIES (AND WE ALL SAW IT HAPPEN).  JJ Abrams is a small minded hack and a cultural vandal.  He will never be forgiven for ruining the most treasured film franchise of all time."
"Feb 20, 2023",positive,Loved it. Critics and self proclaimed Star Wars experts got it wrong. This is a fun movie. Plot holes? Yes. Still enjoyed it as a popcorn classic nonetheless
"Feb 17, 2023",positive,"My least favorite of the sequels, but I love them all. Billy Dee Williams returning as Lando is something to be treasured for a lifetime and Ian McDiarmid returning as Emperor Palpatine is a sight to behold! Great film!"
"Feb 14, 2023",positive,The ending moment was the best part. That ending part was very nice in my opinion :)
"Feb 13, 2023",negative,"JJ Abrams ensures the sequel trilogy was the worst of the 3 trilogies by essentially reconning half of what was added in The Last Jedi, almost like he wanted to sabotage what it added to the Star Wars story out of spite, while simultaneously characteristically thinking adding a huge battle scene with no story makes a good movie. TLJ was controversial but at least told a story and got creative. JJ Abrams took a hammer to it.

I just watched it 10 minutes ago and I couldn't even tell you what it's about (except for destroying the Empire [excuse me, ""The Final Order"", because apparently he even had to rename it again to make sure TLJ had no impact on the canon]), again, and some big battle scene that made no sense at the end and was full of bad writing. Even the characters seemed to have trouble getting on board with half the things in Abrams' contribution to the story.

The only thing that saved it is the Star Wars universe and continuity canon and story. That alone made it entertaining and a movie a Star Wars fan should obviously watch. But, as many diehard fans have, prepare to be outraged with the complete lack of respect to the SW universe and ROTS' predecessor, The Last Jedi, while simultaneously being hands down the worst title out of the 9 movies.

If you're going to take a hatchet to the last director's work because you don't like what they added to the canon and universe, at least be ready to do better. ROTS doesn't even get off the starting blocks."
"Feb 12, 2023",negative,"My fandom of Star Wars was inherited from my late uncle. I say this because it means that anything Star Wars reminds me of him and almost always makes he happy. This film did not have that affect. If I had to guess, not a single individual person actually cared about the finished product. This movie feels closer to living in Tsarist Russia than living in the world of Star Wars. Stay away and pray for the future."
"Feb 12, 2023",positive,Absolutely loved the third trilogy and this one was perfect. Seeing the heroes of my childhood return was so emotional and I totally recommend these films.
"Feb 9, 2023",neutral,A little lame with some very stupid plot points that don't make any sense but you could say that about the prequel‘s so meh very meh there's nothing really else to say except for kylo Ren was great but I really think Finn and Rey would be great together to be honest I kind of feel bad for Rose 5/10
"Feb 9, 2023",negative,"To be honest with you, I've seen this film twice, and I still don't quite understand anything about this universe. Star Wars to me, is just over the top world building that just confuses everybody. It's not something easy to take in and to understand he literally have to be glued to a television and write down in a logbook in order to keep up. This movie just completely did the same thing to me and threw me off, confused me, and then seen the world implode with the public completely demolishing this film, made my head spin multiple times. It's not a terrible movie but it's definitely something I've never revisited again"
"Feb 7, 2023",negative,Worst movie made and all of this due to J.J. Abrams terrible writing and story telling. He just killed the spirit of Star wars...
"Feb 4, 2023",negative,Not really a starwars movie and portrayed Luke entirely wrong but isn't the worse.
"Feb 4, 2023",neutral,"Terrible writing, pathetic story. It really doesn't even make sense. But disney always likes to make the real heros look like idiots."
"Feb 2, 2023",negative,Terrible plot. Ruined star wars.
"Feb 2, 2023",negative,"Very very very bad, ain't no way palps came back, and Rey died by Palps but some voices in here head beans here back to life, omg garabage"
"Feb 1, 2023",negative,"I am a huge Star Wars fan and I have to say, this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen.  It was obviously rushed, poorly written, poorly conceived, regurgitated material, that lacked any of the spark that George Lucas created.  Disney really needs to take Star Wars is an uncharted direction and allow the creatives to execute their own vision.  This was like watching bad anime that I would prefer didn't exist in the continuity.  The fact that the sequel trilogies didn't even have a solid arc mapped out prior to filming shows that this entire IP is being mismanaged and it needs to be saved for the fandom."
"Jan 31, 2023",positive,"Eh it was alright. Can't say the same about the other 2 movies in this overall terrible trilogy, though."
"Jan 29, 2023",negative,"This is absolute garbage. My living room couch would make a better Executive Producer than Kathleen Kennedy. I am convinced you could write a better film by cramming dialogue into a baby, and then having it projectile vomit across the room. I saw this in cinema, and it was a waste of $30 and the better part of three hours. Three hours that could have been spent doing something better, more wholesome, and healthier for the brain, like eating a 10-course meal made entirely of asbestos. The writers have such a severe lack of intelligence that I'm surprised they have the brainpower to breathe. This film is one of the biggest affronts to the entirety of cinema history I have ever seen, right up there with Jar Jar Binks and the Eragon movie."
"Jan 29, 2023",negative,"bad, movie retconed the origonals and prequels. when anakin killed the emporor in the origonals he brought balance to the force and the fact that the emporor is still alive ruins the point of the first 6 movies along with the fact that all matirials are recicled over and over agian. however this brought a satisfing and spectacular end to the carrer of who ever wrote this crap!"
"Jan 28, 2023",negative,"Poor writing, bad directing"
"Jan 27, 2023",negative,"""Somehow, Palpatine returned."" Kind of sums it up. Even Disney admits they didn't know what they were doing here. All the promise of the characters from Awakens is completely abandoned. The story here just feels like it was written by a committee. I really don't know what to say. It really leaves you with an empty feeling."
"Jan 26, 2023",neutral,This unsatisfying and uninteresting finale to the Star Wars franchise relies more on special effects than on the actual plot of the movie.
"Jan 25, 2023",negative,"bad ending to a bad trilogy, not as bad as episode VIII though."
"Jan 24, 2023",negative,"""Somehow Palpatine has returned.""

In the aftermath of TLJ they had their hands full trying to fix all of the problems the second movie in this series had introduced, and while there are a few good moments, overall they failed. The previous movie left things in such a mess that in an attempt to make this one better they went too deeply into the well of nostalgia and ended up creating some of the worst moments in Star Wars.

I'm a huge Star Wars fan, but the Disney era hasn't been good for star Wars movies. Go watch The Mandalorian, or Andor and skip this."
"Jan 23, 2023",negative,As a fan of Episode 4 to 6 this crappy episode is unbelievably hard to watch.
"Jan 22, 2023",positive,"This movie 
It had so much potential… I really wanted to like it…
It has some great ideas and visuals. Secret dead sith world with cool army, a reborn Palpatine, but it does virtually nothing with them, does nothing to justify or earn them, and makes no sense lore wise at all, and doesn't even try to explain them at all. 
Even the great performances by Ian Mcdiarmid, Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley cannot save this fun but absolute mess of a film. This being said, it still is a mostly enjoyable watch, so long as you don't try to think about it too much."
"Jan 21, 2023",positive,Def good as the old ones but it was still very nice to watch.
"Jan 20, 2023",negative,J.J. Abrams really forgot to write a coherent plot 💀💀💀
"Jan 19, 2023",neutral,Bad. the whole franchise. Gets 2 and a half stars only for the fact that its star wars. would deserve 0 otherwise.
"Jan 18, 2023",negative,"It was just bad. People were crying about last jedi, but I liked it except for casino storyline. But this one is just bad."
"Jan 18, 2023",negative,"Palpatine died in Episode 6. Darth Vader, during his redemptive arc, killed him by throwing him down a reactor shaft. Even if Palpatine survived the fall, the Death Star blew up, which would've killed him. Bringing him back undermines the redemptive arc for Darth Vader. Besides that, the movie doesn't feel as epic as it should for a finale. It doesn't have any phenomenal battles or remarkable lightsaber fights. Furthermore, Rey, Poe, and Finn aren't given enough backstory. Rey is a palpatine, but this concept is never explored, and the movie doesn't say much about Finn or Poe. This whole trilogy by Disney was a massive disappointment."
"Jan 17, 2023",positive,Is it perfect? No. But it's fun.
"Jan 17, 2023",negative,"Likely to be the only Star Wars film that could ever be counted as worse than The Last Jedi, Rise of Skywalker not only continues to insult the intelligence of viewers, but insults the medium of film itself."
"Jan 17, 2023",negative,"Literally undid the entire point of the story of the sequels. 

Vader's sacrifice? Useless. Palpatine survived somehow- and it reads like a bad fanfic. ""But ackshually da emperer survoived, an hesa zombie now, an he has a whole fweet with a thousand ships, and they ALL have death star layzors! An the good guys ride their magic space horses across da ships and win wif friendship, ans din Kilo Rim dies bekus he used to much force healz to save raie!"""
"Jan 14, 2023",negative,"I was eleven when the first Star Wars film came out, and I absolutely loved the original films with a passion. This garbage is so far removed from what I once cared about."
"Jan 13, 2023",positive,"It's obvious that Rise of Skywalker isn't as good as the original trilogy. But it's still a great film, and you should watch it."
"Jan 13, 2023",negative,Completely destroys canon of first 6 films. Does nothing to describe or grow the characters. Best to just treat this latest trilogy as though it didn't happen.
"Jan 13, 2023",negative,"What is there to say that has not already been said?
Truly, this is just another of so many reboots/sequels of beloved franchises that openly mock and insult their fan base.
Claming to be made for ""modern audiences"""
"Jan 12, 2023",negative,"How the heck does this have an 86?!? This movie is awful with some of the worst writing ever. Please, do NOT watch this movie."
"Jan 12, 2023",negative,"Just and awful plot with so many plot holes you wonder if they ever even thought about the script before hand? How does palp have the money or man power to produce all these ships lol, and plenty of others just like her striking down palp just as she said but hes gone? Either way mary sue is just the worst."
"Jan 10, 2023",negative,Nothing more than an appeasement exercise for fan boys. A dreadful end to the Skywalker saga and quite possibly the worst of them all.
"Jan 9, 2023",positive,"Great CGI, Kylo was amazing as always, so big in scale, and Rey truly became a jedi. I do not understand why people hate on this masterpiece. Bringing back Palpatine and the Death Star was nostalgic and all the fights were amazing."
"Jan 9, 2023",positive,"This is what happens when you try to please both sides of a polar divide and end up disappointing the entire spectrum. It has its fun moments, and the cast chemistry is charming. It's always fun to spend time with the legacy characters. It was nice to see C3PO get to shine (sorry). Unfortunately, once you become immune to the nostalgia bate you're left with a mess of a movie. It's fine, but it should have been great."

"Jan 8, 2023",negative,I am not one of those people who talks down to people who like this movie. I'm not going to call someone an idiot for liking a movie I like because that's just dumber than the movie is. The main reason why I'm so down on the The Rise of Skywalker is that it contradicts Anakins prophecy. I know some EU novels do the same but those are not canon. This is.
"Jan 8, 2023",negative,"If u hate yourself watch this movie, and you'll realize there is no god"
"Jan 8, 2023",negative,"The worst trilogy ever made the first order was never explained they misused the original cast in fact they were all disrespected in how they were utilized, this whole thing was without honor and without imagination, Ray was a Mary Sue who the hell was Snoke etc. As far as I'm concerned the story ended on episode 6th  sorry 😞."
"Jan 6, 2023",negative,"The entire sequel series was rushed for a quick buck on Disney's part. The wrong people put in charge entirely. Clearly not super fans of star wars. Castrated Luke freaking skywalker. Split Han and Leia, kills off han, rey is 500% overpowered and has no experience at all and it's just so unbelievable cheesy and an embarrassing movie with the star wars name. Should have went with George's original plan for the sequels. Rey thinking she can call herself a skywalker and for some reason shoot lightning by accident.... come on..... or defeat ""her grandfather"" in like 5 seconds. .. yeah right... the sequels never happened for me and many many many star wars fans. I dont even believe this audience rating on here."
"Jan 5, 2023",positive,Easily my favorite of the Skywalker saga. The only sad thing is we aren't getting another trilogy centered on these characters working to build a better world in the aftermath of the first order.
"Jan 5, 2023",negative,Money grab with bad acting and no well of originality.  Sad to see such meaningless messages act important for the sake of greed.
"Jan 4, 2023",neutral,"The movie suffers from poor character development from the main character, along with ridiculous plot armor and an underwhelming villain. Even the return of a great character from the past couldn't make the movie memorable."
"Jan 3, 2023",positive,I was really looking forward to this movie but it almost felt messy. Lots of things from the previous instalment were left explained and some of this just felt very confusing and sloppy almost to set up for new spin offs. The emperor died at the end of return of the Jedi yet is somehow mysteriously alive. There's lots of things here that just don't sit right and almost feels like a disappointing end to the series.
"Jan 2, 2023",negative,Really bad. Holy movie based on the fact that palpatine somehow returns. Insane mcguffin plot with not much logic. Not really this movie's fault but this movie is really bad.
"Jan 2, 2023",positive,"SW ROS is an incredible film with as good a storyline as could have been concocted (with the following caveats: (1) It in many ways invalidates the core message of Episode 8, that really anybody can be a Jedi; (2) That the location of Exogol was so readily located by Rey and crew when Luke had been searching for it for some time, presumably; (3) That Palpatine came back to life or was cloned? Why not have the First Order based out of the cloning planet in this case, I wonder?; (4) The compass thingy.

Otherwise: Hey, hey, hey!!! This movie is amazing!!!"
"Jan 1, 2023",negative,"Pretty bad, story was terrible but the ships and stuff were cool"
"Dec 29, 2022",negative,"Poorly written, good visuals."
"Dec 29, 2022",negative,A mess. It jumped from one thing to the next without ever caring to see if the audience was onboard or not.
"Dec 29, 2022",negative,"I was on an intercontinental flight and bored out of my mind. I tried watching this movie but it was just so terrible, I couldn't take it anymore when after I somehow made it half way through. I prefered being bored for another 5 hours than continuing this movie for a minute."
"Dec 29, 2022",negative,"Shockingly bad story, disjointed and a hot mess.. What a way to spoil Star Wars.. Disney you should be ashamed of yourselves.. and JJ Abrams too.."
"Dec 28, 2022",negative,Passable but still not a decent film to carry on the story of the prequel or original trilogy. Over the sequel trilogy was disjointed and plagued by uninspiring writing and a chronic inability to bring originality to the franchise.
"Dec 27, 2022",positive,You've got to give a lot of credit to JJ Abrams for salvaging the mess left for them by the prior movie.
"Dec 26, 2022",positive,"The movie isn't great as it should've been, but after replacing the director for 8, this is, to my opinion, the best saving JJ could have done."
"Dec 21, 2022",negative,"ruined an already flawed, uneven new trilogy that lacked a coherent vision"
"Dec 20, 2022",negative,"I just did not enjoy this movie. I think it was annoying how it tried to fit everything in, and it just failed"
"Dec 19, 2022",negative,"This is the absolute worst star wars movie ever made, apart from the last jedi. It really feels like it was written by a toddler."
"Dec 19, 2022",neutral,It had its moments and was far better than Episode 8
"Dec 18, 2022",negative,"JJ Abrams tried to do a repair job in this film to make up for The Last Jedi, but doesn't pull it off. I'll always wonder what might've been if JJ had manned up and directed all three movies, but the fact remains that promise of Force Awakens was never fulfilled…"
"Dec 17, 2022",negative,"Actually, the funniest movie I have ever seen. It is an absolute joy to watch and laugh at how bad it is.  Like a parody that doesn't know it's a parody.  Good casting and great performances, that is its one unironically reddeming quality, so that bumped it up 1 star.  Totally uninventive and bleh.  ""Pew pew, zap, kaboom!"""
"Dec 12, 2022",negative,"This movie wasn't great, to say the least.  The characters were bland, there is rushed love that doesn't make any sense.  Star Wars continues to suffer from bad writing in the sequels."
"Dec 12, 2022",positive,"Good action. Great starring cast. Don’t love the direction they took the story, but being someone that loves all Star Wars, if you accept their decisions, you will enjoy it and the effects are top notch "
"Dec 9, 2022",negative,"It was weird watching a Star Wars movie and just not caring what happens.  I found myself, again and again, saying, ""What?  Sure, I guess.""  Stuff kept happening that didn't make sense, was cringey, or contradicted previous stories, but I just went along with it.  ""Whatever"".  ""I guess that's a thing now"".  Admittedly, it must have been difficult to rescue the franchise after The Last Jedi.  They really painted themselves into a corner with that one.  I guess they had to undo some of the things from that film that in turn had undone things from The Force Awakens.  The whole sequel trilogy is a mess and this film caps it off aptly."
"Dec 3, 2022",positive,Be honest it was not that bad I know it is not good as the rest but it's not too bad
"Dec 3, 2022",negative,Not very good Star Wars.
"Dec 2, 2022",negative,He has neither feet nor head of the one who has been able to like this.
"Dec 2, 2022",positive,good but wanted more
"Nov 30, 2022",negative,"This film was so bad that it made me say ""oh, to hell with this"" for the entire franchise itself. It is chock-full of utter nonsense either explained away in single lines or not at all, and its grand finale is entirely disappointing, doing away with two films worth of conflict in a baffling move. The parting shot (and accompanying final words of the Saga) are such that it ruins the entirety of the 9-episode film collection."
"Nov 29, 2022",positive,"This was honestly a pleasant experience to see in theaters. While there isn't much difference between the ST and OT, what the ST added to the universe makes up for this(partially, and in my opinion). Overall, ok movie. I could sit through the entirety and be pleased."
"Nov 28, 2022",negative,"Could've been fine as standalone, but it's a dumpster fire considering the jarring turns this took from the previous two movies. Like, WHO thought this was a good idea?"
"Nov 26, 2022",negative,"One and a half stars in sympathy for JJ Abrams who had to try to retcon the trilogy after the Last Jedi fiasco.  Unfortunately he failed…  bland characters and a stupid, sloppy plot make ROS a soulless corporate mediocrity."
"Nov 24, 2022",positive,It was okei. Wrong that They made rey related to palatine
"Nov 22, 2022",positive,"The film that resurrected passed characters, killed off key characters, and took itself far too seriously than it needed to almost sounds unbearable to watch. I would highly disagree! It's fun plots, twisted tales and insane CGI graphics make it a fun and highly enjoyable film.
Rated: 3.5/5"
"Nov 20, 2022",positive,"Now I understand that people dislike this movie, but I don't understand why. From its emotional fights and heartfelt deaths to its funny comedy and great finale, I consider this to be my favourite cinema experience of all time, topping The Force Awakens. It has brilliant acting, a good story and is one of the most enjoyable and rewatchable Star Wars movies at the moment 9/10 for me. Way too overhated."
"Nov 20, 2022",negative,"This is a really terrible movie, the podcast criticism of the movie is 3hrs long which is longer than the movie itself!  JJ Bordeoms needs to stop producing terrible scifi films with lens flares, he needs to be forcibly removed as director from future scifi projects!"
"Nov 18, 2022",negative,"This movie was all over the place. It brought back characters that should have been left alone. The plot felt like it was invented at the last minute which is probably accurate considering the feedback from the second movie, and some characters get no screen time at all when they were focal in the first two movies or just the second one (rose). Super weird movie. Was ultimately worse than the second one because at least the second one felt plausible. This one feels like a 5 year old wrote the script. And I am not a huge fan of the second one either."
"Nov 16, 2022",negative,WHERE DID THE THOUSANS OF FULLY MANED DEATH STAR STAR DISTRYERS COME FROM? With the Sith knife you need to line it up with a crashed star destroyer EXATLY like what if they were 100 meters to the left the it wouldn't of lined up. Also the part with Palpatine was horrible like he died in the original trilogy you don't live from an explosion that completely destroys you. The part with Rey saying I am all the Jedi and you hear their voices was really cool. It was a super underwhelming movie.
"Nov 16, 2022",negative,It WAS the perfect end to a shitty trilogy.
"Nov 15, 2022",positive,the movie is good and it's better than tpm and aotc
"Nov 15, 2022",positive,"A movie that should have been two movies. A decent movie in and of itself, if you can let yourself ignore the plot contrivances and dropped side characters. This movie had to deal with the brunt of the damage caused by the flip-flop of directors and did its best with what it had. 

All of the actors do their best with what they are given, and the performances by Ridley and Driver are particularly undeniably superb."
"Nov 15, 2022",positive,I don't care what people say. I think this is a brilliant movie.
"Nov 12, 2022",positive,"Great, I love this one, every part of the story is important ,"
"Nov 11, 2022",negative,One of the worst star wars movie ever.
"Nov 8, 2022",negative,"This is just a lazy writing. the ""Duel of the Fate"" title that they cancelled is better."
"Nov 7, 2022",positive,Sad to see the saga end but it was good
"Nov 7, 2022",negative,"Not much to say honestly. Lazy writing at its finest, acting mediocre at best. Not really a Star wars saga worthy product tbh, more suitable for a b production kind of a flick. Gruesome and dismal."
"Nov 6, 2022",negative,"The whole script is an insult to fans. The lack of character developments throughout the sequel trilogy is glaring and the fact that episode 8 really broke everything about the Skywalker saga cannot be undone, especially not by brining back Palpatine. Instead of fixing the Last Jedi, it just keeps on digging deeper into stupidity."
"Nov 6, 2022",negative,"How this is rated so much better than the last Jedi baffles me, this felt kind of messy, fan service-y, and just not good, I accept it into the canon because I'm not a baby, but I just really don't like this"
"Nov 4, 2022",negative,"the worst part of this movie isn't the horrible story, pacing and insane plot points. its the fact that they introduce a completely impossible ability that is literally a spit in the face to the ENTIRE saga before that. the fact that a random girl with no training can heal and bring people back to life with the force, when ANAKIN SKYWALKER the one BORN FROM THE FORCE literally caused the entire original trilogy because he couldn't do this, is honestly insulting to everything george created. how did they manage to create a character so absurdly overpowered that they made darth vader look weaker?"
"Nov 2, 2022",positive," Ends the trilogy without doing anything memorable with any of the new characters. Like Finn wanting to tell Rey something that he never does. With Palpatine back for no good reason. Still, it’s entertaining half assed ending."
"Nov 2, 2022",positive,"Best thing jj could have done after johnson's terrible and cringe ""the last jedi"""
"Nov 2, 2022",positive,"I know a lot of people don't like this movie (and Rey), but this movie (AND REY) it's good. Ok? Just accept that!"
"Nov 2, 2022",negative,Rey's story could have been better. Kylo Ren's redemption could have been less predictable and Finn and Rose were sidelined. I blame the toxic fans of Star Wars for how this movie turned out.
"Nov 1, 2022",negative,"By far the worst star wars movie, the script, acting and directing, all of it. The ony good part is o.c. the music. They could have done everything better. I'd love to see an movie with the old script.
Overall this is the WORST STAR WARS MOVIE."
"Nov 1, 2022",negative,"I don't know how J.J. Abrams managed to go from a great movie like The Force Awakens to a disaster like Rise of Skywalker. This atrocity breaks every already established rules of Star Wars by adding any power that the plot requires. A good movie has a protagonist that has flaws. And in the third movie featuring Rey, she seems to lack any flaw at all. There are absolutely no stakes in this movie. The villain was completely unoriginal. It seems that the writers seemed to have forgotten that the Emperor died in Return of the Jedi. And the addition of a love story that makes as much sense as Count Dooku and Jar Jar Binks. This movie is lucky that Solo exists because it is the only thing that saves it from being the worst Star Wars movie. I would rather watch the Star Wars Holiday Special and three Ewok spin offs consecutively."
"Oct 28, 2022",negative,"I was surprised at how bad this movie was. JJ Abrams usually has great tastes when it comes to sci-fi, but his charm just wasn't there. The entire movie was a rushed hodge podge of fan service, featuring no original score, a cringeworthy opening crawl, and no feeling whatsoever. Palpatine was really boring in this movie, which I would never say about his performance in the other movies. The ending, where Poe says ""There's too many of them"" and Lando saying ""But there are more of us"" was just TRYING TO AVENGERS ENDGAME SO HARD. But this movie is nowhere near as good as Endgame. Hell, in my opinion, it's not even nearly as good as the other Star Wars movies (yes, that includes the prequels and the Last Jedi). This movie just killed my interest in the franchise that I hold very close to my heart. It was so tiring, none of the characters were likable, and was clearly an example of Disney having a tight deadline on everything. If this movie had more time in the oven, it could've been something special. But it's not."
"Oct 27, 2022",negative,I am a big fan of Star Wars. My favorite tv serie. But this last trilogy is a total failure. It is the movie that never should be done.
"Oct 27, 2022",positive,"The film suffers from the same problems as The Last Jedi… long dialogue-driven plot lines full of exposition and dull character moments, but it comes full circle to a thrilling, satisfying conclusion"
"Oct 27, 2022",negative,Star Wars is some of the most sophomoric storytelling.
"Oct 24, 2022",positive,Disappointing close to the trilogy but had some good moments in there and amazing cgi. Overhated and still very enjoyable but very valid criticisms.
"Oct 23, 2022",positive,The Rise of Skywalker perfectly concluded this Legendary Skywalker Saga of Star Wars. The twist of palpatine is one of the best in SW. Rey being Palpatine's descendant makes much more sense considering her raw powers. This movie tributed the saga and legacy characters perfectly. Stunning work by JJ Abrams. And again Daisy Ridley nailed it. Her performance as Rey will surely be among the greatest Star Wars performances. Rey Skywalker is now an iconic & one of the great SW Characters.
"Oct 23, 2022",negative,Worst Star Wars. I don't even think they thought this through at all. Terrible waste of everyone's time.
"Oct 22, 2022",negative,"Really? You resurrect Palpatine to save face? This is what fans get for being fans. I am at a loss for words. This is the death of science fiction as we know it. Denis Villeneuve please save us. This movie is riddled with bad acting, terrible script, extremely bad space battle tactics and worse yet - plot! Another movie where cgi is used to make lots of shiny screen time so as to hide the bad and hollow characters seem larger than life."
"Oct 21, 2022",positive,"Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker suffers from a frustrating lack of imagination, but concludes this beloved saga with fan-focused devotion."
"Oct 21, 2022",negative,"incoherent story, very lazy writing. Why do they have to create the story that way ""Somehow palpatine return"" thats stupid. If he needed to show up at least a force form"
"Oct 21, 2022",negative,This movie should be considered a crime against humanity. There is not a single second of enjoyment watching it. Not a good catchphrase or a good action sequence. Just a sad series of scenes where a good franchise depoisits its hopeless hopes and fades into oblivion. I've never felt as bad as I did watching a movie in my life.
"Oct 19, 2022",negative,"For someone who genuinely enjoyed The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi, The Rise of Skywalker was a massive letdown. 

I think it would have been a better story with a different director and screenwriter."
"Oct 19, 2022",positive,"The haters can say what they want about this movie; but I'll tell you the truth. The conclusion makes no sense if you are a 48 year old gamer man living in their mum's basement but to someone who likes the franchise and can accept it for what it is. The VFX are stunning and Palpatine is awesome either way. My only quarrel is inventing a fourth (Tatooine, Genosis, Jakku) desert planet. JUST PICK ONE! The colour palette is extremely recognisable, a blue grey dominating the film. Kylo Ren is menacing, however I do think Kelly Marie Tran's Rose Tico was sidelined substantially in this instalment, undoing all of the Last Jedi. Either way, It's better than the Last Jedi and an overall good film."
"Oct 18, 2022",positive,It was an oke Movie. Could have been better
"Oct 17, 2022",negative,"Made a RT account just to give it 1 star. Messy way to end the trilogy, they obviously didn't plan out the whole trilogy together, they just tried to throw in a bunch of fan service to make a big ending."
"Oct 16, 2022",neutral,"The movie delivered on a conclusion, all right--It just didn't deliver on much else.

To its credit, this film had some bold ideas, but they weren't very good, and too much of the movie felt like the studio was trying to clean up after the terrible Last Jedi. The movie as a whole feels lazy, and while the ending has the finality of what someone would expect from the conclusion of a decades-old franchise, it doesn't feel earned. After the first act, the plot feels predictable and boring, the character development is almost nonexistent (THREE major characters have fake-out deaths or conclusions that are then retconned within minutes), and the script is borderline amateur. 

While the cast is still great, they really had their work cut out for them on this one."
"Oct 16, 2022",positive,"This is another pretty decent CGI filled Star Wars films, with some impressive landscapes, quirky characters/creatures (including Babu Frik( and some good dialogue. It didn't grip me quite as much as other films but its by no means a bad film. The plot is interesting. I thought it was surprising that Richard E Grant appeared in this film... certainly an entertaining film, this is still worth seeing if your a fan of the franchise, certainly."
"Oct 16, 2022",positive,In my opinion the sequels asw very overhated I will say this one feels like there was stuff they needed to change it is still a good film
"Oct 15, 2022",positive,it's good movie y'll
"Oct 15, 2022",positive,Star wars was a magnificent franchise but now the saga has ended but with an amazing conclusion. Although the final duel didn't left any memorable sensation for the franchise as a finale
"Oct 14, 2022",negative,"The dysfunction of the sequel trilogy is on full display with The Rise of Skywalker. I wonder what JJ Abrams and Rian Johnson's relationship is like, because according to these films, they absolutely despise each other. From the line, ""A Jedi's weapon deserves more respect"" to the minimization of Rose, to the following interaction, ""We need to pull some Holdo maneuvers""... ""Come on. That move is one in a million"", Abrams is purposefully jabbing at The Last Jedi the whole film.

Take away those feelings of division, and this film is still not very good. It was nice to see the three heroes on a journey together (though that probably should have happened in Episode VII). There are some truly stunning visual sequences (though not as good as Episode VIII).

Unfortunately, since the stakes keep getting raised every film (Death Star, bigger Death Star, fleet of Death Stars, etc.) my investment level is very low. When Finn says, ""We take the war to them!"", I stopped and wondered ""who exactly is ""them""?

A disappointing end to a retcon mess of a trilogy, it's frustrating to think about the potential of what could have been.

Best Character: Poe
Best Scene: Passing the lightsaber from Rey to Kylo (though I don't love the implications with force manipulation, the scene is pretty cool)
Best Quote: ""In the event I don't make it back, I want you to know you've been a real friend, R2. My best one, in fact."" - C3PO"
"Oct 12, 2022",negative,"As a lifelong fan of Star Wars, it is sad to see what the franchise has become. The film tries to please as many people as possible and as a result it feels soulless as if it were created on an assembly line. While all films lie somewhere on the spectrum between art and commodity, this feels so removed from any passion that so many feel for the franchise that it feels like a nauseating roller coaster you never think about again once you get off of it. Disney has discovered they can throw near anything out the masses and rake in a billion dollars that their desire to tell compelling stories is gone."
"Oct 8, 2022",negative,This movie is devoid of any story. It is one big noisy music video with little or no plot. Doesn't help that you have a main villain that is like a raging twit throughout and a heroine that is so OP it is a pointless character. This is worse than the Ep 1-3 and second worst SW movie of all time after the idiotic Last Jedi where people can breathe in space with no consequences
"Oct 6, 2022",neutral,"The plot was a complete mess, and after about 40 minutes, I started to think that maybe I had missed a movie in this series because I had absolutely no understanding what was happening! And even when the movie ended (finally), I was still confused about what the point of it was. You had to see it to believe it, but everyone in this movie possessed superpowers that could rival Superman's, and they were all on the move, looking for artefacts and heading somewhere. The upcoming films better be a bit different or even take some inspiration from the old films as there was nothing really wrong with them."
"Oct 5, 2022",negative,"It's hard to get my feelings on this movie at times and the movie's narrative is a bit McGuffiny and messy, The Rise of Skywalker is still a brilliant movie with fabolous performances, a great portrayal of Palpatine, epic action, solid humor and shocking moments that make this the perfect conclusion to the 42 years old Skywalker Saga. (enter false)"
"Oct 5, 2022",negative,This was hefty! Please stop the greed and ignorance and give us some intelligent script writing and some good character development! At least!
"Oct 5, 2022",negative,Plot is kinda weird. Bringing palpatine back was a terrible idea. A couple dumb moments in the plot and some dumb characters. Entertaining but not satisfying
"Oct 4, 2022",neutral,"I will openly acknowledge that this film is considerably more entertaining and considerably less insulting (both as a Star Wars fan and as a human that believes in decency) than The Last Jedi, and unlike that horrible film, I can see myself maybe revisiting this movie from time to time - I mean, we're talking maybe once or twice a decade, but it's not alongside TLJ in my: ""I genuinely hope I never have to go through that again"" list of films.  Having said that, The Rise of Skywalker is a very, very, very dumb film, overblown in every conceivable way, and chock-full of contrivances that come from absolutely nowhere to allow the plot to progress (at a clip that was likely set solely so nobody in the audience can stop and think about how stupid it all is).  However, considering that EVERY plot thread from The Force Awakens was severed and made irrelevant in The Last Jedi, it's clear that the writers were forced to come up with something to completely rewrite this now completely broken trilogy.  I will also give the movie that it actually does have some good action sequences - something that was, somehow, almost entirely missing from its two predecessors, and both the cinematography and Art Design are better than in the previous entry as well.  The music is solid and the VFX (which I actually helped with -- not as an artist but as someone who actually helped fix a problem with a render farm!  No, seriously!!) are generally very solid as well.  The acting is kinda flat, but at this point it was clear that the morale of those involved with this trilogy had plummeted, so I don't discredit the Actors or the Director.  And in terms of things that this movie genuinely does right, it does allow the three main characters to be together for much of the movie (which is good as they have a unified charisma when together), the movie doesn't have the morally repugnant lessons that its predecessor had, and while I hated the finale from a story perspective, I do appreciate what it actually tried to do; like, serious points for trying.  They also had a moment I genuinely loved where Chewbacca breaks down and cries when Leia dies (her actress passed away before filming, so this isn't a spoiler), as characters grieving the losses of those that they, and the audience, loved was something also sorely missing from this film's predecessor.  The biggest flaw, really, beyond the almost insultingly contrived plot, is that the reintroduction of Palpatine as the main villain only acts to negate (almost entirely) the struggles of the main heroes in the original Trilogy.  It's odd, as simply having this be a different villain would've made this a lot better.  Overall, The Rise of Skywalker has fireworks, has energy, has charisma and has brain-damage - it tries and utterly fails, but I actually felt like the film wanted me to be happy, and so, truthfully, I cannot bring myself to hate it, despite how bad it ultimately is."
"Sep 30, 2022",negative,"Unlike the Force Awakens or Last Jedi, it is boring and the story is lame. This title doesn't even deserve the name ‘Star Wars' to be in its title. Such a sad way to end a great franchise. Absolute shit show…4/10"
"Sep 29, 2022",negative,I don't like that the bring Palpatine back and I especially hate the way they explain him being a clone of some kind better then 8 but that's not saying much
"Sep 27, 2022",negative,What a mess.  It undermines the movies that came before it an illogical plot.  The failed attempt to make meaningful dialogue out of the few Carrie Fisher scenes leftover from earlier movies are a slap in the face to a great actress.  Director JJ Abrahams seems more intent on making a collection of catchy scenes than of building a compelling story.  It even rips off The Goonies at one point (the knife map).  Sad and underwhelming.
"Sep 26, 2022",negative,"It was better than The Last Jedi. It was worse than the Phantom Menace. All things considered, the tv survived the movie. Barely."
"Sep 24, 2022",positive,"Probably the best, what anyone could do after ruin johson nearly killed whole saga.
e9 is not good, and doesn't add or creates anything, but at least it fixes sequel tragedy, I mean trilogy so it doesn't break SW mythology."
"Sep 24, 2022",positive,The original trilogy is still better. It seems a little ridiculous after having watched it.
"Sep 24, 2022",negative,Plot holes and poorly written. At least the effects were good.
"Sep 22, 2022",negative,"I wish that i could give it 0 stars. No storyline, no character growth, just super awful to watch. An insult to the Star Wars saga and should have been removed from canon a long time ago."
"Sep 21, 2022",positive,I like this movie. I have always felt like it is a star wars end game. now it has problems MANY problems but I can look past most if not all of them and immerse myself in this bad ass film.
"Sep 21, 2022",negative,"Visuals were amazing, the story was NOT."
"Sep 19, 2022",positive,Best of Movies/TV Series Collection
"Sep 18, 2022",positive,"I do not get the hate for this movie. It is still not a good Star Wars movie but out of the new trilogy, this is the best one."
"Sep 17, 2022",negative,"The Rise of Skywalker manages to undo the most important character arc of the original trilogy for the sake of having a bad guy that people recognize. Canon is destroyed, interesting characters (like Finn) are sidelined and wasted and we're left with an incohesive and relatively unmemorable mess. As the capper of the ""Sequel Trilogy"" fans of the franchise will actually long for the Prequels. 

If you're a Star Wars fan that hasn't seen this, you'd do best to avoid it and watch Clone Wars, Rebels, or Mandalorian instead."
"Sep 15, 2022",negative,"The first film was a microwaved leftover of the original trilogy, the second was an embarrassing attempt to subvert expectations at all costs. This final film was just a desperate last attempt to recover something lost along the way. It was just a bitter disappointment at the end of an awful, disjointed trilogy.

Don't get me wrong, as always a star wars film is a visual spectacle. In that regard alone this film succeeded. In all other ways, including the atrocious PR from disney before and after the films release, treating disgruntled long-term fans and critics like perpetrators of hate crimes, the movie failed utterly. Every plot twist and reveal seemed horribly contrived. Every attempt at humor was forced. Even the action scenes came across as though the showrunners treated it like some kind of obligation somehow. In the end though, don't know what I find more worthy of contempt. This film's bizarre, lackluster script or the fans of the film with their heads in the sand. Save yourself the trouble and avoid the online community, its a toxic wasteland. The film is not much better."
"Sep 14, 2022",positive,"With the disaster that was its predecessor, the odds were stacked against this film. It does an okay job at trying to salvaging this trilogy, but ultimately the whole story feels chaotic, ill-thought and rushed. As well as bouncing around all over the place, I feel it missed opportunities to give long-time fans some payoff - Hayden Christensen should have had a cameo in this film. It's a suitably disappointing conclusion to a forgettable trilogy."
"Sep 13, 2022",negative,A very hollow ending. The characters didn't have any trouble with anything they just happened to stumble upon every they needed. The whole trilogy didn't even have a plan from the beginning. It feels like you can see the director Jj Abrams fighting with the director of the last movie (the last Jedi directed by Ryan Johnson) on screen. And in the end the person with no training is able to beat emporer Palpatine at the most powerful he has ever been without even trying just deflecting his lightning back at him which Palpatine knows hurts him so he should have stopped when it started. Also the Anakin is the one supposed to bring balance to the force yet this character if you can call her that has not had any training and brings balance to the force.
"Sep 13, 2022",negative,"Feels like i watched the same thing but with new cast, felt very meh."
"Sep 13, 2022",negative,"The worst ending for a starwars film, they should have never done this trilogy"
"Sep 12, 2022",negative,"Um filme sem Alma, uma trama de busca , que no final vemos que é uma cópia do filme vingadores ultimato só que sem ser excelente, copiando até a sequência da batalha final"
"Sep 12, 2022",negative,"This movie was so disappointing, the actors did their best but the story and the characterization of the protagonists was just so stupid. There is so much wrong with this movie for me to list everything. Sadly it was just fast paced nothing."
"Sep 12, 2022",positive,"Enjoyed this next installment in the series and thought it was a great continuation of the story & legacy of Star Wars as it pays tribute to Princess Lea & Luke Skywalker. Can't wait to see what happens next with Rey, Kylo Rhen and the gang on their adventures against the dark forces"
"Sep 10, 2022",neutral,"It's acceptable... The prequels are worse than this but comparing the films doesn't make this a good movie it's still a mess. Somehow a character that we HAVEN'T seen in years & hasn't been mentioned or hinted at returns as the main villain of the movie with no explanation other than ""Somehow Palpatine has returned"". I also hate how the force is used in this movie as basically plot magic I don't mind if the force is used in new ways we haven't seen before but using the force to just explain every question in the movie is frustrating. The only thing that works in this film for me is Kylo Ren except for his redemption it felt super lazy & generic to me & the fact that Rey beat him many times before this film so it makes me not find him as much of a threat when he is up against Rey."
"Sep 9, 2022",negative,"Restart the sequels with young Luke waking up from visions like Anakin did in ROTS so, all this movies can be considered a vision that someone sent to Luke. Disney can easily fix this situation please do it. Episode 9 is a major disappointment and I am really sorry to say this."
"Sep 8, 2022",negative,"This Movie was kinda doomed to fail after TLJ. Still it amazes me, how actually bad the Movie was in the end. Let's go:

They ressurected Palpatine - so desperate, so dumb; Insane pacing; Why does the First Order reign?; Oh Rey is 'training'; she can fly?; stupid McGuffins all over the place; A Dagger that fits the Ruins of the DeathStar?? Are you kidding me; Video Game Progression of the story; super weird carry fisher scenes and dialog (well she was dead...); idiotic plot; planet killing star destroyers that chill around in a planet; The don't know which way is up; They loose against small junk ships; Kylo Ren has a stupid arch; Rey cheapshots Kylo, then heals him again; Oh yeha Rey can force heal now; so can Kylo; He dies though, she doesn't..."
"Sep 8, 2022",negative,An attempt to stitch together a bunch of broken sequels.
"Sep 7, 2022",positive,"Growing up in the 90's I was shocked when I learned that people didn't like, or even hated Return of the Jedi. I loved it! Now, here I am, with a not uncommon experience of feeling disappointed with Rise of Skywalker. There are some fantastic scenes, even some interesting new lore to explore in this movie. I can't help but wonder how this movie will be seen ten, or twenty years from now,"
"Sep 7, 2022",negative,"We all wanted to be good, but it's sadly not. The actors don't make you believe the story, there is no scenario. A disappointment."
"Sep 7, 2022",negative,"Terrible, all 3 of the last trilogy were Terrible."
"Sep 7, 2022",negative,Expected something better from JJ Abrams.  This finale to a well-established and revered franchise is nothing short of an embarrassment.
"Sep 6, 2022",neutral,A mediocre end to what started as a promising new trilogy. Couldn't make good the hatchet job of The Last Jedi...
"Sep 5, 2022",negative,"Well, it wasn't as awful as The Last Jedi but not by much. The story once again is ridiculous Mystery Box mania which goes no where; the characters are all flat except for Kylo who actually seems to be trying to act; the humor is not funny; and the ending is pure drivel. The only thing good about this film is that finally the cringy sequel trilogy has ended."
"Sep 5, 2022",negative,"Not only is it an insult to the the past movies and the complete star wars universe but it is also absolute garbage, the plot progresses horribly the entire movie, not having clear goals, having plot holes left and right, no propper set up for things, overall it's almost as bad as The Last Jedi."
"Sep 5, 2022",positive,I watched it for its Visual Effects.
"Sep 4, 2022",negative,"Pretty darn bad, but I am sympathetic to the challenge of trying to pick up the pieces after The Last Jedi basically mashed together Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, killed off Snoke and Luke in unsatisfying fashion, and permanently split the fanbase. This whole movie is an exercise in ""quick, let's hurry to the next thing to try to keep the audience from thinking about how none of this makes sense."""
"Sep 3, 2022",negative,"The characterization of established characters is bad and in conflict with their experiences, even when they try to patch up previous movies portrayals that are also awful. The new characters are poorly written with lack of actual character and depth.
The plot is frankly ridiciculous full of plot holes and coincidences on galactic scale and it ignores what is established from previous movies yet also contradicts itself even."
"Sep 3, 2022",negative,Ignoble end to a legendary saga.
"Sep 3, 2022",negative,"Completely incongruous with the other two films. You can tangibly feel the mad scrambling of the film creators trying so hard to salvage something, *anything*, to make this film work. What's left is just sad."
"Sep 3, 2022",negative,Incredibly bad all the way through. Completely ruins its legacy while it walks and stomps all over it. A limp finale for a terrible series.
"Sep 3, 2022",negative,"Not good, worse then the 2nd installment in the trilogy and I didn't think that was possible."
"Sep 2, 2022",negative,Last minute rush job to try and rescue a disastrous trilogy with no vision or planning..
"Sep 2, 2022",negative,Better then last jedi but that is the worst big blockbuster released in the last twenty years so not saying much. This is still terrible in every area truly laughable how anyone made it and thought it was any good!
"Sep 1, 2022",negative,:/ this was such a bad film. I'm glad that we can ignore the Disney installments and pretend none of this happened.
"Aug 31, 2022",negative,A failed attempt to fix the problems the last Jedi created and arguably the force awakens too.
"Aug 30, 2022",negative,"Just a huge mess.  Made no effort to integrate any of what came before, 
Even Lando showing up isn't enough to save the day.   

Maybe its for the best though, maybe the failure of one of the golden cows of cinema will give a little look in to original material. Even star wars was new once...."
"Aug 30, 2022",positive,"Star Wars: the Rise of Skywalker achieves to undo the direction of its predecessor. Though the movie still remains visually stunning to look at without standing special facts, Star Wars episode nine fails to recover from the jumbled mess that was episode eight. The only reason why I am being gracious is because this movie did move at a pretty good pace and I did have more fun with the action in this movie. Overall, this movie was extremely sloppy."
"Aug 29, 2022",neutral,"Had some cool moments but still the worst of the sequels. the writing is so attrocious its almost satire at times. Horrible pacing and editing. cheesy dialouge , and boring story."
"Aug 29, 2022",negative,"This is my least favourite film of all time. It is completely devoid of soul rehashing character arcs already completed to bring back a long obsolete character that died meaningfully and that we were done with. It is riddled with constant plot holes and half of the films run time is a fetch quest filled with padding and complications that amount to nothing. This film is a complete failure of all imagination. It fails at every opportunity to come up with anything new. I assume children who haven't seen the originals, who are unable  to understand the references will leave this movie confused and unimpressed by how underwhelming the film is. You could have 1000 nostalgic feel good moments but it could never be a good story. Instead of continuing the story that was set up with the last jedi they decided to make a nostalgic omage to star wars. And the worst part is the retconing of luke skywalker who died meaningfully saving the rebellion. Luke's sacrifice was meant to be showing the galaxy the legendary warrior version of luke, the hero, despite the fact that that version of Luke didnt really exist. That didnt matter because he played the part anyway buying time for the rebellion to escape and create a legend that will inspire hope for generations. But what does this film do? It undermines all of that by having Luke catch the lightsaber and saying that all of his previous conclusions were wrong. All because some dipshits who don't understand story telling didnt want good ol Luke skywalker to die this way because I dont know apparently Luke is supposed to be fucking imortal or something. The rise of skywalker is by far the most disgusting, unimaginative and pathetic piece of cinema I have ever had the displeasure of witnessing"
"Aug 29, 2022",negative,"Instead of real Star Wars movies we get these hyper-productized safe emulations that suffer from boringly overwhelming lack of creativity. In terms of ideas there is just a surface that is nothing more than a tenuos collage that constanty collapses due to its brute forced buildup. Suddenly falling through sand to find a dagger that suddenly shows a way to a map, then a non-creative epic battle at the end - this is plot carrying at its worst."
"Aug 29, 2022",positive,I am a first order guy and I think that Emperor Palpatine is the best. I think that Rey being his grandchild is dumb and not true and the star destroyer being destroyed is not good. I know that Rey is not a Skywalker and it does no look good on the Skywalker name.
"Aug 27, 2022",negative,"Black holes learn how to suck from Disney starwars. Makes episodes 1,2, and 3 look like masterpieces"
"Aug 25, 2022",negative,"This movie is bad in so many ways, but what bothers me the most is how good and ready the protagonist is, there is no journey like we see with Anakin and Luke."
"Aug 24, 2022",positive,"While it is still frustratingly inconsistent and leaves a whole lot unanswered, it does fix some of the obvious carelessness with The Last Jedi and even offers some explanations to The Force Awakens."
"Aug 24, 2022",negative,"The fact ppl liked this, shows just how dumbed down humans have become!"
"Aug 24, 2022",negative,"I hope the cast and crew continue on to have great success in the industry and make their mark on the world of cinema. The producers, head writers, and Darth Abrams on the other hand, I hope this massive failure will teach them to stop underestimating audience intelligence and to stop using mystery boxes and whiplash inducing subversion devices."
"Aug 23, 2022",negative,"Disney, once again you took what you already killed and proceeded literally resurrect it and then kill it again. The sith won, congratulations. A Palpatine literally stole the Skywalker name, stole Luke's home, his lightsabers and his sunset."
"Aug 22, 2022",negative,"It's pretty much one of the worst Star Wars movies. I gave it one full star instead of half a star only because the movie is technically good (sound, visual effects etc.). The movie fails to provide sensible character motivations and comprehensible pacing. The worst offense is how it breaks the lore of previous films. Anakin's sacrifice and redemption didn't mean anything. The struggles of the rebellion were for nothing and an old baddie is shoehorned in because Star Wars is afraid to do anything different."
"Aug 22, 2022",negative,"No direction, character development, and senseless plots.  Granted, there was no direction, or point in the last one to come up with a way to continue it, the idea made no sense, and destroyed the points of the originals.  They should have outlined a story before starting the sequels.  The Empire had countless people suddenly to run each Star Destroyer?  Everyone is wishy-washy on what side they are on?"
"Aug 22, 2022",negative,Does not even deserve half a star. Absolute garbage that completely retcons the prophecy of the chosen one. If anakin didn't actually kill palpatine… then his entire character arc over six movies is pointless and irrelevant. JJ and Kennedy should be absolutely ashamed of themselves.
"Aug 22, 2022",negative,"Didn't hate either TFA or TLJ when I watched them. Both were kind of just meh for me. This film makes me look back on both of them with disdain. I'm no Star Wars super fan, but this ruins everything good about the franchise. This is truly one of the two worst films I have had the displeasure of seeing ever in my life."
"Aug 21, 2022",negative,One of the most incompetent movies ever made.
"Aug 21, 2022",neutral,"It's very hard to get behind this movie. I disagree with the very way that they set out to make it honestly. They felt the need to wrap up the trilogy, as well as every other episode in the series, while at the same time catering to the people who hated all of the changes from The Last Jedi. Within that context, they probably did make the best movie they could. But that's just way too much to try to cram into one movie, and I feel it's unnecessary in the first place. The only good thing I can say about it really, is that it does bring everything to a conclusion. Nothing is really left unanswered, even if it was answered in a terribly clunky way. Really, it's just painful to watch this trilogy at all, knowing how it ends, and how much better it could have been.
5/10"
"Aug 21, 2022",negative,"Truly awful. 

Absolute destruction of fandom."
"Aug 19, 2022",negative,"As a life long star wars fan, I couldn't be more disappointed. The only reason I gave it one star was because Abrams was given a horrific mess by Rian Johnson to clean up"
"Aug 16, 2022",negative,"franchise ruined, completely crapped all over their own fanbase.  Cool business model Kathleen Kennedy"
"Aug 15, 2022",positive,esta pelicula ofrece una buena conclusion de la saga con una gran devocion a la original
"Aug 15, 2022",negative,"The worst thing Star Wars has ever created. A movie that feels like it has no relation to all the movies before it, which detracts from, maybe even destroys, Anakin, Luke, and so many other character's arcs, and which decides to forget Finn, Poe, Rose and every other character the previous movies introduced in order to focus solely on Rey and maybe a bit of Kylo Ren. Overall this movie just feels like it is a massive joke on all the other star wars movies up to this point and is not at all deserving of being the finale, nonetheless canon in Star Wars."
"Aug 14, 2022",negative,"the laziest movie ever made
""somehow palpatine returned"""
"Aug 14, 2022",positive,"This is so dang good! I loved every second of it, It had a lot to do in the time it had. I really didnt enjoy last jedi, I only watched it once and I wanted to just get up and leave but this one had me on the eage of my seat - in the good way! This one is a match to the first one and the characters feels true to the ones we are introduced to in the first one and the story makes more sense and feels like we are back in the world of star wars. If you like the first one you will definitely like this one but if you liked the last jedi then you might not like this one as mucht as this is a returen to the world introduced in the first one"
"Aug 10, 2022",negative,"Meh. Not good at all. The plot was nonsensical. Your basic McGuffin chase against a villain who once again has the capability to destroy planets. But the McGuffin itself didn't make a lot of sense. And the villain's ability to destroy planets was a vain attempt to up the ante for a series in which the villains have already been capable of doing that... three times already. 

The appearance of the main antagonist basically steals the thunder from the original trilogy in this series. And his plans were seemingly patched together to keep the plot moving forward. 

This latest trilogy was bad as a whole, but this last installment was the worst and easily skipable."
"Aug 10, 2022",negative,"So many plot holes, inaccuracies and mistakes were made it feels like someone without any knowledge of Star Wars wrote the plot. Prepare to have you nostalgia bone sucked even drier."
"Aug 8, 2022",neutral,"Upon my original 8/10 review - Just did a tripple bill topped with a midnight screening. Blimey! Anyway, I hated The Last Jedi at what I promised would be my LAST midnight screening, and although movies this late are spoiled by the timing of these midnight screening things, this one managed to keep me stoked. Actually finishes the whole saga off very nicely. The handling of the Carrie Fisher difficulty was quite good, considering they just wrote new dialogue around scenes cut from the first film in this trilogy, rather than CGI ing her in. A little forced, but for the most part worked. It's probably something of an 8/10, maybe more. They introduced a rather spectacular dark side aspect that I wish they gave a little more time to breath. Another positive that came out of this one is that it ties on to The Last Jedi quite well. I felt the Last Jedi ended up messing things set up in the first one, in the hands of another writer, but feel differently about that middle chapter now.

A later viewing, one that significantly down graded it

Having re-watched the originals, the prequels, rolled through the new seasons, the new movies, I reached this again to find it lacking something significant. I realise Carrie Fisher's death doubtless threw this movie out of orbit, however I think they would have done well to have recovered something of what was originally intended by CGI ing her in, while also adding the cut material from the Force Awakens, and writing around it. Her inclusion being limited to that, and the writing to shoe horn her in really undermined it all, seems horribly forced. Secondly, SPOILER, they shouldn't have killed Ben off at the end. They ended his life with a kiss between him and Rey, and, well, I'm just going to fan edit his disappearance out of it, so it seems as though they may have become something more afterwards - something of a troubled love story.

There's a lot of ideology thrown in here too, which sadly kept taking me out of the movie.  Shall never escape it, it seems."
"Aug 8, 2022",positive,Bad ending to the Star Wars saga
"Aug 8, 2022",positive,"I love that there is another Star Wars movie, but this seemed like Disney was trying to please everyone and the movie was blah."
"Aug 7, 2022",positive,The greatest final 02 hour: and 22 minutes ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Aug 7, 2022",negative,"i dont know how this movie managed to waste an incredible cast, a massive budget, and the entire history of a 8+ movie saga and make all of them worse with this being the conclusion. I dont even wanna watch episodes 7 or 8 which I think are decent anymore because I know this comes after it."
"Aug 5, 2022",negative,"Not as bad as The last jedi. but that's nog saying much. weak story, no star wars magic. wish i could forget ever seeing movie 7, 8, and 9 but what has been seen can not be unseen"
"Aug 4, 2022",positive,"Many parts of this movie felt forced. It was just filled with random and questionable points. For example, on the planet Pasaana, Rey and everyone were being chased until they crashed into sinking sand. After sinking and falling into an underground tunnel system, it happened to be the exact place that had the exact thing they were looking for (the next clue which was a Sith dagger). Questionable choice to bring back Palpatine, though it didn't bother me cause it was important to the story. Plus he's just dope. Very random that there were so many ships with Palpatine on Exegol. There were still lots of things I enjoyed like the scenes with the force connecting Rey and Kylo between different planets. Luke was much more likable in this movie. The scenes at the Death Star ruins were awesome. Acting was great. CGI was great. Final fight scene with Rey, Kylo, and Palpatine was awesome as well as the rest of the fighting that happened on Exegol."
"Aug 3, 2022",positive,I was very surprised how much I liked this movie. It had some flaws and some unbelievable things happen in it for sure. It makes up for The Last Jedi though and Abrams cleverly connects the dots from what I disliked from the last movie that this move makes up for it. This movie had some great lightsaber battles and very good emotionally acted scenes. Overall was a fulfilling move with the nostalgia and I like what Abrams did with the ending. This movie helped redeem the last movie.
"Aug 2, 2022",negative,Please dont... Its  getting worse and worse since Disney took over
"Jul 31, 2022",negative,"Not the worst movie ever but it suffers from the previous movie completely derailing the story. So many scenes felt like they were rushed, and I believe it's because Rian Johnson decided he wanted to tell his own story rather than continue what was started in The Force Awakens. I give the movie a 2 star rating due to having to finish up after the steaming pile of crap that was The Last Jedi, it really deserves more like a 1.5 at best."
"Jul 28, 2022",negative,"what a bad movie, i didn't like the end, is like throwing to thrash all of the Skywalker legacy"
"Jul 28, 2022",negative,"Lazy, just plain lazy. The movie only works by retconning many established parts of previous movies in a lay way to get to the finish...very disappointing end to a once great saga."
"Jul 28, 2022",negative,"An absolute insult to George Lucas, Darth Vader, and the lore of Star Wars itself, if you love Star Wars, this movie will only anger you."
"Jul 26, 2022",negative,This movie is so bad that I'm getting sad and tired as I type this single line review.
"Jul 25, 2022",negative,"Yes, sucks bad. Bad, bad."
"Jul 25, 2022",positive,"not that good of a movie, but an amazing save from the last movie which was a disaster..."
"Jul 23, 2022",positive,My rating for the film is a 6.8/10
"Jul 20, 2022",negative,"I only gave this a 2 star rather than half a star because The Last Jedi (TLJ) made it impossible for anyone to get this movie right. The plot of the movie just doesn't make sense. ""Somehow Palpatine returned"", yeah somehow... So getting thrown down an engine shaft straight into the core of the death star is a survivable experience - This is not an ability that has ever been discussed, but they pass it off by saying ""The Dark side is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural"" stealing the line out of RoTS but out of context. All this means is that Darth Vader died for nothing, this is a MAJOR PLOT HOLE - the prophecy of the chosen one is that Anakin/Vader would bring balance to the force and destroy the Sith - Before this movie, the prophecy was intact. The Plot is also full of coincidences, Lando just happens to be on the planet to provide assistance just as the gang turn up, without him they would be captured, he just so happens to know the location they need to look for the way finder, they get this dagger by complete luck after falling through some kind of new quicksand that happens to have tunnels underneath, the dagger is inscribed in the language of the Sith, C3PO can translate it but cant tell anyone so this leads them on a stupid side quest to reveal the location of the wayfinder... The whole movie just feels like coincidence after coincidence rather than logical decisions are being made to advance the movie. 
In terms of characters, Poe doesn't progress in this movie - we get a small look at his back story but I think they added that in as an afterthought too. Fin doesn't progress. Luke is a different person compared to TLJ, and thats a good thing but terrible in terms of continuity. Rey has godlike powers and somehow kills Palpatine (I assume he's dead but you just don't know now) - in the prequels and originals, there is a power level structure - Palpatine is more powerful than Vader, Yoda is more powerful than Luke. The Prequels have it similar with Mace and Yoda the most powerful and Obi-wan and Anakin just below them - The sequels have completely ignored this, Rey is THE most powerful Jedi to ever exist - she must be if she is more powerful than Palpatine - just because theyre related does not mean she should be as powerful - Star Wars has never explicitly said that offspring will have the parents force abilities - the only instance is Vader and Luke but even then, Luke had to train hard to become as powerful as he did in ep6; up until this movie Rey had never trained (I don't count the lightsaber and rock scene as training) so how she has these abilities is ridiculous, at least this movie shows her training, but still not enough to be Palpatines equal, hes been a force user for decades. 
We are lucky this is only a circa 2.5hr movie because it needs to be longer to fill in all the plot holes ~ 5 hours would suffice.
So negatives out the way, this movie is visually impressive. The vastness of the battles doesn't come across quite as well as RoTS' intro but its still very good - its something I always expect from JJ Abrams. 
I blame Disney for this primarily, JJ needs some of the blame but it sounds like he had a few weeks to write this script before they started filming."
"Jul 18, 2022",negative,Negative stars. The one great character they had in this movie was not the main lead and he was abused by the horrible plot and storytelling.
"Jul 17, 2022",negative,"I gotta be brutally honest, this movie is not good at all.
It might just be the worst ending to any film series and I do not say that lightly. This movie spends most of its time trying to undo The Last Jedi which is a very cowardly thing to do. As someone who actually liked The Last Jedi, that really annoyed me. Because now I can't watch Force Awakens and Last Jedi without thinking that this is how the trilogy ends. The ending itself is just trash. For a standalone film the ending could work but this is the ending to a nine part saga. And it's a rushed mess that you will probably forget about what happened at points when you finish it. The one word that can describe this movie is Overwhelming and not in a good way. I also hate that Palpatine is in this movie. It completely ruins Anakins sacrifice. But I gotta give credit where it's due, Ian Mcdiarmid was phenomenal as Palpatine. In fact, all the actors were giving it their all. This movie does have good moments but if I'm judging the whole thing, I can't give it a good score. This movie is proof that Disney had no plan whatsoever with this trilogy."
"Jul 15, 2022",negative,Terrible end to George Lucas' next level story telling
"Jul 15, 2022",positive,great effect good story
"Jul 14, 2022",neutral,Why does this film have to be so dumb? They gave up on trying something new and instead brought back a villain who already served his purpose. This movie was the best I could have been coming off the previous film which was not good either.
"Jul 14, 2022",negative,One of the worst movies I have ever seen. Cannot even put into words how bad this dumpster fire was.
"Jul 13, 2022",positive,Not as good as Force Awakens but an excellent movie.
"Jul 12, 2022",negative,"This movie has a terrible plot and it has so many inconsistencies that it's hard to count. But it does have some nice character moments and a cool final battle. There were some really strange directorial choices though. ""Somehow Palpetine returned"" really that's the best you got? Overall this movie is really disappointing but has some fun moments."
"Jul 12, 2022",neutral,"Well, is it a good movie? Absolutely not. The amount of questionable choices made in this movie is insane, but it is still watchable, so for that, It is more enjoyable than the prequels."
"Jul 10, 2022",negative,"My least favourite of the saga just dreadful story, character arcs, and lack of a feeling of Star Wars instead with lazy writing and this wasnt the actors fault they just had nothing to work with"
"Jul 10, 2022",negative,No respect for the dead. Reinforces my preference for Star Trek movies.
"Jul 9, 2022",negative,"Another bad movie that is killing the Star Wars franchise. This movie is little bit better then the Last Jedi. But it is still a very big disappointment. In my opinion it is bad for Rey to be angry all of the time and becomes a Jedi, even Anakin who became Vader was not so angry compared to her was more of a Jedi than her. Strange that Rey calls herself a Skywalker. She is not part of the family of Ananakin (Vader), Luke, or Lea. Yes, Vader would be like a grand uncle to her. I know JJ Abrams was trying to fix all of the damage done from the Last Jedi fiasco from Rian Johnson."
"Jul 8, 2022",negative,"The worst Star Wars has been since the Holiday Special.

Who thought JJ Abrams was a good choice for an ending?"
"Jul 7, 2022",negative,"Abrams for almost 3 hrs is trying to undo the last Jedi in this poorly told story. This non-story made no sense from start to finish. Disney has lost their way. It should of been called ""the rise of profit!"""
"Jul 7, 2022",negative,"Very poorly written. Abrams is one of the greatest at creating characters, but his ability to tell a story is weak."
"Jul 7, 2022",negative,A bad end to a bad trilogy
"Jul 5, 2022",negative,"Disney Star Wars clearly has the capacity to make visually stunning and financially viable films, but as the budget and hype of projects goes up the amount of care and love for the franchise gets lost in the focus groups. Without a Dave Filoni or a Favreau breathing life into it, Rise comes across as incredibly boring and contrived in narrative. While seeing it once on the big screen might trick you into thinking it's epic, rewatches and stripping back the visual appeal betray poorly written characters, abysmal dialogue even compared to George Lucas scripts, and-- most sinful-- a Star Wars movie that isn't very much fun at all. Thanks again Kathleen Kennedy :/"
"Jul 3, 2022",positive,It managed to be magical in spite of being muddled. Kind of a waste of a wonderful setup in previous movies.
"Jul 3, 2022",negative,"The absolute low point of Star Wars. A derivative mess, a travesty of a movie."
"Jul 3, 2022",negative,The worst Star Wars movie ever! It completely ruined Anakins redemption and broke all the important rules of the Star Wars universe
"Jul 3, 2022",negative,"This movie completely disrespects every other Star Wars movie made. I don't hate on the new trilogy, 7 and 8 were fun to watch, but this movie is just an abomination. The force can do anything, characters are underdeveloped, there are massive plot holes, but as I mentioned, the worst of it all is that this destroys the franchise as this is supposed to be conclusion of a long-running saga."
"Jul 2, 2022",negative,"Mary Sue palpatine cannot carry a tv show, much less a trilogy."
"Jul 1, 2022",negative,"Didn't enjoy it, but I honestly can't blame them for it being that bad. TLJ ruined the series so bad they really couldn't recover from it"
"Jun 30, 2022",negative,"Very bad, nothing to do with the original canon 👎"
"Jun 30, 2022",negative,"Rise of Skywalker is a complete and utter disaster. It lacks direction, characters are bland, jokes are cringe, and the ending is frustratingly awful. To this trainwreck's credit, the score and CGI is obviously amazing, but, that's not enough to save it. The entire sequel trilogy was absolute wasted potential."
"Jun 29, 2022",negative,"The good stuff?  Special effects and cool saber duels.  The bad stuff?  Pretty much everything else.  I was in disbelief with how bad the writing was.  If you're going to essentially rewrite one of, if not THE, best trilogies of all time, at least make it make sense.  But, no... Disney had other ideas.  A Palpatine bringing balance to The Force?  Kylo Ren murdering his father, only to be turned to the Light by said Palpatine?  And then to top it off, the return of THE Palpatine because, well... clones?  I've seen and heard better storytelling from my 6-year old niece.  This trilogy made a mockery of the originals and even the prequels (it was that bad) and spat in the face of George Lucas, Mark Hammill and even Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher.  The only reason I'd recommend this trilogy to anyone is to give them a bigger appreciation for how incredible the original trilogy was.  Absolute trash."
"Jun 29, 2022",positive,The best!! Rotten tomatoes got this wrong! one of my favs
"Jun 29, 2022",negative,This movie is ass. I was going to give it 0.5 stars but Adam Driver does a decent job. Rest of the movie is ass. Major ass.
"Jun 28, 2022",negative,This movie was a disappointing conclusion to the Skywalker Saga. The Last Jedi is no excuse for the way this movie turned out.
"Jun 27, 2022",negative,Just a poor rehash of return of the jedi
"Jun 27, 2022",neutral,"Yeah, this is better than CATS."
"Jun 26, 2022",negative,Story was boring and didn't really make any sense. To think that they could have made any star wars movie with whatever villains they could imagine and some how came up with lightning-emperor from episode 6 to be the big bad guy is disappointing.  The whole thing reeks of Disney's poor story telling quality. This was made to make money not to entertain people.
"Jun 25, 2022",negative,The worst star wars movie ever made. The phantom menace had better writing.
"Jun 25, 2022",negative,"carece de sentido total con la trilogia original, y la trilogia siguiente. Decepcionante. Lo unico que la salva es ver de regreso a viejas estrellas como Han Solo y la Princesa Leia"
"Jun 25, 2022",negative,"Главная героиня полный кринж, хуже персонажа сложно найти"
"Jun 25, 2022",negative,Not much could be done to salvage the stinking wreck that was The Last Jedi - yet The Rise of Skywalker is still able to disappoint fans in other ways.
"Jun 24, 2022",negative,This movie has no real plot! Emperor was killed by Vader years ago.
"Jun 24, 2022",negative,Soooo Palpatine wins after all.
"Jun 24, 2022",negative,I don't understand how Palpatine returned it just makes no sense at all
"Jun 24, 2022",positive,the worst thing for me is that they ruin anakin's legacy
"Jun 23, 2022",negative,It doesn't make any sense with anything. It's a terrible end. That's not how the force works.
"Jun 23, 2022",negative,"This film is tied with ""The Last Jedi"" for the worst in the franchise (so far). The disconnection from the previous two films is inexcusable. The choreography in fight scenes is lazy. The villains can't be taken seriously. The attempts at humor are awkward and take away from immersion. Overall just wish the sequels wouldn't be considered canon. They need to try again."
"Jun 23, 2022",negative,"This was all over the place. It was trying to make up from the Last Jedi, while also trying to provide cheap fan service with the bringing back of Palpatine. Just terrible."
"Jun 23, 2022",negative,It is just a copy of episode 4. Its success was based on nostalgia and pure fan love for SW.
"Jun 22, 2022",negative,"This film is the best example of mediocre management, scenario impotence, lack of acting talent, and of Mary Sue. Thank you Kathleen Kennedy thanks to you we now know how to make the worst movies in history, even Tommy Wiseau is far from you."
"Jun 22, 2022",negative,"I cannot believe this audience score was legit. This movie was a hot mess. Nothing made sense. If there's no consistency then how can you get invested in anything?

Basically Disney Star Wars kept changing the rules and then using them to mess with the audience. There is no way this movie would've worked if it had not relied on the Star Wars nostalgia. As it was, it did not work anyway. And you can tell because people still talk about the original Star Wars, and nobody talks about Rise of Identity Theft anymore."
"Jun 22, 2022",negative,"A plot so dumb it seems like it was written on a napkin after a night of heavy drinking,  this is the sad conclusion to a messed-up trilogy that true fans are more than willing to forget or write off as fan-fiction."
"Jun 22, 2022",negative,"Worst movie ever, broke the movie universes own laws of physics and upped the dangers to pointlessly ridiculous levels that made it feel like eating raw sugar instead of a lovely dessert."
"Jun 21, 2022",negative,"Junk movie making, destroying beloved IP with weak story telling and narrative driven characters"
"Jun 21, 2022",negative,They made a lot of decisions and they were all wrong.
"Jun 21, 2022",negative,This and all other ones close to this killed SW.  Rogue One  - Best ever Star Wars made - period
"Jun 21, 2022",positive,"A fitting end to the Sequel Trilogy, given its disastrous predecessor's handling of most characters.  While it may be Disney canon, I don't think it was the greatest comclusion to the Skywalker Saga for multiple reasons.  But, given its constraints, Episode IX at least handles the new and legacy cast with respect and makes the best of a poor setup from The Last Jedi.  The cinematography and audio are amazing, and it feels like Star Wars!"
"Jun 20, 2022",negative,really just bad writing and lukewarm acting. the anti trilogy.
"Jun 20, 2022",negative,Terrible movie for everyone that cares about the Star Wars universe in the slightest. It destroys the lore and makes other movies not make any sense.
"Jun 20, 2022",negative,"[sigh].....Disney, Disney, Disney.....enough.  So the IP of an original 70s film that spawned a sequel better than the first and established a fan base of prodigious proportion is re-shot, re-cast; gussied up with better CGI; photocopied; drizzled with nostalgia and served up as if it were something new.  It's the same as ""A New Hope.""  And there is no hope that Disney will do anything other than this ingenuous repackaging with it's stable of IP - it's the equivalent of fast food - all bright and no substance. If only it had kept on the trajectory set by the Rian Johnson film, then we would have had a film worth watching.  No ""let's resurrect Emperor Palpatine because...i forgot what i was saying..."""
"Jun 20, 2022",negative,Esta trilogía no es canon.
"Jun 19, 2022",negative,Palpatine's return was confusing and little to null explanation. I don't believe much thought was put into this trilogy.
"Jun 19, 2022",negative,If you made me choose between the existence of the three new movies or a 5 minute scene from the Mandalorian or Obi Wan I would certainly choose shows. New movies were aweful. Worst part is I barely remember plot. Total waste and a money grab - glad they finally got their act together with the shows.
"Jun 18, 2022",negative,Almost the worst film of the sequel trilogy
"Jun 18, 2022",positive,"This film is a brilliant ending to the sequel trilogy and the entire Skywalker Saga, featuring a wonderful message about how family is more than just your blood - sometimes your true family is the one that you find along the way. It also gives a strong assurance that you do not have to follow the dark path of those who've come before you. You can create your own legacy. You can choose to be better than the ones who came before, the ones who would want to see you fall, which is incredible! The film is also just tons of fun. C-3P0 is a pleasure to watch shine in this. Palpatine makes the perfect appearance to tie all nine films together into one deranged arc. Adam Driver gives such a good performance as Kylo Ren/Ben. The scene between Ben and Han may be the greatest Star Wars scene ever made. Everyone is excellent in this. While this film wraps things up beautifully, it also feels like a beginning of something new too! I truly hope we get to see more of Rey, Finn, Poe, Rose, Connix, Chewie, Jannah, and Beaumont in the future as the film makes it very clear that they are just getting started! Finn, I just know you're going to be a jedi! Poe, I just know you're going to kiss Finn! Lol, all that being said, I love the sequels. Excited to see what comes next!"

Nah this is just kinda dogshit as a diehard star wars fan. This movie could've been really great if they just made Kylo the ultimate villain of the trilogy after Snoke was murdered, but no they just brought back the dude incinerated.
The end scene was okay at least."
"Jun 17, 2022",negative,"This movie feels nothing like a ""war"". Just a fortunate series of events leading to a predictable end. Backtracking and undoing so much of the Last Jedi instead of focusing on what worked was a huge mistake."
"Jun 17, 2022",negative,Frustratingly tries to undo the prior movie and directly making the ending of the previously trilogies less impactful and this film and the whole trilogy a complete mess
"Jun 16, 2022",negative,"I felt that it was just focused on undoing everything that The Last Jedi set-up. I recently read Colin Trevorrow's Script "" Duel of the Fates"" and I think that it's way better than the Rise of Skywalker. It just seems that instead of falling through with their plan for the Sequel Trilogy, they bailed based on a very small but loud minority of people who didn't like the Last Jedi. So I will always wonder what could have been, if they took a chance and did Colin's story."
"Jun 16, 2022",negative,well this movie copied endgame
"Jun 16, 2022",neutral,This movie is a weird one for me cause some days i love it and some days i wanna burn it with fire. The best part of this movie is adam driver as kylo ren he really gives it his all here and is absolutely incredible as a tortured villain. Rey is still pretty lame and so is finn. But the best part is the music. The music is great and the worst part was Palpatine being included.
"Jun 16, 2022",neutral,"It seems they did their best with the mess left by the previous film, but a compromise ends up pleasing nobody."
"Jun 16, 2022",negative,"Boring, frustrating, awkwardly paced, and an insult to our prior knowledge of this universe."
"Jun 15, 2022",negative,"Just another great example of J.J. Abrams' & co.'s abilities, thus a total failure.

Ridiculous story ("" somehow Palpatine is back"") and just a disastrous ending to a project we didn't really need and which already began in the worst possible way (the sequels). That's no Star Wars."
"Jun 15, 2022",positive,It's not all good but it closed the Skywalker Saga in a relatively satisfying way.
"Jun 15, 2022",negative,"Just abysmal. Ruins the legacy of the Skywalker's. Episodes 7, 8, and 9 do not exist in my universe."
"Jun 15, 2022",negative,"""Palpatine somehow returned"" - that's what we get instead of ""I'm your father"" revelation. That's about sums it up. 
Mary Sue runs around being lucky, gets new forces out of nowhere, defeats everyone with no effort. You're not Skywalker, you're an impostor, born out of lack of creativity. And we thought prequels were bad.. I'd better watch Jar Jar doing a pod race, than this."
"Jun 15, 2022",negative,"This movie had some okay points, but a lot lacking. Also, because of the first two movies it didn't make sense. Lastly, Rey's powers just don't make sense in the universe of Star Wars. Very disappointed."
"Jun 15, 2022",negative,"Although the story makes no since at all, it has a couple good things. 
1. Jedi force healing is alright I guess.
2. It is the last film in this trilogy."
"Jun 14, 2022",negative,Absolute dumpster fire
"Jun 14, 2022",positive,"Effectively, JJ Abrams is strong on effects but weak on depth again. There is a feeling of revisitation of places and people of old in a not very meaningful way. There is a lack of heart."
"Jun 14, 2022",negative,"I am all the Sith and I am all the Jedi scene is a lazy writing and the final battle is also lazy as well, because they just copy the scene in ""Avengers Endgame."" The Mandalorian is better."
"Jun 13, 2022",negative,"The worst Star Wars films of them all, so bad you can't even believe what you're seeing. Nothing makes any sense and they have stopped pretending. It's just effects on screen and famous actors to bring some nostalgia factor and make us forget that all the new characters are utterly forgettable or downright annoying and offensive to any fan of the original franchise. It's a train wreck so bad it hurts and it makes you sad as a Star Wars fan to see a great saga finally ruined by Disney in this way."
"Jun 13, 2022",negative,"Worst starwars film ever, or really worst thing on screen ever"
"Jun 13, 2022",negative,Way to ruin star wars for ever
"Jun 12, 2022",positive,Loved it. I love Kylo and Rey!
"Jun 12, 2022",negative,"Worst movie of the saga

Rey Skywalker? W T F"
"Jun 11, 2022",negative,i dont even need to say anything just watch the movie and see how they ruined the entire point of the star wars franchise.
"Jun 11, 2022",negative,This is by far the worse star wars film I have ever sat through. The story makes no sense.
"Jun 11, 2022",negative,Everything about it is bad. The story makes zero sense and is just trying to under TLJ and give the fans corny fan service moments. 
"Jun 11, 2022",negative,"Its just bad, anything canon is gone, anything with common sense gone...this is not Star Wars."
"Jun 10, 2022",negative,"Loved the storyline but the acting was horrible i could get my 4 year old niece to act better then most of these ""prof actors"""
"Jun 10, 2022",negative,"This movie has so many problems. Inconsistent and terribly executed. People behind this project clearly had no idea how to conclude, or even begin the continuation of the original trilogy. Absolutely terrible."
"Jun 9, 2022",negative,"This movie was rough to watch, given that we have multiple examples of just how good a piece of Star Wars entertainment can be. It's predecessor set it up for failure, and it committed. Plot contrivances, terrible dialogue, and poor characters are just a few of the problems that plague this movie."
"Jun 9, 2022",negative,"This movie, along with episodes 7 and 8 accomplished one thing: make the awful prequel trilogy films look like they deserve Oscars for Best Picture."
"Jun 8, 2022",negative,Horrible like the rest of the sequels
"Jun 8, 2022",negative,By bringing back the old Cillian for someone else to kill it completely negates vaders turn to the light side and the sacrifice he made. There is no curse in any language that would bring justice to the level of horror this movie brought.
"Jun 8, 2022",negative,Total distraction of Star Wars on display here. What a disgrace to Luke!!!
"Jun 8, 2022",positive,Should have stayed with one director throughout the trilogy and not switch for the 2nd movie. The Rise Of Skywalker course corrects The Last Jedi. Palpatine returning in this movie kind of ruins the sacrifice Darth Vader made in Return Of The Jedi. Overall is a much better movie than The Last Jedi but is a disappointing entry and conclusion to the sequel trilogy. Would hope to have a JJ Abrams cut of The Last Jedi and Rise of Skywalker that shows what he wanted to do with the whole sequel trilogy some day.
"Jun 7, 2022",positive,"Amazing ending, but a little slow in some parts."
"Jun 7, 2022",negative,"Honestly, it sucked. Didn't feel like star wars at all, had too many things that we had never thought possible in canon, but Disney made it so that with those new things, they could do whatever they want to keep their precious Rey alive."
"Jun 6, 2022",negative,I grade a movie based on how many times I can watch it or the quality of the story and plot.  This movie fails on both ends.  I have no interest in ever seeing more than once and the story/plot are very dissapointing.  But I gave it a 2 because im a huge star wars fan.
"Jun 6, 2022",negative,"Can't believe they made this movie equally as worse than ""The Last Jedi"", this movie isn't good at all. The fact that they brought Palpentine back is so outrageous for me, and he should never have brought into the sequel trilogy at all. They did it because they are desperately making last attempts of trying to save the sequels, but no can do for me. I don't quite understand the appreciation from this film. Even the ending was very mediocre and can't save the film. God, when are we ever going to get a Star Wars movie like those in the original trilogy?"
"Jun 6, 2022",negative,"Great VFX, decent fight scenes, but that's just about the only good things about the film. Sidelines Rose, gives zero development to Poe and Finn, Rey is ridiculously powerful looking at the timeline, and Ben Solo's redemption arc is laughable. Retconned parts of Return of the Jedi made very little sense. And the pacing was terrible. How do people like this movie?"
"Jun 5, 2022",negative,"Fails in every regard as a finale. As an end to the sequel trilogy, and as a sequel The Last Jedi, and as a conclusion to the Skywalker Saga. Even by itself, it fails."
"Jun 5, 2022",negative,"3/10

Ooof. That was... rough. 
Saw this in theaters when it came out and I heard from friends that it was better than the Last Jedi. 
After I viewed it, I knew they were lying to me >:(
Palpatine coming back was definitely the first red flag, but I tried to be optimistic about the movie. But it kept on having really stupid moments to bring my mood down. Rey is an uninteresting character, the story was very messy and filled with MacGuffins. Did not feel like a satisfying farewell message to a years long saga, but rather a sad whimper of a goodbye. 
I would not recommend this movie to anyone. My dad watched it with us in the theaters and he is a really big Star Wars guy. He was visibly saddened by what he just saw and it made me pretty upset."
"Jun 5, 2022",negative,The best of the worst Star Wars trilogy. Maybe after the Last Jedi the only place you could go is up.
"Jun 4, 2022",negative,"Rise of Skywalker is a continuation of JJ Abrams making mistakes. The potentially largest is the idea of each movie centring around an original cast member. Sadly, Carrie Fisher was supposed to be the main original cast member for Rise of Skywalker. This weird idea reduced time from her appearing in other films. 

From a lore standpoint this movie also heavily backtracks on the idea anyone can become force sensitive. Which ironically is suggested in the first two films of the sequels. By making Rey be related to Palpatine it enforces the idea of force-sensitive bloodlines. 

Ultimately this movie is the result of not knowing what story you are telling. Say what you will about the Prequels, they actually told a story that can be followed by the audience. From the Force Awakens, these sequels have been confusing, and have had no clear direction. Don't seem to know what they want from their characters.  It's like they are making everything up as they go along. And adding lots of nostalgia as simple fan service, not anything that furthers the plot.   I'm glad this sad chapter of Star Wars is finally finished."
"Jun 4, 2022",negative,Borders on unwatchable. Proof that Last Jedi wasn’t a fluke. Disney doesn’t understand what makes Star Wars special. 
"Jun 3, 2022",positive,"Moving, exciting, and for me, a great wrap up to the Skywalker Saga. I must say, the filmmakers were at a severe disadvantage here with the passing of Carrie Fisher. They really set her up to shine in this movie and her absence really prevented this movie from reaching its true potential. That being said, I was still impressed with what they were able to accomplish, given what little they had to work with. But Rey's revealed lineage really brings the Skywalker Saga full circle and gives a great send off with the true antagonist of Star Wars."
"Jun 3, 2022",positive,"The entire trilogy (yes, ALL of them) is astounding and this is a great end to it! Star Wars is wonderful and this served as a great bookend to this trilogy."
"Jun 3, 2022",negative,"Trash, felt like a really bad fan fiction"
"Jun 3, 2022",negative,I have to assume for this movie to get an 80% tomato score the reviews must have been written by not true Star Wars fans this movie is idiotic bringing back palpating was stupid starting the movie with no context of what happened after the last one was confusing please this movie had so many flaws
"Jun 3, 2022",negative,"The action was ok I just wish that the movie could give us some time to breathe because sometimes there is to much action and when we got to breathe it was just praising and original trilogy character. The acting was cool. Then the story most of it doesn't make sense like why and how did palpatine come back and the whole sequel trilogy was just a rip off/rehash of the OG trilogy because when you look at the sequel trilogy storyline its just copying the OG trilogy but I like how they gave us the Leia Jedi Training scene that was cool but id give the story as a whole a 2.5/10.
The visuals were great the character's are cool. I'm just sad of when they teach Rey like something's are stronger than blood at the literal end of the movie she changes it to Skywalker."
"Jun 2, 2022",negative,"Well, mostly not very good, i really just forgot about it cause it was not very good so i forgot about it cause... you know... not very good. mostly bad though."
"Jun 2, 2022",negative,"Wow that was terrible.  Easily bottom 3 movie of all time.  Horrendous writing, plot, Dialogue, ect.  Literally nothing about this movie was even remotely enjoyable"
"Jun 2, 2022",negative,"Disappointing and disgusting.  Many forgettable characters are introduced here for the sake of ""diversity,"" but are never fleshed out, and ultimately distract from the story for no reason.  The main plot is flimsy and relies HEAVILY on nostalgia and special effects in order to draw in audiences.  Worse still is the character assassination of classic and beloved characters for the sake of pushing a clear political agenda."
"Jun 1, 2022",positive,"The movie that had to be sacrificed after 8.

Not much to say. It is a big mess filled with plotholes and shortcuts due to how it has to fit two movies worth of plot into one as well as rebuild the things destroyed by the previous movie.

However it has some nice ideas and cool visuals and cameos to keep you entertained enough.

A real shame how the trilogy turned out, HOWEVER it will be interesting to see where they take those characters after now that this is over."
"Jun 1, 2022",positive,"Though this film's plot and ending may be viewed as stupid and uninteresting, the Star Wars action is severely present during this film."
"May 31, 2022",negative,"I watch the film but it didn't have anything cool like the old star wars films, and how is Palpatine back. Like bruh, They could have made a new villain for the star wars characters but no, and Rey is not even a skywalker that ending is bullshit. And the ending of the cool lightsaber emo kid dies bruh, the new films are bad anyways, they are just bringing back characters from the old movies, instead of making new villains or new characters they just using old ones the films are just so bad to the star wars fan base and no one loves the new films"
"May 29, 2022",negative,"It's not a good movie but a disastrous finally for a trilogy, and a nightmare being part of the star wars continuity."
"May 29, 2022",neutral,"The critic reviews are closer to the truth than audience. Plot was crowded (Last Jedi didn’t leave much to work with). Too much, too messy, too late."
"May 28, 2022",positive,Ok this was a good star wars movie!
"May 28, 2022",positive,Abrams had to work with the steaming pile of s*** Rian Johnson had left him with.
"May 28, 2022",positive,It gets a bad rap but so much better than the jar jar days.
"May 27, 2022",negative,Honestly had no expectations for this movie though I doubted they'd be able to pull the trilogy together. I would've given this half a star but Ben Solo's arc in this at least brings it to a one. The first hour of the movie is worthless as the characters do a lot of pointless planet-hopping which is unnecessary. Finn and Poe are both Rey's sidekicks with pretty much no development or purpose in the film. Palpatine was a hamhanded choice for a villain. The only worthwhile thing about him was the implication that he is actually Darth Bane and that the sith have possessed each subsequent apprentice in some kind of group consciousness when they were struck down in anger. This implies Palpatine or even Plagueis were never the sith lord but possessed by the one who started the rule of two and that they intended to possess Anakin and/or Luke as well and it just didn't work out. Fan fiction aside the movie could've been five minutes and had the same impact.
"May 22, 2022",negative,"The character assassination, mishandling and plot holes are so sad. Sadly, this has what happened to Star Wars."
"May 21, 2022",positive,The movie was awesome !
"May 20, 2022",neutral,"This movie could have been great but the only problem with it is the fact that it is a conclusive chapter. Its basically making a Endgame without an infinity war. There is no movie setting up Palpatine's Return. Its just bam Palpatine is there. You may argue they said what happened between movies setting up his return in marketing. but that ""marketing"" was in a Fortnite event.."
"May 20, 2022",negative,"I've always understood that the new saga was meant for kids but it is still poorly executed. The saga has no direction, unnecessary/unrealistic dialogue, confusing backstories, and to wrap it up... Rey buries Luke and Anakin's lightsabers in the sand for NO REASON except to show off the two yellow lightsabers she acquired somewhere offscreen. My recommendation, get drunk and enjoy the visuals.. because that's all these movies are good for."
"May 19, 2022",negative,A terrible mess with some beautiful moments
"May 18, 2022",negative,"Bad writing, bad story, bad characterization. Only good thing are the images, but the moment you look deeper, you have to admit, that this is not a movie worthy the label 'Star Wars'. Anakin Skywalker not being in this movie proves it to be not part of the Skywalker-Saga at all - he will always be the chosen one."
"May 17, 2022",negative,this movie did suck. but it was a star wars movie that was made for Star Wars fans.
"May 16, 2022",negative,Boring and forgettable.
"May 15, 2022",negative,"An incoherent, insulting, mess of a film, ""Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker"" does the impossible and dethrones ""The Last Jedi"" as the worst Star Wars film to date. The CGI doesn't suck most of the time, and there are some characters and moments that have potential. However, an extremely convoluted story that confuses itself half the time and an unclear direction on the director's part make for an absolutely awful movie. The main characters are as bad as ever, with the actors just feeling tired of their roles at this point. There is also an abundance of plot holes throughout, rewriting the whole franchise and rendering nearly every other film useless. There are a ton of dumb moments as well, and many of the subplots lead to literally nowhere. Overall, the worst film of the entire franchise and an insult to the entire fanbase."
"May 14, 2022",negative,What an great way to end such a bad trilogy wtf is even Disneys star wars at this point?
"May 11, 2022",negative,Watching how the sith kitchen knife was used showed me how useless a motif can be made.
"May 10, 2022",negative,Better than the Last Jedi but that doesn't take much. More Disney and Jar Jar nonsense. All three Disney films should be wiped from cannon. Utterly dreadful
"May 9, 2022",positive,"It was better than the Last Jedi, bit more enjoyable but I didn't like certain things such as the return of Palpatine, the dark scenes and was very cluttered specifically the star destroyers, too over the top, and the horse creatures on the star destroyer, alright idea, but would suit better on land as I'm surprised the ship didnt just try and knock them off the surface otherwise the movie wasnt too bad"
"May 9, 2022",negative,"And thus dies heroes, journeys and memories of ""good old time"" without any hope of a better future. A slaughter prone to be studied in films school."
"May 8, 2022",negative,"Debatably the worst StarWars movie to date, The Rise of Skywalker fails in every way. Where the Phantom Menace put audience into a coma with boredom the final entry into the Skywalker saga is different in the way it is so flawed its entertaining. Put together by a studio scrambling to mend their mistakes the Rise of Skywalker does a better job at retconning and destroying the legacy of the originals whilst tarnishing its own trilogy."
"May 7, 2022",negative,"It gets some stars for trying to fix the Last Jedi's mistakes, but awful pacing, insurmountable plot holes, and continuously bad choices were still made. Everyone knows now that these movies had no end game vision and we're written as they went which caused the directors to pull on each other in all the wrong places. This hurt all movies and even stunted the Force Awakens which was an acceptable movie at the time."
"May 7, 2022",negative,This movie is just chaos. It’s like they tried to appease everyone. I don’t know why Palpatine had to be brought back he was never really a good villain but neither was Snoke. Problem was there was that all the new protagonists storylines were all over the place and broken. They tried to split the sarcastic anti-hero between both Poe and Finn and make them the new Han and Lando. Should’ve just gone with the Heir To The Empire storyline instead of making this story that really didn’t go anywhere.
"May 5, 2022",negative,"This film is an absolute mess of an experience. It spends most of its runtime frantically trying to retcon the last movie while simultaneously attempting to win over the audience with unearned fanservice that ultimately harms the film more than it salvages it. It's clear that this trilogy had absolutely no plan or clear direction from the beginning and was made only to try and milk as much cash from the consumer as possible, with no regard for artistic or creative drive. The Rise of Skywalker, with its abhorrent pacing and nonsensical plot, retroactively makes the films that came before it worse, making it nothing more than a $275 million waste of time."
"May 5, 2022",negative,"I hate everything about this terrible movie. First of they made her a phalpatine which was the dumbest thing. And then she calls her self a SKYWALKER? When's she's the literal opposite. And the ""lightsaber fights"" suck. Worst Star Wars movie and I do not suggest. The only reason it gets 2 stars it's because it's Star Wars. Final rating 4/10"
"May 4, 2022",negative,Worst writing in a movie I've seen in my lifetime.
"May 4, 2022",negative,"Poor plot,  ideas and treatment of all characters"
"May 3, 2022",positive,"they course corrected after the last Jedi, mistake in my opinion."
"May 2, 2022",negative,Absolutely horrible. Created so many plot holes that ruined the point of the previous films in the franchise.
"May 1, 2022",negative,"This movie sh!ts on everything I liked from the first two sequels. It's lazily made, the plot is stupid, it has no tension and most scenes are very cringe and/or dumb. I also hate how this movie is so obsessed with undoing everything that happened in The Last Jedi"
"Apr 29, 2022",neutral,"Star Wars the Rise of Skywalker brings back JJ Abrams as director and is the last movie of both the sequel trilogy and the skywalker saga. This movie much like endgame serves as a conclusion to one of the most popular sagas in history yet is mediocre. JJ falls into the same pitfalls of force awakens as well as adding new problems. This movie relies on nostalgia fest to please fans, retcons the last Jedi in response to the backlash, and it makes decisions that come out of left field in the end pleasing no one. In this story after Kylo Ren rises as supreme leader, an old foe returns Emperor Palpatine back from the dead to exact revenge. This means Rey and the Resistance must stop him. Although the premise can work, the execution is not very good with a convoluted screenplay's good seeing the return of familiar characters like Lando Calrissian. Ian Mcdiarmind as Emperor Palpatine shines among all the negatives of the movie, Ian brings the darness, cunning, and evil cackle that this character is known for truly ending his run as the emperor. But this movie despite its beautiful visuals and many easter eggs to all previous 8 films of the saga is a mediocre ending to one of the greatest sagas in history."
"Apr 29, 2022",positive,Schlocky jay bauman Mike stoklasa sonic is the best thing ever
"Apr 29, 2022",positive,"While this is a step down from the first two films in the trilogy, this is still an emotional and epic finale to this beloved saga.  I still wish it would've tied things together more smoothly for this new trilogy, but I still think that this film as well as AOTC are the most criminally underrated films in the Star Wars franchise."
"Apr 29, 2022",negative,"I'm sure on a technical level this film worse than The Last Jedi, but I can't hate this movie. It's too stupid to hate. And at the very least it has the decency to be entertaining, unlike The Last Jedi. I still wouldn't recommend the movie though. Skip it, unless you just really have to know how this trilogy ends. Or you're a masochist. Same thing really."
"Apr 29, 2022",negative,"Literally starts with a scroll saying a dead villain has appeared somehow (that's not a paraphrase, they actually use the word somehow) and goes downhill from there.  There's a whole secret planet full of death stars and the lightning is more biggerer than it's ever been and oh my god they really had no plan did they"
"Apr 27, 2022",positive,"The Rise of Skywalker is a mixed bag for me. On one hand, I think the Rey and Kylo subplot is handled really well, the acting is still quite good, and it's mildly entertaining, but on the other hand, Palpatine's return is completely wasted, there is too much unnecessary fan service, and the plot is a mess. Definitely the weakest installment of the sequel trilogy. 5/10"
"Apr 27, 2022",positive,This was an okay movie.  🤛
"Apr 25, 2022",positive,"I truly have no words. I didn't love it, but I didn't hate it. Solid movie and way better than Last Jedi, there are just so many unanswered questions throughout the entire movie. Credit to Adam Driver for giving a great performance."
"Apr 24, 2022",positive,"the final battle between emperor Palpatine and Rey, Rey hear's the voice's of past jedi's we hear the voice's of Anakin, Obi Wan, Mace Windu and many more. and that is why this movie is worth watching"
"Apr 24, 2022",negative,This movie has the worst writing in all of Star Wars. It completely destroyed The Skywalker saga and Anakin and Luke legacies by bringing THAT villain back. It just doesn't make sense at all.
"Apr 23, 2022",negative,"So bad.  The movie was a mismatched combination of several good ideas and several bad ideas poorly smashed together.  Everyone loves a good villain and Palpatine is the only one in Star Wars that lasted after you see his face.  The ""impending doom McGuffins"" on the ""secret base"" run by the ""evil in the shadows"" only accessible by the ""compass McGuffin"" seems like a good start point.  The character plot points and interactions make it seem like it was being read to us by an elementary school child with something they just wrote in one sitting."
"Apr 22, 2022",negative,"This movie was created after basically running out of ideas. They bring back a villain that got exploded in a death star (twice) and can't even give a good explanation. Nothing fits together at all, please, if your a star wars fan, ignore the disney trilogy"
"Apr 22, 2022",positive,l was Happy when it finished The Original Trilogy and it was Fantastic Well Story Universe and l was happy how it really are Visual and actor was Well Done
"Apr 21, 2022",negative,"this movie ruined star wars for me. if you're a new watcher, stick to the original trilogy and the prequel trilogy. That's it. Do not watch this new trilogy. I would rather watch Morbius three times than watch the new trilogy."
"Apr 20, 2022",negative,"There are so many useless things going on so fast in this movie, that only an hyperactive inattenting child could appreciate it. Incoherent, pointless and unwothy. The worst movie of the worst Star Wars trilogy, it's impressive how much effort and money were spent to create something which had an incredible potential yet came out so disappointingly bad."
"Apr 19, 2022",negative,This movie was the worst way to finish the Skylwalker saga. Too bad. They lost me.
"Apr 19, 2022",positive,"By a landslide, the best film in the sequel trilogy, and I'm glad JJ Abrams came through for all of us who heavily neglected Last Jedi, and gave us a fitting conclusion,  But still one way or another, this is still not even close to best Star Wars movie overall."
"Apr 19, 2022",positive,"Not the triumphant conclusion to the Skywalker Saga that people wanted, but let’s be real that’s a movie impossible to make, ending something 40+ years in the making that touched so many people no film could meet that expectation. It allowed people to say goodbye to characters they loved and wasn’t ridiculously predictable, although slightly cheesy"
"Apr 17, 2022",positive,"A good film with an adventurous story with magnificent fights and special effects, in short, a great film to finish a saga that has been going on for more than 40 years"
"Apr 17, 2022",negative,One of my least favourite films. A slight improvement from The Last Jedi but still very bad. This is a terribly written film which also ruins the legacy of Anakin Skywalker. This film is the result of not having a clear plan and story from the beginning.
"Apr 16, 2022",negative,"Didn’t make sense, too much going on."
"Apr 14, 2022",negative,"I dislike the clear attempts to retcon the Last Jedi, despite my disagreements with the decisions made in that movie. A poorly constructed finale with way too much going on, despite some of its better moments. An incoherent end to an incoherent trilogy."
"Apr 14, 2022",negative,Awful and lazy writing.
"Apr 12, 2022",negative,Ruining Vaders sacrifice not being the move is the least I have to say about this movie lmao
"Apr 12, 2022",negative,"Though the visuals were stunning and it passed my holiday time, it destroyed the legacy of the 9 films. ANAKIN was supposed to end the sith (being the chosen one) but instead no, he was never the chosen one and all jedi were wrong. It's just horrible that a random Marie-Sue can just defeat the dark lord with two blades."
"Apr 10, 2022",negative,"This movie was a product of lazy writing combined with some bonkers story/script decisions. Most of the lead ups felt forced, hard to believe (within the universe) and had no setup or previous film explanation. The decision to digitally insert Carrie Fisher into this movie not only made me personally discomforted, but is an extremely disrespectful decision to the cast member, family, fans and franchise. Overall, this movie left the franchise with a good closing of its third trilogy but desperately needed some more fresh, competent story writing."
"Apr 8, 2022",negative,its a okay movie if you just want a sommer blockster filmnight but if you're a star wars fan it's a complete disapointment for me i don't like that they completly break the rules just denies what happend in the orginals like rey and wide boy kylo ren fight in the ruins of the death star? like what the death star was completely destroyed.
"Apr 8, 2022",negative,Terrible movie but I think J.J. Abrams got a rough hand from the previous disaster.
"Apr 7, 2022",negative,"Finn got played, he went from potential Jedi to Lando in just one movie."
"Apr 6, 2022",negative,Crappiest installment yet. I actually hate Rey. Get a personality. Something...anything. Make me care. I wish I could have that time back.
"Apr 4, 2022",positive,"Considering all of the residual Last Jedi mess that Abrams had to clean up, Rise of Skywalker turned out to be a sufficiently satisfying conclusion to the Skywalker Saga.

The Star Wars aesthetic is back along with Abrams, and some really compelling visuals in new environments. I wasn't thrilled that this came back to Palpatine again, but since Johnson took all other options off the table in Last Jedi, I don't know what else they could have done.

There were some pretty significant plot leaps, but again, I found them understandable since we had to get from a really lousy point A to an acceptable point B, and we were definitely in a Star Wars movie the whole way. Glad to see Luke redeemed somewhat and Rose written out (a boring, pointless character leftover from Last Jedi).

All in all, I found Rise of Skywalker acceptable. Probably tied with Return of the Jedi for 3rd best Star Wars movie."
"Apr 4, 2022",positive,"Good film, a personal look in Black Widow's past."
"Apr 3, 2022",positive,Yeah this film made me intensely happy. It wrapped up nine films worth of storytelling so well.
"Apr 3, 2022",negative,"This is not the finale Star Wars deserved. Really, really terrible."
"Apr 3, 2022",positive,"I understand the negative opinions, but particularly I loved it!"
"Apr 1, 2022",negative,Pointless storyline. Hard to watch.
"Apr 1, 2022",negative,"A good movie minimises the number of logic holes in the script. This movie is a collection of illogical scenes and it seems as if the script was written by schoolchildren.
The animation, however, is breathtaking as always. Enjoy the space battles and forget the story."
"Mar 31, 2022",positive,"wouldve been great if the story explainded why the emperor is alive, but a nice end to the sequels"
"Mar 29, 2022",positive,JJ Abrams returns to finish what fans wanted but therefore adds in his own favorites that do create a good story but fail to correct what happened in the Original Trilogy and create weird plot holes.
"Mar 24, 2022",neutral,"Saw 'The Rise of Skywalker' just before Christmas with my sister, but it took me a while to gather my thoughts on it. Being not sure what rating to give it or how to express my opinion on the film. Will admit that when seeing it in the cinema, to me it was enjoyable but had a lot of faults. Since watching 'The Rise of Skywalker' then though, the more it has been thought about the more it has gone down in my estimations. My reservations felt back then still remain the same, as well as what struck me was good, while thinking of more since.

My opinions on the previous 'Stars Wars' films were much more definite, being a fan of the original trilogy and while the prequel trilogy had a lot of flaws to me they weren't that bad. Also thought 'The Force Awakens' and 'The Last Jedi' were better than expected (am aware that possible blasphemy has been committed here), but 'The Last Jedi' certainly had a lot wrong with it. 'Solo' was good fun on its own terms too. Absolutely judging it from an open mind, 'The Rise of Skywalker' left me very conflicted however and ended the trilogy on a whimper rather than a bang, it's not deserving of a 1/10 but it is not near deserving in my opinions of the 10/10s mostly given to counter the negativity in classic critic bashing style. Of the franchise, this was the one in all honesty that left me the most disappointed.

Will start with the good things with 'The Rise of Skywalker'. It is gorgeously shot and designed and the special effects are often a marvel. John Williams delivers yet another rousing score that has its own character but cleverly includes the well-known iconic themes from the previous films.

There are some great performances here, Daisy Ridley carries the film outstandingly, having become more confident with each film, and Adam Driver is menacing and conflicted. Carrie Fisher again brings nostalgic poignancy to Leia, while John Boyega and Oscar Isaac are charismatic and do their best with what they were given (which was quite weak in my view) and how great it was to see Ian McDiarmid again as Palpatine, again his material was not great but he does a good job with it. Chewbacca is as adorable and funny as ever and C-3PO provided a few amusing moments. Babu Frik was a nice new addition and there were a couple of touching and nostalgic moments. Some of the action is thrilling, namely the extended blaster battle and Rey and Kylo's force-based clash.

For all those good things, 'The Rise of Skywalker' has a lot of major flaws. With so little time to breathe in the story, the film feels far too rushed which made it very difficult to digest the more convoluted parts of the story. There is also too much going on so the film feels very cramped by the final act, and also too many characters. Some are fun but too many of them are underused or even pointless and tacked on, such as Lando and Rose Tico. Mark Hamill and Harrison Ford only seemed to be there for nostalgia purposes and are merely walk-ons.

Although the action has its moments, too much of it doesn't rouse like it should do and is in a way forgettable. The big reveal that has been much discussed here made absolutely no sense (the atmosphere felt at that part in the packed auditorium in the cinema was like a uniform ""what the heck?"") and really convoluted the storytelling later on, leading to a conclusion that felt rather too anti-climactic and made a waste of the characters involved in it. A long way from a bang. Morever, the dialogue is as bad and even downright laughable than the worst of the prequel trilogy's with far too much exposition and unrealistic conveniences.

Overall, have seen far worse but a big disappointment. If some people liked it, good for you. It just didn't work for me and many others, for reasons that are valid, and it is inexplicable as to why people have an inability to accept that, and not just for this film but for almost every film here. 5/10"
"Mar 20, 2022",positive,"Some may hate Palpatine returning. Some might say Trevarrwos script was better. Some might say TLJ took more risks.
I say JJ abrams has made a film that is a glorious love letter to everything Star Wars. Its rollercoaster of action and pathos, drama and redemption."
"Mar 18, 2022",negative,"Rushes through too many things at once, all at a breakneck pace, brings Palpatine back for zero reason, ignores Finn, and has been completely forgotten about due to its lack of innovation and an interesting story"
"Mar 16, 2022",positive,I haven't cried so much over a movie in a while. SW9 justifies and gives meaning to the entire trilogy. The best of all.
"Mar 16, 2022",negative,Pretty awful and disappointing on every level. I don't recommend  Ep 7 8 or 9.
"Mar 15, 2022",negative,"its like they tried fix everything thst was wrong with the last one, but some made it ridiculously stupid and predictable. just let it die disney "
"Mar 15, 2022",negative,"I'll give 2 stars for it being entertaining, and the visual art is very impressive. But story-wise it is terrible. Long story short, just the bringing back of palpatine as the main villain ruins the point of episodes 1-6. The point of the previous 2 trilogies is Anakin and his arc, eventually defeating the emperor and saving the galaxy. With palpatine just not dyeing, or getting a new body from this, it almost completely craps on the story of those 2 previous trilogies. If someone wasn't a fan of the original or prequel trilogy, then they would probably like this trilogy. But for all those fans, most of the time it feels like a remix of a story that's already been told."
"Mar 14, 2022",positive,"(spoilers) This movie is the end of the Skywalker Saga. The part that I didn't like is that this movie is incredibly rushed. Rey knows where Luke was looking where a wayfinder, gone! Kylo Ren finds out that Rey's on a certain planet, deploy spaceships! C-3PO knows where the wayfinder is but can't tell them, ERASE HIS MIND AND MAKE HIM TELL US! Can't get across the sea to get to the wayfinder, Rey just straight up leaves without any notice! And now Kylo Ren's here! These people are so rushed to find a wayfinder or Emperor Palpatine or even just looking for each other! I'd rather have the original Duel of the Fates script happen. Never read it, but I think it would be much better. I hope the next Star Wars movie is less rushed."
"Mar 14, 2022",negative,"The film looks great, but just like the other sequels has a highly contrived plot which continually raises huge plot issues but never addresses them.  You cannot just bring back a dead villain and hand-wave it away.  The whole thing with the map-knife? Please, show a little respect for your audience."
"Mar 14, 2022",negative,"Absolute convulted garbage.
Led nowhere, beginning with a ridiculous revival of an old enemy and finishing with an utter mess of a nonsense ending.
No explanation or proper character development just exposition and deadpan concise rubbish."
"Mar 13, 2022",negative,An underwhelming end to the Skywalker Saga. Palpatine's return did not make sense.
"Mar 13, 2022",negative,The worst episode of the entire Star Wars franchise. The cast is ridiculous silly and the storytelling can just be considered as weak. Why is Disney destroying the complete story and the origin characters?
"Mar 7, 2022",negative,"Completely irrelevant and incoherent as a movie. Even worse as the finish of Star Wars. Bad at every level (except visually - it's great there). A sad ending for a beloved franchise. I really hope that someone one day says: The sequel trilogy was some nightmare, we are making it anew!"
"Mar 6, 2022",positive,"Star Wars 9 is ridicously fun but if J J Abrams directed the last movie, this would have been the best Star Wars movie ever"
"Mar 3, 2022",positive,"The Rise Of Skywalker offers a satisfying conclusion to the Sequel Trilogy and its main characters, while giving us some memorable and nostalgic moments. However, outside of that TROS lacks the pacing, writing and cohesive story in order for it to be put on the same pedestal as other Star Wars films."
"Mar 1, 2022",negative,"It truly bums me out to see how much people favored this movie over the Last Jedi and are willing to accept what felt to me like some of the laziest and sloppiest writing I have ever seen, especially for Star Wars. There are so many infuriating moments that are clear attempts to appease fans who were not happy with the Last Jedi that the whole movie feels like it doesn't make sense in the trilogy or the Saga. The pinnacle of this laziness was ""Somehow Palpatine retuned."" We are not given what the message that went across the galaxy unless you happened to play Fortnite before the release in theaters. Overall it felt shallow, lazy, and like it was trying to spoon-feed me with nostalgia and condescending simplicity."
"Feb 25, 2022",negative,"If it were any other movie, it would probably be a two or two-and-a-half star rating.  But this was Star Wars, and I can say it was my least favorite in the entire series.  The special effects were great, excellent actors, and some good action sequences.  It was just SO non-sensical.  There's been loads of criticism hurled at the prequels over the years, but all of them are better than this movie.  Very, very disappointed.  After such a great start to the sequel series with Force Awakens, too."
"Feb 24, 2022",neutral,"Honestly, it could have been a better way to end the saga properly... The screenplay has huge issues, not to mention the lack of originality and imagination to create an intriguing plot. Despite this, it has potential as far as special effects are concerned. Cinematography and sound are both good, but honestly not that much as its predecessor (2017). A good beginning that unfortunately drops down to a complete collapse at the end. Final score: 5.5/10"
"Feb 24, 2022",positive,"The cast is very well done but the film gets lost in nonsense, the settings are really beautiful, worthy of the previous films, the appearance of the emperor amazed me but at the same time it seemed to me a very recycled idea, a film still appreciated."
"Feb 23, 2022",negative,"Jar Jar Abrams did about as good as he could have hoped to.  He only had one movie to basically tell the entire story since Ruin Johnson trashed the entire sequel in the third move.  It would have been better to declare a 4th movie and pretend Ruin's story never happened.
Leah training Rey and Palpatine's return -- oof.  This this was a dog."
"Feb 23, 2022",negative,"This was a huge mess of a movie that didn't know how to recover from the Last Jedi. If you don't wear a brace, you may break your neck trying to keep up with the pacing. None of the plot points make sense and the whole movie is cringy."
"Feb 23, 2022",positive,"Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker wins the award for best opening scene in any Star Wars film. A movie with wonderful design, great choreography, nice(st) cinematography, stunning costuming, and an amazing score. So where could the film go from such a great opening? Does it go up from there? Or does it fail and falter throughout the rest of the film?

Me being an avid Star Wars fan, the return of the emperor was a great surprise. But it leaves so many questions. One being, why? What purpose did this serve to the new trilogy, could it have been avoided? Couldn't we have brought in a new villain? Once you get past the strange and horrific return of the notorious Emperor Palpatine, the film is really special. There are so many stand out aspects of this film that separate it from the others. Since I'm a sucker for cinematography and colors, I have to say that this is the best cinematography I've seen in any Star Wars film. 

This movie is pure nostalgia. It brings back old characters and memories that we love (or hate, possibly). The first time seeing Lando since the original trilogy is surprising and extremely exciting. I remember seeing this in theaters on release night and man did the audience go WILD! There are many times during TROS where tears will fill your eyes as you're overcome by the emotion and the sheer depth of what's in front of you. 

Something I find super intriguing about this one in specific is how it really dives into Kylo and Rey's ""force relationship"" and how they can see each other, touch each other, feel surroundings, etc. without actually being there. It explores the connection they have, and while it leaves a lot up to speculation, it's still really cool since we haven't seen anything like it in past films. 

And oh my gosh the lightsaber battle between Rey and Kylo when they're on the Death Star… the sound design, the animation, the choreography, the timing of everything, it's so well done. I am a sucker for the throne room fight but this is a close second. It's truly amazing to watch and to hear. Like how do you not see Kylo Ren and just gasp at how awesome he is, the way he holds his lightsaber upside down or the way he walks through a wave. He's a really cool villain and this movie did a terrific job actually showing him off in ways the 2 prior to TROS didn't.

The third act of Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is what really made this film so enjoyable. It's non stop action filled with tears, laughter, awestruck staring, and so many different emotions. And how does one not tear up at ""but there's more of us Poe, there's more of us!"" ??? Tears, every single time. 

Well in my personal opinion, this movie did not fail as it went on. I do believe that the second act was a little bit boring, but that's almost impossible to avoid when your opening scene is as crazy as this one and the entire third act is entertaining as ever. The story falters a little bit, but why focus on the minor details? Just sit back and enjoy the scale of what's unfolding before your eyes. What's not to like?

I could pick apart every single moment of this film and say what I love and what I hate about it. Like honestly, this review could be longer than the movie script and I would still have more to say. I believe this is one of the most wrongly hated episodes of the Star Wars saga, as this one brings so much to the table. You just have to give it a chance and really try to enjoy it because honestly it's great!"
"Feb 22, 2022",neutral,Bad film but most of the fault is because rian johnson in ep8 did a mess and forced JJ abrams to close a trilogy very fast and with a lore and a lot of characters broken and left distorced. could have been very good. i personally hated the idea of the return of palpatine... so boring and unoriginal
"Feb 22, 2022",negative,"All the mistakes made in the last Jedi made a successful resolution impossible for this movie.  However, it invents a whole new round of mistakes and implausible plot contrivances.
A waste of time and money."
"Feb 21, 2022",negative,"I went to the cinema hoping for a satisfactory finale to the Star Wars saga which would reverse the rot that had set in since Disney took over the franchise.

It didn't take long for my tentative expectations to be dashed and then completely destroyed as I watched Star Wars be replaced with boring, non-sensical corporate junk. This movie is the epitome of everything that is wrong with Hollywood at the moment. Everyone involved with writing and producing this movie should be sacked, and Disney should start again at the end of Episode VI, or sell the franchise to a company who can produce movies with genuine creativity, depth and respect."
"Feb 21, 2022",negative,"An abysmal end to an abysmal trilogy. Void of understanding or nuance of what came before, JJ Abrams cobbled together a story because he had to, and because The Last Jedi did nearly irreparable damage to the franchise.

Hopefully this movie and trilogy can be forgotten soon."
"Feb 19, 2022",negative,Dire end to the saga. A mess from start to finish and don't start me on resurrection of the Emperor.
"Feb 18, 2022",negative,This movie spends two and a half hours telling the audience what's going on without adding any weight to anything. It's a mess and it's an awful end to the Skywalker Saga
"Feb 18, 2022",negative,Wow. This was a pretty disappointing story. They need to remake this in a couple years and forget about it like the first several Hulk movies.
"Feb 17, 2022",neutral,Meh it's better than The Last Jedi but nothing more.
"Feb 12, 2022",positive,Great when Im watching it. Disappointing when I thinking about it after
"Feb 12, 2022",negative,"That's not Star Wars, that's Disney. A waste of lifetime. And Rey was, is and never will be a Skywalker!"
"Feb 10, 2022",positive,"This film is ok the plot doesnt have sense, hux Kill billions of people and now you say hkm is a spy? And the end is terrible, the death of Kylo was unnecessary"
"Feb 9, 2022",negative,"This film and this trilogy, in general, were so bad, that I cannot in good conscience consider them cannon. Kathleen Kennedy, Rian Johnson, and JJ Abrams should feel very bad for their abysmal performance. They had no coherent vision for this trilogy other than to destroy anything linked to the prequel trilogy. They were so bad that even Mark Hamil and George Lucas did not like them. Also, wokeism ruins everything."
"Feb 8, 2022",positive,"Everything that was going wrong about Rey's origin story in The Last Jedi was fixed in this beautiful redemption arc for Ben Solo. The only people complaining are the ones who do not appreciate change from the set ways of IV-V-VI (and the critics because just look at the audience rating!) 

The story of Leia and Han and their lost child is perhaps my favourite of all. Maybe because I related more to Ben than I did to Anakin (not that he's not the greatest!). Above all, the simplistic storytelling of yet another rebellion built on hope, and that hope breaking through a heart frozen over is why I came out of the cinema in tears.

Star Wars isn't only lightsabers, star fighters  and grunts. The reason why it's so unique from other outer space sci-fi is the inclusion of heartfelt bonds. 

And what's more heartbreaking than the story of a little lost boy throwing tantrums with a cracked Kyber crystal growing into a simple ""good boy sweater"" and learning to let the light in?"
"Feb 8, 2022",negative,"The star wars universe was once a unique and artistic explosion, now gentrified to generic, money making dribble."
"Feb 8, 2022",negative,"How this movie's audience score is not only better than The Last Jedi but also ""fresh"" at 86% is the most backwards thing I've ever seen. This is easily the worst entry in a franchise as big as Star Wars as I have ever seen. It's so non-comittal, so lazy, so downright stupid that I can't even put to words how this actually ruined all the good that came before it. The only redeeming quality of this movie is Ben Solo.
Adam Driver does a great job with what he's been given, and luckily it was enough to keep me mildly invested in the ""story"". Man, I wish this weren't such a terrible conclusion to such a beloved franchise. Should've had Duel of the Fates instead. At least that one sounds like it took some risks and didn't spend half the movie trying to retcon what happened in The Last Jedi. The more I think about the movie, and the more actual good Star Wars projects that release, the more my disdain for this movie rears its ugly head. I hate this. I hate it here."
"Feb 6, 2022",positive,"No es una pelicula muy buena que digamos porque no me gusto como murio palpatine y me hubiese gustado que todos los heroes y villanos hubiesen aparecido porque si palpatine pudo pasar su escencia a un clon otros sith como Vader, Maul entre otros se hubiesen revivido con alquimia sith pero igual es muy entretenida y no hay que maldecir un trabajo que costo mucho....
y que los heroes fueran aparecidos por la misma fuerza como que todos los sith se revivieran con alquimia sith y los jedi con el poder de la fuerza..."
"Feb 5, 2022",negative,A truly terrible story. It looks nice though.
"Feb 4, 2022",positive,"I was relieved this movie had less of the adolescent temper tantrums seen in the previous one. The VFX was fun as usual, and visually appealing. Though, I did wish there was a bit more depth. I kept wishing for a bit more character development... and as a Star Wars fan, of course, even more epic use of the Force! I still love the 3 classics the most, and I guess those movies really set a high bar that most of these newer SW films have not quite matched."
"Feb 2, 2022",negative,"If you want to watch a movie where JJ Abrams retcons The Last Jedi and make Anakin Skywalker's entire character journey through the prequels and original trilogy feel like a waste of time, this is the movie for you. The Last jedi might not have been great but it allowed the last movie of the sequels to be something different. In the end what we got was an extremely bland Darth Vader story, a terrible copy of Avengers Endgame climax moment and no matter what anyone says, basically 0 character development. This final film personified the sequel trilogies whole idea of if you want to understand and like the character journey, go buy the extra disney stuff. At the end of the day, Rise of Skywalker fails as a Star Wars in a Trilogy which fails as a Star Wars trilogy. I only feel sorry for the actors in this movie who ended up with 1 dimensional characters to play. Last of all, Sorry Rian Johnson."
"Feb 1, 2022",positive,Absolutely loved this movie. Watched it 9 times in the cinema and would definitely do it again. That's Star Wars to me. Daisy Ridley is a true gift to this world.
"Jan 30, 2022",positive,"I liked it, satisfying ending, great as always Kylo Ren, very good action and cinematography"
"Jan 29, 2022",negative,"I felt nothing coming out of the theatre except for utter frustration. Regardless of your opinions on The Last Jedi, it's its sequel and as such, should pick up what was set up in the previous installment of the saga. You can't just ignore and retcon what you don't like. It simply does not work like that. This undid everything The Last Jedi had risked it all to accomplish (making that movie worse retroactively) and forced recycled plots and characters down our throats in a cheap attempt at feeling familiar but hey--visual effects were great! I'll get some pretty screenshots for my computer desktop... I guess."
"Jan 29, 2022",negative,"What was supposed to be the ""grand finale"" of a trilogy of trilogies turned out to be arguably the worst Star Wars movie in terms of plot and message. Giving it a full star because the baggage from 7 & 8 (especially 8) and the death of Carrie Fisher really made it very difficult to tell a good story and tie things up while at it."
"Jan 28, 2022",positive,An Epic Ending for the Star Wars Saga. Especially for the final batlte. Although it isn't perfect I enjoyed it.
"Jan 28, 2022",neutral,Really disappointing conclusion to the sequel trilogy. Bringing back Palpatine was a big mistake.
"Jan 28, 2022",positive,"Honestly, I can understand the hate on this one. It surely has its flaws, but it does bring together amazing VFX and a somewhat coherent story. The survival of Palpatine has been Legends lore forever and is now introduced into official canon - give it a watch and relax. It can be very good if you let it."
"Jan 28, 2022",negative,"I went into this in the theaters with fairly low expectations but remember it failing to meet even those. A couple of years later, I decided to give it another shot, wondering if maybe I had been too hard on it. Unfortunately, I liked it even less this time. While there are some moments of artistry in Rise of Skywalker, these good bits are so heavily undercut by the film's persistent failings that they lose what allure they might otherwise hold.

The plot of the film makes no sense. It's a treasure hunt to find the Emperor's hiding place, but the steps are incredibly contrived and leave me with a thousand questions. Everything seems haphazard and poorly thought out. The writers made sure they put in a few set ups for later events, but these set ups feel contrived themselves and only after the pay off did I understand why they were even in the movie. 

I also found the decision to bring back Palpatine to be an extremely weak idea. If you're going to crib ideas from the old comics (not necessarily a bad idea: KotOR II did it well), why would you take them from Dark Empire of all things? Surely there must have been less stupid ideas to repurpose. Even worse, [START OF SPOILERS] I really hated their decision to make Rey the granddaughter of Palpatine. It just feels lazy and lacking in creativity. There have been tons of heroes in Star Wars who don't descend from some ""powerful bloodline."" Having her the daughter of nobodies was a great way to send the message that anyone can be a hero. Making her a Palpatine just felt like a cheap gimmick to introduce a theme of generational conflict into Rey's life, which we didn't need since we already had that with Kylo Ren. 

I was also disappointed that they chose to have Ben die. ""Bad guy turns good and sacrifices himself"" isn't a terrible trope, but it's kind of bare minimum for a redemption arc. I'm sure a good writer could have done something more interesting if any effort had been put into the story. It would have been so much more interesting if Ben had to live with his history of mass murder and work to atone for it. Instead he gets off easy. One good act and then oblivion. Boring.  

Finally, I thought it was a very bad look to mostly cut Rose out of the movie. In her final (conscious) scene in the Last Jedi, she declares her love for Finn. Then in Rise of Skywalker, they just write her out of most of the movie and have Finn seemingly end up with some random character they introduce in this movie who has no bearing on the plot. [END OF SPOILERS] What is this supposed to say? That you can't have an interracial relationship in Star Wars? Or that Disney is caving to the backlash by some fans against Rose? Neither is a good look as it makes it seem like Disney is either anti-miscegenation or is siding with the mob that launched racist and sexist attacks against Kelly Marie Tran. 

Overall, Rise of Skywalker was just a boring mess. I know the other films have plenty of plot holes and contrivances too, but not on this level. Not even close. And I certainly wasn't so bored while watching them as to have time to analyze how contrived and disjointed everything was. While I didn't think the prequels were good movies, I would be more inclined to watch those again than Rise of Skywalker. What an embarrassing end to the series."
"Jan 25, 2022",negative,"Absolutely incompetent. The only amusing thing about this film, is that it is basically a middle finger to Rian Johnson.

What an absolute disastrous way to end a trilogy for a beloved franchise that means so much to so many people. Kathleen Kennedy's management of the Star Wars IP is proof that her rise to position was on the shoulder's of better people and has no ability to help produce a coherent series or property that people want to watch for entertainment.

Here is hope to her quietly being sidelined to make room for more competent people with a love for the property and are more interested in telling a story, than a message."
"Jan 24, 2022",neutral,it gets very boring and most of the ideas this movie has are already ending before we get to the second half
"Jan 23, 2022",positive,Pretty good finale to the saga.
"Jan 21, 2022",positive,"This was pretty good. I was not a fan of the trilogy about Anakin, but these about Rey are actually good. This was a great end to the Star Wars saga and I like it.
Not the best, but ok."
"Jan 21, 2022",negative,It was a shit movie but I can't really blame JJ Abrams. Rian Johnson left him nothing to work with.
"Jan 19, 2022",negative,"I love Star Wars movies, and that was drivel! Even worse than the prequels. It's the only Star Wars movie I could not bring myself to watch a second time."
"Jan 19, 2022",negative,"Horrible movie, the dilute the mystic feel of the force by playing who has my lightsaber tag, no real character development, characters are not really interesting, no real story(tried to bring the big guns out with the Emperor but failed), The whole film is boring, out of place, and real mess."
"Jan 19, 2022",negative,One of the worst movies i've ever seen in my life. What did Disney do with our beloved saga. I didn't like te prequels but next to this ones they are a work of art.
"Jan 19, 2022",positive,"If Star Wars is your favorite restaurant, this movie is the burger. Not a daring choice, not going to win any James Beard Awards, but it’s satisfying, fun and hearty. There are a lot of maguffins, a few plotholes and some things that don’t work. But so much of it does work. There’s a ton of heart and emotion and strong performances. And the movie is fun. There’s a bit too many daggers and talismans and wayfinders, just like what you see in Marvel with a magic box or a universe glove or a time-traveling Duracell battery. You can poke a hole in any of this if that’s your goal. Avoid the toxic, hyperbolic opinions and enjoy this trilogy for what it is. A good time. All these reviews saying this or that killed the franchise, lol this trilogy made $4.5 billion dollars. Go to Disney. Watch The Mandalorian. Have fun. Star Wars is fun. "
"Jan 18, 2022",negative,"Well made and acted, but a HUGE letdown. They needed a game plan for these 3 films when they started. Have JJ and Rian working together from the beginning. It would have made it all cohesive."
"Jan 18, 2022",negative,"Awful writing, does a disservice to the movies that came before. This whole trilogy may as well not exist, but this movie is by far the worst of the 3. I would much rather they stuck with the plot setup by Last Jedi. It looks good, has decent action, but none of the other characters feel useful. It's the Rey show again. Kylo has a revelation and never says another word the entire movie, what a waste."
"Jan 17, 2022",positive,"No matter what people say, even if the overall story is a confused mess that lacks some interest, The Rise of Skywalker still has the action and amazement we know and love from Star Wars, and for that, it's a pretty decent watch."
"Jan 17, 2022",negative,"For anyone who was excited about the fact that Emperor was being brought back for this film, they must have been pretty disappointed to realize it was just a cheap and meaningless gesture to sell more movie tickets.  The entire sequel trilogy should have followed the popular ""Shadows of the Empire"" book series from the 1990's instead of this trash.  JJ Abrams should go back to making crappy horror films."
"Jan 17, 2022",negative,This is the worst Star wars movie. They were lazy with the villain and did not deliver for Star Wars fans.
"Jan 16, 2022",positive,"As usual with these newer movies, visually stunning but lacking in compelling storytelling. While nowhere near as good as Star Wars' best films, ROS is still a decent ending to the Skywalker saga. Despite what some might say, this is still better than the prequels."
"Jan 16, 2022",positive,"I understand the critics and the distaste for the film, but I enjoyed this film. I felt satisfied with how the trilogy was ended."
"Jan 14, 2022",negative,"SPOILERS AHEAD: In my opinion, the worst sequel. It basically completely destroyed the story that had been building up and Palpatine just came out of the blue."
"Jan 14, 2022",positive,"Imagine asking a space monk like Luke to ""be more violent"". Tell me you don't understand Star Wars canon without telling me."
"Jan 14, 2022",negative,Terribly written with so much laziness in the script. The writers use convenience too much to attempt to stretch out the movie to the 2-hour mark. Rey is such a terrible lead in this movie. The ending where she claims to be a Skywalker is horrible as there is zero explanation as to why she claims that. And lastly the fan service. There is so much terrible fan service in this movie that is meant to get the fans engaged and hyped but it all backfires.
"Jan 12, 2022",positive,"this movie is awesome I loved this movie so much I hate Star Wars but when I went to go see this movie with my mother, my hate for Star Wars ended and I became a Star Wars fan"
"Jan 6, 2022",negative,"Genuinely insulting cash grab that can't even do ""fan service"" right. The cast is good but they're given nothing whatsoever to work with. 

On a scale 1-100 this film is a 0."
"Jan 5, 2022",positive,"The only thing I really dig about this movie, is the visual effects. That's the only thing I was impressed about. The plot line is too far-fetched and just not entertaining enough. I know, the world is about to be taken over by the Dark Side, but suddenly (spoilers) Kylo Ren steps over to the Light Side and helps Rey to defeat the Emporer. 
Just not the way I would choose to end the Skywalker Saga.
But nevertheless, I would recommend it, because of the amazing visual effects.
(I am more pleased by the series nowadays, like The Mandalorian, or The Book Of Boba Fett)"
"Jan 4, 2022",positive,"It has stupid moments but it's overall good. Though, all of the shitty elements only happened because toxic fans who cyberbullied the creators online."
"Jan 3, 2022",negative,probably the worst of all Star Wars movies
"Jan 2, 2022",negative,Worst movie in the franchise
"Dec 31, 2021",negative,Story sucks. Character development sucks. Movie sucks. They fly now...
"Dec 31, 2021",positive,"An acceptable closing.  Not much to work with after The Last Jedi, so this is about as good as can be expected without a complete do-over"
"Dec 31, 2021",positive,Melhor do que o último
"Dec 31, 2021",negative,A poor attempt at a Star Wars movie.
"Dec 31, 2021",negative,"Cool video game....or was it a movie, i couldn't tell.
Mindless junk, without any of the soul of what made Star Wars...Star Wars."
"Dec 30, 2021",positive,"While a bit too rushed and predictable, it's overall a fun and satisfying finale to the Skywalker Saga."
"Dec 29, 2021",positive,Was better than the last Jedi but not a bit improvement
"Dec 29, 2021",negative,That is not Star Wars - More like expensive fanfiction...
"Dec 29, 2021",negative,Terrible end to a terrible trilogy.
"Dec 29, 2021",negative,"One star is better than the last Jedi 1/2 star.  But seriously, they gave it their best shot to ruin the franchise."
"Dec 28, 2021",neutral,It was a decent movie. The movie was not a good ending to the Skywalker saga.
"Dec 28, 2021",negative,No. Just no. Dont like this one .
"Dec 28, 2021",neutral,There are some things Disney should not be part of. This is one example. They are not one with the force.
"Dec 28, 2021",negative,"Too little, too late, too rushed, too confusing, too unbelievable. 
Oh and to quote Han from the first of the Disney trilogy ""that's not how the force works"" it's not magic! you can't just do anything then say a wizard did it."
"Dec 27, 2021",negative,This is a sad demise of a franshise...
"Dec 26, 2021",negative,thex never had a plan for that shit
"Dec 26, 2021",negative,"I was rating last Jedi as the worst Star Wars movie but than I've seen this one and for sure this one is the worst StarWars movie. Nice cgi, pretty good surround mix, visually good as expected with empty characters, non-sense empty talks, unexplained, baseless storyline which they couldn't explain in 7 hours trilogy, a character that can do everything easily without training or knowledge, new popped out Jedi abilities etc and all other bs makes you watch this one only once."
"Dec 26, 2021",positive,"Definitely not the worst. Certainly not the best. But Star Wars 9 packs enough of everything and, like Avengers Endgame, it does whatever it takes to conclude a much beloved saga and serve as a good summer blockbuster extravaganza."
"Dec 25, 2021",neutral,"This movie tried it's hardest to make up for the previous ""The Last Jedi"" Did it fail? Not really, I mean it wasn't worse.

It tried to fix things but ended up making it messier. To be honest short of everyone waking up and pretending that the previous movie was a dream there wasn't much they could do to fix this one.

It did get back on track and follow the normal Starwars formula, but when you have to spend half you movie trying to make up for the previous one then it was always going to fail.

(Spoiler) Also trying to rely on a previously killed villain like the Emperor to be the main bad person again doesn't sit right, it cheapens the Original and Prequel Trilogy storylines, not to mention retcons to point of nonsense.

Overall it tried to clean up a monumental mess and it just smeared it around a bit, I wouldn't recommend anyone watching The Last Jedi so by that logic I wouldn't recommend anyone watch this one either.

Unless you already did in which case probably watch this one. Definitely watch the Mandolorian."
"Dec 23, 2021",negative,It's better than TLJ but it's just not a good star wars movie
"Dec 23, 2021",negative,"If you're born 1979 upwards just skip this film. The set pieces are boring because the main characters are so wooden and without heart, trying to re live the big liners from the original. This is c-rate material."
"Dec 22, 2021",negative,"With all the bad word of mouth reviews from friends I waited for a Disney+ trial to finally watch this and make my own mind up.

My verdict is Disney corporate political meddling has removed every ounce of entertainment from this installment. Terribly dull script, wooden acting and quite frankly watching two guys following Rey around like fathomless lap dogs was just embarrassing. The Force has left this franchise at light speed and I will not be returning anytime soon. It's understandable therefore that Disney has indefinitely shelved the next installment in the hope we will have forgotten what a mess they have made.

Now on to the RottenTomatoes User Ratings which have now become so laughably unreliable in favour of studios you are best just asking a friend these days so you are not disappointed and out of pocket. Pretty much every new studio release from Disney now has a 70%-80% user rating and many of them are well below average. On the surface ‘The Rise of Skywalker' has a higher User Rating than the prior ‘The Force Awakens' which is just absurd. Yet the Critics Rating are polar opposites, 52% for ‘Rise of Skywalker' vs 93% for ‘Force Awakens' at the time of writing. Definitely something very fishy is going on with the Rise of Skywalker' user ratings and indeed all of Disney movie User Ratings.

If in doubt ask a friend or wait for a Disney+ trial."
"Dec 22, 2021",positive,"Critics don't know what they are talking about, this is a great movie."
"Dec 20, 2021",negative,Just really bad. Completely destroyed the conclusion to the original trilogy. Bringing back Darth Sidious made Darth Vader's sacrifice completely pointless. Another massive fleet of ships that came out of nowhere.
"Dec 19, 2021",positive,Critics review show how little they know about Star Wars compared to the fans. The fact Last Jedi is 91 is ridiculous.  This film ain't great but it sure isn't Last Jedi.
"Dec 19, 2021",negative,Panicked attempt at finishing all the storylines while also retconning almost all of Episode 8 entirely while also trying to engage fans with tons and tons of weird and illogical fanfiction
"Dec 18, 2021",neutral,Made no sense in the context of the Star Wars universe
"Dec 17, 2021",negative,"The movie has several callbacks and fun cameos to previous Star Wars films sprinkled throughout. However, I think that it suffers from a plot that is more focused on McGuffins than character choices and development. It attempts to introduce new characters into the story, but they only take away from screen time that would have helped build up already established characters. The third act of this film tries to deliver a fan servicing climax, however, it does not feel deserved because of the build-up to that moment, and the stakes are not entirely felt. I was not emotionally invested in what happened. Most of all, I thought that the reintroduction of the main antagonist was entirely sudden and out of place with the direction that the trilogy had been moving in. Perhaps, despite the mixed reception of the Last Jedi, this film would have felt like more of a conclusion to a trilogy if it had worked on building on and improving elements from the second film. This being said, I think that out of the three sequel films, this one did the best job of honoring legacy characters, and is sure to satisfy many Star Wars fans."
"Dec 14, 2021",positive,A good enough ending for the skywalker saga it could have been better but not terrible
"Dec 13, 2021",positive,"Although it was better than the Last Jedi, the Rise of Skywalker opened and left quite a few plot holes that seem like they may not ever get resolved seeing as the trilogy ended along with the sudden return of Emperor Palpatine after all this time with a very lackluster explanation. This movie left a lot more to be desired from fans and with all the open plot holes that were created, left some wondering if we'll ever get them resolved. Various mixed opinions on how this trilogy ended"
"Dec 10, 2021",negative,Really great Disney took this awesome story and made trash out of it. I'd rather watch Lucas episode 2 lol
"Dec 10, 2021",negative,I believed that Ep. 8 was the worst movie in the Skywalker Saga until I rewatched Ep. 9 a couple of times. The complete & utter disregard for canon & the Star Wars Universe (well... galaxy really) is on full display in this atrocity. The issues in this installment know no bounds.
"Dec 6, 2021",positive,"Levando em consideração que o J. J. Abrams teve que fazer 2 filmes em 1, Consertar o filme quase autoral do Rian Johnson (Os Últimos Jedi), o filme é bom. Rey devia ter morrido e Kylo ser o último Skywalker... A maior falha foi dois diretos dirigir a trilogia"
"Dec 6, 2021",negative,"This film is offensively bad. The promise and potential of TFA has been hideously squandered more and more as this trilogy has gone on. This film, the final nail in the coffin, disrespects the source material with possibly the worst writing I've ever seen in a film of this scale and budget. It is irredeemably bad. It is fraught with contrivances, contradictions, senselessness, and unearned payoffs. Disney cannibalized and surgically disavowed some of the most beloved fictional characters in cinema history. This is worse than TLJ. At least TLJ was internally consistent despite the bathos and the character assassination of Luke Skywalker and infantile political grandstanding. TRoS is utterly forgettable. Even though the cast was comprised of strong actors and talented filmmakers, they couldn't save this writing from itself."
"Dec 6, 2021",negative,"Example of poor story telling. Forced story with next to no character development. Extreme force-feeding of political correctness, lack of any of the depth of the original Star Wars that has been plaguing all of the Disney-made ""Star wars""."
"Dec 5, 2021",negative,"Objectively bad. Awful script, nonsensical plot - characters with little to no depth and multiple attempts to solicit emotion while removing all stakes (see chewbacca and c3po 'death'). 

A prime example of what happens when a movie is created by a corporate committee rather than passion for a good story. 

You can't just slap 'Star Wars' on a movie to make it good. I feel bad for the actors who had to work so hard with such crap material."
"Dec 5, 2021",negative,"Very disappointing for the finale of the trilogy of the sequel series and seems to negate the ""Chosen One"" storyline of the prequel/original trilogy."
"Dec 1, 2021",negative,"Such a disservice to the Skywalker saga. Completely negates the character arc of Anakin Skywalker; his rise, his fall, and his ultimate redemption by killing Palpatine and bringing balance. The sequels destroyed the developed characters of the original trilogy, such as Luke and Leia and replaced it with underdeveloped, shallow characters like Rey and Finn. There was a way to do this, and destroying everything we loved about Star Wars was not the route."
"Dec 1, 2021",neutral,Had to watch it witch my brother. The making is really great but otherwise it's just not my thing really.
"Nov 30, 2021",positive,"All of the characters you've come to know and to love and a few new additions.  I thought it was well handled in bringing back some of the characters from the Star Wars movies of the 70s.  I was caught up in the excitement of the battles, the ongoing fight of dark and light, so the movie moved quickly for me.  I really enjoyed the ending, it was a fitting end to the series."
"Nov 28, 2021",neutral,Easily the worst of the bunch (including 2 of the prequels). What were they thinking? Leave it to J.J. Abrams to fly both Star Wars and Star Trek into the ground...
"Nov 27, 2021",negative,Mary Sue is all of your favourite Jedi - so you MUST love her
"Nov 26, 2021",negative,"This movie is a huge pile of **** It is nostalgia bait, bring old characters and trying to have its Endgame moment, and it failed. It makes up things at it goes, and I honestly think that The Last Jedi is a bit better, just a bit. Anyways, please don't watch this movie if you don't want star wars to be ruined for you. Just stick to the original trilogy."
"Nov 26, 2021",positive,"It was good but not great. Endgame was a better conclusion than The Rise Of Skywalker, but The Rise Of Skywalker is still a decent start wars flick."
"Nov 25, 2021",negative,"I wish we could have seen the middle entry of the trilogy Abrams opened with Episode VII. As it stands, while this movie does what it can to return to form, its nostalgic trip down memory lane rings hollow without context. Unearned heroism meets unearned villainy meets unearned redemption in this slapdash first, second, and third installment in a hasty fourth Star Wars trilogy, after The Last Jedi decided to deny any intriguing answers to the questions posed by its predecessor. Little can be said about this film except that it just isn’t very good, to no fault of its own. Had The Last Jedi honored any of what came before, this finale could have been so much more than the hasty, inarticulate mess it turned out to be. "
"Nov 23, 2021",positive,"This is a milquetoast film in the saga, but it's effects are superior.  There is no possible way this movie could have met expectations but, despite that, has a great cast."
"Nov 23, 2021",negative,Disney sucked the soul out of Star Wars.
"Nov 23, 2021",negative,"I fell asleep to the most spectacular finale to the greatest franchise of all time!…oh I'm sorry ""formally"" greatest franchise. The payoff and conclusion was pretty horrific, daisy has been wasted ever since the force awakens and it's too bad, if we had film makers who actually listened to the fans this could have been great, shame."
"Nov 23, 2021",positive,I'm a Star Wars nerd at heart so I really loved this movie and IMAX was amazing!!!!
"Nov 22, 2021",negative,It's bad. Like REALLY bad.
"Nov 22, 2021",positive,"Rating: 8/10. 88/100. | I don't care what people or critics say, this is the best Star Wars film, to me. And it should be looked upon as the 3rd or 4th best by overall consensus. 
There's some problems but eh.
This film is what solidified this saga for me. At first the highest i rated one of the films was a 7.6 for ""Empire Strikes Back"". Granted, I was torn about my ratings from the get go, but this film is what really awakened my true feelings. 
Empire went from a 7.6, to a 7.9, and then after this film, an 8.7. This film barely beating it, at an 8.8/10. 

I mean, I know it might change later, just like it has been, but for now I feel confident enough about my ratings and reviews; which is a first, ever since I started this saga. 

The Star Wars Saga went from a good franchise, to being one of my fav universes/franchises in film history. 
It gripped the Force around me, and now I love it and the Force is with me. This is the way."
"Nov 21, 2021",negative,This movie is just one miguffin after another that totally undermines the original Star Wars trilogy by bringing the emperor back to life. Also the killing off and reviving other characters lowers the stakes.
"Nov 21, 2021",negative,nah. They need to start this over. make it all a weird force fever dream that rey or luke had as a crappy potential future and do everything to make it not happen.
"Nov 21, 2021",negative,"The only good part of this movie was not the ending, but when it ended."
"Nov 20, 2021",negative,A real nadir for the Star Wars franchise. For older fans like myself this film and trilogy has basically killed off Star Wars for me and for many others. Absolutely awful. The worst of the three films and that is saying something.
"Nov 19, 2021",negative,"It's hard to even encapsulate my thoughts in words, because I'm not even sure what I witnessed. Like watching a person in a wheelchair topple down a flight of stairs, I want to do anything to help, and yet I can only sit back and watch aghast knowing that there's only suffering left. 

This is immensely sad it becomes comedic, in a deeply mournful way. It feels impossible to make a mockery of something with such a powerful legacy such as Star Wars. But Rise of Skywalker somehow exceeded all hopelessly low expectations to be an absolute travesty of filmmaking. 

I've heard that this was an attempt to reset from the mistakes made in The Last Jedi. And yet the entire runtime of the film is filled with MORE mistakes, nothing of which resolves or absolves the previous poor filmmaking, and all which only makes the situation worse than it already was. It's as if Abrams gave up before he began, attempting to juggle far more than he knew he could, dumping his entire juggling act on the floor, shrugging, and walking away even though he was paid to entertain.

The first part of this film is exhausting. The nonsense jump-cutting from scene to scene at (quite literally) lightspeed is so disorienting. It was so hard to wrap my mind about even what the general plot or objectives were as it bounced between conversation and action spectacle. Only when Lando Calrissian makes an obligatory cameo that I was somehow drawn out of my drunken stupor, and realized that I was actually watching a beloved series near and dear to my heart. 

And then I saw that series so bastardized that it was hard not to sit back and mock the entire thing. Jedi ghosts have super powers! Rey also has healing superpowers, wowee! Is that Palpatine? What's he doing there? Look at all those sith in coliseums. Why are they there? Who knows! 

It's just nonsense. To think of all the controversy there was when the new trilogy was originally debuting, and the entire Star Wars canon had to be reset just to make it make sense; knowing this is where it all ended up, it's almost a joke that the lore needed to be reconstituted at all. This series stomps on everything you love and acts happy about it. And you're meant to feel joyful that everything you love has been destroyed, truly and completely. You're meant to like this.

This is most certainly one of the worst films I have seen in a very long time. My disappointment is immense."
"Nov 19, 2021",positive,"good final battle of one side (spaceships) and the other side (lightsaber) is very boring and without emotion.
Rey is the worst character of the saga"
"Nov 18, 2021",positive,was really good. wish things would have ended differently.
"Nov 17, 2021",negative,"No clue how you enjoy this movie as a star wars fan, or a movie fan. Lazy, plot holes, ruined star wars content pre-2016, just awful ending. So many terrible decisions. I could go on forever but not wasting my time. Mauler sums it up pretty well on YT."
"Nov 16, 2021",negative,"This was a rough movie to watch.  Amazing and shocking that so much money and time was spent and this is what came out.  Genuinely feel bad for the actors who are attached to this garbage.  It probably made a lot of money and I am sure there are fans of this, but for me it was truly terrible.  I don't understand how the Star Wars cartoon & video game stuff can tell a better story than a big production movie.  I fell asleep a couple times and just couldn't even focus on this because it was such a mess of a movie.  Best thing about this movie was hearing my Nephew, who also fell asleep during the movie say he woke up to the part with the fake Darth Vader.  That was funny...."
"Nov 15, 2021",negative,"It's the counterpart for The Last Jedi, here we have an amazing Star Wars film, but an awful movie in general."
"Nov 15, 2021",negative,"after waiting almost 2 years to watch the film I was not disappointed. It was as horrible as I had expected. This film continues the lack of character and plot development from the first two Disney Sequel Trilogy films. 

The only things I enjoyed in the film were John Williams' musical score and seeing Lando, Han, and Luke, and the opening crawl. Seeing Leia was bittersweet since she died before the completion of the film."
"Nov 15, 2021",positive,"The worst moment in star wars history ""Somehow Palpatine Returned"" -- what a cringe. 

While you trailer trashies were bashing The Last Jedi for trying to be different and for showing some racehorses being beaten and calling it ""political"", they responded with this mess for you. Thanks boomers. ""Somehow Palapatine Returned"" -- give me a break. The Last Jedi is citizen kane compared to this honestly.

The ending scene isn't that bad but the rest is a real shame and a mess. Had you people stopped complaining this movie would have been alot better."
"Nov 15, 2021",negative,Absolutely abismal. Jumps here and there between decent ideas connecting them with such poor and pointless choices that looks like a 10-year-old was calling the shots at disney
"Nov 14, 2021",negative,"Literally no homage to any of the content before 2016. What a lack of respect towards George lucas. You can have the budget the good actors and still drop the ball. Palpatine got the ''average villain simple overpower harry potter walk down on Voldemort treatment''. No epic memorable light saber scenes. Lukes one awesome hallway scene in the Mandalorian series is better than any scene in the entire recent trilogy including way better than anything Disney did with luke in the last 2 films. lets use a montage of all the old actors and and cast?, or a montage of old clips?. A thank you george lucas? nothing?"
"Nov 13, 2021",positive,Molto molto molto bello
"Nov 10, 2021",positive,An amazing end to the saga with an epic climax and great character development.
"Nov 10, 2021",negative,"This just continued the fact that Disney destroyed Star Wars.  Wasn't much of a story and did nothing with the characters.  And sorry, but Rey was not a good character, especially for the majority of the audience."
"Nov 9, 2021",negative,"Just as we thought it couldn't get any worse... After a great deal of suffering from watching The Last Jedi... JJ has to come back and try to fix this trilogy, an impossible task I'd say, and I'd be correct. This movie is a mess with MAJOR plotholes, and it seems like it satisfied the fans? I don't get that, maybe the positive reaction stems from the after-shock of having to watch Rian Johnson's attempt at butchering the whole franchise, but this movie seriously lacks the Star Wars charm, which George Lucas gave us with his film. The reason why The Force Awakens is held higher than the two later instalments into this sequel trilogy is because that movie has the Star Wars charm, and the nostalgic feeling and hype around watching Star Wars again got to us all. There is serious potential wasted in this sequel trilogy, JJ played it safe, Rian ruined everything, and this is the attempted clean-up... This is a sad attempt, Disney, maybe you should try to bring in a George Lucas or a Dave Filoni in a supervising role or something. Both of them know how to handle this franchise. George seems to be more than happy to help, and Dave Filoni is already your employee. Disney, you failed yet again, and yet again you held all the right cards, but chose to play the wrong ones instead."
"Nov 9, 2021",positive,The end story did not work but it was a well done movie and I enjoyed watching it. The visuals and action were great.
"Nov 9, 2021",positive,"I love all the Star Wars films, and this is my favorite."
"Nov 9, 2021",negative,"Watched it high and it was great, the sounds and colors were entertaining and pretty to look at. 
Watched it sober and I wanna cry. Lazy writing and a dumb story. 'Somehow palpatine returned'"
"Nov 8, 2021",negative,"Wasn't horrible but very far from good.  
 
Should've done more in regards to Anakins character."
"Nov 8, 2021",negative,"Star Wars = Star Boredom its now for kids, I never did crack a smile at any of the jokes, it has now evolved into a character rediculous movie thus its two star rating!!"
"Nov 7, 2021",negative,"Rise of Skywalker had very lazy and weak writing. If you are a Star Wars fan, you had to have noticed how horrible the world building was. The visuals were amazing, but in this day and age, that is a given with a high budget movie. Rey was overpowered, the music was good but never felt right for the moment, and the Reylo kiss felt like it had almost no build up. Star Wars has so much potential. It is a shame it was all wasted on this."
"Nov 7, 2021",positive,"Given how #8 ruined the trilogy, this movie tied it up amazingly well. Hope they redo 7-9 some day, though, to fix the dozens of plot mistakes."
"Nov 7, 2021",negative,The worst of the Disney Star Wars films... and that's saying something!
"Nov 7, 2021",negative,"It was like watching somebody else play a computer game as they directed the character from zone C to zone B to pick up the key to open the door in zone A. The only difference being that as this was a film I knew I was never going to get a turn, and that sucked hard."
"Nov 6, 2021",negative,"As every Star Wars fan knows, it was the vain attempt to save the Sequel Trilogy from the desecration affected on it by The Last Jedi, and to some extent by the much better The Force Awakens. Visually stunning, of course. Convoluted and terrible plot."
"Nov 6, 2021",negative,So dispointed the franchises ened this way.
"Nov 6, 2021",negative,The conclusion of this trilogy is very messy and basically sets up its own story and concludes it without much context. It's almost as if they were trying to redo the whole trilogy in this one movie rather than actually go off of what happened in the previous two films. Overall it makes it seem like Disney just made the sequel trilogy with the intention to sell toys and make money rather than to actually add a meaningful story to the Star Wars saga.
"Nov 6, 2021",positive,"A fun throwback to the serials that inspired Star Wars, not without its flaws but endeavours to conclude a saga 42 years in the making despite its predecessor cutting it off at the knees."
"Nov 4, 2021",negative,The most disrespectful finale to the original Star Wars franchise imaginable.
"Nov 4, 2021",negative,"This movie honestly ruined everything post 2010. The characters are extremely inconsistent, poor plot, horrible battles, overall a shit movie. I can't emphasize how much I hate this movie."
"Nov 2, 2021",negative,"I've waited years to review it, hoping my mind would change over time, but I'm still just stunned that all of Star Wars wrapped up with this monstrosity."
"Nov 1, 2021",positive,"Pretty much the same as all of the recent installments of Star Wars.  Enjoyable enough, though not the seminal cinematic moments of old."
"Oct 29, 2021",positive,I prefer original trilogy this movie try too hard. They should not have killed Han.
"Oct 29, 2021",negative,"JJ's latest outing is all spectacle and no substance. True, he was given an unenviable task on the back of the bucket of puke that is The Last Jedi. But the greatest failing in this movie is the lack of respect shown to the collective intelligence of the audience. The Star Wars universe is not the Marvel or Transformers universe. Disney would do well to remember that."
"Oct 29, 2021",positive,"'Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker' is a good ending to the ""Skywalker Saga"". A lot of the film is good and even some of it is amazing, but there are a couple of things that just didn't work for me. The fan service is very strong, the pacing is rushed in many places and the final battle does not feel earned, but this film does feel like Star Wars, concludes Leia's journey in a respectful way and concludes this saga not in pieces. This film is definitely not the best, but it is a blast that may leave you with a tiny sour taste with the ending."
"Oct 28, 2021",negative,"Just hot garbage.

Having no attempt at plot, character development, or even fun the ONLY thing going for this giant product placement of a movie was nostalgia. Yet they continue the trend from TFA (and that other one with the purple haired admiral) of ruining everything that made the old Star Wars movies watchable."
"Oct 27, 2021",negative,"Otra vez, decepción, no espera quería decir... DECEPCIÓN, con mayuscula, deciciones estúpidas, agujeros de guión y muchos sin-sentidos, podría hablar más pero ya se haría muy larga, así que se supone que este era el final no solo de la nueva trilogía de Disney, sino de Star Wars, esta gran franquicia amada por muchos incluyendome, pero resultó ser un final que dejó mucho que desear."
"Oct 27, 2021",neutral,Should have been split into 2 parts. Just a bad and slapped together retelling of dark empire

"Oct 26, 2021",negative,"I just can't. Waited until all the ‘hype' died down to actually watch it, it is horrendous."
"Oct 26, 2021",negative,"On the bright side, I don't care about this shit any more."
"Oct 23, 2021",negative,I've found it unwatchable. I've tried and failed 3 times to watch this movie without getting up or falling asleep and failed. Just another confusing hodgepodge of bits of a script thrown  together that makes no sense to the overall epic storyline and concepts that just come off as stupid. With episode 7 being a revamp of episode 4 it definitely feels like the epic ended at 6 with Return of the Jedi.
"Oct 23, 2021",negative,"why did they bring back palpatine...

No way this is canon, so many plotholes, its impossible to believe that force ghosts can interact with the real world, and Palpatine survived a nuclear explosion in space.

I like a few things, I feel a little better than ""Holdo manoeuvres"" are said to be nearly impossible, and the Chewie got a medal, which made me happy. Its always nice to see Mark Hamils face, even if his character was stuck in a rusty blender and raped for some dollar.. But I like him

But this film is just JJ taking a fat dump on TLJ (which Rian Johnson writing totally deserved) but in the process neglecting his own film and just let it combust and explode like some sort of garbage firework

graphics were cool but I don't care"
"Oct 22, 2021",negative,"If you saw the last two movies, this should come as no surprise.  Nothing Disney and nothing JJ Abrams is ever going to be good."
"Oct 21, 2021",negative,"If you like cgi you will like this movie, that is the only good thing about this movie"
"Oct 20, 2021",negative,Star Wars died in the last movie.. this movie is a dead corpse rotting in Disneyland..
"Oct 18, 2021",negative,"Judged as an amalgamation of different departments doing their absolute best to try and ""fix"" the ""issues"" with The Last Jedi, it's hard not to feel bad for a lot of the people involved in this production, and I feel compelled to commend them for all their hard work. The performances, music, set design, special effects, costuming, and so on, all look sound and are pretty much universally good-to-fantastic in this movie... however.

Rise of Skywalker is, before it is anything else, an embarrassment of a film so desperate to cash in on nostalgia that it never once takes a single risk with not just its own story, but the franchise that this disaster of a trilogy was meant to reinvigorate. Nearly every single aspect of the plot, from the most important beats, down to the most mundane ones, is an utter failure.

I understand that many people felt burned by TLJ, I do. Even though I'm one of its defenders, I'm well aware that it was going to be difficult to follow up, as there was no way Disney could or should have tried to make another ""anti"" Star Wars, Star Wars film. That said, this wasn't the way to do it. The end result is genuinely the worst time I've ever had watching anything Star Wars. When I wasn't bored, I was angry."
"Oct 18, 2021",positive,"A decent attempt to rescue the trilogy after it's abominable predecessor.  It was set up for failure, so doing as much as it did to redeem the series deserves kudos.  The movie itself is a bit rushed, trying to please the fans by wrapping up most of the major plotlines and characters, but no way around that for the last in a 9 movie series."
"Oct 16, 2021",neutral,"Remember in the early 2000s when there were a bunch of amateur filmmakers making Star Wars fanfilms?  You know, stuff that absolutely was not cannon, sometimes had pretty decent special effects and fight choreography, but didn't really tell much of a coherent story, or did things that don't really fit into the Star Wars universe, but were entertaining enough to watch in their own little bubble? 

That's this movie.  It's a really high budget, feature length, Star Wars fanfilm.  It has the lightsaber fights.  It has the music.  It has the sound effects and visuals.  But it's made by people who really don't know much about Star Wars and just want a flimsy excuse to film a few lightsaber fights and space battles.

If you look at it in that light, rather than the final crowning piece of the Star Wars saga, it's still a very, very dumb movie, but it can still be entertaining at times if you're imagining John, Daisy, Adam and Oscar are just super fans making this cinematic fan fiction in their basement.

It's an absolutely terrible Star Wars movie.

It's a pretty okay Star Wars fan film."
"Oct 15, 2021",negative,Utter trash. The worst movie of the entire franchise.

"Oct 5, 2021",neutral,Unfortunately a majority of this movies run time is spent fixing the last jedi's mistakes it is a definite improvement over that film but still leaves alot to be desired compared to the original and even prequel trilogies I admit it was pretty cool that they brought palpatine back but I can honestly say the best part about this movie is the fact that it is the end of Disney's awful sequel trilogy
"Oct 4, 2021",negative,Absolute nonsensical garbage. I complained about the movie more than I watched it simply because of how stupid many things about it are.
"Oct 1, 2021",negative,"If you want to have a film that builds its whole existence on fan service, plotholes and pretty pictures, you've come to the right place. Also, the movie has the wrong name ... it was actually called Star Wars: The Retcon of Fanservice.

The one star for it because it has 2-3 cool scenes. The rest is for the trash can.

"Sep 25, 2021",positive,It was a good movie but not a good end to this trilogy. Could've been so much more but still worth a watch if you're a Star Wars fan.

"Sep 6, 2021",negative,"Not as bad as the Last Jedi, and there are some well done set pieces but it is incoherent and full of holes (it's impossible to reach Exogal without a sith wayfinder until every other ship in the galaxy arrives). More hopelessly inept bad guys. Planet killing star destroyers, but don't worry, you only need to shoot at the big gun and they blow up. Build a super fleet but only have a single navigation beacon. It goes on. I suppose given the complete turkey that was TLJ this trilogy was beyond saving but it was still hugely disappointing."
"Sep 5, 2021",negative,"J.J. Abrams and Kathleen Kennedy's final ""Star Wars"" abortion. Flaccid, lifeless, and only worth it for John Williams final film score. There is zero passion for anything in this, it is pure Godless Disney product."
"Sep 5, 2021",positive,"It is a movie that is once again a controversial film, but for me, everything about this movie works. The story, the action, the characters, everything. Palpatine's return, although it definitely wasn't the plan since the beginning, it worked for me perfectly. It spoke to my childhood, and the movie also used Palpatine to give Rey a great end to her story and closed everything together perfectly. Thanks to all of that, this movie was a fantastic end to the Skywalker Saga and a great watch. It's in my top 5, and the only thing stopping it from making it is in the top 3 was that at the end, they did Finn dirty as his journey doesn't have a satisfying ending, and this was not the plan from the beginning. It felt rushed and quite sudden; if they had had teases to build up to this occasion, it would have made the movie much better—still a fantastic watch and a great end to the Skywalker Saga."
"Sep 4, 2021",negative,1.0/5.0 A Horrible and Tragic way to end the Saga 
"Sep 1, 2021",negative,"I wished that this movie had changed its title from Rise Of Skywalker to Duel Of The Fates. And the fact that the tv spots has featured the theme Duel Of The Fates itself and not in the movie is disappointing. The prequels had more backstories and  adventures than this rubbish. Kylo Ren never traveled to Darth Vader's castle in the movie and did not encounter the Webbish Bog. He never got a new mask, and Rey was too emotional and obsessed with redeeming Ren. Rey was suppose to have a dual bladed blue lightsaber and wearing all black like Luke Skywalker from ROTJ but instead wore her white robes. This movie was terrible. Prequels are outstanding, whereas the sequel trilogy is considered garbage for me. 2.5 stars"
"Aug 30, 2021",neutral,"This trilogy got out of hand unfortunately. The main takeaway from this was that Abrams solely came back to screw over Johnson, and just do his random own thing. Just like Johnson had done to Abrams' vision in the previous installment. The Force Awakens set us up to believe that we were in store for some fantastic Star Wars movies, and that was far from the case. Messy, boring and unnecessary story, and the character representation really missed the mark."
"Aug 30, 2021",negative,"This movie was simply an apology for the abysmal disaster that is Last Jedi. In a word, this movie is lazy. With no original content, resurrecting the Emperor because they couldn't come up with anything new. Rey is still the Mary Sue, never able to fail at anything. One big yawn."
"Aug 29, 2021",negative,After the TLJ I said it could not get any worse but I refused to see it in the theater. I decided to watch all 3 sequel movies on Disney+ to see if I would change my mind seeing them together. This movie was a mess. At least Rian Johnson was trying to insult or intelligence. I guess they had no choice.
"Aug 28, 2021",positive,"Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker ( B+) (88%)
A great finale to a trilogy I actually love. Definitely had it's fair sure of headscratching moments... But it ended the trilogy off in a good way and really did some good fan service. I love Kylo Ren's ark and think he is one of the best things star wars has ever had as part of it's franchise. The final battle was epic and some of the character decisions were awesome to see. Good film."

The pilot and comic relief stormtrooper accompany her as everything you fell in love with about Star Wars is ruined right before your eyes. But hey, it's better than the Last Jedi..."
"Aug 21, 2021",negative,"Better than The Last Jedi, but when you have spaceships which can't tell which way is up is, things are far beyond saving. TLJ and TROS confirmed the sequel trilogy could not top the George Lucas's prequel trilogy. The prequels are a cohesive connected story, existing and respecting the universe of Star Wars. 
In all fairness, when TLJ ended I said, 'What's left to tell? Do I even care what's to come in Episode 9? Nope.' TROS is not completely JJ's fault. He actually tried, but in end he was not the right choice even in the beginning of TFA. It's on record, a lot of the material in the final cut was made by Disney and Lucasfilm without JJ knowing. IE, the kiss. However, JJ is not great at concluding stories and solving his own mysteries. Let's not forget Chris Terrio. The screenwriter who also brought us messy, over-bloated, poorly written scripts like Batman v. Superman, Justice League, and now TROS. All three films based on weak scripts which have to be extremely long and complex just to make sense. The pacing and editing of TROS is horrendous. Loaded with pissing contest moments between two polar opposite directors (JJ and Rian). Desperate attempts to appear like there was a roadmap in the beginning, when clearly there wasn't.
A side note, the battle and fight scenes in entire sequel trilogy are awful. How is it possible, Star Wars, which has always been known to have great battle and lightsaber fight sequences, can go three movies without a single good battle? Rogue One not only accomplished this, but it's one of the best in all of Star Wars. Battles in the ST are simply show up and fight. No strategies, no side objectives, extremely short, cutting away to non-stop sequences. The final battle in TROS is easiest the worst in all of Star Wars. Forced, lacking in creative imagination. How often do we get spaceships that can't tell which way is up????
The sequel trilogy is copy and paste of the original trilogy and undoing the sacrifice of the key character. Vader's redemption of killing the emperor are undone and handed over to Rey. Consider this. The sequel trilogy made the OT obsolete. Sadly, you could watch the prequels, skip the OT, watch TFA, skip TLJ, and watch TROS. The actions and outcomes from Luke and Anakin in the OT are no longer necessary thanks to perfect Rey. It's all been boiling down to her. The Solos are gone, the Skywalkers are dead, a Palpatine remains and won. Thank you Disney for officially killing Star Wars. What we got was a trilogy of great trailer looking shots."

"Aug 13, 2021",negative,"I'm a reasonably solid Star Wars fan. I mean, I don't put ""Jedi"" as my official religion on government forms or anything like that, but I do own all the movies on DVD and a few items of merch. But I found myself on my phone halfway through Rise of Skywalker, which speaks volumes about what I thought of this movie (FYI - I was watching it in my own home cinema, so no one was disturbed).
Star Wars The Rise of Skywalker should was a chance to make up for the failings of The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi. Instead, we took a backwards step with an almost comical imitation of a Star Wars movie that crossed the line from nostalgic nod to the past into shameful copy. The storyline didn't make any sense and lacked any real emotional intelligence. It felt like they were 
making it up as they went along. The resolution of the relationship between Rey and Ben was anti-climatic and, given many people had guessed (wrongly) that those two characters were at least distantly related, the relationship seemed awkward, a la the kissing scene between Princess Leia and Luke in Empire Strikes Back.
Good luck getting me to pay to see any more Star Wars movies, Disney. That's six stinkers in a row. I just hope that if you make any more films, the Force is With You."

The result is an incoherent, nonsensical jumble with little consistency with the two movies before it. Its lack of originality, weak character arcs, and contrived plot devices are fatal flaws. Its crystal clear by now that Disney had no plan or vision for the trilogy at the start and this crucial mistake is felt most strongly in this film."
"Jul 26, 2021",negative,"Disney really ruined this series, a one time watcher, nothing special, watch the clone wars series instead by LucasArts"

"Jul 24, 2021",negative,It finished that non-trilogy nightmare that wasn't really a trilogy except for the same stupid new characters ruining all three movies.  These Disney Skywalker movies went nowhere and they were not really about the Skywalker family.  They were Disney's attempt to ruin George Lucas's Characters' legacy.

"Jul 24, 2021",negative,"Where did it all go wrong for the sequel trilogy? This movie is just pure fan service with no depth. No character arcs, no chemistry that's realistic or fun to watch and one of the biggest let downs in cinema history with Palpatine's return. Palpatine was one of the highlights of the prequels and to see him just be used as a cash grab is cringe inducing. Kylo ren's turn to the light side was completely out of left field, Rey was still a mary sue with no development from the force awakens and everybody else was just there on the side lines with nothing important to do. It's a true shame too, if they just let 1 director make the entire sequel trilogy with no major input from the studio, it could've turned out amazing, but instead we got a half backed mess of a trilogy that don't feel connected in the slightest."
"Jul 24, 2021",negative,Well... that was... disappointing.
"Jul 24, 2021",negative,Just a mess consisting of retcon after retcon. The story has too many unanswered questions and no clear direction. How this has such a high audience score is beyond mind boggling. This movie does nothing to respect the Skywalker legacy.
"Jul 24, 2021",negative,"After a massive dump of a previous film, this remains the only SW film I have not seen in the theaters.  Tons of problems with this film.  Some major plot inconsistencies, technological nonsensicalness, and lack of originality.   Apparently they were rewriting right up until deadline.  A few can be excused due to logistics after Fisher's death, but overall this shows that there was no real plan for the trilogy.    I found myself genuinely hoping for an end credit reveal that all the Disney SW films were actually fictional holo's watched by the main characters in the Expanded Universe."
"Jul 24, 2021",negative,"Blasphemous trash. Poor writing and terribly executed. Kathy Kennedy's sequel trilogy has zero respect for the franchise that George Lucas created & cultivated over the course of four decades. After killing Han and Luke in the previous installments, they finished episode 9 by killing off Leia, to purge all original trilogy fans. Some of the new characters even got similar treatment, especially John Boyega, who fans really hoped to see a Stromtrooper turn Jedi, but nah, Lucasfilm went with the Mary Sue role instead.  The writers clearly were not Star Wars fans because they don't even understand how the 'force' works. The force cant teleport things, sorry. This is NOT my Star Wars. This film was blasphemy and pure trash."
"Jul 24, 2021",negative,"I suppose it's a decent wrap up for what they already had going this far into the new trilogy. I felt like the build up to the return of Palpatine wasn't very well-executed, neither was the build up to the reveal of Rey's true lineage.  
I was also very disappointed with the way Finn's character was shaped up throughout the trilogy, and this movie wasn't any different. Some of the subtleties, such as for his abilities, were perhaps too subtle, as opposed to Rey or Kylo being more in-your-face.
All in all, I just wasn't impressed."
"Jul 23, 2021",negative,"My goodness, what a mess. The whole trilogy is a disaster and could well be the end of an once beloved and respected franchise. Alas All good things..."
"Jul 23, 2021",negative,This movie is an embarrassment to the franchise. Largely nonsensical this movie does a good job at dragging an amazing legacy into the mud. The failed storytelling shows that the writers did not have a plan. When making a series of movies you should have a solid grasp of where the story will go. This one did not appear to even have a rough outline.
"Jul 23, 2021",neutral,"Some great action, and visually amazing.  But that's about it.  A ton of missed opportunities.  Rey should have actually accidentally killed Chewie.  Would have made for an unforgettable scene.  But they chickened out."

"Jul 21, 2021",negative,Worst plot ever! It is lazy and takes the audience for dummies.
"Jul 20, 2021",positive,"Its not a bad film but its the finale of the Star Wars trilogy of trilogies and it just wasn't good enough. The Rey/Kylo Ren kiss was just an awful idea after the build up, in fact Ren was a weak adversary for Rey and the reversion to brining in Palatine as the big bad was just boring, all pantomime cackles from a static body. The down plying of John Boyega's Fin was a massive missed opportunity, his more subtle approach was missed and Fin was effectively written out of the trilogy as he did nothing of real importance to move the story on. The whole crashed Death Star in a weirdly rough sea with big waves which appear for no apparent reason and never hit any of the protagonists fighting, was just boring. It is a shame because it has ruined the franchise for me and made me feel like a grown up at 67 and I didn't want that. I had had big expectations after the interim offering, Rogue One, knocked my socks off."

"Jul 18, 2021",negative,"I have never seen a more messy plot from Star Wars films. Everything is half-assed, and they just randomly make up things as they go."
"Jul 17, 2021",negative,Has been 2 years seen if watch this thing and until this day i have PTSD every time someone talks or mention this movie
"Jul 16, 2021",negative,One of the most terrible Star Wars movies in history. The prequels were 10X better than what this put up on the screen. If it purpose was to tare up the fanbase it did its job. Not a movie that I expected from people safe guarding George's legacy.
"Jul 14, 2021",negative,"The writers must have been high when writing the script. And not the good high, where you get out-of-the-box ideas, but the bad high, where you just get lazy and wanna eat junk food. Had to watch it over several days - this is how unbearably boring and uninteresting this movei is. Don't waste your time with it."
"Jul 13, 2021",negative,"terrible politically motivated nonsense that doesn't add to the original trilogy, but utterly undermines it."
"Jul 13, 2021",positive,"An excellent conclusion to the trilogy and the entire skywalker saga.  A adventure with action and mystery and love, all in a classic Star Wars movie."
"Jul 12, 2021",negative,"Well.. it was hard to follow up on the absolute s***show called TLJ, JJ really didn't have much to work with. So of course it's a mess. But bringing in Palps and making Rey his granddaughter, and how she ""identified"" as a Skywalker in the end- that was a lot of bad choises. Good things: Well, at least JJ try to entertain his audience, unlike the massive troll Rian."
"Jul 11, 2021",neutral,I would agree with the general consensus that the sequel trilogy lacks creative imagination...Rise of skywalker runs out of steam for me.
"Jul 10, 2021",negative,"I bought gold class tickets to see The Force Awakens.
I bought regular tickets to see the Last Jedi.
I watched The Rise Of Skywalker on TV and quickly deleted it off my DVR
Kathleen Kennedy and Disney the Franchise killers.
P.S. All the Skywalkers died by the end sadly along with this franchise :( :( :("
"Jul 9, 2021",positive,"The trilogy was sabotaged by TLJ, so I feel sorry for the makers of this movie. But Disney are the custodians of this franchise and it's unforgivable what the final trilogy gives long term fans. George Lucas would not have allowed this to happen."
"Jul 7, 2021",negative,"This movie is the worst movie of the Skywalker Saga. It rises above the stupidity of the two previous movies and gets a new world record for ""Worst Movie Ever"". The only reasons I'm giving this film half a star is for visual effects, John Williams and the fact I can't give 0 stars. There's too much trash in this movie to write down so I'll just say that bringing Palpatine back, was the DUMBEST thing to do. It erases the point of Vader's sacrifice and ruins the OG trilogy. Honestly, I excepted more from J.J Abrams."
"Jul 7, 2021",negative,"eu to sendo legal pra caralho agora irmão na boa, e uma bosta assisti isso não na boa! vai ver toy story4 na boa e melhor!"
"Jul 6, 2021",positive,"Star Wars: Episode IX is the first movie I learnt of with my senses and knowledge of Star Wars intact. Just before this movie was coming I watched all the previous movies so that I could catch up before this movie came. I wasn't born until The Phantom Menace, I didn't know anything about the other movies since I used to think Star Wars is only a cartoon, then when The Force Awakens came I had my board exams going on. And The Last Jedi was getting so much hate I thought Star Wars is just another franchise being done to death like Jurassic Park or The Matrix. So overall saying, this is the first Star Wars movie that I knew how to react on when it released. And that was definitely not a good reaction.
So first of all my problem is with how ""convenient"" the plot twists are. How on earth are the plot twists done so badly that there doesn't seem to be anything at stake! Rey and friends are getting sucked in sand, the animal inside is friendly. C3PO's memory gets formatted, R2D2 restores it. They don't know where to go, Rey just holds her knife and COMPARES IT WITH THE SURROUNDINGS AND FINDS HER WAY!?! And no, I'm not even getting to the dozen things that happened when she had to defeat Palpatine. Nothing matters in this movie for that matter. What happened to Rey becoming evil? What happened to the rebels on the planet where C3PO's memory was formatted? They were never brought up again.
The movie completely massacred everything that Star Wars stands for. I think the problem with all the sequel movies is that they are pandering to a much, much younger generation. Anything that could have been a little too mature was probably thrown out of the window by Mickey Mouse, because then how will the little girls from Middle East have Rey dolls if she did something mature like Luke and Anakin? Palpatine came back to life only so that Rey could smash him again and show how strong and smart she is. Ben Solo died only because he was trying to save Rey for some reason, even though he has Jedi powers so he could have just moved her out of the path. No culture, lifestyle, important character, backstory - nothing happened in here. It was just picking up on the disaster that Episode VIII was.
And the worst part in the entire movie was when Rey took, or rather should I say, STOLE the Skywalker surname. What even was that scene? The way Luke and Leia were standing in the sky, they looked like her parents. The second worst for me would be the Rey and Ben kissing scene. I don't know how to say this, but Rey has a very sister-like look to her. Why would Ben ever do that? But of course, not everything is bad about Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Palpatine. Like I said before, it has a really awesome CGI, probably the best in the entire Star Wars franchise. The cinematography was also very good. The background score added to the intensity.
And the best part - it's the last movie of the sequel trilogy. Finally this thing ended. We don't have to watch any more of Rey Palpatine anymore. I'm glad I've watched every single Star Wars movie now, so I have been able to catch up with the trend and now I can talk to anyone about Star Wars whenever the topic comes up."
"Jul 5, 2021",positive,Not great but not as insufferable as the last jedi. Some cool new force power ideas and the jokes were less cringe. The plot did meander and drag on a bit. Probably could have shaved 20 minutes off and i usually like long movies. There is a little bit of hope for star wars outside of the Mandalorian. Just a little.
"Jul 5, 2021",negative,I was very disappointed with the poor story and the way that the characters were portrayed.
"Jul 5, 2021",negative,"this movie was yet another horrible star wars movie, with no good characters, an uninteresting basic story, and still no villains worth fighting."
"Jul 5, 2021",negative,Who is the chosen one again?
"Jul 5, 2021",negative,"The only level of consistency in this trilogy is the outstanding special effects. Other than that, this film does everything in its power to crap on Rian Johnson and the infamous ""The Last Jedi"". It really is a waste to end the skywalker story on such a messy note. Easily my least favorite Star Wars film."
"Jul 3, 2021",negative,"Horrible mess. Illogical C-movie level story.
Ashamed that I have watched this.
George, you were ought to bring balance to the force, not leave it in darkness..."
"Jul 3, 2021",negative,Incoherent end to an incoherent trilogy.
"Jul 2, 2021",neutral,Loved the character of rey and kylo but the lack of planning waster their character ark. Hated that they give in to the fans and even though it does not make sense they did it just to please the fans. This film is disappointing.
"Jul 1, 2021",positive,"This was the best movie of the new three, but that isn't saying much. Kylo Ren's internal struggle feels fake and almost tongue in cheek. Rey leaves something to be desired. And the completely sudden comeback of Palpatine with no explanation feels like a reach. So much could have been done to make this a better movie. Small details that would have added only meer minutes to the total run time. Overall, disappointing."
"Jul 1, 2021",positive,not the best film. but the best ending they could make of the trilogy
"Jun 27, 2021",positive,"Just as awesome and incredible as Force Awakens with Daisy Ridley at her best, and having an extremely strong and epic finale to end of the sequel trilogy of Star Wars."
"Jun 22, 2021",negative,"Lazy screenwriting (Palpatine? Seriously?) extreme pacing issues, dropped plots and MacGuffins galore (one is even lifted straight from The Goonies). It's clear they had no plan for this film other than to stuff in as many side characters as possible in order to maximize toy profits. The main cast give it their all but are given absolute drivel to work with. All in all, each film in this trilogy is more disappointing than the last and that is no easy feat following The Last Jedi. 

Dear J.J, 

Stay FAR away from any other existing franchises, you have have done more than enough damage. 

Sincerely,

Everybody."
"Jun 21, 2021",negative,Didn't palpatine take years to force lightning? But nah Rey can do it cause angerey
"Jun 21, 2021",negative,"Finally got around to seeing this after the train wreck of the Last Jedi. I'm shocked the audience score is 86. This movie is a disgrace to George Lucas. There was zero cohesion between this film and the previous 2. It feels like a bad marvel movie. Even if I let everything wrong with this movie slide, I can not accept the ending. Maybe some liked it, but the movie ( and saga for that matter) ends in the most cheesy, backstabbing way possible. It's laughable. Out of the literally limitless possibilities, Abrams chooses to retcon everything and end with that? It's just not right. 1/10"
"Jun 19, 2021",negative,"Watching this movie is frustrating for several reasons related to the too high pace speed of the cuts, which doesn't allow the watcher to absorb and understand what they have just watched, but also to a narrative level, bringing more questions than answers, in a movie which should be the conclusion of a trilogy that in this manner clearly shows the lack of an overall plan regarding the Sequel since the beginning."
"Jun 19, 2021",negative,"A deeply disappointing conclusion to the Skywalker saga, Rise of Skywalker is the product of a studio with no sense of direction, a huge budget, and production conflicts. The only positive aspects are the impressive visuals, acting and score. 
The film falters in the writing, with a clumsy attempt at damage control from the previous film, while offering hardly anything of substance to continue and resolve the story. The storyline is filled with plot conveniences, plot holes, clichés and tropes from other sci fi films, as well as recycled beats from previous, superior, Star Wars films. The weight of delivering a satisfying ending to decades of storytelling loses Star Wars' trademark magic and is instead a cold, corporate carcass of cinema, that is unlikely to please fans, though may provide enough spectacle to entertain general audiences.
4/10"
"Jun 16, 2021",negative,"Confusing mess, but that follows JJ's patterns.
Who really cares anymore."
"Jun 16, 2021",negative,Como fã de Star Wars fiquei decepcionado achei confuso e uma cópia dos filmes anteriores
"Jun 13, 2021",negative,The absolute worst Star Wars film
"Jun 13, 2021",positive,"The film is amazing, well built, with a good script, but... It misses a lot in its ending, with Rey being palpatine, it kind of ends his whole journey."
"Jun 12, 2021",positive,"It's basically two films rolled into one and suffers because of it. Also, it doesn't bridge the previous films together and leaves the trilogy feeling lopsided. There are some moronic sequences and mcguffins everywhere. I could go on all day about the problems this film has, yet, I was pretty entertained while watching it."
"Jun 11, 2021",negative,"O pior filme de Star Wars que já vi. Péssimos roteiros, má atuação, plot mais batido possível... A Ameaça Fantasma parece escrita por Shakespeare quando comparada com esse filme. Ian McDiarmid é perfeito, mas o plot do filme é muito ruim e não consegue aproveitar isso. A morte de Palpatine é ridícula e Reylo é horrível."
"Jun 10, 2021",positive,"It seemed rushed and not enough story. This and the other two in this trilogy fell flat and didn't give a full Star Wars feel. The feeling was there, just not fulfilling enough for Star Wars in my opinion. 

There was a nice twist, but seemed kind of cheap and redone from Darth Maul. This trilogy seemed like a current game where the rest of the story is in the DLC that hasn't come out yet"
"Jun 9, 2021",negative,"For my opinion and anyone else's, about this movie was so disappointed. The worst thing about this film is the ending when a lady asked her name and Rey chose her last name ""Skywalker"". She's not really related to Luke or Leia. And also Palpatine returns i thought he's dead and Death Star 2 got destructed already. I hate it how palpatine gets another clone of himself. That's ridiculous! How on earth that he can make a duplicate of himself? Overall, this movie is completely trash and it doesn't make sense at all. It upset to me how I feel on this situation. 😤😤 👎🏻👎🏻"
"Jun 8, 2021",negative,"I did not like the concept, the script, total ignorance of the lore, the decisions the director made, the cast, the play.
Good cgi thou. If you have no clue what jedi, sith are about you are going to like this."
"Jun 8, 2021",positive,"If there was ever a movie that was doomed to fail, it'd be this one. The follow up film to everyone's favorite Star Wars movie, ""The Last Jedi"", has an  incredibly difficult time fixing the mess that Rian Johnson created. This being the case, I think JJ Abrams, as flawed of a directer as he might be, should be commended a lot more for his work here. I think he did a good enough job with what he had, especially with how he integrated Leia after Carrie Fisher's death. You can tell he treated the characters with respect and that's a win in my book. Although the movie falters from some bad jokes every now and then, I think the humor is handled much better here thanks to characters like C-3PO, D-O, and of course, the one and only, Babu Frik. Also, the fight scenes were so much better in this one (the two lightsaber fights were actually really great and creative in they're execution), although nothing compared to the prequels or originals. The new planets that were introduced were also really cool and it was nice to see the Death Star wreckage. Now the scenes that I really loved were Leia's sacrifice, Ben's ""memory"" of Han, Luke's talk with Rey, and  the voices of all the Jedi speaking to Rey (they should've actually been shown as force ghosts but we can't have everything I guess). Some stuff that bothered me were Palpatine's return (barely explained and a bit goofy honestly) and Anakin not showing up at all as a force ghost. In the end, this movie is just ok. I enjoy it but it's definitely far from being a great movie. It presents some truly awesome ideas, but sadly doesn't have enough time to really flesh them out. Another disappointing Star Wars movie... but hey, at least it wasn't all bad."
"Jun 7, 2021",negative,Poor trilogy. It’s pretty evident that Disney had no plan coming into this trilogy. It sucks because you can see what Disney can do with a plan like in Mandolorian. Instead we’re stuck with this steaming pile of poop
"Jun 6, 2021",positive,Not what we expected nor completely what we deserved or wanted.  Doesn't deal with a slew of plot holes and other issues but then again neither did the first prequel.  Leave it at its Star Wars and it freaking rocks.
"Jun 4, 2021",positive,It's not as good as the others but overall pretty good.
"Jun 1, 2021",positive,It was much better then the last jedi but it was rushed and limited by the hold the last jedi dug. Should have been  split into two films. All the films should have had a planned out line also.
"May 29, 2021",negative,The Rise of Skywalker is the worst Star Wars movie ever created. It may have been more entertaining in terms of graphics and fighting than previous Star Wars movies but it all comes down to one massive mistake by the writers and producers. The return of Daddy Palp is an utter disgrace to the Star Wars saga and should never have been allowed to make it past the first round table discussion for the movie. George Lucas himself stated that Star Wars is all about Anakin Skywalker and his rise and fall as the chosen one. The return of Palpatine ruins Anakin and his story which is complete incompetency from the writers. The introduction of Rey as a Skywalker only drags Anakin and Luke's legacies through the mud even more.
"May 27, 2021",negative,This movie is more entertaining to make fun of than it is to watch. That's not a good thing. I don't understand why Disney would give control to people who continue to be incompetent.
"May 26, 2021",positive,"I don't like that people hate this movie. It's not a terrible movie. It was a good way to finish an amazing franchise. It was a definitely a step up from The Last Jedi, critics were very wrong about that movie."
"May 26, 2021",negative,"The Rise of Skywalker is what you get when large corporate interests (relatively new business daddy, Disney) are paired with a lack of intestinal fortitude required to make anything that can be rightfully called art. Rian Johnson offered a fresh departure from the (admittedly beloved) tropes that defined Star Wars cannon in the 40 intervening years between A New Hope and The Last Jedi. Penny-pinching, ROI-beholden executives caved to narrowminded, change-fearing and disproportionality loud audiences and destroyed any chance of a worthwhile entry into the cannon. Instead, we got The Rise of Skywalker."
"May 26, 2021",negative,"Firstly the Audience score is not genuine. Somethings at play here. The movie is a mess. It tries hard to do some damage control but, with what he has done or had tried to do JJ Abrams proves he is part of the disaster that is now the ""Disney Star Wars"" franchise."
"May 26, 2021",positive,"In my opinion, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is by far the best Star Wars film out there! With a ton of new characters (And some old ones too!) Watching this movie over and over never gets boring. There's a lot of humor and exciting action scenes. I also love Kylo Ren's new look!  It's not a perfect film, but it has enough oomph to get you through it without getting bored. A great movie for any Star Wars fan."
"May 25, 2021",negative,"If I could give it lower I would. Honestly like it's not even all the bad stuff it does with the Star Wars Universe and lore, it's just a bad plot with bad writing. Perfect way to end a bad trilogy. Feel bad for Fins character, could have been developed so much more!
""They fly now!"" LOL, who actually came up with this. Star Wars has been so Marvelised it's painful."
"May 25, 2021",neutral,Probably my least favorite Star Wars movie since Attack of the Clones.
"May 24, 2021",positive,Overhated. Redeems from the Last Jedi and is really good especially the call backs
"May 21, 2021",negative,"I do not understand the Disney execs. Why would you put so much pressure on yourselves to advance Lucas' story line of the previous 6 installments. Instead, move on to a different timeline, make a stamp in the universe all your own. My God, this series is so forced (pun horribly intended)in so many different confusing directions. Just a sad contribution that sours the entire series itself."
"May 20, 2021",negative,Its a shameless cash grab. A super safe joyride of emotions to please fans because not enough people appreciated what the last jedi built up. Palpatine died in return of the jedi and everyone seems to not care that he's in rise of skywalker. Everyone who mindlessly rates this 5 stars makes me sick.
"May 18, 2021",positive,"Star Wars Rise Of Skywalker - 6/10. Saw Star Wars Episode 9 during the holidays and totally forgot to post the review. Rise Of Skywalker is a decent, but underwhelming end to a trilogy that started off strong with Force Awakens. J.J. Abrams returns to direct the finale, and though he is able to make a way to a resolution after the way The Last Jedi ended, he sadly has to resort to bringing back an old villain in Palpatine. Palpatine is no where to be heard or seen in the previous two films, so his reveal as the mastermind is extremely confusing and underwhelming. Rey and her comrades are fighting for the universe, while Kylo Ren is still hell bent on winning for the dark side. Though, this battle should create a lot of spectacular sequences for the finale, Rise kind of feels a little flat in terms of excitement. The action sequences look cool and are grand, but they're missing something. It almost feels like things just happen for the sake of the story to end. Kylo gets a nice end to his story arc, while the twist with Rey's lineage just feels unwanted. If she ended up being a nobody and still saved the universe, it would have super poignant and meaningful. It would have given the meaning of ""may the force be with you"" a lot more depth. But with the twist, it just didn't sit well. Daisy Ridley does deliver a great performance though, and its cool to see how she delivers in her final performance in that character. As for the films other technical departments, it scores in production and music. John Williams delivers yet another wonderful soundtrack, and it will sad and tough to know that this will be his last Star Wars film. All in all, Rise of Skywalker works but plays it safe a little too much. Hopefully, when the new series starts up, they will opt for a more challenging storyline that doesn't focus on familiarity."
"May 17, 2021",negative,"This is not a bad movie. It's quite an enjoyable one to be honest. But I can't rate it as one because of what it represents. 
The Force Awakens was fun, but it was kind of a re-hash of a new hope. But The Last Jedi was not just a fun movie, but it also took the series in a new direction - But because Star Wars fans hate anything new, disney got cold feet with this one and just did Return Of The Jedi again. The leaked Duel Of The Fates script was so, so much better than this re-hash, but Star Wars fans would have pulled it to pieces."
"May 15, 2021",neutral,"There's a handful of inspired moments, but The Rise of Skywalker fails to deliver a satisfying end to the sequel trilogy due to its leaps in logic, overstuffed narrative, and scatterbrained direction that undoes a lot of The Last Jedi's plot."
"May 14, 2021",positive,"This film is a mixed bag for me, I was thinking I would hate it but I enjoyed it more than I thought but it doesn't really play well after multiple viewings. A lot of pressure fell on J.J. Abrams to end this on a good note and the pressure shows as he again copies plot lines and ideas from previous movies. If Disney wants to do any more Star Wars movies, I hope they move away from the ideas that ruined Episodes VIII and IX."
"May 12, 2021",negative,"I like how the review from rotten tomatoes calls this a ""fan focus devotion"" when in actuality it's more of a Star Wars greatest hits than anything else soullessness is in this films blood."
"May 12, 2021",negative,"A sad ending for a sad saga. Terrible acting, no ideas whatsoever, special effects are not enough to honor Star Wars. I will thrash this last 3 movies as if they never happened."
"May 10, 2021",negative,JJ Abrams truly could not have made a worse Star Wars movie if he tried.
"May 8, 2021",negative,Ok is it visually pleasing? Yes. And am I a gay starved for representation? Also yes. Idk maybe if I was high I'd like the movie more.
"May 7, 2021",negative,"Terrible movie by a director that doesnt watch or like the original material. Movie is so fast paced and devoid of anything meaningful. The logical loopholes and plotholes are so bad that you will cringe all the way. Its the sad ending of a horrible saga. Ruining the past along with its future.

Its a movie for people who doesnt like Star Wars, not good movies and hates logic. Do no watch unless you are a bland human with nothing real in your life."
"May 7, 2021",negative,"Though it might not necessarily be the worst Star Wars movie by conventional film standards, it's the worst in terms of what it means to the overarching saga. The choices made here were truly awful, with each story beat undoing some fascinating development that had been planted in Episode VIII."
"May 6, 2021",negative,THANK GOD IT´S ALL OVER.
"May 5, 2021",positive,"While I do think this movie plays it a little too safe in places and makes a few weird choices, it is a very fun film that I greatly enjoy."
"May 5, 2021",positive,"6.75/10. J.J. Abrams' insistence using hte original trilogy as inspiration and direction for his own work is disappointingly apparent, finishing the series (and following an incredible middle installment) with a comparatively shallow, ho-hum finale. You know how it goes - the galaxy is brought to life by glorious special effects, pulse-pounding action, a great score, and awesome performances from the cast. But alas, Abrams can't rise to the artistic challenge issued by Episode VIII director Rian Johnson to end the series with daring. Rather, he seeks to simultaneously placate both the rabid devotees of the franchise who can't handle any deviation from their own expectations, and casual film goers who may have no expectations at all, by bringing back previously dead and ever-popular arch villains and undoing some of the twists that made VIII so great. It feels focused-grouped into mild tepidity, offering little more than fan service and nostalgia in an attempt to hurt no ones feelings while getting as many butts in the seats as possible. There are some wonderful character moments, particularly between the Po and Finn, who have found a wavelength that makes there friendship feel like brotherhood, and between Rey and Kylo, who build on their connection from the previous film that ends their characters arcs in a predictable but still pretty satisfying fashion (excepting a final, forced moment between the two that made me throw my hands in disgust). This probably won't be the final Star Wars film, or trilogy. 15 years from now, some young film student who saw these movies in theaters will be the next talent to reintroduce us to a galaxy far, far away. I hope she or he chooses to follow after Johnson's example rather than Abrams."
"May 4, 2021",negative,"Efforts on behalf of every one of the actors earn this movie two stars, they all did an incredible job breathing life into their characters, who were unfortunately wasted in this lazy rehash of the original series. What a shame to reach the end amid a recycled  storyline, missed opportunities to expand the universe and just so many dead-end plot lines that add nothing.  It's a heartbreakingly disappointing finish to a series that had so much potential, but this is a story that will never end and we can all hope for redemption in the future."
"May 4, 2021",negative,There are so many plot holes in this movie that it is Swiss cheese.  Nothing about this movie should have ever been made.  The fact that anyone thought this was a good movie is mind blowing
"May 4, 2021",negative,honesty one of the Worest Sequels i think i've ever seen after like maybe twenty mintuines i coundt watch this anymore a complete boring no imagation no story film that makes no sense whats so ever
"May 1, 2021",negative,Absolutely disappointing movie with overload of cliches. The movie never should have happened.
"May 1, 2021",negative,"Clearly from the beginning, when seeing this trilogy it was seen that there was never planning, to tell us the events after the return of the Jedi, and it is again a REMAKE of the originals and this time of episode VI, seeing this installment there was never any evolution in the plot, and with each installment of this trilogy it was only seen to want to tell the same thing that was seen in the originals, Empire / First order, Rebels / Resistance, A new hope / A new hope, overthrow a dictatorship / overthrow a dictatorship, I reiterate there was no evolution, this trilogy should never have existed, the skywalker saga ended in episode VI the return of the jedi."
"Apr 29, 2021",positive,Much better than the Last Jedi but felt like it tried to cram too much in
"Apr 29, 2021",negative,"Ugh. Just ugh. Disney buying up film studios is the death of creativity. Lucasfilm, Marvel Studios, just ugh. That company exists to ruin everything we love."
"Apr 28, 2021",positive,A welcome return after the Last Jedi moved the goalposts for the worst.
"Apr 27, 2021",negative,Mary Sue ruins star wars GG
"Apr 26, 2021",negative,"There was no reason to bring Palatine back. This choice alone ruined many opportunities for Kylo Ren to step up, but the movie keeps him muzzled. There were also several scenes that made no sense: the link between Rey and Ren, the magical disappearing act, Ren not dropping the lightsaber after trying to give it to his vision of his father, but THROWING it into the ocean, forever cementing him as a man-baby."
"Apr 26, 2021",neutral,movie was rushed. Didn't follow the lore. had a few good moments but not that great.
"Apr 26, 2021",negative,I have no words to say how bad this movie overall preformed. In comparisson to the originals this is a huge insult. Millions of Dollars wasted for this.
"Apr 26, 2021",negative,This was hard to watch.
"Apr 25, 2021",negative,I don't think they could have done worse
"Apr 25, 2021",positive,"Works to retcon all the things that made ep 8 so awful. Basically, as a stand-alone film, this movie is a neat ""what-if"", but still doesn't quite fit, as-is, into the canon Star Wars universe established in ep. 1-6. 

Overall 3/5
If you're going to watch the sequels, watch 7, skip 8 entirely, and watch this one."
"Apr 24, 2021",positive,a lot of fun not the best movie ever but enjoyable
"Apr 24, 2021",negative,"Disney can't make a decent Star Wars movie but somehow they're able to make masterpieces like The Mandalorian and Clone Wars Season 7. The Rise Of Skywalker is like a drunk gymnast and just absolutely misses the landing. By bringing back Palpatine, it is destroying this movie and Return Of The Jedi and Vader's Sacrifice."
"Apr 23, 2021",neutral,"The Rise of Skywalker has many moments of glory, but they're hampered by uninspired, underwhelming direction and a fundamental misunderstanding of what the Sequel Trilogy had been working towards. https://letterboxd.com/josephtomastik/film/star-wars-the-rise-of-skywalker/"
"Apr 23, 2021",negative,"To many reveals, stories to connect and plotholes. It just tried to redo a lot of the OG SW. Some good effects and there it ends the rest is just kinda meh. Just hope this is removed from canon bec palp was killed by Luke. To become a powerful Jedi you need training, unless you are some random grand daughter of palpatine then I guess you will become stronger than EVERYONE ELSE."
"Apr 22, 2021",positive,The story is a little messy and some caracthers don't get enough development but here is a lot to enjoy from this conclusion tho the sequel trilogy. Apart from the story the action sequences are great and beautifull with characters that we love.
"Apr 21, 2021",positive,"This film is a fast and too safe version of what a finale should be. It hits all of the right beats, but fails to do anything original and feels predictable. However, it is still an enjoyable experience that any star wars fan would enjoy. This film feels as if it was actively trying to ignore the previous movie. The shorter runtime tells me the Abrams was trying to get this film done, with the old college try. Despite the sith tracker being one of the most obvious plot devices I had ever seen, the film uses the characters well enough for it to sort of work."
"Apr 20, 2021",negative,"i truly do not understand how this has so many good reviews. and the fact that the only reason people like this movie is that its just pointless bland cgi mush, with terrible writing and nothing but petty swipes at nostalgia. it pales in comparison to the beauty of the last jedi."
"Apr 19, 2021",negative,I can't believe there's actually a stars movie this bad. this movie is a MESS a huge mess there is so many plot holes in this film. I don't recommend this movie. Don't waste your time on this God awful movie.
"Apr 18, 2021",negative,"What a waste of time! 2.3 hours of my life that I will  never get back. JJ Abrams proves to the world how he can single handedly destroy the whole beloved franchise with this final instalment. Recycled storylines, scenes and characters, together with a two dimensional heroine at the centre of it all makes this abomination truly awful and one to miss."
"Apr 17, 2021",negative,JJ took a big crap on Ryan's vision and the franchise as a whole. It's a descrace that this movie's score is as high as it is.
"Apr 17, 2021",negative,"As a lifelong Star Wars enthusiast, I was deeply appalled by this film. It wasn't just bad, it was insulting! The Emporer was thrown down a shaft which resulted in a massive explosion, not to mention the entire Death Star later exploded; yet somehow he survived in secrecy for 30+ years on a barren planet manufacturing countless world killing Star Destroyers? Even the most misguided fan fiction couldn't have recreated something so abysmal. Worse than the plot, the entire movie was just seemingly random scenes slapped together, constantly jumping around. Also light speed skipping? Not a terrible concept, but moronic execution. 

All in all, just a terrible movie and a massive disservice to Star Wars fans. My only hope is that Favreau & Filoni will erase this timeline."
"Apr 17, 2021",negative,it was eh. I mean what can i expect off of disney. Oh well.
"Apr 17, 2021",negative,"""Somehow, Palpatine is back"". Awesome backstory! Cool!
What a bunch of shit. Really? ""Somehow, Palpatine is back"". Wow."
"Apr 16, 2021",positive,"Despite the toxic ""fandom"", this movie is amazing. Incredible sound design, acting, production design, character creation etc, not to mention a fast paced ride of emotions and excitement. On par with The Force Awakens."
"Apr 11, 2021",positive,I loved the movie and thought that star wars had a great continuing ❤
"Apr 11, 2021",negative,"A very silly, disjointed mess of a movie, but I was expecting nothing less from such a series that had long ago gone off the rails. People blame George Lucas for making bad decisions with his franchise, but now it is Disney's problem. While this was not as terrible to me as the Last Jedi, there is simply nothing to recommend here except ""pretty graphics"" which is simply a given with any movie approaching this mammoth budget. Looking back at the trilogy these characters are not compelling or interesting. They copied characters we'd already gotten but missed their soul and essence. I could have lived without the annoying Kylo Ren. This movie is supposed to wrap up the trilogy but almost flat out admits the previous two films didn't need to even exist. Go back and watch the originals, or even watch the prequels and tell me I'm wrong here. Star Wars become popular because it had good characters, interesting stories that evoked a larger mythos and felt familiar while also exploring cool ideas. These are just cranked out messes, and it doesn't help when the people in charge sabotage each other and act like the fans are the enemy."
"Apr 11, 2021",negative,One of the most disrespectful and immature movies I have ever weathered. Abysmal and atrocious.
"Apr 10, 2021",neutral,"The build up to this film had the movie doomed from the beginning, the characters feel like they have no chemistry has all characters really haven't spent enough time with each other, this movie does start off extremely well feeling like an original movie however it hits a point where I feel I should be invested and on the edge of my seat however I felt bored waiting for my next scene, this movie doesn't follow instep of any of the other movies and you walk out of the theatre asking questions that you should know the answer to for the greatest movie franchise of all time it's very disappointing"
"Apr 8, 2021",negative,"This is a train wreck. The first half of the film is a bad, cringe episode of the amazing race, they do nothing but go on a hunt for McGuffins. After that it's just a boss fight with a man who died 30 years ago and the most two-dimensional over-powered hero in the Saga. If I had to choose between re-watching this film and cutting off my own arms, I would be no good in a Mexican Wave."
"Apr 8, 2021",positive,esta pelicula es muy buena un gran final
"Apr 6, 2021",negative,"There were some mildly entertaining moments, but the filmmakers completely trashed Anakin's sacrifice in episode 6. Rey still has no character development, and they minimized Rose."
"Apr 6, 2021",positive,"Not an awful movie, just quite innaccurate. It has some well done scenes and isn't exactly bad, though it wasn't what many were looking for"
"Apr 5, 2021",negative,Hopeless and heartless. A depressing ending to the saga.
"Apr 3, 2021",positive,The conclusion of the Skywalker saga was really good. I don't care what the TOXIC fans say Rey is a Skywalker.
"Apr 3, 2021",negative,Um lixo. Uma vergonha de filme. Aliás toda essa nova trilogia.
"Apr 2, 2021",positive,"Too many rehashed themes and plot conveniences. I know that is somewhat expected from a stars film but, these was not much of the feel, good cinematics or jaw dropping action that make it work."
"Apr 2, 2021",negative,"Really really bad story but the acting, cgi and sets make it a decent time."
"Apr 1, 2021",negative,Horrible train-wreck. Doesn't feel like Star Wars at all.
"Apr 1, 2021",negative,"It's entertaining, but also really bad."
"Apr 1, 2021",negative,"This is not only the worst star wars, It's probably the worst movie ever made. This film discover new depth of mediocrity. The only positive point about this scam, is that the destroying of the star wars saga and spirit is definitely over, at least we hope so...

PS: Leia was never a Jedi."
"Apr 1, 2021",negative,"I have been a life-long Star Wars fan.  It was the vehicle through which I made one of my first groups of friends in elementary school, it continued to deliver exciting content through the prequels and spin offs as I grew up, and through the first two ""new"" sequels (Episode VII and VIII), it continued to deliver for me as a fan.  I passed down my love of this to my children too.

I share that because the abject disappointment that Rise of Skywalker gave me was so unsettling.  The underdeveloped story, the lack of character development, the shameless (and childish) [and poorly executed] attempts to retcon themes and plots from The Last Jedi...I had a very hard time following the movie in theatres when I saw it, and in the several times I have attempted to rewatch it since it was released I can't even get through to the end before turning it off.

As an educator, I see a film like this and cannot help but wonder aloud why this kind of failure is acceptable in the entertainment industry.  Our trio of new heroes - Rey, Finn, and Poe - they instantly vanished into obscurity after this movie flopped so badly.  For decades, characters like Luke Skywalker, Obi-Wan Kanobi, and Darth Vader - they have served as philosophical archetypes that provide meaning and significance in life and storytelling - far beyond just the entertainment on the big screen.  What lessons do our trio of new heroes teach us now?  Through The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi, lessons existed and were debated among fans and non-fans alike.  After Rise of Skywalker?  None of it matters because Emperor Palpatine returned oh and Rey's heritage is revealed and oh they defeat the Emperor and the Sith somehow and now Rey is a Skywalker with a yellow lightsaber?  There was no deeply seeded foreshadowing for any of this.  Instead we got an ongoing chain of irrelevant side characters that ultimately ended up being irrelevant - Maz, DJ, Rose, BB-9E, the Knights of Ren, Ochi, Zorii Bliss (I had to actually look up her name because she was such a random insert character), Jannah, not to mention forcing Leia into Rise of Skywalker.

I actually created an account on Rotten Tomatoes solely for the purpose of expressing my dissatisfaction with this movie.  It is not subject to debate that this movie is good or not - it is objectively a poor final product.  Sure, it was visually beautiful in moments, but only visually.  The story and characters were poorly executed and delivered a HUGE disservice to true life long fans of this franchise.  Now all we can do is hope someone will come along and rerelease a different director's cut of this film that actually makes sense.  Rey, Finn, Poe, and others deserve it too."
"Apr 1, 2021",negative,Just Terrible. Rey is an irritating prescience. Adam Driver is this movies only saving grace as he is brilliant.
"Apr 1, 2021",negative,I literally cant even type all the things about this movie that are atrocious. It was almost as bad as episode 8. The ending is literally romeo and juliet. Rey and Kylo take turns dying after kissing each other. Theres 10000 other things i could go into but its not worth it. The movie is horrendous
"Apr 1, 2021",negative,"A very boring and sterile film. Disney's main Star Wars trilogy suffers from the ""Marvel"" syndrome. Instead of trying to be more serious like the original trilogy as well as The Revenge of the Sith, it ends up being a poor man's Guardians of the Galaxy. There are moments where I thought I was watching an inferior version of Endgame rather than Star Wars. This movie is very boring as well.  The only great Star Wars movies from the Disney era include Rogue One (amazing) and Solo."
"Mar 31, 2021",negative,"Had to watch it twice, I kept falling asleep the first time."
"Mar 29, 2021",neutral,"Meh, it wasn't that bad, it definitely wasn't a mess like TLJ but it could have been done a lot better"
"Mar 29, 2021",negative,"It's an improvement from The last Jedi, but so is a pile of garbage. This is a desperate attempt to write the wrongs of the sequel trilogy, while it does shine at times, the undeniable betrayal of The Last Jedi hardly makes any Star Wars film worth watching."
"Mar 27, 2021",negative,"things happen the movie

better than the previous one tho
and it looks cool sometimes to"
"Mar 27, 2021",negative,"This film has no substance except for fan service. It contradicts itself, and knowledge we already know from the rest of the series, and has no place in the saga we call Star Wars

I would gladly watch Attack of the Clones over this"
"Mar 27, 2021",negative,The worst attempt of trying to milk the last dried utters of the franchise for all they have since the last jedi! It's also the most nonsensical movie ever created.
"Mar 26, 2021",positive,"Funny, original, & sweet!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Farewell to Luke and his twin sister Leia, plus Han Solo and Kylo Ren!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Mar 26, 2021",negative,"Literally, even the cast admitted that this movie was written at the last minute. Anyone who watches this can feel the vibe that this movie is made just for the sake of finishing Disney's sequel, the story is horrendous, Disney is so out of material they have to recycle old stuff, they even had Poe saying ""SOMEHOW Palpatine is back"", this line alone reflects how crappy this sequel finale is. But if you look at the bright side, finally the Disney's sequel is finished and we don't have to see any more of this poorly-written and commercial Star Wars crap."
"Mar 25, 2021",negative,The worst I saw from star wars
"Mar 25, 2021",neutral,"The Rise Of Skywalker cleans up the mess The Last Jedi made, but fails to give any of its characters a satisfying arc, and retcons the previous films in the process."
"Mar 24, 2021",neutral,Everything is wrong with this movie. Missed the idea of being Jedi.
"Mar 24, 2021",negative,I find this movie so boring and pointless...
"Mar 24, 2021",negative,"This tried to apologize for The Last Jedi, but the damage was done. This doesn't help. Anakin AND Luke are now failures. And now we have a Palpatine Saga... you know, since a Palpatine WON. 

You gotta be sick to think this good."
"Mar 23, 2021",positive,everything but Ray really wasn't that bad. God she gets me so angry. Terrible character. Should have been Finn. Guys a beauty.
"Mar 23, 2021",negative,Absolutly Insulting for fans. Disney wanted to say we all had to fuck off.
"Mar 22, 2021",positive,"Okay movie, fixed a lot of the last Jedi's problems which is always a win and I like Rey and Kylo much more in this film. However, it still lacks which I do not blame JJ for at this point but could have been better, wish they brought George back for this final film but not a terrible finally for the franchise. Could've been better."
"Mar 22, 2021",negative,"The moment they ripped off Endgame, was when I realized I wasn't watching a Star Wars movie."
"Mar 21, 2021",negative,I feel bad for JJ Abrams. He had to clean up Rian Johnson's mess and this movie was the result. It wasn't as much a movie as it was a clean-up attempt.
"Mar 21, 2021",negative,A very bad movie but better than the previous ones.  pure rubbish that only insults fans and all that is star wars
"Mar 21, 2021",negative,"What is this? It looks like a movie made in parts that they have not been able to put together, it is a Frankenstein's monster. It is nonsense, with tricks that come out of the sleeve and you have to believe it."
"Mar 21, 2021",positive,"la cinta intenta remediar la falta de rumbo claro de sus predecesoras en la trilogía, como película individual esta bien a secas."
"Mar 21, 2021",negative,"A lackluster and bloated ""finale"" to what was once the greatest saga of all time. 
The hope and emotional climax  that we were given at the end of The Last Jedi is no where to be found here."
"Mar 20, 2021",negative,No words. Just none. 
"Mar 20, 2021",positive,the best Star Wars sequel
"Mar 20, 2021",positive,"The last entry to the Skywalker Saga had a bunch of flaws, mostly because of JJ Abrams' choice to bring back Emperor Palpatine, it resulted in a very fast-paced mess, but it had a lot of great moments, I can never get tired of seeing Ian McDiarmid play Palpatine. 'The Rise of Skywalker' is overall an enjoyable fast-paced space adventure film but with a very weak story."
"Mar 20, 2021",negative,"Terrible writing
Terrible ending of a saga"
"Mar 20, 2021",positive,"Great wrap up to the Skywalker saga.  So much fan service!!  Babu Frik is one of my favorite characters of all time!!!  I have it as my 4th favorite Star Wars movie and enjoyed every second of it!! Brought on every emotion as a Star Wars movie should!! Will definitely miss these movies and these characters!
Overall, gave it a 91/100.  Go see for yourself!"
"Mar 20, 2021",negative,"There are elements in this film that I enjoyed however there is so much that just didn't work. From the opening of the movie to crazy amounts of continuity errors, never has a trilogy of movies not worked a trilogy. At least Eps 1-3 4-6 work as a collection of movies. Disney's attempt to rewrite Star Wars whilst clinging on what makes it nostalgic was a bad move. Episode 9 is a mess and not even a hot mess. The ending is well... End Game..."
"Mar 20, 2021",positive,"Messy, but sooooo stylish, fun and emotional."
"Mar 20, 2021",negative,worst star wars movie just horrible
"Mar 20, 2021",positive,"A good example of how critics take themselves too seriously. When it comes to Star Wars, trust the force (and opinions) of the fans. ROS feels like a true Star Wars film, peppered with nostalgia and the Jedi fighting I've been waiting for."
"Mar 20, 2021",neutral,"This is the worst of the complete saga. For any true fan it is an insult to more than 30 years of legacy beloved characters. Abrams tried to hard to tie all loose ends coming up with new Jedi stuff that are hardly accepted by the fandom. Bringing back Palpatine where again when no one ever asked for his come back and less by this terrible ""clone"" way, it was a clear mistake from the start."
"Mar 20, 2021",positive,"It doesn't succeed as a movie very well... messy plot and dead end plot points and some stuff was very rushed. However, it succeeds very well as a Star Wars movie. Def could've been better especially if they delayed the movie by a year to give a lot more time, but then it would've been delayed by Covid. They also totally could've split the movie in 2 as to really give more time for the characters especially since the first 2 movies had no time jump. The best thing about The Last Jedi was that it wasn't riddled with nostalgia, but that doesn't mean everything nostalgic was bad. There were some truthfully stunning scenes in this film and it really shows as being the last time the Skywalker family would have the spotlight... truthfully amazing movie and at minimum is very entertaining which is the #1 job a Star Wars movie has, and it more than did its job. Split into 2 parts or given an extra year for production, or both, would really have saved the final story in the Skywalker saga. Doesn't mean it was so bad, absolutely with revisiting because there is so much to enjoy."
"Mar 19, 2021",negative,star wars is dead because of disney and kathleen
"Mar 19, 2021",negative,another boring star wars movie
"Mar 19, 2021",negative,This film gets everything about Star Wars wrong and destroys the legacy of Episodes 1-6
"Mar 18, 2021",negative,"I don't usually review films publicly however this film recently had an article about some last Star Wars apologists. The overall flow or new hope redesign for the audience, mock the Star Wars World by going against everything ever done before, and then the last goes so far into a literal monster and cult  movie and essentially is cutting off the head of the franchise and burying it with the hopes and dreams of millions. 

Nothing was earned and twenty people at Random could reimagine this entire new 3 part franchise and plan out better. The adventurous and cheap nature of the originals is gone and until people start getting better quality material that's not poisoned or lampooned by corporate to make it as universal as possible, this is what you will get every time. Resting on laurels, they did not come close to what it could have been."
"Mar 18, 2021",negative,"It was exciting at first, but when the dust settled, the realization of what they had done to the past storylines, Kylo Ren/Ben's redemption, Rey taking on the Skywalker name(smacks my head), and the hokey ""Palpatine is back"" just left me disappointed in more ways than one."
"Mar 17, 2021",neutral,"Un buen intento por ""arreglar"" la franquicia después de The last Jedi, pero esta película que contradice todo lo establecido antes hace ver que la franquicia desde The Force Awakens nunca tuvo un rumbo establecido.

Como película fuera de las otras dos, tiene momentos épicos que cualquier fan de star wars disfrutaría, pero para cerrar la historia y el arco de los personajes... se siente bastante forzado como tratan de finalizar todo, haciendo que su final solo se vea como un mal truco bajo la manga y se siente como un final a medias.

Sin mencionar que el absurdo comodín de traer de vuelta a Palpatine y su relacion con Rey hace que se sienta mas forzada y sin sentido toda la trama de la pelicula y su existencia como tal."
"Mar 17, 2021",negative,"The Rise of Skywalker is a really fun movie, in fact, a lot of action and adventure. Kids will love this movie. However, adults will certainly roll their eyes a few times with the very obvious flaws in the script for this film, the construction of its narrative and the characters, that appear to have been created by a 4-year-old child."
"Mar 17, 2021",negative,The Movie was not good because it follows a story line that was ended by George Lucas in Episode 6. Overall bad movie Don't watch it.
"Mar 16, 2021",negative,"I have never hated a movie as much as I hate this one. The first 2 sequels left me unimpressed, but (without spoiling anything) this movie actively dismantles the story told by the original trilogy. This movie should not exist."
"Mar 15, 2021",negative,Only good thing about whole sequels is Kylo Ren
"Mar 14, 2021",positive,"A satisfying end to the Skywalker saga.

The Rise of Skywalker was a total improvement over The Last Jedi and brought back fun and action-packed adventure.

Even though JJ Abrams played it safe and predictable, The Rise of Skywalker is a solid final film."
"Mar 14, 2021",positive,Haber no es tan horrible es salvable tiene cosas diferentes de la saga original pero si hubieran quitado a palpatiene y meter a otro como dark maul hubiera sido mejor
"Mar 14, 2021",negative,Pace is unbearable. Story line is congested. Just entirely too ambitious and ready to serve. You expect steak but get an old school TV dinner. I lived for SW as a kid- but can’t rewatch this one. It’s jacked.
"Mar 13, 2021",positive,"Really well-made and full of action, drama, and unexpected parts"
"Mar 13, 2021",positive,Great Star Wars movie in its own right
"Mar 12, 2021",positive,"I genuinely really like this movie. It's definitely not the best star wars movie in my books, but it's still great. I don't know if I just absolutely LOVE star wars, but this movie was great. I'm not ashamed to say that some scenes made me cry, LOL. Overall, great movie, not the best, but great."
"Mar 12, 2021",positive,"For anyone who hated THE LAST JEDI, rest assured, JJ Abrams gave you a worthy conclusion to this trilogy. This is on par with THE FORCE AWAKENS (if not better). At times a wonderfully dark film that paces well as the longest Star Wars at 2 hours and 21 minutes. For everything that has been written about this new trilogy over the years, while I was never a big fan of it and I won't miss these characters as much as other characters from the past, I hope this is indeed the end of the cannon. If Disney wants to do spinoffs or movies with new characters, that's fine. I think over the course of the last 40+ years, this cow's been milked dry."
"Mar 11, 2021",negative,"After the poor writing, jarring comedy, plot holes, lack of understanding of the Force, character assassinations, throw-away deaths, and astonishingly stupid ending meant The Last Jedi (TLJ) had summited the mountain of awful... it seems like JJ Abrams said ""hold my beer"" and created the Rise of Skywalker to show he can out-dumb Rian Johnson without breaking a sweat."
"Mar 9, 2021",positive,"Meh 
It could of been worst"
"Mar 8, 2021",negative,What a mess... an awful end to a trilogy that should have never been made.
"Mar 7, 2021",negative,Can't say much that hasn't been said before. An average attempt to salvage what was a broken trilogy. The failures a too long to list. Here's hoping the whole trilogy will eventually be de-canonized. Unfortunately even that will never resolve the missed opportunity of having those original characters on screen together. A mistake of Abrams own making. In any case no one will be interested in these movies or these characters in a decade let alone 50 years from now.
"Mar 7, 2021",negative,"Terrible with so many plot holes, not as bad as Last Jedi but not far off it"
"Mar 5, 2021",negative,"What can I say? Darth Vader's sacrifice was completely trashed, there was no world-building or imagination, and the characters were hardly developed. The. acting was pretty good though, and the special effects were great. Nobody gives enough credit to any of the behind the scenes. I also did not like how they minimized Rose Tico. I thought she was the best thing to come out of the last Jedi."
"Mar 3, 2021",negative,This is rotten crap. JJ abrams has to go in prison for this. Very poorly scripted fast-paced movie that keeps going forward. No emotion. Such a bad ending to the Star Wars franchise. Palpatine coming back was confusing and dumb. The cgi is pretty horrible in my eyes. ( not the worst ). Overall i'm proud that i didn't watch this at cinema. Skip this movie and the entire sequel trilogi ( 2015-2019 ) and you won't miss anything. Another ruined franchise
"Mar 3, 2021",negative,It was just awful. Gave up watching
"Feb 28, 2021",positive,"It's not what I wanted, but I can appreciate it for what it is."
"Feb 28, 2021",negative,"It's quite a surprise to see Disney be so lazy with a franchise as big as Star Wars. They the plot contradicts itself, the characters remained undeveloped, and Palpatine's return was a joke. The worst installment in the entire saga."
"Feb 27, 2021",negative,"The writing is terrible to say the least, nearly every character goes back twenty steps if they went one ahead in TLJ, JJ tried to cancel Rian Johnson's work in the previous movie creating holes as big as the Xystons and making the saga end in one of the worst ways possible"
"Feb 26, 2021",positive,Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver do their best but it's not enough to save this movie.
"Feb 25, 2021",positive,An honourable end to the saga. The way they brough Palpatine back but didn't undo anything done in the original was key. The explanation of Snoke was weak and needed more background to how Palpatine was Rey's grandfather. But the return of Lando makes this film worth the watch
"Feb 25, 2021",negative,"Terrible writing, awful characters."
"Feb 24, 2021",negative,"The plot has so many holes and completely illogical turns that you simply stop caring about what happens after fifteen minutes. On top of that the main characters are hollow and one-dimensional with no character arch whatsoever. A comparison with the Game of Thrones finale comes close to hand, but at least Games of Thrones had some good acting all the way to the disappointing end, which is more than you can say about The Rise of Skywalker with the exception of Adam Driver."
"Feb 23, 2021",negative,"The second part already was bad for a Star Wars movie. The third part just confirmed certain suspicions I already had concerning the character arcs. Dialogues are still poor. Plot armor remains. Character arcs are just built on outdated ideas and principles that are wrong in many ways. They not only don't fit into the overall Star Wars idea, they are also outdated in terms of our modern culture. It's like they tried to write a Pirates of the Carribean story in the 1980s."
"Feb 23, 2021",negative,perhaps the worst movie ever made.
"Feb 23, 2021",negative,"It's sad to see that a movie called the ""rise"" of Skywalker is the downfall of StarWars and an insult to many long lasting fans..."
"Feb 22, 2021",positive,"It felt rushed at times, but was ultimately a satisfying end to the Skywalker Saga."
"Feb 21, 2021",negative,"They were riding space horses on top of Star destroyers. 
Rey is still the strongest and has no rival. 
More fake jedi powers that help the writers move the plot along. 
Just a terrible movie. Don't bother. Stick with the first six. Don't watch these three is you really love Star Wars."
"Feb 21, 2021",negative,"This movie is just a random series of compltely unexplained objectives and events so the characters have something to do. For example, suddenly they really need this one dagger that you've never heard of, so they get it; but then they can't read it without doing this thing with C3PO which you've never heard of, so they go do that. It's non-stop nonsense that isn't even consisten with itself, but some massive plot holes that destroy the credibility of the entire series, if it had any left at this point."
"Feb 20, 2021",positive,"It is rare that one movie makes me like two others much less -- those two being The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi. Star Wars purists can say what they want, but the real issue for me was seeing that there was no plan for these movies from the start. That being said, it was an entertaining watch."
"Feb 20, 2021",negative,"The pacing was awful.
The plot was awful and far too contrived.
TLJ gave this movie a tough handicap, but this film did nothing to help itself or save the trilogy."
"Feb 18, 2021",negative,"Very poor film with more holes than plot, more original trilogy characters sacrificed in an attempt to win fan approval - Truly terrible film please Disney learn the lessen and have people involved that love the saga and ditch the Sequel trilogy. Still not sure what the point of the Sequel trilogy was ... was there a central plot? character development? a new story arc linking to the original films? oh no just a vehicle to make money!"
"Feb 18, 2021",negative,"""Somehow palpatine is back""
Ok that's just lazy writing at it's finest"
"Feb 17, 2021",negative,This movie is and slaps the face of everyone that loves Star Wars.
"Feb 17, 2021",negative,"This movie is heart breakingly bad. So bad that it not only ruined the already questionably sequel trilogy, but all of Star Wars for me. That's right this film is so awful that it makes the original Star Wars unwatchable by association. How you ask?

Start with the premise. Emperor Palpatine is randomly back from the dead for unexplained reasons. This immediately ruins the First Order as villains, turning them from interesting neo-fascists to puppets of the Emperor. It also ruins the arc of Return of the Jedi and Vader's sacrifice.

The emperor has somehow built himself a fleet of thousands of Star Destroyers on a random planet with no industrial capacity. This continues the sequel trilogy's complete disinterest in creating a vaguely plausible universe (the entire New Republic was in one star system! Space ships do stern chases until they run out of fuel! A fringe political splinter group can build a bigger weapon than a centralized government) but takes it to new levels. Yes, epic requires suspension of disbelief. But it requires its own internal logic and world building. You need to be able to imagine beyond the conflict on the screen.

It only goes downhill from here. Lando gets a cameo but no characterization. Smoke gets handwaved. Kylo gets redeemed. Everything interesting set up in the previous two movies is tossed aside."
"Feb 16, 2021",negative,This movie looked great as did all the sequel trilogy but my God was it laughably awful
"Feb 16, 2021",negative,only reason it got half a star was because I can't give 0. actually deserves a negative 5. min see w
"Feb 16, 2021",positive,"Beautifully crafted visuals, serviceable action and some heartfelt moments barely make up for the mishandled plot and questionable dialogue."
"Feb 15, 2021",negative,"Absolutely abysmally boring plot and horrific pacing. Nothing in the plot is earned and every event felt like plot device with no substance. The entire film relied on pure fan service to drive the plot forward, and completely failed in almost every way. J.J Abrams proves himself to be talentless and never takes any sort of risks in this film. Force power invented in this film are straight up disgrace to the legacy.

Truly abysmal film, and I hope J.J Abrams never returns again to make another soulless and forgettable cash grab."
"Feb 15, 2021",positive,"Overall I like this movie. There was a lot of action throughout the movie. The movie was engaging and easy to watch. I like how the special effects were not overly done. It was very surprising to see what happens to Leia and C-3PO, it definitely marked the end of an era. Not to mention the progressional growth of Rey throughout the movie, taking the story in a different direction. I hope that Chewbacca continues to be that one character that ties the new stories back to the original trilogies."
"Feb 12, 2021",negative,very bad. A lot more worse than the prequels
"Feb 6, 2021",positive,A film made with all the heart for fans and a true Star Wars adventure for those who want to start following the franchise !
"Feb 3, 2021",negative,"Everything about this movie sucks, trying to fix the mess that The last Jedi left, and failing even more so. Don't waste your time, it's good we now have a real Star Wars story (The Mandalorian), created by real directors and producers that care about it and not just about money."
"Feb 3, 2021",negative,Jar Jar interests me more than Rey
"Feb 1, 2021",positive,"Perfect movie. This movie is action filled, there are references to old movies and SHOWS, and more. It's absolutely fantastic. Palpatine's return is done so well and Rey saying she's  a skywalker is a perfect end to the saga."
"Jan 31, 2021",negative,"I enjoy any good/entertaining movie. This was bad/boring but I watched to end for any redeemable qualities.

TROS - Not part of the Sequel Triology & if it is then it is the Worst of Trilogy & Whole Star Wars Saga.

Actual Title v Title It Should Have Been -

Star Wars: Sequal Trilogy v Star Wars: New Generation

SW: TFA v The Estranged Skywalker/Lost Jedi
Pros: Decent Reboot, New Characters, Kylo Ren

SW: TLJ v The Dark Skywalker/The Redeemable Skywalker
Pros: New SW Concepts, Character Development/Arcs & KyloRen/Rey Dyad Force

SW: TROS v The Last Skywalker/The End of Skywalkers
Pros: 1* for Visuals, Actors & Crew did decent job with Rubbish Everything Else - Story, Screenplay, Directing & Editing. I hated the last 30 minutes.
Only saving grace of whole movie was Kylo/Ben arc, the blue lightsaber at last & all his fight scenes.

This Trilogy only works if you think of them as Life of Kylo Ren/Journey of ***Solo"
"Jan 29, 2021",positive,"It was an exciting end to the saga but it suffered from a lack of adventure and imagination. The movie's dedication to its fans was a nice move, sadly, nobody ever understands the true beauty of saying goodbye by dedicating a masterpiece to its long-time viewers."
"Jan 26, 2021",negative,"Dear Lord, this was a mess beyond belief!

I have a fanboy since the first movie.  
A bigger fan after the second movie,
Slight more fanatical after the Return of the Jedi (Ewoks took me down a notch)

The next three prequels were so so, with some hits and some misses.

Episode 7 and 8... I can deal with even if it seems to be a rehash with variations.

BUT EPISODE 9 caused a bigger disturbance in the Force than the destruction of Alderaan.   I actually sighed and say ""gimme a break"" several times throughout the movie.

Can this movie be taken out of the Star Wars canon?  Please!!!!



Even so, I still love the SW universe,"
"Jan 14, 2021",positive,"Great film, as with all films, go see and make up your own mind - Visually Stunning conclusion to The Skywalker Saga :-)"
"Jan 13, 2021",negative,WORST STAR WARS MOVIE EVER
"Jan 13, 2021",negative,"The worst of the sequel trilogy. Nothing made sense. JJ tried to reverse The Last Jedi, but created a mess. A lot of fan service, but nothing had any impact. Several fake deaths and unlogical elements. Terrible movie."
"Jan 11, 2021",negative,"So Luke wants to find the way finder, then just gives up??? Also this movie completely makes return of the Jedi a waste of time????? How is Ray so overpowered so fast with so little training???? What a convoluted mess, I hope in the future they make this movie an alternative timeline."
"Jan 7, 2021",negative,This movie was an attempt to salvage the previous two in the sequel series. Still not good though.
"Dec 31, 2020",negative,garbage...  total disrespect towards every aspect of the lore of the SW fandom
"Dec 31, 2020",negative,Complete manure. Disney absolutely destroyed the greatest IP in history.
"Dec 31, 2020",positive,"Pros: Great Performances from Ridley and Driver, Genuine heart in its filmmaking, Respect for what was appealing about Star Wars from the beginning, Loveable aliens and droids, Fantastic score, Fantastic climax, No shock deaths, An uplifting message about what defines a person, and a Satisfyingly-hopeful and happy ending!

Cons: Boyega is somewhat underutilized, Somewhat uneven pacing, Retconning of promising plot points from the previous film, and Lightsaber duels feel too short!"
"Dec 31, 2020",positive,"I thought it was an action packed, fast paced story well told as an ending to the saga.  Although sad to see it end - the end was fitting.  Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver performances were fantastic - I've watched this over and over and like the other episodes will watch it again and again."
"Dec 30, 2020",positive,"Perfect ending to the saga. I loved the movie. In addition to containing so many exciting moments, the film manages to remind you of the real star wars."
"Dec 30, 2020",neutral,"This was one huge missed opportunity. If JJ could let go of the original Star Wars trilogy and actually write something creative and new for once in his life then maybe this movie wouldn't have been such a mess. Bringing back the Emperor from the dead? Seriously? I get that people hated Last Jedi but at least Rian tried to do something unique, BUILD OFF OF IT but instead JJ just denied it and contradicted it. The film was a lazy, sloppy disappointment. 

PS. If you are going to give Rey a new light saber either have her USE IT or don't have it at all, dick."
"Dec 30, 2020",negative,"50+ plot holes. Seemingly no respect for the established story. Had low expectations, still disappointed."
"Dec 30, 2020",neutral,Disappointing storyline.
"Dec 30, 2020",negative,"An underwhelming chapter to end the Skywalker saga. Full of subplots and its too illogical ways to ""course correct"" the franchise really dragged this movie down."
"Dec 29, 2020",negative,Who in the world in the Audience gave this good review to be 86%? Now I know RT is a paid platform. This makes no sense. This movie was horrible and Im not even a big SW fan. But I know enough about it to know this storyline is way off its origin.
"Dec 29, 2020",neutral,"I could tell they just made things up while making this movie. What's next, your going to tell me Obi Wan has a son who lives in Naboo? I expected better since this is the closure of the Skywalker Saga."
"Dec 29, 2020",negative,"If you've just watched the first 6 starwars movies, dont bother to watch the sequels. Disney really fucked up on them, but their spinoffs are great. The skywalker saga ended when Revenge of the sith was released and its a shame to call the sequels a part of the same storyline."
"Dec 29, 2020",negative,"Much of the film featured a convoluted plot with rushed storytelling. A disappointing way for the saga to end. The writers seem more interested in showing off what they think looks cool (""fan service"") instead of crafting a thoughtful and engaging story."
"Dec 29, 2020",negative,Horrible! Dishonours the original (real) Star Wars.
"Dec 29, 2020",positive,"Although the movie is not without quirks, flaws and plot holes, the cinematography, themes and overarching story of The Rise of Skywalker make it a solid Star Wars outing with a great conclusion for the sequel trilogy and all 9 Star Wars episodic films."
"Dec 29, 2020",negative,"Ok Palpatine being back like totally negates Anakin's arc... It's like the filmmakers got scared with the audience response of the last Jedi and we're doing damage control,,, but the plot of the way finder, the dyad of the force & what all non-plots crammed into this... I'm just done!!!"
"Dec 29, 2020",positive,"Not much to do after the disaster of the previous, still lacks creativity and coherence."
"Dec 29, 2020",negative,"""Emotions are not for sharing"" - Pablo Hidalgo - Lucasfilm Story Group"
"Dec 29, 2020",negative,"This movie is at least twice as bad as the last one. My review for the last one... "" I hate this movie with a passion. It's so idiotic it makes the prequel's seem good. It honestly hurts to watch it."". So, yeah. Not good."
"Dec 28, 2020",negative,The rise of Skywalker??? More like the rise of failure.
"Dec 28, 2020",negative,"As a movie I'd give it 5/10. But as a Star Wars movie? 1/10. Also, nice job at freezing the audience score!"
"Dec 28, 2020",negative,"This movie is a fireworks show. In other words, you can watch and enjoy what is happening on screen, but if you think about it for even a second, it all falls apart. So much time is spent undoing The Last Jedi that it never develops its own story (even though I did not like The Last Jedi, I don't think spending a movie undoing it was necessary). It copies Endgame blatantly but with none of the emotional impact, plot points are left completely unexplained, and in trying to please everyone they pleased no one."
"Dec 28, 2020",negative,"This film was awful, so Mary Sue Palpatine calls herself ""Rey Skywalker"" at the end.

The Emperor Wins!
The Skywalker family all dead!

WHAT A MESS!"
"Dec 28, 2020",negative,"This movie is just a disgrace to the Star Wars franchise, Sure, Ok, there was a good part of the movie at the end, its called the Credits, check it out. Oh and at the start.
The part where Star Wars goes on screen and the music starts playing. The Text scroll was terrible though."
"Dec 28, 2020",negative,"Horrible. 

Spoiler:




Essentially makes all 9 movies about Palpatine. Ruins the original 3."
"Dec 21, 2020",negative,"This movie is an excellent example of how to make a bad movie. I still have a hard time believing this is really something that costs hundreds of millions of dollars. With all that money, they apparently neglected to hire one star wars fan to tell them it was awful. None of the plot made any sense. The special effects were average for any basic movie nowadays. The directing was nothing like the actual star wars movies as it lacked the juxtaposition demonstrated in the real movies. Darth Sidious just explains the plot instead of having real lines. I am not sure who thought it was awesome to attack a ship with space horses. It was the stupidest part of any star wars movie. I mean wow, space horses. It was hard to top force ghosts interacting with things, but they did. These people are stupid. Stop destroying star wars. Please."
"Dec 21, 2020",negative,"It's overall average, although despite the flashy action and rushed story, I was still bored enough to do the dishes half-way through. Entirely forgettable like the rest of the new trilogy."
"Dec 18, 2020",negative,"It is sad to see how the Star Wars Story got treated with so much disrespect, so little planning and so little originality. This is the worst film of the ""low quality fan fiction with ridiculously high budget""-continuation to George Lucas' original triology. I won't watch it again and regret watching it after the disappointment of the first two Disney-Star Wars film."
"Dec 14, 2020",positive,The most underrated movie ever.
"Dec 13, 2020",positive,loved it to bits i do get why it's hated but i thought it was a fun action film with a amazing twist not the best star wars film not by a long shot but i still loved it
"Dec 9, 2020",positive,"This was honestly the best movie of the sequel trilogy and a very great closer to the Skywalker saga. J.J Abrams finally got this trilogy right back on track after The Last Jedi's plot holes almost sent this franchise right down the toilet. It had finality, fast-paced action, great messages and some nice dialogue. This to me is the ""Star Wars"" that I know and absolutely love 🍿👏"
"Dec 9, 2020",positive,"This film was ok. They were obviously trying to do to much in suck little time. The film feels very rushed at times. The acting is great, but the story plot wholes kinda make it hard to appreciate the great performances and great action scenes. Speaking of action this is one of the best of the entire saga. I love kylo’s arc over the last 3 films. Rey’s arc could have been done a little better with her being the main protagonist. I felt as if J.J Abrams saw what Rian Johnson did with “ The Last Jedi” and tried to fix it but it was already to little to late. Overall descent Star Wars film, but with it being the finale, i along with all Star Wars fans expected better."
"Dec 1, 2020",negative,"Nothing make sense, the story is stupid at best and the cuts will make you eyes bleed"
"Nov 30, 2020",negative,I thought that this movie is definitely the worst in the star wars saga. It only gets a star because the effects and action were great but everything else was a disaster.
"Nov 30, 2020",positive,A fitting finale to the Star Wars series. One of the best Star Wars movies of the new production. Up there with Rogue One.
"Nov 29, 2020",positive,"Personally I didn't find it as troubling as The Last Jedi, but seeing this was the conclusion of 42 years worth of movies and storytelling, it really needed to be either 2 movies or 3 hours long."
"Nov 27, 2020",negative,A poorly planned end to a poorly planned trilogy.
"Nov 26, 2020",negative,"The most awful and horrible Star Wars movie. 
Not even Solo was this disappointing. Disgusting. I hate you Daisy Ridley and wish you everything bad in life. JJ Abrams, I'll never forgive you; you truly crapped in the SW franchise with this scum."
"Nov 26, 2020",positive,8th time watching this. Adam driver doesnt get old
"Nov 26, 2020",negative,"Half a star is a generous amount of stars given. This film was an absolute abomination to this saga. Sith Lord Emperor Palpatine should have eliminated every character introduced during this terrible trilogy. I think that the monkeys repairing Ren's helmet could have come up with a better film than this. Joe Biden himself could have stuttered out a more complete movie than this garbage. I wish that Babu could free my memory from this disgrace of a trilogy, as he did with C3PO. The only part of this entire trilogy I found entertaining is when Kylo Ren died. BB8 is technologically impaired, and it is unable to even open simple doorways or passages. The insignificant droid had to be carried up a small hill to survive. Disney, ""You have failed me for the last time""-Darth Vader. My disappointments immeasurable, and my day is ruined.
P.S. Finn is useless."
"Nov 25, 2020",negative,"The big finale to the Skywalker saga and we don't even get a big lightsaber fight at the end. It relies on the holy trinity from the original trilogy to be great, however when two of them have been killed off, and with Carrie Fisher dying in real life, there's nothing really you can do with them. Poe gets an unoriginal and dull back story, Finn is their too. I think Rey is a good character, but the sudden romance that was never built up was pointless and was there really no better ideas than to make her a Palpitine. The movie just feels like a wasted opportunity."
"Nov 23, 2020",positive,"How Can I Stop watching this ? 
Amazing , realy Amazing"
"Nov 23, 2020",negative,God awful. So many garbage plot devices and a** pulls. None of this movie made sense. This entire trilogy as a whole was pointless. I only pray we never see episode ten.
"Nov 22, 2020",negative,"I've been a Star Wars fan since I was a kid and this movie, The Rise of Skywalker, was a mess. Never have I been so unbelievably frustrated while watching a movie in the theater. I honestly don't know where to begin. First off, this easily could have been made into two or three fairly decent films, but unfortunately, this movie was rushed from beginning to end, important plot revelations were sloppily thrown into the script without any setup from the previous two films in the trilogy, the sheer amount of retcons shoved down the audience's throat to appease those who disliked The Last Jedi (which I also didn't enjoy) were mind boggling, and I'm not even going to talk about the insulting amount of in-your-face fan service moments which, despite their efforts, did not make me care in the slightest about what was going on. I felt nothing. There were a few redeeming qualities: for example, the visual effects were stunning and the acting was pretty good, there were a few jokes here and there that brought a chuckle out of me, but overall, the Rise of Skywalker was so forgettable that it's honestly hard to write this review right now and I watched it like a month ago."
"Nov 22, 2020",negative,"They should have called it ""Star Wars: The Rise of Deus Ex Machina"".  There is a single redeeming quality to this movie- well, maybe two.  The first is the line ""Poe Dameron, spice runner, runner of spice.""  The second is that the yellow lightsaber is cool.  But everything else is so inconceivably horrendous that you just HAVE to wonder why JJ Abrams would do this to us.  The Force Awakens was a sign of the death of Star Wars movies, and this is the final nail in the coffin."
"Nov 19, 2020",positive,"The ending of this movie franchise was like tying a shoe: you tied the laces, but you ended up with a knot around your ankles. It provided us with the sheer example of a lack of energy, as well as proving over and over again that you have to have forty eyes to spot the millisecond homosexuality in the background. The directors are cowards!"
"Nov 17, 2020",negative,"This movie just like the rest of the new ones didn't make any sense whatsoever. I truly understand now when Daisy Ridley said in an interview that the writers had no idea who was going to be the ""Big Bad"" in the last episode, since they killed off Snoke in the previous movie. Palpatine coming back made zero sense, since there wasn't any buildup in the previous movies whatsoever, and him being beaten by a Mary Sue character that didn't have any character development at all. She acquired all her Jedi powers and mastering the lightsaber in such a short time with any shortcomings unlike the previous main characters, so Palpatine being defeated so easily is just ridiculous. Sad that the writers didn't know what they were doing at all and turned an interesting character like Rey into one of the worst ever made."
"Nov 16, 2020",positive,"I grew up with the originals and have to say, I don't get what the critics have a problem with. This was a really fun, exciting, and satisfying Star Wars film. Maybe a tad rushed, could have stood to at 30-45 minutes to its runtime. But, otherwise, great tie-ins with the original trilogy, great send off for Han and Leia, Luke makes a fun appearance, and Rey gets to fulfill her destiny. My kids were in tears afterward, if that tells you anything."
"Nov 16, 2020",negative,"Star Wars is my favorite movie franchise, but this movie has plot holes and gives abilities that are not consistent with the rest of the franchise or even with itself. I did not think that characters' actions made sense. There was hardly any character development and the whole movie felt like it was full of irritating and predictable ""plot twists"" but no real substance."
"Nov 16, 2020",negative,the only good thing about this movie was palpatine. the worst thing was the force power of pulling a lightsaber out of thin air sucks and ruins it for me.
"Nov 15, 2020",negative,"As an action film it was just okay, and the pacing was all over the place, and feels like it was made for the tik tok generation attention spans. 

As a Star Wars film, its horribly disappointing."
"Nov 12, 2020",negative,"Horrendous, the entire trilogy is shambles. It's extremely obvious the entire movie is fan service made but it fails in that aspect as well, it destroyed the meaning of the movies that came before it only to sell quick seats in the theater. 
Technically the pacing is a mess, it's like trying to cram 3 movies into one, the characters have no meaning and palpatines return is cringe at best. 
Go watch the mandalorian instead and save time."
"Nov 12, 2020",negative,This film is unwatchable and is evidence of a lack of direction from Lucasfilm. It is clear that there was not a distinguishable outline for the film much less the trilogy
"Nov 12, 2020",negative,"It took me 3 times To finally finish watching it.. this movie is such a lame. Why did they choose abrams ? He made so many bad movies... how could it be any different? I dont mind if anyone liked it, but there is absolutly no chance i ll watch 7,8 and 9 ever again. ..."
"Nov 12, 2020",negative,"It's like J.J. and his co-writer didn't even have an ounce of creativity to spare. With higher up executive politics and a fan base of unapologetic nerds they had to appease. I don't blame them for not following through with Rian's vision for the next Star wars movie and cramming so much of what J.J. wanted to do in episode eight in to this movie. And once again they basically copy/ pasting the whole movie from the ‘Return of the Jedi', which was such a cop out. And the constant pandering to the audiance was not earned."
"Nov 11, 2020",positive,"I will admit, I give it a 5 stars because of the filmography and the acting. However I would give it a 4 and a half due to the story outcome and plot."
"Nov 11, 2020",negative,"This film is entirely non-sensical but I don't think I've laughed this much in a while. Not at the jokes or anything, just the sheer, unadulterated chaos that was JJ Abrams trying to fix this abomination of a story."
"Nov 10, 2020",negative,please. This movie is horrible. It ruined pretty much everything that made Star Wars amazing. They shouldn't have made this. Star Wars ended with episode 6.
"Nov 10, 2020",negative,"The utter balls Disney had to release this film is amazing.  This film is a mess , A BIG MESS! There are only two things I like about this film is the CGI and the cinematography. I remember I was  about 10 when The Force Awakens came out, and that was the first star wars film I ever saw And after that I became a star was fanatic until Solo came out and I lost interest ( not saying solo is a bad film it's jet kind of dull than the others). And when I saw this in theaters when it came out it was like I was watching the 2013 Oldboy, and It was so unimaginative. Yesterday I watched it again to see the problems and the things it did right. Firstly their are scenes that drag on for way, way to long and It was very annoying. The plot is the EXACT SAME AS EPISODE 6!!!! The score is fine, the editing is ok, and the sound is decent. The good things are the cinematography and the CGI, the film has a lot of nice shots in the film especially the use of color. and the cg well its a star wars film. Their are a lot of unnecessary stuff and unnecessary characters. Over all this film shows that Disney needs to stop this nonsense and die. This film is a 4.6/10 . P.S if their is a hell this film is going their."
"Nov 9, 2020",positive,"This movie is a perfect conclusion for all the Skywalker saga in the Star Wars Universe ! the first part place a lot of situation and the second part finish all of them with a lof of emotions ! the ending is very powerfull and the visuals are greats ! The characters are well played by the actors and its always to watch this movie again and again (12 times for me xD). One of the best star wars movie, of course, but he have some defaults which create a difference or speed between TFA and TLJ but that change nothing about the movie which is like TLJ, a masterpiece of the galaxie far far away..."
"Nov 9, 2020",negative,The story was trash and Leia died for no reason and Jedi can heal people for some reason and that would have been useful many times in the past and the end fight scene sucked I wanted all the Jedi spirits to help the rebellion defeat the dark side but no all we got was shit.
"Nov 8, 2020",negative,An absolutely disjointed storyline leaves the audience frustrated up until a baffling twist at the end. Character story archs are left unresolved and some of the most interesting stories are introduced in the last half of the movie and left out of the spotlight.
"Nov 8, 2020",negative,"I was almost bored to death by this. Disney, just erase this from canon."
"Nov 7, 2020",positive,"This movie was a disaster and an adventure at the same time. It had some stupid plots like Palpatine returning, the newest trilogy feels more about the rebels than the Jedi."
"Nov 6, 2020",negative,"Pathetic, no other words. Ruins what they've already destroyed in so many ways. I watched this movie 3 years after release having wish I just never did being such a huge fan."
"Nov 4, 2020",positive,A great ending to the Star Wars Skywalker Saga! A better ending than Resident Evil: The Final Chapter!
"Nov 4, 2020",positive,"And the Disney Star Wars ended with that with lots of spin-off in the makings  
it is better than the prequels 
But in my opinion not as good as the originals"
"Nov 3, 2020",positive,"Good movie. If you were born right before the digitally mastered episodes 4-6 in the 1990s, you would definitely want to make watching the last trilogy of Star Wars as part of the bucket list. Yes, there are plot-holes in the movie, but they summed up of what happened in previous Star Wars movies, in my perspective to the best of their ability. My life is mainly complete now."
"Nov 3, 2020",negative,"Unfortunately terrible. A terrible waste of potential and excitement. A chaotic mess of contrived plot devices, forced coincidences, fetch quests, and fake-out deaths. Disappointing and unstructured."
"Nov 2, 2020",positive,Talvez não fosse a forma correta de terminar mas é uma boa diversão
"Nov 2, 2020",negative,"The new Saga ends with a fast paced mess of a film. This film is all over the place. Characters are introduced and never used, the action feels too planned, and the story is just thrown together. The acting is great, but everything down to the editing is so fast paced it feels more like a recap than an actual story. The finale of the movie is set to be a massive battle and is just horribly executed. There isn’t any stakes and a lot feels like fan service. They had potential with this new trilogy and as the movies went on they just decided to just run with whatever they got. Sadly this is a messy way to end something so beloved."
"Nov 2, 2020",negative,"This movie ruins Star Wars cannon beyond belief. The force healing ability destroyed Anakin's sacrifice, Luke gets treated like a pathetic loser who gets beat by everyone, Finn has no character at all, he is just the goofball rebel who shouts REY!!!!! like 60% of the movie. When the movie is set up as a ""come to terms with who you are"" and Rey just disregards that and just takes the Name Skywalker because Palpatine is evil WTF is that, take the name of the family whose legacy you just ruined. Let's just hope that the next Star Wars movie I either way in the future or way in the past, god forbid another sequel trilogy based on this crap."
"Nov 2, 2020",negative,"Another boring disaster. It's way worse than the prequels, boring and uninspiring."
"Nov 1, 2020",negative,What happens when you make a film that gives a certain segment of the Star Wars fan base what they want. You get a Rotten Tomato that must immediately go straight into the garbage compacter
"Oct 31, 2020",negative,Lack of relying on classic famous star wars characters. Constantly defying established Star Wars lore. Character arc development is abandoned constantly. Trying to constantly pull emotional gimmicks. Creates ridiculous seemingly invincible villains and then needs to create ridiculous seemingly invincible heroes. Big Budget does NOT mean Quality.
"Oct 30, 2020",negative,"Absurdly horrible.  It's not impossible to get me to like a new Star Wars movie (I really like Rogue One), but it just needs to make sense and have a purpose. I would venture to say that JJ Abrams is one of the worst directors out there, and worse than Rian. Awful awful."
"Oct 30, 2020",negative,"trash! The plot is ridiculous, lots of the scenes don't make sense, A disgrace to George Lucas' creation."
"Oct 30, 2020",neutral,"The movie was fine but I saw some red flags 
1 Palpatine coming back to life is what I hate the most about this movie I'm okay with the force beating out balance and have if to be restored again but palpatine should stayed dead and let someone else be the main bad guy of Star Wars 
2 the ending is basically a rip off of Independence Day a message of hope helps  unite people to fight agents an invasion force and the weak spot on their ships is under the bell canons 
3 destroying a planet we barley know, Seriously why destroy Kijimi when they could destroy a planet like Mon Cala or Chandrila or maybe Coruscant,Lothal or Kashyyyk"
"Oct 30, 2020",negative,"Wasn't a fan, old films were better"
"Oct 29, 2020",negative,"My god was this movie dissapointing. the skywalker saga and star wars is a very very loved franchise and it deserved so much more as an ending. disney completely ignored the source material (the name ""anakin"" isnt mentioned ONCE in the entire trilogy btw) and the directors couldnt agree on their ideas. we had no explanation as to why palpatine came back and for all we know he could come back anytime. the dialogue is childish and cringey too, and to be honest the only thing saving this movie from getting half star from me is the soundtrack. other than that, awful movie. i do not recommend"
"Oct 28, 2020",positive,"This movie revisited the Star Wars we all grew up with. Well-executed and choreographed action scenes, a house of cards built around the cast, a soundtrack that immerses you, and a thrill ride of nostalgia."
"Oct 26, 2020",negative,"As incredible as it might be, Star Wars defines a whole universe to explore, but this film is just a repetition of the first trilogy's drama. Disappointing."
"Oct 26, 2020",negative,"The Rise of Skywalker is a disappointing ending of a trilogy that doesn't connect anything and goes nowhere and to a saga that deserved better. Rian Johnson's work was so much better, but Disney gave in critics that occurred to Empire Strikes Back too, and this film happened. Sad."
"Oct 25, 2020",negative,"Although this film has some of the best scenes of the entire saga (Luke raising the X-Wing, Bendemption, Leia), it's the weakest Star Wars film of all time. It retconned so much of what was established in The Last Jedi, and bringing back the Emperor just cheapens the Chosen One prophecy, and thereby Episodes I-6 -- although Ian McDiarmid was absolutely phenomenal and frightning as hell. I just wish they had stuck with Colin Trevorrow's ""Duel of the Fates."""
"Oct 25, 2020",positive,Honestly enjoyed it not as bad as people say. I liked how it was wrapped up. Satisfying.
"Oct 25, 2020",positive,Entertaining but a very standard end to the Skywalker Saga. Would’ve worked better split into two movies.
"Oct 23, 2020",positive,I found this movie to be a bit of a mess if I am honest. TLJ was totally not what JJ Abrams would have took Star Wars and so he spent most of the movie retconning the plot points. It was a welcome return for Ian MCDiarmid's Darth Sidious but also felt forced and contrived. The whole Rey is his granddaughter also made zero sense. There was also the question of exactly who Snoke was. Was he controlled by palpatine by the force? Was he his own person and if so how could he be force sensitive if he was made in a lab? Again very muddled and clumsy story telling. It was better than TLJ though.
"Oct 22, 2020",positive,THE RISE OF SKYWALKER is what you get when you try and please everybody.
"Oct 21, 2020",positive,Perfect ending to the saga.
"Oct 21, 2020",negative,"Awful, I'd rather watch prequels at least those movies made me laugh. This trilogy did the opposite, it pisses me off."
"Oct 20, 2020",positive,"I don't care what other people say, this movie was good. A lot happened, it wasn't a great end to a 9 film saga, but it was a good end to the trilogy."
"Oct 20, 2020",negative,"The one thing that I respect about this film is its originality in plot. Which is truly the only good thing that can be said about this film. Its a fun movie if you completely disregard the legalistic's and the logic of the whole plot which for me personally, is impossible to do. The main example of this is Palpatine, that he cloned Snoke, and that he conveniently had a fleet of star destroyers under an ocean of ice which were all equipped with hundreds of red storm-troopers and pilots. All of this completely contradicts everything that the sequels were building up to. And seriously, how on earth were all of those Final Order people in star destroyers under the ice ocean suppose to still be alive after 20 years!? So if your somehow able to look past the incomprehensible plot you might enjoy it but I just like to pretend this movie never happened and is a truly dreadful 4/10 film!"
"Oct 20, 2020",negative,"Un verdadero fiasco, una historia aburrida, la mayoria de los personajes aburridos, una historia espantosa, una deshonrra a la saga"
"Oct 18, 2020",positive,"Being a Star Wars fan and see this, eh, kinda predictable to see Rey real identity, but other than that, worth it"
"Oct 17, 2020",negative,"I'm upset that zero stars is not an option. If George Lucas were already passed, he'd be spinning in his grave, so I can't even imagine the living equivalent."
"Oct 16, 2020",negative,"Badly ridden, badly paced mess that had characters with no character arch and were badly. I didnt either like that movie was made to be one big scavenger hunt with no consequences and destruction of the stakes and achievements of the original trilogy. Sparkles of Nostalgia were not merely enough to  save this. To be fair it wasnt easiest job to pick up the pieces of the destruction that the Last Jedi caused, but in many cases this movie just made it worse."
"Oct 15, 2020",neutral,"I mean, it's decent, not an abomination like Last Jedi, but they didn't do the one things fans wanted, Anakin as a force ghost, the voice wasn't enough."
"Oct 14, 2020",negative,"Poorly written, incoherent, schizophrenic and trashes decades of Star Wars lore. 
A dumpster fire of a movie that I wish had never been created."
"Oct 13, 2020",negative,"I sat through the movie and everything felt off, it took me a while to piece together why. yes, it's Star Wars. Yes, it has some amazing visuals but it's an overall flop. the writing and editing... offf, it's rotten.
a stunning lack of depth. shallow characters with little to no development and their motivations, in any meaningful way, are non-existent.
I'm baffled sometimes as how writers actually get their job. do they not need to interview or prove they can write?
Star Wars for me is only 6 episodes long."
"Oct 12, 2020",negative,"An absolute missed opportunity to perhaps to make this whole trilogy work and make sense unfortunately it's a mess, I don't blame JJ for everything, it seems a lot of issues we're forced rather than nice storytelling."
"Oct 11, 2020",negative,"This movie utilizes nostalgia well, has one or two really touching scenes, and has pacing fast enough so that the movie isn't boring - but the plot is non-sensical and the script is awful, the ending is pointless and redundant, and it does not add anything good to the franchise,"
"Oct 9, 2020",negative,shit that expels shit.
"Oct 9, 2020",positive,"Fue un término a esta trilogía que a mí parecer estuvo bien, obviamente el odio a este final a mí parecer viene del no complacer a los fan con sus teorías, si le buscan lógica a los acontecimientos si son creíbles y disfrutables, yo como fanático considero un buen final a esta trilogía y de hecho queda algún tema abierto para nuevas películas"
"Oct 7, 2020",positive,"The extreme lack of creativity in replacing a previously dead character compromises the experience in addition to taking all the credit from Luke and Darth Vader. Which is a shame, as the first half of the film is very cool, with good action scenes, and very entertaining. But overall, it's fun."
"Oct 5, 2020",positive,Best one of star wurs
"Oct 4, 2020",positive,A grand piece of art delivering a beautifully heart wrenching yet satisfying end to a great saga while preserving all of it's brilliant mannerisms that we have come to love from Star wars!!
"Oct 3, 2020",negative,"People that died obvious deaths are back to life, people can reach out and touch you from 1,000 miles away only by thinking about it, people can drain power from others like a Nintendo game but also can magically heal others by shear will...Disney and Abrams *do not have ideas*. This is a lazy rehasher's idea of brilliance."
"Sep 29, 2020",positive,After the hideous previous film this is a difficult climb from down the barrel. Not perfect at all but less annoying than expected.
"Sep 29, 2020",neutral,"Kinda weird. Also this whole ""resurrection"" of Palpatine is far-fetched."
"Sep 28, 2020",positive,"Yes, this movie has plot holes and conveniences. Yes, it's really unimaginative in areas (TLJ and TFA weren't imaginative as well though tbh so I don't get that criticism) but I thought this was a really satisfying end to the Star Wars saga. The acting is obviously impressive with Driver, Ridley and McDiarmid being standouts, the visual effects and sound design is amazing, the score (despite being the weakest of the 9 movies) is still great, I love the interactions with Rey, Poe and Finn, I love Rey's struggle with the dark side and contrary to popular belief, I liked Rey as a Palpatine and it tied well with her struggle of the dark. Kylo Ren's struggle with the light is also cool and his reunion with Han is beautiful, Leia was implemented much more than I thought even though Carrie Fisher sadly died and her death scene was really emotional, the hearing of the Jedi voices was incredible and the action sequences are phenomneal, particularly the final battle and lightsaber duel. It's just an entertaining time and I like all the callbacks to previous movies. It truly feels like an emotional finale.

There's things I didn't like though. Finn is given such little to do, the knights of Ren are sadly wasted, Palpatine coming back is really lazy (but since I love the character it didn't bother me too much) and the story is quite predictable and safe but I don't care what any of the haters say. This is an incredible movie and as someone who despised The Last Jedi, it was a joy seeing this movie shit on it. (A-)"
"Sep 28, 2020",negative,"?
The pacing is terrible at it feels like the mantra of the director was ""let's throw in everything plus a kitchen sink"", even if it makes little sense. 
Absolutely delirious film that is a plot device in itself.

The worst Star Wars Film by a hefty margin."
"Sep 26, 2020",negative,"Lazy and unoriginal, a huge disappointment to an otherwise promising trilogy"
"Sep 25, 2020",positive,"It was great to go back to movies and see this movie.  My first Star Wars move was return of the Jedi in 2nd grade. My son (21 yo) wanted to see it too.  It was great time and still
A great movie. !!!"
"Sep 24, 2020",negative,"Different characters, different scenes, but story line and plot similar to the ""originals"".
Fairly disappointed."
"Sep 23, 2020",negative,"It was balanced, but failed to provide the originality, that the two previous trilogies, have given us. Disney should have been more avant-gardist rather than being fan pleasing."
"Sep 23, 2020",negative,The viewing left me disenfranchised
"Sep 22, 2020",negative,"A most offencive action agaist Star Wars Fandom, an affront to our inteligence."
"Sep 22, 2020",positive,"THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS 



Ok so let's get this started I'm going to be up front with you all this was one of my most anticipated movies of the year as I enjoyed the last two yes I enjoyed the last Jedi unlike a lot of other people.

I thought it was a interesting direction and cinematically  Beautiful like force awakens  however I am extremely mixed on this movie there was a lot I liked and a lot I didn't

I'll start with the positive great performances all around the film is shot and effects and are all beautiful and the story has some good elements like theirs a scene in which force healing is used to heal a light saber wound and there's a scene where ray is seeing something and here's the voice of all the Jedi and the light sabre battles are outstanding 

Amongst many other cool things like mental force battles  the films comes across to me as somewhat satisfying and other parts of it not so much 

The film kinda drags itself out in places what I assumed would be an epic end light sabre battle was not and much shorter than I expected.

The emperors return was not as explained as I would like as good as it was To see one of the most iconic characters back I expected more behind it some characters conclusion like huxnfelt so rushed to get it over with. 

Over all it's a well made film with great performances Battles and effects and maybe would of worked somewhat better as a second part to a middle instalment If you take away the last half hour as opposed to the final of a saga consisting of 8 main films and 2 spin offs

Now it's not secret Star Wars has a ridiculous toxic fan base that never seem to be satisfied and that made its way in to this movie

it's fells more like a fan made  thing as opposed doing it's own thing fans were annoyed to hell by how similar the force awakens was to a new hope and hated rains direction because it didn't meet their fan theory's of finding out who rays parents were amongs other things or some that liked the idea of Raylo and or kylo redemption


 this film drivers on those front so much so it's nothing but a fan service conclusion however they stil leaves me with no doubt that fans will stil complain about something I simply expected a lot more as a final entry"
"Sep 22, 2020",positive,"Lots of nostalgia and tying up of loose plot threads. Kind of a popcorn movie, but a really fun finale to the Skywalker Saga."
"Sep 21, 2020",negative,"It was so bad I literally thought it was a joke, You can spend years talking about how bad this movie is and not even discuss the whole thing."
"Sep 21, 2020",negative,"You know, I didn't see this in theaters, I haven't bought the DVD/Blu-Ray, and I don't have Disney+. I didn't really want to see how Disney would f*ck up the lore anymore.

So, last night, me and some friends decided to see it through another friends Disney+ account.

God, this movie isn't very good. The pacing is all over, the lore is broken here and there, Deus Ex Machinas, irrelevant characters, irrelevant plot-points, leaps of faith in terms of the fanbase, and of course, the ending.
I won't spoil anything, but I don't like this... 
It's a bad movie, but it's not horrible. I watched it all the way through, without wanting to walk away, or turn it off, so it gets points for that."
"Sep 20, 2020",positive,One of the best films of all time a great end to the saga which I hope comes back and am sad is over but it was amazing. Those critic reviews are idiots and have brains the size of an ant
"Sep 20, 2020",neutral,"I mean, after the mess that was TLJ its pretty hard to make a movie after that so it wasn't too terrible. Bringing back Palpatine and making him Rey's grandfather is just lazy writing."
"Sep 20, 2020",negative,Poorly written movie made to milk out the last juice the Star Wars franchise had to offer.
"Sep 19, 2020",negative,disappointing ending to a mediocre reboot
"Sep 19, 2020",negative,"What a pice of crap. I Honestly can't not watch any of these movies any more. I am going back to watching the OT. Like if you said, I will pay you 1 Million dollars to re watch this stuff, i honestly do not think i could."
"Sep 19, 2020",positive,"I don't know why people hate this movie but from me this is amazing movie! And also from me the story is good, The visual effects is Epic, and the ending is perfect."
"Sep 18, 2020",neutral,"I never got the whole Star Wars thing. After this movie I still don't. And what's more, I don't understand the controversy surrounding the last three movies."
"Sep 18, 2020",positive,"Im not a Star Wars junkie, but I thought this movie was a lot of fun."
"Sep 18, 2020",negative,They had no idea what story they were telling. Just quick! Try and slap something together so we can finish this thing off and get as much cash as possible before people figure out how hollow and shallow this thing is.
"Sep 17, 2020",positive,"A nice way to wind up the saga. Not too keen on some of the ""political correct"" stuff. But hey! That's hollywood."
"Sep 16, 2020",negative,"Train wreck.  Ruined everything good about Star Wars.  A non-existing, no relevance plot that took away from all the victories and sacrifices of the original trilogy characters.  How is it possible to ruin the best movie franchise of all time?!"
"Sep 15, 2020",negative,"Very random. (I'll be very vague)
Finn seemingly does nothing. Palpatine somehow has survived being tossed from a great height, the initial explosion and then the Death star being blown up. Characters are continuously believed to have died and then ah-ha! it was a trick! Cheaply brings them back a second later. And then there's Finn trying to tell Rey something all throughout the movie. Other characters mention it but it never got resolved. And then finally after all this time the ability to bring someone back from the death like Darth Plaguies the wise is seen. Yay! But it kills them?...?...?
If you have the memory span of 3 seconds, the plot might make sense. It's filled with plot holes, does not make sense Canonically and in my opinion a waste of time.
Now, if you're like me you'd have been so focused on the fast pacing that it seems only reasonably bad. Just wait. Sit back and wait. Think about it.
Enjoy."
"Sep 15, 2020",positive,Amazing! I thought that the last Jedi was good bury the first half was kinda boring but this so so good and lives up to the Star Wars name. Highly recommend watching.
"Sep 15, 2020",negative,"Let's start with the positives, some of the problems I had with The Last Jedi they did fix such as some of the characters being completely unlikable and the Last Jedi being slow. But there is one problem! It seems like J.J Abrams wanted to do the reverse of TLJ but went way too overboard in the process. There is no reason why Palpatine should be there as it makes Vader's death pointless, instead of the movie being slow it feels completely rushed, and a lot of the parts do not go together. Let me just say that I was a kid when the prequels came out and watched the original trilogy at an early age and as a kid I could understand why Luke had to find Yoda or why Anakin turned to the dark side. I'm in my 20s now and I don't understand some of the parts in the last two films. Also despite Kylo Ren and Finn being my two favorite characters in the sequel trilogy, they got very little screen time in both this and TLJ and I have no clue why. It's a two stars because it's not the worst movie ever made (keep in mind that The Star Wars Holiday Special exists), it's just a major disappointment for what is advertised as the end of a trilogy."
"Sep 15, 2020",negative,Not the best star wars movie but not the worst. Rogue one is the best new one. This one is second place to the worst one last jedi.
"Sep 15, 2020",positive,"I think this is the movie that we are all have been waiting for. It completes the sequel trilogy, opening the holes on why Rey has this starting powerful character or the other fans may say the Mary Sue character."
"Sep 15, 2020",negative,"None of the directors, writers, or producers of the sequel trilogy understand Star Wars in the least. There is no real consistency, and this film proves it."
"Sep 14, 2020",negative,"This movie got two stars from me for the visual effect alone. The rest is, imo, pure garbage that doesn't make sense, and worse, in many ways makes the previous Movies make less sense:o Especially when it comes to the force, what it is and what it can do:(

.close to following many other movie-goers out the door, but I felt like I had to see it through to have an opinion."
"Sep 14, 2020",positive,"Obviously not as good as the others, but entertaining and gives you chills and memories c:"
"Sep 14, 2020",positive,"Me encanta, con desacuerdos pero me gusto"
"Sep 13, 2020",negative,"While marginally better than 7 or 8, that isn't saying anything. The story is just as convoluted and still has some level of weird parallel motives to the original series movie, in this case 6. Doesn't work, just makes the already bad story more incoherent. Completely lacks any logic or realism no amount of suspension of disbelief can correct for. Everything in the story is only there, because the story demands it, not because it can be explained. Sometimes these are ridiculous ex machina moments one after the other, at other times all in-universe rules are suspended, even those just established, in order to make a scene or special effect. Still not good on that front either most of the time though."
"Sep 13, 2020",negative,Skip it. It's a cold shower for Star Wars enthusiasm.
"Sep 12, 2020",negative,Waste of time rey is overpowered and is better at handeling the force then every other jedi ever trained combined after just a short training is able to destroy palpatine without breaking a sweat while palpatine can use force lightning to destroy starfleets wgile when turning his full attention to rey it has the effect of a toy
"Sep 11, 2020",negative,"Difficult to follow, too many tired tropes.  Nothing about it made much sense.  It was like a series of video game fetch quests.  Not impressed."
"Sep 11, 2020",negative,Why can't I give zero stars? A half star is more than this movie deserves. Terrible. Sad they ruined the saga.
"Sep 10, 2020",negative,"It does feel like there was some effort in trying to fix this trilogy's plot, but it was simply not enough. This third movie should feel like a rush of excitement after two movies of epic build up. But it isn't, it has some good isolated plot ideas however, this movie simply does not bind the trilogy together. For example, there are some serious inconsistencies around the whole dyad in the force concept, versus what was first said in episode 8 about Rey and Kylo's connection. 

Star Wars continues to be cool in this last trilogy just because of the ""laser swords in space"" idea, other than that, this trilogy is just a mediocrely executed story with a nonsensical plot, which makes it frustrating to watch."
"Sep 10, 2020",positive,Meh. characters are all boring apart from Finn who got very little screen time.
"Sep 10, 2020",negative,This movie was a mess
"Sep 10, 2020",negative,"This was a mess. Shows no planning and no ability of execution even at a rudimentary level of story telling. The best way to watch these sequel films has become to take them in ironically. Who is this audience that likes this nonsense? Seems they all
Have the same
Comments too. Lol."
"Sep 10, 2020",negative,"Too much fan service, unoriginal music, and an extreme oversaturation of Emperor Palpatine. There is too much emptiness and flair here."
"Sep 9, 2020",negative,Made the Skywalker story completely irrelevant... way to go Disney!
"Sep 9, 2020",positive,"Tons of money does resulted in great CGI and quite entertaining screenplay. However, the story is full of holes with the main character wearing full armor all the way through."
"Sep 9, 2020",negative,"Shame on you Disney, shame 😕"
"Sep 8, 2020",negative,"Urgh, so so so many clichés! So many inconsistencies. The Ren mask, the joke about it. The death or Leia, The scene with Lando and Janna. I'd love to put the blame on Disney but the Star Wars stories aren't bad at all but 7-8-9 was just a bad idea."
"Sep 8, 2020",negative,"It's a spineless animal, it's a paragraph where every sentence starts with ""then"", it's a ungratifying conclusion, and it's mind-numbingly boring. With all its emptiness and nonsense left and right happenings, The Rise of Skywalker is a frustratingly stale film where an epic conclusion was promised, and will likely not go down as the satisfying finale forty years in the making."
"Sep 7, 2020",negative,"I can't give this movie a passing grade. It was the first time I had left a theater legit angry. There are a lot of very cool visuals in the movie, but from what was set up in the previous 8 films this movie made absolutely 0 sense. The problem with Disney making the Star Wars movie is they keep trying to make everything ""bigger"". Make the force powers more powerful. Make the emperor be able to blow entire fleets up with his hands. Some people will absolutely love it, because it is a very cool looking. But they are sacrificing story for visuals. 

I felt this, and the previous movie ""The Last Jedi"", completely forgot to develop characters of Poe, and Finn. What the series was trying to do was recreate the magic of the ""Big 3"" from the original series (Luke, Leia, and Han) and also give each of the original Big 3 their own send out. It just landed flat in my eyes. But I do give credit to the actors, they all were incredibly good, but my problem comes with the script. This movie felt like a course correction from ""The Last Jedi"". 5/10"
"Sep 7, 2020",negative,This is a joke for the fan is orrible movie
"Sep 6, 2020",positive,"Guy, I don't understand the criticism, so many people didn't like the movie! He's GREAT and incredibly epic. One of the best movies I've ever seen"
"Sep 6, 2020",neutral,After the let down of the last one... This is amazing. Although I saw it on it's release I forgot about and haven't wanted to rewatch.  It was a scramble to get the fans back. It's Star wars so I liked it
"Sep 6, 2020",positive,the action was good but the plot could have been better
"Sep 5, 2020",negative,"It's September 2020 and I'm still not over how bad this movie was. As something that was marketed as the finale to the entire Skywalker saga this did not succeed in that promise. There were so many things from a story and character perspective that just did not make any sense and it's a real shame how rush this felt. Even the editing seemed off among other things. 

What held promise as a story that showed that anybody even a nobody could become a Jedi, we once again get hit with the fact that yes your bloodline matters and is the only way you'll be of any importance. Being attached to an important bloodline is the only acceptable way to explain how you can be so powerful rather than just the fact that you are. 

This movie catered to the worst desires of the toxic side of the fandom of the Original Trilogy dudebros and you cannot convince me otherwise."
"Sep 5, 2020",negative,"A joke of a movie, like the whole Disney trilogy. The movie is not just poorly written, it actually manages to ruin the OT and the PT entirely. Absolutely no respect for the work of George Lucas."
"Sep 5, 2020",negative,"Es una película muy buena visualmente hablando, pero su trama es un desastre y el final, decepcionante."
"Sep 5, 2020",negative,A total disappointment to the end of what turned out to be a very average story
"Sep 5, 2020",negative,Palpatine coming back to life? Really? Couldn't come up with something better? No creativity or passion went into these last three films. Highly disappointed.
"Sep 4, 2020",negative,"I would insult whoever was guilty of this crime against something so beloved for millions of people, but after several months of its release I could only feel disappointed and sad, they destroyed something we loved for selfish reasons. Don´t be fooled by their reach to nostalgia with old characters, vibrant explosions, or of a conclusion to the sequel of the original trilogy. We deserved something much better, the actors deserved much better, the saga deserved much better, old and new fans deserved much better. 
So this is how Star Wars dies... with thunderous applause."
"Sep 3, 2020",neutral,"Meh, the movies was not good.
If you watched every other Star Wars movie, you can understand that this movie makes absolutely no sense.
There are lots of things that are terrible, but these are the worst...

*SPOILERS ALERT!*

1. PALPATINE WANTS TO DIE?
In the Revenge Of The Sith, we know the Palpatine is The Sith with the goal of living forever. 
He spent decades and decades to find a way to live forever, but, in this movie, he makes something that is totally opposite... He wants Rey to KILL HIM so she can become empress and all the Sith will live in her, blah blah. That is NOT what the original idea of Emperor Palpatine is. NOT.

2. FORCE HEALING?!?
Of all the things in the franchise, I think the idea of healing through the Force is the worst thing ever. Jesus, how illogical it is.
Let's go to the Revenge Of The Sith once again. 
Anakin Skywalker is having nightmares showing his wife, Padme, dying during the childbirth which makes Anakin turn to the dark side.
Well, with the Rise Of Skywalker's logic, Anakin could simply remain Jedi and be Padme during the childbirth, and, if something goes wrong, he could simply put his hand on her and revive her. 
That's absolutely not cool. It makes no sense, looking at the prequels.

3. REYLO?
I know that there are lots of people who are Rey and Kylo Ren shippers.
But, it also makes no sense. Kylo Ren is a murderer who killed his father and also almost killed his mother. He was also about to kill Rey. 
And, Rey fell in love with him? With a murderer?

4. LEIA'S DEATH FOR NO REASON?
Yeah, this is one of the worst things in the movie. Why did Leia die? No one even touched her, she was not too old, she wasn't ill?
So, when Rey stabbed Kylo in his belly, Leia said 'Beennn' and died. For what? Why?

Of course, Rey calling herself 'Skywalker' and burying Anakin's lightsaber in the sand are also some of the worst things in the movie."
"Sep 2, 2020",positive,"I love the fast paced action in this movie. The nostalgia was great, and really is one of my favorite star wars movies"
"Sep 2, 2020",positive,"Overall good conclusion with lots of fan service. Did its best to reorient the trilogy after The Last Jedi, however the lack of a cohesive, well thought out story for the sequel trilogy hampered this film's ability to excel. Given the vast irrelevance of the second film in the trilogy, this film could have done with taking more time to explain some plot points. Nonetheless excellent acting, special effects, music, and pretty solid plot and characters make this entry in the Skywalker saga likely to satisfy fan's expectations, but not exceed them."
"Sep 1, 2020",positive,"I’m not mad I’m just sort of disappointed... I have some problems with this. I didn’t like how Palpatine was even in this movie, it felt more like oh here you go here’s a character you remember and he’s back even though it makes 0 sense. What made it worse was Palpatine being Rey’s grandfather... like I’m sorry that took me out, I don’t need everyone in the Star Wars universe to relate to each other if it makes no sense to the overall plot. Rey from knowhere is better than Rey Palpatine, you didn’t have to relate her. She had her own arc throughout these movies!! Now the movie does have a lot of great moments but also moments that feel recycled from other movies... I’m sorry but the final battle is literally a copy of the main climax sequence from Avengers: Endgame and it’s rough that the same studio (Disney) just let both Marvel and Star Wars recycle that same emotionally impactful moment but like it didn’t do much to me and Marvel did it better. This movie felt like an obligation after the fan outcry from The Last Jedi, they tried to make up the arc and fix certain things that just didn’t feel cohesive throughout the trilogy. This trilogy was not planned properly, instead of making one cohesive story throughout three movies, it just felt like they created the script for each one based off opinions on Twitter and that kinda sucked. Now the kiss between Kylo and Rey took me out of the movie completely, that was so cringe. Now the movie itself was fun even though a lot of elements took me out of the movie. Is it a bad movie? No it isn’t a bad movie at all but I felt like I could’ve rated this higher if the plot elements were more cohesive. Lea’s death didn’t feel earned or emotionally impactful enough although I do understand they didn’t have much to work with given the death of Carrie :( but it just felt like they tried to undo everything from The Last Jedi and ultimately it just didn’t feel planned out at all. The genuine conclusion was fine though I just didn’t like the pacing and the overall writing in this for the most part. They needed one cohesive story across 3 movies, not adjusting everything based off of fan backlash. The Jedi “be with me” moment was the best part of the whole movie and it felt like Endgame planted that scene in Disney’s head with the avengers coming out of the portals... something just felt very off about this movie to me, but it isn’t bad (3/5)"
"Aug 31, 2020",positive,"Fck lazy writing. Meter plot twists/finales trágicos para personajes que se merecen arcos narrativos completos es la definición de lazy writing y de chantaje emocional; ojalá que las nuevas generaciones de guionistas sepan distanciarse de esta cosa espantosa que Hollywood está tan empeñada en meter a la fuerza en sus películas y series, arruinando la experiencia de los espectadores sólo para ?? para qué??
Leí que van a hacer un director's cut nuevo con Lucas y Spielberg, y la verdad que ojalá, así le dan un poco del feeling y aesthetic de la trilogía original. Que metan un poco de mano en Marvel, ya que está, que sus guionistas hicieron... básicamente lo mismo que los de esta película."
"Aug 31, 2020",negative,"( Warning this movie contains massive spoilers) This movie sucks, I'm not going to sugar coat it but it flat out sucks. Yes it has some good moments but you should if reading this just watch the movie for yourself. Because many people will probably like this movie but for me I officially hate Star Wars. Last Jedi sucks and now rise of Rey skywalker sucks. I can't with Star Wars and this movie made no sense and was all over the place."
"Aug 30, 2020",positive,"Was it a good movie , sequel , and a great end to the skywalker saga ? I say YES , ABSOLUTELY YES . however many people critic it for some things they dont like in the movie , but i understand because i felt the same . Example , the story is too fast , but i get that , Lucas have lots of things to show . He could easily lengthen the movie to 3 hours , which is okay because we all love a star wars movie that is long . We want to enjoy the story . But past is the past , and i will say it again .. YES ABSOLUTELY YES !"
"Aug 30, 2020",positive,Yeah i could say that I don't know what if they did good
"Aug 30, 2020",negative,Absolute garbage that destroys the original SW universe furthermore.
"Aug 30, 2020",positive,Fantastic ending to the Skywalker Saga.
"Aug 30, 2020",positive,This was like a bad idea for the mess tlj was. The series has been severely damaged. I'd give it less of a score but there was an attempt to fix the disaster that was tlj.
"Aug 29, 2020",negative,"Too much movie rolled into too short a time, and feels disjointed (perhaps because of the previous unmentionable mess in the saga). Lots of plot inconsistencies to finish off frankly the most disappointing of the Star Wars trilogies. I left wishing that maybe Disney had tackled subplots in Star Wars (like rogue one) first before taking on the sequel to the original and frankly excellent (in my opinion) trilogy , so they could have laid out a coherent plan for the last three movies, perhaps producing something that at least felt like a trilogy which developed its plots and characters. It would have been nice to see some service in developing its heroines, heros and villains so we could identify with them in some way. Instead they come off as wooden and even the characters from the original movies feel unrealistic, off their arc and thrown in purely for fan service. Not sure how Disney is going to make a comeback after this"
"Aug 29, 2020",negative,"the worst star wars movie ever, disney just ruined whole star wars, so much potential wasted, so much money wasted, star wars was better without it"
"Aug 29, 2020",negative,"Péssimo, para mim que sou fã da saga, imaginei que o filme pudesse me dar a sensação do novo, mas fizeram uma trilogia que e a cópia da antiga trilogia de 1979, fin personagem totalmente aleatório e desfalcado e sem sentido, pool uma imitação barata de Han solo, a Rey eu gostei dela seria o único personagem de toda a saga que eu salvaria."
"Aug 27, 2020",neutral,So full of cliche and poorly paced. Like The Hobbit in space 
"Aug 27, 2020",positive,"I really enjoyed the Kylo Ren movies, although I think they were lacking some general plot development.  This movie was probably the best one of the lot. Things were happening the entire movie, no downtime, so no time to get bored. The pointless characters are glossed over quickly and most of the movie sticks with the main players. Rey and Kylo Ren exchange life force (calling the force baby that's coming in the sequel!!) and beat up an old man. It's good stuff!!! 

Some things to look forward to: lots of ghosts, Rey randomly changes her name, Kylo Ren randomly changes HIS name, they pull a random villain out of a hat so there's someone to kill at the end, and there's plenty of fighting in a variety of locations. Kylo Ren keeps Darth Vader's head on his spaceship, possibly in his bedroom. Rey has magical healing powers. They fight in a cool shipwreck that's still in the ocean.  And of course there is a space battle at the end! 8 stars for constant action and magical spirit bonds, minus 3 stars for not explaining who the old man is or ever bringing him up in the other movies."
"Aug 27, 2020",positive,"JJ did his best of what he had, a bit of a mess but there could have been worse endings."
"Aug 26, 2020",positive,"This was a great conclusion to the best movie series of all time. It was truly epic and a major improvement over ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"". Great film."
"Aug 25, 2020",negative,"""A Band-aid for a huge open wound"". Disappointing, upside down, full of nonsense, simply...Heartbreaking for the true Star Wars fans out there."
"Aug 25, 2020",negative,"When a movie's climax evokes a feeling of ""What? That's it?"", you know something went really wrong. To be clear, I enjoyed The Force Awakens at the time, and disliked The Last Jedi. The quarrel between J.J and Rian Johnson fans has nothing to do with my dislike of Rise of Skywalker.

The entire movie felt like I was watching a summary. Everything was rushed through, scenes and choices that should have had time to develop were rushed along with contrivances just to keep us moving from one set to the next. Palpatine returns, but is criminally wasted. To this day, I don't understand what the point of bringing him back was, just to die effortlessly.

This movie suffers from the same problems as the other movies: there's only the barest of continuity, and very little opportunity for the characters to develop and grow. The entire structure of this movie felt like a fanfiction: from rushed narrative, to having the producer's new, totally original character take down the big bad of a previous story. Months of frantic work and reshoots, and this was the best that Lucasfilm could come up with. Utterly disappointing."
"Aug 25, 2020",positive,Very satisfying addition to Star Wars series.
"Aug 22, 2020",negative,"things happen without explaination and often for no apparent reasons, other than the plot to happen, bending all logic with force... well, at least it looks and sounds nice..."
"Aug 22, 2020",neutral,"it has a bad premise and the action is too similar too similar to Avengers Endgame, but the performances are good and the cgi  is still solid."
"Aug 21, 2020",positive,"Amazing movie! Especially the end where Rey says 'And I am all of the Jedi.' First of all, it gives you Avengers: Endgame vibes and second it is just such an epic moment The reason why its 4.5 stars, not 5 is because of the title. I really did not like how Rey just named her self skywalker and because that scene is all the way at the end, audiences don't know what they mean by 'Rise of Skywalker.' I would prefer a name like 'The Endgame' or 'Fall of The Order.' But overall a great end to the saga!"
"Aug 21, 2020",negative,"Pretty awful as star wars movies go.  Plot holes, a lot of story having to fix plot holes from the last one. Some where in this muddled mess of the film there is a kernel of a good story but poor execution and deux ex machina liberally sprinkled everywhere breaks the movie.  Waste of talent as the acting was pretty good with the pretty shoddy material they had."
"Aug 20, 2020",negative,Terrible conclusion to what was a shocking trilogy of films
"Aug 19, 2020",positive,"Pretty fun, classic ""star wars"" entertainment.  Didn't have the guts to take the kinds of risks that the Last Jedi took, but still an entertaining, well made movie that delivered a solid space adventure romp :)"
"Aug 18, 2020",negative,"Not a good moving as CPG gray said ""Its like drinking water when your not thirsty"""
"Aug 18, 2020",positive,"Loved it! Tell George Lucas to keep his hands off Star Wars, his dream was amazing he just doesn't have the talent to bring it to life."
"Aug 18, 2020",neutral,"Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is the most underwhelming Star Wars movie since Attack of the Clones, and just as predictable as Revenge of the Sith. Now before I go into ranting about all of this movie's issues I'll first state the good it has and what I liked about it. //1. Ben Solo is the only character in this movie that has a real arc. Finally turning to the good side and finally excepting who he is. 2. The pacing in this movie is surprisingly good. 3. The visual effects are still on the same level as TFA and TLJ. 4. The movie still manages to be enjoyable (despite all of its flaws) and had some cool scenes in it (like the desert scene with Rey flipping in the air and taking down Ben's ship).\\
Now here is all of the bad, the missed opportunities, and the why?
//1. First of all... Palpatine. Just why? The Last Jedi gave us some very deep and intriguing stuff to think about. These sequels are about creating something new and letting go of the past, so why did they even need to bring Palpatine back?
2. Nobody has an arc in this movie other than Ben Solo. Try and remember the arcs in this movie other than his, you can't. Everyone got an arc in The Last Jedi, EVEN ROSE GOT AN ARC IN THAT MOVIE AND EVERYONE HATES HER. But no one, not even Rey, learns anything or grows into a different person. Everyone stays the same. 
3. Leia's death is very rushed and doesn't make any sense. So she could use the force to fly through space in The Last Jedi but has to die in order to say one word to her son?? This is just one example of this movie being inconsistent with the rules that the previous movies set up. 
4. The Knights of Ren seem really cool. They look like real bad asses but we only see them in action in one scene and that's it. Hopefully we see more of them somewhere else but it was a huge opportunity that was sadly missed. 
5. There was just way too much humor in this movie. It seemed like every other line an actor says is trying to be funny or crack a witty joke and it's just too much. I know that in The Last Jedi there was also some unnecessary humor, but it's at least tamed compared to how much is in this movie. 
6. Poe and Finn's chemistry and entire relationship is just so weird in this movie. Poe is literally so caught up in Finn's business everywhere they go. In the other movies it was just a bro friendship that was fine and cool. But in this movie it's portraying them as if they are gay for each other. I know it sounds a little ridiculous but they just seemed off in this movie. It was also really cringe-worthy to see them on screen together. The lines that they say to each other are so cringe-worthy to hear and that actually goes back to the humor part that I thought was bad. 
7. The force rules in this movie are so freaking inconsistent and out of place that I don't even know what the rules are anymore. But it's really not only with this movie, it's with the prequels and in some parts of the sequels too. But anyway, my first question lies with Finn and Rey. In The Last Jedi, it is said that the force can basically be with anyone and everyone since Rey's parents were nobody and she is a pretty powerful jedi. Then they use that for Finn in this movie since he was able to locate Rey AND found out which ship had the signal at the end. But the movie also contradicts this by saying that Rey was a Palpatine, and by saying that Rey is a Palpatine it basically says that only Jedi/Sith can use the force. So which is it movie. Is the force with everyone or is it with Jedi/Sith only? Or do you have to have Midi-chlorians in your cells? My second question then lies with Ben Solo and Leia. First of all, Ben dies by turning into a ghost like a Jedi would... but I thought he was a Sith Lord with good intentions? The movie makes it seem like he was a Jedi all along but with bad intentions, but this is not him. And also why does Leia not turn into a ghost as soon as she dies? Why does she turn into a ghost only when Ben does? This makes absolutely no sense to me and this movie officially made me clueless on what the force is and its rules. 
8. Whatever Finn wanted to say to Rey is never answered and is actually hilarious that it never was answered, but not in a good way. 
9. This movie is basically anti The Last Jedi when it doesn't need to be. This movie could have been such an amazing and solid trilogy if it wasn't for the fear of the creators worrying about criticism from Star Wars fans because of The Last Jedi. The Last Jedi sets this movie up perfectly for whatever it wanted to be and it somehow manages to be underwhelming and unexciting. Apparently they had a completely different movie planned out which honestly looked nothing like this movie. In fact looking at the concept art for that movie, IT LOOKED SO FREAKING COOL AND SO MUCH BETTER. 
10. This is probably my biggest problem with the movie. This movie has no risks at all. Nobody dies and therefore it felt like there were no stakes. They took the Star Wars saying ""nobody is ever really gone"" too literally. It would have been really emotional and heartbreaking to see our old heroes and comic reliefs finally go but nope it's okay they're never gonna die don't worry guys. THIS IS THE FINALE OF THE SKYWALKER SAGA. This is the one movie out of the entire saga that should have taken the MOST risks. This caused the movie to be super underwhelming and overall... disappointing. \\
Honestly, if I had the power to redo any movie ever, I would choose this movie and then tell Lucasfilm to hire Colin Trevorrow to do his thing with HIS own srcipt. Just reading some of the things he had planned makes me so disappointed in what this movie could have been. Also the kiss in the end was so unneeded wtf."
"Aug 18, 2020",negative,"This was the worst movie I ever saw. I loved The Last Jedi. When I was watching this at the cinema I felt ashamed to be a SW fan. They took the criticism of the previous movie that came from the unappreciative haters and wanted to fix all of that was criticised. So this is nothing more than a mea culpa. Makes me want to vomit. Such a shame, cause Rey's journey was so inspiring, but it felt like they threw her character in the trash. The writing is awful. I haven't watched any Star Wars since I saw this."
"Aug 17, 2020",positive,The fact that there was no road map for this story is now 100% clear.
"Aug 16, 2020",negative,Absolutely terrible. The last scene of the movie is basically an insult to the whole Skywalker family.
"Aug 15, 2020",positive,"The visuals as usual for a Star Wars film are great.  There are a few moments where I even feel for Kylo Ren.  But unfortunately, the last couple of films, especially Last Jedi, has soured me on the whole plotline and cast.  My biggest emotional reactions were when cast members seemed to be dead and then came back and I was all like 'f***'.  I also feel bad for Abrams, who tried really hard to add fan service and stuff a serviceable plot line into the movie.  Unfortunately, after doinking around for two films, trying to wrap it up in one felt really rushed.  And the whole thing with the Emperor on the Sith world with a star destroyer fleet all lined up like Henderson Field & Battleship row felt forced and over the top, and a bit lacking in imagination.  Still, better than 'Last Jedi', where dreams go to die."
"Aug 13, 2020",negative,"I don't understand how so many people like this movie. Putting aside the massive plot holes, bland characters, and uncompelling story, this movie has utterly destroyed the Original Trilogy. Anakin didn't find the good within himself and kill the Emperor. Luke didn't succeed in freeing galaxy and ending the greatest evil in existence. No, the creditor that goes to Rey ""Skywalker"" Palpatine, the most bland protagonist we never wanted, a Marie Sue with no growth or development whatsoever, whose character ark could only be drawn with a disappearing ink. Palpatine never died, our hero's never succeeded, this movie has stolen away their growth and accomplishment. When I watch this movie, when I see what it does, I can't help but feel that they must absolutely hate this IP. This saga deserved so much better. I would give this movie negative stars if I could."
"Aug 11, 2020",positive,"Feel-good, deeply emotional end to the saga."
"Aug 10, 2020",negative,it's crap it's crap it's crap it's crap it's crap it's crap it's crap
"Aug 10, 2020",negative,"The movie is weak on its own, but as a conclusion to the trilogy and to the saga  it is just a shame. It is unimaginative and boring, nothing new. The desire of filmakers to play safe absolutely destroyed the potential of the sequels to bring smth worthy to star wars. The dialogues seem to be written by a 5-year old and the pacing is terrible. Bringing palpantine, jedi spirits and stupid reveal of rey's parentage all in the second part of the last movie makes tros an absolute mess."
"Aug 10, 2020",positive,Best Star Wars Movie
"Aug 9, 2020",negative,Cringy plot and sloppy storyline
"Aug 9, 2020",negative,"The main factor in this movie is ""luck"", they are going from A to B with luck and have luck to find old actor and have luck again... Killed someone...? No! lucky it was a different ship and so on. Worst was ""space horses"" on a spacecraft and NO, SHE IS NOT A SKYWALKER, SHE IS A PALPATINE. I hope they really decanonize these movies. They are not Canon for me and never will be."
"Aug 8, 2020",negative,It is trashhhhhhhhhh
"Aug 7, 2020",positive,There was really cool action and stunts that I liked this is a really good movie
"Aug 7, 2020",negative,"Back to safezone. The last jedi is the best starwar ever, Nothing new in this episode."
"Aug 7, 2020",negative,"Full of plot holes.  A Star Wars movie should be better.  From being a massive OT fan, I now have no interest in ever watching any Star Wars movies again. The end of a boring and unnecessary trilogy."
"Aug 6, 2020",positive,A fitting ending to a film franchise.
"Aug 5, 2020",positive,"Im a big starters fan
The movie lives up to the Starwars nam."
"Aug 4, 2020",negative,"I can't believe the score on this movie is so high. The story writing for the last chapter of the Skywalker Saga is so painfully bad. I don't blame Disney for wanting to erase these movies from the canon. This movie is only good for a few fleeting moments of fan service while you scream silently ""IS THIS THE BEST THEY COULD DO???"" internally."
"Aug 4, 2020",negative,Movie was so fast paced and didn't make sense. So many contradicting things when you take into account the other movies. Lots of plot conveniences and nonsense
"Aug 4, 2020",negative,No tiene consistencia con el resto de las películas. La trama avanza demasiado rápido y tiene muchos agujeros y sinsentidos.
"Aug 2, 2020",negative,"This is what you get when you don't plan a Trilogy and have to put it all together in one movie, a rush, sloppy mass"
"Aug 2, 2020",negative,A humiliating end to the Skywalker saga.
"Aug 2, 2020",negative,A humiliating end to the Skywalker saga.
"Aug 2, 2020",neutral,"I'm not against the new trilogy. I'm not. The Last Jedi is one of my favorite Star Wars movies, actually. But this movie bites off more than it can chew.  By a lot, actually. It adds twenty new unnecessary characters. Nothing in the final third feels earned. What you were allowed to say about The Last Jedi, that it evenly divided fans- you can't say about this one. I'd recommend it, nonetheless. The thing is- this is the kind of movie you have to form your own opinions about. If this review was Rotten all the way, I'd still recommend it. It's essential. It has a little out-of-place but funny humor, and a cool little Avengers moment."
"Aug 2, 2020",negative,This movie couldn't be anymore of a confusing mess if it tried. Wtf happened here?
"Aug 1, 2020",negative,Worst movie I haver ever seen with a lot of cliché and useless especial effects. No sense in all the movie and the new saga.
"Aug 1, 2020",positive,"The movie demonstrated multiple symbols that she conclusions to storylines that were played throughout the Star Wars Saga. The conclusion of the Star Wars saga could have been done in no better way. As a standalone film, this would not make much sense since the storylines are continued from the older films. When watched as the final episode in the saga, this film will make much more sense and bring tears to the eyes of true Star Wars fans. I 110% recommend concluding your Star Wars Marathon with this. It will definitely make it worth while!!!"
"Aug 1, 2020",positive,"Some might say this movie is too similar to other star wars movies. Some might say it's not imaginative enough. But I actually liked the movie. Yes, it was at times similar to older star wars movies, but to me, it had enough twists and surprises to also make it stand out from other movies."
"Jul 31, 2020",positive,"This final Star Wars episode  has a heavy load wrapping the whole saga up in feature length and unfortunately packs too much in to make this a thoroughly enjoyable sci-fi adventure; however, along its convoluted way, there are lots of sets of breathtaking visual appeal."
"Jul 31, 2020",negative,It's like the people doing this movie had no knowledge of the star wars saga. The only reason to see this mess is to learn how to not ruin a beloved and loved story. It's almost as if the creator knew that they where doing when they destroyed everything I loved with this horrible mess.
"Jul 31, 2020",positive,Much better attempt..
"Jul 31, 2020",negative,"La pelicula trato de compensar  TODO lo que la habían hecho sus peliculas predecesoras, pero no puedes arreglar algo que ya esta roto."
"Jul 31, 2020",positive,I loved The Rise of Skywalker but it seriously does not deserve a 51% rating it's better than both The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones.
"Jul 31, 2020",negative,"Huge fan of Star wars. This film was real bad, close to garbage. The story? The script? The lines? What were they thinking?! Level of 'HOPE' has become childish and a joke. Characters were still absolute shit. Hate... no... DESPISE what Disney has done to the franchise. The old era needs to return and fix what this has become. Glory to the Empire!"
"Jul 29, 2020",negative,"I'd rate this higher if it weren't part of a trilogy, let alone Star Wars. I don't expect every movie to be internally consistent. But this movie ignores the Last Jedi and the OT. It ignores itself half the time too; inserting something that happens with 0 pay off later. ""Let's add another thing, and never develop the ones we have.""

Oh and Palpatine returned because JJ cares more about spectacle than substance. I'm sad that we never got a sequel to the Last Jedi. I had fun because I'm able to look past failure and enjoy work where people put it in. The spectacle was fun, but it's definitely not what I wanted.

Why is this rated so high?"
"Jul 27, 2020",negative,The story of this movie is just extremely stupid and ridiculous. A real disgrace to the original trilogy.
"Jul 27, 2020",negative,This makes the prequels seem like the best saga ever
"Jul 26, 2020",negative,What a travesty! An incoherent and unintelligent mess.
"Jul 26, 2020",negative,"Disney must have paid to have positive reviews put on this site. You can make videos longer than the movie itself simply talking about the gigantic plot holes, awkward pacing, and terrible writing. It doesn't even main continuity with its own previous 2 movies. Only reason it got the extra half star was because of the visual effect."
"Jul 26, 2020",negative,"Complete crap. Story line was terrible. On a Star Wars bright side,  I loved The Mandalorian"
"Jul 26, 2020",positive,"I loved it until the lazy ending, so much potential wasted!"
"Jul 25, 2020",negative,"Of all the movies I've ever seen in my life, this is one of the worst.  It's just so bad. Words cannot describe.  86% viewer score, clearly does not include any bad reviews, this is top ten worst movies that made any money.  Straight garbage, I feel bad for every actor in this mistake"
"Jul 25, 2020",positive,"OK. This movie was nothing short of good but not great. After a bunch of forgettable films, The Rise of Skywalker is actually decent enough to give us a reason to care for characters like Rey and co. JJ Abrams and the writers for this film do do diligence giving us a backstory for the protagonist, while including some roots to the originals. The Saga is wrapped up in this film as it should be, but leaves somewhat of a long lasting sour taste in your mouth knowing how good these sequels should have been, yet how poorly they were executed."
"Jul 24, 2020",neutral,"It's been said that J.J. Abrams makes movies for the shareholders.  If that's the case, welcome to the board meeting to end all board meetings.  No one ever said that pleasing everyone would be easy, but with The Rise of Skywalker, the director pretty much nails it.  That is to say, this film --much ballyhooed as the Final Chapter in the nine-part, forty-two-year-running ""Skywalker Saga"" --  is, aside from everything else and the kitchen sink, an entirely, deliberately, innocuously, agreeable film.

As the galaxy reels from the realization that the thought-dead shriveled and perpetually cackling Sith Lord, Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid), is back and up to his old tricks, the chronically displaced heroine Rey (Daisy Ridley) is deep into her Jedi training on a new woodsy obstacle course planet.  Kylo Ren (the great Adam Driver), the new Supreme Leader of the First Order and evil son of Han Solo and Leia Organa, has set about looking for Palpatine, all the while also looking to continue his Dark Side seduction of Rey.  In the course of Disney's Star Wars ""sequel trilogy"", the downright weird relationship of these two characters has taken center stage.  It all comes to a glowing, lightsaber-clashing head with The Rise of Skywalker, with both Ridley and Driver giving this resolution their devoted all."
"Jul 24, 2020",negative,This is the first Star Wars movie that I was actually unable to sit all the way through in one go. It is a narrative clusterfumble and the pacing is terrible. Half of the movie is focused on retconning the last movie leaving no time to develop any sort of coherent plot and everything in this movie is supposed to take place within an arbitrary 16 hour timeframe? Give me a break.
"Jul 24, 2020",positive,"It may be flawed, but that doesn't mean it's not fun to watch."
"Jul 22, 2020",positive,Spectacular movie with the in-depth philosophy that can allow us to learn so many lessons applied for our profession and life.
"Jul 22, 2020",neutral,"Yes, I went ahead and ended up watching this after declaring the Star Wars franchise dead from the last entry which was complete shit. Maybe the best one of the new trilogy? Meh. Only because it wraps everything up in a not totally horrible way. There's still a lot of silly, stupid crap here, just not as much as in The Last Jedi. Rey flips around like a ninja turtle a lot in this, to the point where it's just damn comical. Same ol' final showdown between the two sides in a not so epic space battle like all the rest and with the same ol' predictable finish. There's other lame stuff that I can't be bothered to recall at the moment. So take this two and a half star rating with a grain of salt. At least there won't be any more new Star Wars for a while. Stop milking this cash cow Disney, it's done."
"Jul 22, 2020",neutral,"5/10 It's really, really, really bad.... Pity for all the hard work gone into the FX and the original world building..."
"Jul 22, 2020",negative,"A truly disappointing end to a franchise that had potential. 
This film is overstuffed with story arcs that should have been spread over two films or a longer 3 hours Star Wars epic. Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley are the only highlights in this movie."
"Jul 22, 2020",negative,This one was somehow even worse. I don't have the energy to get into it right now but my god can we go back to the prequel days please?
"Jul 21, 2020",negative,"Worst movie in the Skywalker saga by far. Takes a flamethrower to everything we loved about the originals, renders Kylo impotent, and makes Rey an overpowered Force demigod. Worst of all, it's entirely derivative, counting on fanservice and expensive CGI to win over fans, and to some extent, it worked."
"Jul 21, 2020",negative,Probably the worst mainstream movie in the last two decades
"Jul 20, 2020",negative,"This is an awful movie. Palpatine's return (without a doubt) makes it so that the victory at the end of Return of the Jedi and Vader's sacrifice were completely pointless. JJ Abrams has no imagination whatsoever. He couldn't think of anything better than bringing back the Emperor (really?). This movie is just a nonsensical plot surrounding Palpatine (we have to find the thing to find the thing to find Palpatine). It is so fast-paced, you don't have time to think and realize how stupid and nonsensical the plot is.  The ending is so over-the-top with a huge space battle and flashy special effects. Instead of making you feel excited or emotionally touched, the movie makes you feel exhausted and sick of Star Wars. Also, the fan service is way too much in this one.

I can only say a few positive things about the movie: The visuals and use of practical effects are great. The dynamic between Rey and Kylo Ren is good. It is a competent film regarding dialogue and acting. But story is a very important aspect to me when it comes to Star Wars movies. Not only does this movie have a messy plot, it ruins the story arc of the original six films.

 This movie disrespects George Lucas' legacy and the legacy of the original trilogy. It is a disappointing conclusion to the franchise."
"Jul 20, 2020",positive,"Fantastic, easily one of the best of the series. Almost a love story, but just as with Luke and Anakin it wasn't in the cards to last."
"Jul 20, 2020",negative,"This movie is beyond horrific, it doesn't even make sense. I've watched all the Star Wars movies and it doesn't even compare to the older ones. Please don't waste your time watching this movie! It's WORST than X-Men Dark Phoenix at least that's tolerable."
"Jul 19, 2020",negative,Very very very bad movie
"Jul 18, 2020",positive,The reboots were subpar and Disney botched the first couple of episodes.   This one finally put it all together and made it worth following along.   Well done
"Jul 18, 2020",negative,"If I could give this less stars, I would. It's been like 2 years and I still think about this movie with pure unfiltered rage in my heart."
"Jul 17, 2020",negative,"It was terrible at best. You don't need to be a long time SW fan to see the flaws: abuse of plot devices, plot holes, poor dialogs, inconsistent character development... There are problems in virtually every single scene, I have no idea how they managed to produce such a bad movie. 
Visuals are impressive, although I find the editing is often disturbing.
It pains me to be so negative about it, but it's just such a shame"
"Jul 17, 2020",negative,"Fast paced, frantic motion without an once of thought. The effects were good, individual shots were amazing, the story was a insane disjointed fetch quest, and the characters were wasted. Don't watch it if your going to think about it, but probably  fine if you just want to turn your brain off while you watch something pretty, if you don't have to pay for it."
"Jul 16, 2020",negative,I don't have much to say that's positive about this movie...   you wanna know if it'll entertain?   Disney and millions of bucks of JJ....  you'll get money's worth of entertainment but I can't guarantee you'll like it at every moment.
"Jul 16, 2020",negative,"A very disappointing finale to the well loved Star Wars saga. It's an absolute mess, listen to the critics."
"Jul 16, 2020",positive,"Everything here was either a huge hit, or a huge miss for me. Thankfully, though, it managed to entertain me, and even make me feel emotions. Though technically the weakest of the trilogy, I think that it works the exact same way as Return of the Jedi. If you just accept it on it's own term, it can be really fun, much like The Force Awakens."
"Jul 15, 2020",negative,"It pains me that this exists. Illogical, narrative mess. Every sin in cinema. 

Star Wars is a legendary franchise, but Disney made a movie so awful that's going to take several years to recover from."
"Jul 14, 2020",negative,"The cinematic equivalent of season 8 of GoT, a complete rushed mess. Attempts to wrap up way too many storylines and ends up being completely unsatisfying. A totally forgettable shambles."
"Jul 13, 2020",positive,"Not the best storytelling, but entertaining and sentimental if you enjoy the Star Wars saga."
"Jul 13, 2020",negative,"Last trilogy is even worse than 2nd trilogy of star wars in pretty much everything.
Episode 1 were made for little childrens and second were just a lot of cgi leaving history behind. 3rd episode were quite good Ill admit.
Original ones are masterpieces.
And then we have this trilogy...
Force awakens were pretty good. I even got really excited about all this new history and I couldn´t wait to see more but...
Ryan Jhonson made the worse SW movie I´ve ever seen. Destroyed the most iconic character of the franchise and with him a lot of the stablishment of what the force were what were it used for and pretty much everything related with the main plot of the 2 first storys....
I really hated the last Jedi. This one is a little bit better for me...
But has some big fails.
1st the force is not something u have as Jedi is something around u so makes not sense to absorb the force from another person and the life with it.
Since when can u teleport objects with force?
And all the fanservice with all those imperial ships worthless?
¿Who made them who pilot them if u need a device to get there?
noone in the whole universe realized all the materials and people working in such a big project?
The whole movie is a nonsense like riding horses over a destructor in the space with or without atmosphere...

So this is my ratting a 0."
"Jul 12, 2020",negative,I think there is only one way to move on. Rey has to wake up and realize this all was just a dream.
"Jul 12, 2020",positive,"Started with a vilain that wasn't one and was defeat on every occasion he was faced before , a underling message that confused and self righteous to the point of insult , an unlikable main character overbearing support character that undermined the journey of the mains characters , a wish to spit on everything that had any meaning before , a destruction of the balance and tension with : hero are moron -> can only be saved cause ennemy are weak / stupid and a creeping extension of the boundary the setting had set.
All of that granted the trilogie starting distrust and hate from of a big portion of the fans (me included) but they managed to somewhat turn that around (at least for me) which is an exploit in itself.

The film is not really good cinema that a given :  Scene that can be pretty obscure if you are not rationally putting them in context ; A tendency to over explain ; A tendency to use brutish approach where subtle one would have been better ; Not subtle reference; And the general pacing that is way to fast probably due to the work of ""repairing"" what was made in episode 2.
BUT and that a big but the film is trying so hard to please and deal with the hand that was dealt that it's commendable . 
It create a vilain when nothing was given , it try to give motivation to the main character than can progress in their story now that support character are not taking the screen , i would says that every criticism about how the story was not properly transmitted had an attempt to be addressed in this movie even if in a childish way. 
In the end they pushed Rey from a despicable character that annoyed me to no end by it's mere presence to a good ""meh she's okay"".

This is not a master piece ( FAR from it) but that still impressive ! 7.5/10"
"Jul 11, 2020",negative,"Movie of convenience. Answer to any problem along the way. The hero has zero burden and makes for laughable story. on a positive note, it is aesthetically pleasing. Last Jedi was awful, and this movie tries to work around it, but the end result is 2 1/2 hours of convenience and plot armor. "
"Jul 11, 2020",negative,Campy and repetitive. Any attempt at humor or decent dialogue missed the mark.
"Jul 11, 2020",negative,Slight improvement on the last car crash..... but not much. It feels rushed and incoherent and just a shambolic mess from what used to be a great franchise. It's sad to see the demise of Star Wars and this Disney trilogy has truly been atrocious from start to finish. This was a total cringe fest.
"Jul 11, 2020",negative,"Hat nichts mehr mit dem Star Wars zu tun, das wir kennen. Disney wollte nur noch bisschen Kohle scheffeln."
"Jul 11, 2020",negative,"wow what a waste of my time
This franchise has gone to the dogs or space horses..WTF"
"Jul 10, 2020",positive,"I am a huge fan of the Star Wars sequel trilogy, and I was not disappointed by this one. It has, what I felt was the perfect ending to the Skywalker saga, nicely wrapping up all the previous eight films into one, action-packed conclusion."
"Jul 10, 2020",positive,"Past the first 25 minutes, truly enjoyed it. 3/5 for uneven performance and disgustingly bad pacing in the first act."
"Jul 9, 2020",negative,"I thought that it was way too fast-paced. Nothing is really explained, and the Battle of Exegol was just weak. Everything's just confusing and there's a lot of plot convenience. What I would have liked to see would be that Rey dies and therefore Jedi die out. Not every saga needs a happy ending, and I think it would be appropriate for Star Wars because the Jedi have not always been amazing. Also, it would pretty much prevent the Sith from returning. So, yeah. What a disappointing end to an incredible saga."
"Jul 9, 2020",negative,"I don't even know where to begin. This movie was marketed as the last movie in the Skywalker Trilogy but ended up being a Palpatine movie that had NOTHING to do with the Skywalkers. Yes, Leia was in the movie, and I love that they kept her in the movie after she passed away, but what she said and did in this movie just made no sense. And even though I didn't like his character, the movie (and possibly this trilogy) was more about Kylo/Ben than anyone else. So if anything movie should have been the Rise of Solo with Rey taking on HIS name, not Luke's/Leia's name since neither really had much to do with her. Unless there's a book about Leia raising and training Rey that I haven't been forced to buy yet, so fill in all the missing story pieces..."
"Jul 9, 2020",negative,"Totally boring, I'm a Star Wars Fan and I just went on my tablet instead.  What I do find particularly frustrating in the new franchise is how no tension whatsoever is put into the lightsaber scenes.  It used to mean death or escape for one of the characters... they're out that much they're just glowing sticks now!"
"Jul 9, 2020",negative,Star Wars universe is completely dead. My condolences.
"Jul 9, 2020",negative,Fails at basic storytelling. Opens up more plot holes by reviving Palpatine and making him Rey's grandfather. How silly.
"Jul 8, 2020",negative,"I wanted to like this movie. I wanted to give it at least four stars. however, due to the quality of this horrific film, I find this the absolute WORST that the Star Wars franchise has to offer. the script is atrocious, the plot is laughable and shallow, and it treated the universe with no respect. the two GOOD things I can possibly think of are: Daisy Ridleys acting, and.. and..... I guess just daisy Ridley."
"Jul 8, 2020",positive,"Honestly there is no way to put the crazy Star Wars fanbase at ease. I fully believe this was a strong third act for the trilogy. However, this film does an awful job at tying up loose ends and unfinished plot lines. If only it had followed suit with The Last Jedi more closely. You should not make a trilogy that can be changed based on what the audience wants to see fully. This movie is full of fan-service and nods to the good ol' days. So many flaws but also so many expectations, you really can't hope to be made happy by this finale to The Star Wars Saga. Disney wanted something fresh but it seems as though it was rotten from the start."
"Jul 8, 2020",negative,If I had known how terrible the movie was and how it was going to leave me feeling I would have told my husband that we were going to see Jumanji The Next Level instead. At least I would have left the movie satisfied and excited for the next movie instead of feeling gutted and zero interest in future Star Wars projects.
"Jul 7, 2020",positive,"A fun movie that does the job, but some of the plot points are forced."
"Jul 6, 2020",negative,"I loved all of the actors... the story and the movie tho, omg what a piece of garbage. When ever something bad happens, it is undone a second later... i just wish it was shorter, no suspense at all.... to old for this I am."
"Jul 6, 2020",negative,This shouldn't be canon it is a total mess and good soldiers follow orders
"Jul 6, 2020",negative,Lixo acabou com a saga
"Jul 6, 2020",positive,Great movie that saves the ST from the abyss. Some decissions are doubtful but after TLJ this one was way more than could have been expected
"Jul 6, 2020",negative,"I waited a long time to see this movie because I was afraid of what I had heard. Those fears came true. It felt rushed, poor story, poor characters. One Star for the visuals. This felt like a money grab to me. As a star wars fan I am disappointed."
"Jul 5, 2020",negative,"The fact that they wasted the opportunity in this trilogy of having Leia, luke, Han, and Lando plus all the non human characters all together in the same scene will always break my heart. They never had an outline for the trilogy. This is movie is a mess created to make fans that disliked the last jedi happy. Studio heads shouldn't interfere with the creative decisions in a movie, THEY ARE NOT STORY TELLERS. It's movie made to fix problems in the previous 2 movies rather than to tell a great story."
"Jul 5, 2020",positive,"This might not be the best conclusion, not as great as Endgame, but all I can say that they put much effort to this with the characters and it was great to see Lando again, the last living character of the franchise."
"Jul 5, 2020",neutral,"Not as bad as the prequels, but it's close. There's great performance, but the movie feels unfocused. Should've stayed with one plot."
"Jul 4, 2020",negative,What a waste of the sequel trilogy. The third movie trying to give three movies a direction.
"Jul 4, 2020",negative,"The movies is filled with plot holes!
Palpatine being alive is dumb.
Rey naming herself a Skywalker is dumber.
And it totally makes Anakin (The real chosen one) seem like a leftoff from a more civilized age. The lucas age.
They should put Dave Filoni in charge so we would not get crap like this.
Ps: They have been flying since the clone wars."
"Jul 4, 2020",positive,Rise of Skywalker is a decent movie. Although it is not a great movie but I still like it better than the prequel trilogy. Where this movie came short was they tried to unwind everything in The Last Jedi and it felt too much like a fan service. Personally I liked The Last Jedi and I think Rise of Skywalker would have been much better.
"Jul 3, 2020",negative,the only good thing in the movie was oscar isaac as poe dameron :/
"Jul 3, 2020",negative,"That was SLOPPY. I waited to watch this one (the only Star Wars movie I haven't watched in theaters I might add) because I heard bad things. I wanted to let those bad things settle before I watched it. Come at it with a fresh perspective.  It didn't help. It was sloppy. Very lazy. It's a beautiful looking movie it just felt rushed. Lazy. Thing would just happen with little to no explanation. ""Hey heres this thing that you now have to accept as fact. Sorry no explanation for it or anything."" 

Rey felt more akin to a super mutant from the marvel universe than she did a Jedi. Speaking of Marvel.... anyone notice the blatant rip off of Avengers Endgame? The part where ""oh hey we are fighting this battle alone and losing.... oh wait just in the nick of time here comes everyone to save us and help us win."" Other movies have done that trope before Endgame but the way it was shot in this movie was almost a blatant rip off. Instead of super heroes coming out of Dr. Strange portals it was ships coming out of light speed jumps. 

Give me a break."
"Jul 3, 2020",negative,"After the disaster of the Last Jedi, JJ tried to mash up everything possible to save it- and failed misserably. Unfortunately it is just a horrible horrible chance wasted with this whole sequel trilogy."
"Jul 3, 2020",negative,"I waited a long time to watch this. I am a huge Star Wars fan but was a bit overwhelmed by the response to this film. I finally sat down and I think I gave it a fair chance. I really, really tried to keep an open mind but it just felt like every time I looked past some ridiculous new lore or detail that was stuffed in... another popped up. This movie was simply ridiculous. It would make more sense if this was its own stand alone trilogy separate from the rest of the Star Wars films as the whole Rey/Kylo storyline was really difficult to watch as someone who absorbed every bit of Star Wars media for most of my life. I might even like this trilogy a tiny bit if it wasn't called Star Wars at all. Episode VII was just okay. VIII made no sense but was just barely watchable. IX is just unforgivable. Extremely disappointing. I'm not sure if I am a Star Wars fan any more and seriously doubt I will ever spend any money on the franchise ever again. P.S. The 1 star is for Lando flying the Millennium Falcon. His presence and dialogue as he flew were the only part of this film which reminded me of Star Wars."
"Jul 3, 2020",negative,This was SO bad. Bad script. Bad plot. Poor character development.  Just skip it.
"Jul 2, 2020",positive,"Pretty good. An enjoyable mess, but definitely not the best Star Wars has to offer."
"Jul 2, 2020",positive,"Yes, this movie panders to Star Wars fans, yes it feels uneven; the pacing is often very rushed. I wasn't an overall fan of The Last Jedi, although I liked some of it. I think this movie beats the Prequel mess and Last Jedi by far.  We old folks who actually remember the thrill of seeing the first movies at the theater have to keep in mind that we DO have to let the past die, we have to pass the baton. Losing Leia in real life made things even more high stakes. JJ Abrams and Disney are NOT George Lucas and nobody can truly fill those shoes. However, JJ is extremely gifted and did his very best honoring Leia and dealing with 42 years of unbelievably world-changing source material that has sadly, been convoluted over the years. But who of us can say we, too, haven't (like Luke, Han, and even our beloved Princess Leia) become something far different than we hoped 42 years ago?"
"Jul 1, 2020",positive,"Given the fact the Last Jedi should've been a movie straight to Disney chanel how childish it was. JJ gave me hope and discard the trash he was left with, to create an amazing ending to the trilogy. "
"Jul 1, 2020",negative,"It's apparent that there was no plan for this trilogy. Was better than Last Jedi, but still awful. #NotMyStarWars"
"Jul 1, 2020",negative,"This movie left me feeling extremely disappointed. The entire trilogy had a ""make it up as we go along"" mindset around it, and therefore it is not surprising that this ending was so hectic and rushed. Many moments in this film contradicted those in the original films in a way that ruptured the flow of the 9 movies in this series. Various characters did not receive the endings that they deserved and incomplete story arcs left viewers hanging, which ultimately caused The Rise of Skywalker to be possibly the ""worst"" Star Wars movie to date."
"Jun 30, 2020",negative,"I actually liked the first two movies in the sequel trilogy, but this one is just bad all on its own. Some of the dialogue in this movie is so bad, Finn and Poe do almost nothing in this movie, the final battle is underwhelming, and Palpatine coming back to life was just idiotic. Overall, this movie was absolutely disappointing as both an ending to the sequel trilogy, and the so-called ""Skywalker Saga."""
"Jun 30, 2020",negative,"This is a terrible movie, so terrible that there is nothing to say, I can't understand that people like this shit! There is nothing good there, except the visual and everything, nothing else. A terrible script, terrible characters, a terrible production, and the actors in General did not try. And the problem is that this is the Canon of the star wars universe."
"Jun 29, 2020",positive,"The course correction from The Last Jedi was not as jarring as others make it seem, but pacing did have to compensate for lost time at the start. Scenes seemed purposeful and attempted to revive some Force Awakens threads, which were aggressively cut by the Last Jedi. Ben Solo and Rey were given their chances to shine, but Finn and Poe didn't have as much to do. They did not have very meaningful roles in The Last Jedi, either. Accordingly, Ben and Rey achieved more closure than Finn and Poe. I would have liked more force sensitive characters. Leia's force powers were given some very important context. Han returned for some closure. Overall this movie had an unnecessarily difficult task and it did a fairly decent job. I would appreciate a fan edit that trims the trilogy together. Much of The Last Jedi could be left out. The Last Jedi had some good ideas, but ultimately the dueling vision of Abrams and Johnson were just not compatible."
"Jun 29, 2020",negative,"The story didn't make any more sense than the rest of the new trilogy, and felt like a slap in the face as a Star Wars fan. Even ignoring the old Star Wars universe (which was declared non-canon by Disney), the plot broke it's own lore presented within this movie alone. Great visuals wasted on poor writing."
"Jun 29, 2020",positive,"The tricky thing with JJ Abrams is that he knows where to go, and never been influenced by the others"
"Jun 27, 2020",negative,"Without a doubt, this movie is a steaming pile of sh*t.  No story , no anything of any interest. How anyone making this film thought the script was worth the effort to commit to film is beyond me. I loved the OG trilogy, easily the worst of the 9 films. Can I have my money back."
"Jun 26, 2020",positive,"Great watch, will watch again, and can recommend.

Now, for the original fans of the space wizards, I can understand that this isn't their cup of tea anymore. The pacing of the originals was slow and dramatic with small things being revolutionary, and this lots and more to the same computer powered fast paced cinematic magic.

For everyone, the pacing is a little all over the place, and the importance of locations vary wildly. The movie itself is oddly long and rushed: almost they they were going to split it into multiple movies but decided it had to be one movie.

That all said, none of that particularly matters to me. We have great characters on an epic adventure against a indomitable foe with really good development (mostly). The actors all know their characters well, the effects are great and it looks good.

That said, the big climax is kind of nonsense: there is a sloppy reveal, a weak redemption, a SHODDY premise, and just an odd choice of final moments.

The 7-9 trilogy is definitely flawed, and it wouldn't be anything without 4-6 (probably fine without 1-3), but 7-9 is probably what I'm going to rewatch. And all those numbers show what this should be, a series, a series of movies, maybe, but there are a rich number of stories here that don't deserved to be rushed or forgotten."
"Jun 26, 2020",positive,Its really underrated and has amazing pace en vfx and sfx. My fav star wars movie
"Jun 26, 2020",negative,"A clusterf**k dumpster fire ending to a misguided, inhuman trainwreck that profanes one of the great cultural mythologies of our time."
"Jun 25, 2020",negative,"I'd honestly give this movie 1 star if it didn't have lightsaber sounds.  I literally laughed out loud the first time Kylo force called Rey and when the ""spy"" was killed and when Kylo threw his weapon into the ocean..

I mean, the movie looked really pretty and had a bunch of half-baked remakes of old scenes and there was plenty of Finn yelling random characters names but the movie just wasn't good other than the, objectively, incredible CGI... unfortunately the story telling was equally as objectively bad as the CGI was objectively good.  There just wasn't anything organic about how the movie came together; it was all contrived... 

...anywho.. 1 star movie but 1 extra star for lightsaber sounds."
"Jun 24, 2020",negative,"Terrible yet again, I really hope they re do these movies. I didn't even waste my money going to the theater this time"
"Jun 24, 2020",negative,"The Rise of Skywalker is a bloated and convoluted mess of a movie that should have never been released into theaters. JJ is not creative in any way shape or form, and gives us another copy of the OT. TFA was a copy of a new Hope, TLJ gave us something new, but JJ didn't know how to handle Kylo Ren being the main villain and instead he brought back a preexisting character who's deaths meaningful. There is nothing new or creative in this movie. 

This movie will satisfy a few types of people:
1 If you are a casual viewer who just wants to have fun
2. If you hate The Last Jedi and want everything set up in it to be undone
But if you care about a movie having  good story and character development and whatnot, you will hate it just as much as I did.

I'll only cover a few things because I don't want this to be too long.

I just want to start off by saying that this movie is only meant to satisfy fans who hated The Last Jedi. JJ refused to take on the challenge of making things that people didn't like in TLJ better, but instead he just undid everything and replaced it with something that will satisfy the man children who couldn't handle that TLJ did something they weren't expecting. People wanted Rey to be the descendant of some powerful force user, so now she is a Palatine. people wanted Rey, Finn and Poe to have more time together so the first half of the movie is wasted on them going on a video game adventure quest to find a map. People didn't like Rose, so she is written out. People don't like how a female told a man what to do in TLJ, so no more of that. This entire movie is just a retcon of The Last Jedi. It's a pile of fan service that is tied together through an awful story.

The editing in this movie is honestly embarrassing, and I'm sorry but the acting isn't great. there are so many moments where the characters react in the completely wrong way. It feels like the actors were reacting to something different, but then the editors didn't have a clip of the actors reacting to what they were supposed to be reacting to and they just through in another clip in which the characters say something vaguely similar to what they should have said and call it done. When they think Chewbacca explodes Finn says ""No"" in a way that you would hay if you had just lost the ball in a football game. He should have emotion because he thinks his friend just blew up and died, but nope.

The visuals are not creative. It's all stuff we've seen before and nothing new. In TLJ we got Crait where the surface was covered in salt and underneath was red. it was a beautiful and creative visual. This movie has nothing. We get another desert planet, a planet with houses that look like they could be on earth where it snows, a planet with grass and an ocean, and a planet that is just dark. Nothing is creative.

The first half of the film is fun to watch, but the pacing is horrible, it's wasting time that should have been spent covering the massive amount of ground they had to, and the plot is very generic and has nothing new to offer. The entire first half feels like something you would watch in a Star wars kids TV shows rather than the final movie in a franchise. 

Finn does nothing in this movie. In TFA he learns to be a loyal friend. In TLJ he learns to fight for a larger cause. In TROS he yells ""Rey"" a lot. He has no arc whatsoever. At the end he gets force powers as a plot convenience so he can tell them which ship is the main ship. It's ridiculous how he can tell you out of 500 Star Destroyers, which one is the main ship by using the Force, but on Pasano he can't use the force to tell the difference between two transports when somebody he loves is on one.

The second half of this movie is horrible. It's worse than anybody could imagine. I don't even know where to begin because it was so miserable and exhausting. First, Palpatine is back. JJ just undid Anakin's redemption. Anakin was turned to the dark side by Palpatine, then turned back to the light by Luke. To ensure that he was good again he gave his life to defeat palatine and destroy the dark. 

Rey being a Palatine is the single worst thing to happen in this movie. Rey being moody is important for a multitude of reasons. One, her counterpart is a Skywalker. He has this massive legacy he has to carry on his shoulders and he feels so much pressure and stress about it. Rey is the opposite. Her weakness is that she has no legacy, she has no lineage. Also, Rey being a nobody is a reminder that anybody can be with the force, you don't need to have a parent with the force because it can manifest in anybody. Then JJ retcons this by making Rey a Palpatine. 

I had fun watching the first half even though the pacing was awful and it was riddled with plot conveniences, plot holes, and retcons, but the second half is unforgivably bad. I'm shocked to my core that people actually enjoy this mess."
"Jun 24, 2020",negative,"This is embarrassingly bad, full of plot holes, non-existent character arcs, exposition. In what is possibly the greatest franchise of all time and with unlimited money available, it staggers belief that they've messed up the key basics of storytelling. The writer and director should be ashamed of themselves."
"Jun 24, 2020",negative,...lost for words on how bad this is
"Jun 24, 2020",positive,"Considering the mess he was left to deal with from episode 8, J.J. Abrams did a fantastic job in repairing the trilogy and in fact it was better than expected for me. I had serious doubts about the story after The Last Jedi ruined one of the great heros of cinema in Luke Skywalker. I've been a fan since 1977 and this is one of the strongest episodes made since the original trilogy. The Force is strong with this one!"
"Jun 23, 2020",positive,"It could be better, i defenitly loved it"
"Jun 23, 2020",negative,This is a great example of how to destroy a great story. How yo insult a 5 decade fan base. This movie is crap
"Jun 23, 2020",positive,"Lacks imagination. So many story lines going on, and such rapid changes, the whole thing is a dumpster-fire mess. Hard to have any emotional involvement in these characters. At one point, I feel like I'm rooting for the dark side to just consume this series and call it a day. George Lucas bottled lightening twice, and since then it's been uneventful. So another shoot-em-up sci-fi romp. Barely good enough to watch. Not good enough to care about."
"Jun 22, 2020",negative,Somehow worse than the last jedi
"Jun 22, 2020",negative,it was entertaining but it wasn't star wars
"Jun 22, 2020",negative,"The film is full of pointless MacGuffin hunting as well as contrived plot points. Overall, a poorly written film and a terrible ending to the saga"
"Jun 22, 2020",positive,i am surprised it's better than the last Jedi
"Jun 22, 2020",positive,"Considering the circumstances, JJ did an excellent job at creating a final installment for the Star Wars saga, and bringing it to a satisfying end."
"Jun 22, 2020",negative,"Wayyyyyyy better than the last Jedi, but still not a good Star Wars movie.  If you're a casual, it is a decent enough watch.  If you actually care about Star Wars, you can see how LAZYYYYY and below average this film was.  Again, it feels like the writers/ directors have never seen a star wars film.  Characters are very poorly developed (in all 3 movies, not necessarily this films fault) and there are scenes that are TOTALLY inconsistent w Star Wars canon.  But the ReyLo love/hate thing is decent enough for a casual watch."
"Jun 22, 2020",negative,"I'm a HUGE SW fan. This movie made no sense--the entire plot was cut and pasted together, with a nostalgic shout-out every 5 minutes. Oh wait, it's ANOTHER Death Star. The ending sucked too--poof, vanish, group hug--wtf is that?! The actors' performances--Ridley, Driver, Isaac, Boyega (even though they totally did Boyega's character a disservice)--are the only things that actually redeem the movie at all. Did Lucas--or even Filoni--look at this thing before it was released? Ugh."
"Jun 21, 2020",positive,"Another unimpressive movie in a long line of unimpressive movies. How are they in the precise position for the skyline to match so perfectly with the dagger... Why would Leia have to die just to communicate with her son using the force... Seriously, you're bringing Rei back to life after you just killed her 2 minutes ago?! Horrific writing. The only redeeming feature is the clear effort that the FX team put into this movie. They did 10 times to work the writers did, and where was the director? Did he not read the script? There's like a 100 holes in this plot. But go ahead and watch it, just so you can say to yourself that you're never gonna watch another StarWars movie for as long as you live after this."
"Jun 21, 2020",neutral,Mediocre is the best thing I can say about this movie.
"Jun 21, 2020",negative,"What is wrong with you people! This is nothing but a lazy, plot-hole filled, over the place, story lacking piece of shit.

This is genuinely the worse movie I've ever seen."
"Jun 20, 2020",positive,"This is inarguably the greatest film of all time. The beautiful ending to an amazing 42 year long saga. Don't believe any of the stupid critics saying this movie is bad. It's a masterpiece. Trust the audience scores, not the critics."
"Jun 20, 2020",negative,"Difficult to measure my disappointment with Rise: messy, convoluted plot with previously-unheard of characters popping in and out without impact or development, despite the script clearly expecting me to care (I didn't). The retconning of Last Jedi sticks out like a lightsaber in a dark room. Huge plot holes you could drive a Star Destroyer through - you know, the ones in an area of space nobody could get to, built by,... who, exactly?

Messy is the word I keep coming back to. So contrived and annoying that I just couldn't feel my way into it - every few minutes something pulled me out of the story by being overblown, under-developed or overly-complicated (often at the same time). And Hux?! SERIOUSLY we're meant to buy that??

Stars for Ian McDiarmid being generally wonderful again and the effects being predictably breathtaking in places. But it's not enough to save it. This is a poor film."
"Jun 20, 2020",positive,"The Rise of Skywalker is a mess, I would lay a lot of the blame on The Last Jedi. J.J Abrams did what he could but it isn't enough. I had a good time with Rise but its an awful end for the saga. The fact that Anakin Skywalker wasn't in this movie (except for small voice cameo) is just mind blowing. This film for me doesn't conclude the Skywalker saga but rather the disappointing sequel trilogy."
"Jun 20, 2020",negative,wow this movie really put the last nail in Star Wars coffin.
"Jun 20, 2020",positive,"A great conclusion to the best movie series ever! It was truly epic and a major improvement over ""The Last Jedi""."
"Jun 19, 2020",positive,This movie is amazing the old critics that keep reviewing new movies that they don't understand is chaos because some movies that they review they say are bad but are great like this one Rey as a person grows Finn is still amazing and this will always be one of the greatest star wars movies ever made  C3PO is still a great droid and they really show his sweet side in this star wars movie even though Disney kinda messed up with the first 2 this one comes back strong.
"Jun 19, 2020",neutral,"The expectation must have been too great.

I had seen some negative comments, so I was ready to accept a certain level of disappointment, yet I was still hoping. Enough to go see the film on the very first day it opened, both to satisfy my curiosity, and to prevent seeing some spoilery stuff on the web before seeing the film.

George Lucas' STAR WARS has been part of my genetic makeup as a film lover ever since I saw the original in the theaters in 1977 when I was 12 years old. I liked movies before, but this started a lifelong passion with cinema, first in science-fiction, and then, a much broader spectrum as I grew older. While I loved the first two STAR WARS movies, I was however never a fan of RETURN OF THE JEDI, and positively detested the prequels, which I have never dared to revisit after my initial viewing at the theater. Still I was excited yet cautious in 2015 when a concluding trilogy was brought forth by Disney.

It is an ambitious and scary endeavor; to find a satisfactory conclusion to a saga started 42 years ago. I can understand why director J.J. Abrams, who had earned a bad reputation with handling endings after his lackluster denouement to his popular series LOST, finds this task challenging. However, he has an undeniable talent with rebooting movie series like he demonstrated with MISSION IMPOSSIBLE III (almost strangled out of existence by the excesses of John Woo), STAR TREK, and of course STAR WARS: EPISODE VII - THE FORCE AWAKENS.

With STAR WARS: EPISODE IX - THE RISE OF SKYWALKER , Abrams creates a film that suffers the same faults that plagued FORCE AWAKENS; a desire to please the status quo that creates a succession of scenes that are strongly reminiscent of fan-favorites moments in the previous series, trying to capture the lightning of the original trilogy. While in THE FORCE AWAKENS, Abrams managed to circumvent that sense of déja vu with a strong cast that married adroitly members of the classic cast with charming new characters and a streamlined script by Lawrence Kasdan and Abrams himself that managed to make the audience care about those characters and their tribulations.

In RISE, however, we are assaulted with so much action that the characters have little much to do than react, and we are left in the end with the impression that the only ones who have a chance to emote or grow through the story are Rey (Daisy Ridley) and Kylo Ren (Adam Driver). They are in fact given the chance to stare at each other with intensity and duel many times in the film, in often gorgeous set-pieces. The conclusion of their complex relationship won't be a surprise to many, although the big reveal of Rey's origins may be. Surprising. Not great. Just surprising.

The score by John Williams is appropriately composed of a string of greatest hits, which is a pleasure to hear, but accentuates the sense of déja vu. The will to offer the fans ''what they want'' creates awkward moments when characters show up or situation occurs just for the sake of fan service. Such scenes end up being maudlin more than anything, with a floundering sense of false sentimentality. There are moments in the film manufactured to elicit an emotional response. And I am the perfect target for such moments. I am a complete crybaby at movies. I will get choked up and tear up extremely easily. Yet here, the only moment I did was at the very beginning of the film,  in anticipation as the lights went out and I felt a surge of excitement in the capacity crowd in the theater.

I am one of those who actually enjoyed the previous chapter, THE LAST JEDI, where I felt that director Rian Johnson took chances and went into very interesting directions, even putting in a bit of a political statement. After having watched Abrams' last effort, I have to confirm that Johnson's film was a much better film, and had stunningly emotional moments (Laura Dern's sacrifice, Mark Hamill's last moments) that finds no equal in this last installment.

Probably the most telling moment from the projection was the complete silence from the crowd as the end credits appeared onscreen (after probably my favorite scene of the film, which beautifully caps the series with a nostalgic twist). No applause, from a crowd that had shown great enthusiasm at the start of the showing. Just stunned silence.

Still, the film moves along briskly, and the special effects are impressive, but as a conclusion to a flawed, yet beloved saga, this final chapter fails sadly to actually ''rise'' to the occasion (pun shamefully and fully intended).

P.S.: is it just me or is the Force way more powerful in the new movies than in the past? Must be all that midichlorian in the water."
"Jun 18, 2020",positive,I am a huge fan of all the Star Wars movies. This one is no exception. I believe the storyline is great as well as the sound and visuals. Kept me excited from start to finish.
"Jun 18, 2020",positive,"The Rise of Skywalker was not what I expected for the last movie in the Star Wars Saga. It was not the best way to rap up the whole saga, but it was an excellent movie nonetheless. It had an Avengers: Endgame kind of twist to it and we got to see many old and new faces. The editing was superb and the producers put a lot of effort into certain scenes that made up the movie."
"Jun 18, 2020",negative,Horrible movie George Lucas said he flat out hate it this movie and the last Jedi Thanks Disney for buying a Amazing franchise And then ruining it!!! Disney you killed it Star Wars will never be the same!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Jun 18, 2020",positive,"Well, by far the best of the new trilogy despite gaping plot holes and new interpretations of how the force works. Good fun and worth a watch but my nerdier side did react to some of the scenes."
"Jun 18, 2020",negative,"El guionista/director de este millonario bodrio no ha tenido ningún interés en hilvanar nada: las escenas se suceden una a otra sin sentido, de forma ridículamente infantil a veces: como está más preocupado de los saltitos y las carreritas toda la trama se basa en porquesíes... bueno, ojalá fueran porquesíes, ya que cuando trata de explicar algo es de forma absolutamente ridícula.  Para ir de objeto en objeto hasta el enemigo final ya tenemos el videojuego de Zelda, y esta película no lo mejora. La estrella que le doy es por el conmovedor esfuerzo de los actores por tratar de sacar adelante semejante chapuza."
"Jun 17, 2020",positive,A must watch! Very impressed with J.J. Abrams work!
"Jun 17, 2020",positive,"Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker deserves some credit, and certainly more than The Force Awakens does. It has gripping fight scenes, some eerie moments, and many 
visually stunning frames; however, the plot was full of holes, there were scenes so dumb that I literally caught myself laughing out loud in the theater, and the premise of a doomsday device was one I had already seen in Star Wars three times before. Somehow, fourteen years and an entire trilogy after the last movie of the prequel series, we find ourselves in a universe that is relatively unchanged despite J. J. Abrams' additions."
"Jun 17, 2020",negative,"Upside of this movie - it is better than the totally abysmal The Last Jedi. But that really isn't hard, considering that The Last Jedi is among the worst movies I ever saw. That's the only good thing about The Rise of Skywalker for me, though, and surely doesn't mean that it is in any way good. The story totally makes no sense and is full of plotholes. The way they killed off Leia was even more stupid than how they killed off Luke in the previous movie. Apart from that, there was lots of action but little to no story. I doubt I will ever watch this movie again. I'd rather just watch the old movies and read some of the older novels. I know many fans didn't like the Expanded Universe much, but honestly, it was so much better than what Disney gave us in recent years. I really hope Disney doesn't do another Star Wars trilogy - they already ruined Star Wars enough - but I guess that is wishful thinking."
"Jun 17, 2020",positive,Meh. I expected more from JJ. We miss Lawrence Kasdan.
"Jun 16, 2020",negative,"This movie was beyond disappointing for me. It's as if its creator thinks we are too stupid to look past the cool flashing lights and images to see that there is absolutely no story, Its ""oh let's go look over here for this thing, then over here for this, then over here for this, now let's kill Rey's magic grandpa"". I am a huge fan of almost every star wars media ever put out but this movie and the two before are pure crap."
"Jun 16, 2020",negative,"Never seen so many ham-fisted moments. Had a laugh or two, but a majority of my time was spent rolling my eyes."
"Jun 16, 2020",positive,Rise Of Skywalker is the most Star Warsy Star Wars movie since Return of the Jedi. I guess not everybody is looking for that in a Star Wars movie based on critic reviews for Skywalker and the bewildering Last Jedi (I hated it). But this one checked all the right boxes for me. It's a tad convoluted but still a super fun trip through the galaxy that surprisingly elicited more emotions from me in the theater than any film I can recall in a long while. Yay Star Wars!
"Jun 15, 2020",negative,"What can I say that hasn't already been said? Really, it's just so sad to see what Disney has done to Star Wars. This movie was basically a joke to me. I saw it for free at a work party, so at least I didn't lose money, but I did lose time, which is move valuable. I missed the first 20 minutes or so (apparently they don't show previews when it's a rented out theater), and I found myself constantly checking my watch wondering how much longer the movie would run. I came in with the lowest of expectations after the train wreck that was the Last Jedi, and this movie showed me they hadn't been lowered nearly enough. That Kathleen Kennedy has a job still just shows that this world is not just."
"Jun 15, 2020",negative,"As I like to call it, The Rise of the Crystal Skullwalker, was the dumbest most grandiose betrayal of a film saga in history. The three prequels were better told as stories, which is really saying something. Dumb dumb dumb!"
"Jun 15, 2020",negative,This movie constantly trys to redeem the sequel trilogy but whenever it gets close it sacrifices story for a visual.  This also leads to lazy writing like when they claim the Holdo maneuver is one and a million while attempting to fix The Last Jedi's failures but backtracks and uses it at the end because it looks cool.  The ships not being able to leave the planet is also lazy writing due to the explanation being they don't know which way is up.  This lazy writing is mostly caused by the director's want for them to have more stakes then Return of the Jedi but he also wants there to be a way for the good guys to win.  This also causes him to drag in a giant fleet at the end with the explanation of Lando asked even though no one came to their aid when they needed help just a year earlier.  Ultimately this movie relies to much on fan service and cool visuals but fails to bring anything of substance to the table.
"Jun 14, 2020",negative,"It felt like a child wrote the ending based on things they remembered from other films. Didn't follow the last film and had so many plot holes in the film it was akin to lace. Also, the characters in the film's had relatively unexplained changes of heart."
"Jun 13, 2020",negative,"Bom, pela minha decepção com o Star Wars 8 eu nem fui no cinema ver este filme, muito pela baixa expectativa e pela ideia patética de trazer o Palpatine de volta ( que destrói a redenção do Darth Vader ), e só assisti nessa semana, e a verdade é, poupei 14 reais não indo ao cinema mas a Disney me deve 2 horas e meia, foi o pior Star Wars que eu já vi, conseguiram fazer Os últimos Jedi parecer razoável, o roteiro é ruim, os personagens são construídos e desconstruídos todo o tempo, o filme faz Fan service o tempo todo, as lutas são horríveis, Alem de muitos plágios ao Filme Vingadores Ultimato, e pior é a batalha final onde colocam milhares de naves e não se tem 3 minutos de ação com elas, essas horas faz falta um Peter Jackson que fazia muito bom uso do exagero, poderia ser uma batalha como a do Abismo de Helm ou a Batalha de Minas tirith, mas é algo fraco e esquecível, E obvio que não posso esquecer do Infame beijo entre a Rey e o kylo Ren, que é absolutamente sem sentido e revoltante, a grande verdade é que Star Wars não é Marvel e por isso essa formula Disney não ia dar certo, não atoa teve um desempenho fraco nas bilheterias, metade do que arrecadou o Despertar da força, e pela correção Inflacionaria Ameaça Fantasma e Vingança dos Sith também arrecadaram mais. A grande verdade é que faltou a coragem que o George Lucas teve com as Prequels, de tentar algo novo, os filmes podem não ser grandes coisas ( embora considere o Vingança dos Sith o melhor Star Wars ) mas tinham personalidade e a historia não tropeçava e tinham continuidade, enquanto essa nova trilogia não tem sequencia e não teve planejamento, George Lucas escreveu as 2 Trilogias antes de fazer o filme, algo que claramente não foi feito nesses filmes que toda hora variavam os diretores e roteiristas, mostrando que a Disney fez a compra de Star Wars pensando em vender brinquedos e ampliar seu parque em Orlando ( nenhum problema nisso, mas faz algo bem feito pelo menos )."
"Jun 13, 2020",negative,"Watching whole last 3 movies was so cringe that i literally feel bad, its the most senseless boring shit ever, full of sentimental pictures and etc"
"Jun 13, 2020",positive,The effects where cool and with cool action 
"Jun 13, 2020",positive,It's a Good movie not as bad as you Hear in the Internet
"Jun 13, 2020",positive,"A thrilling end to the sequel trilogy that delivers classic star wars as well as a fitting tribute to the 9 episode saga.  Like all films in the series before it, the visuals and cinematography were simply stunning (a consistent strong point in Star Wars).  John Williams delivers, once again, a fantastic score that hits all the right notes.  Fans of Star Wars will not be disappointed."
"Jun 12, 2020",negative,"It's not bad, it's worse."
"Jun 12, 2020",negative,"Me: ""The Last Jedi will be the worst star wars film ever""
JJ: ""You Overestimate my power"""
"Jun 11, 2020",positive,"Star Wars Rise of Sky. Review: 7/10

Pros:

Star Wars nostalgia

Ben Solo's arc

J.J. did the best he could with what he was given in The Last Jedi

Cons:

Destroys Anakin's entire character meaning from the previous 6 films

Felt like they didn't have a full plan for 3 films"
"Jun 11, 2020",negative,"Good Cinematography, CGI, Special Effects, Sound design, Score, and Performances.  WORST screenplay ever filmed.  Absolutely inept and embarrassing writing.  Shockingly so.  They didn't have a story to tell and it was obvious. It broke my heart because there are so many wonderful writers and directors with stories to tell, who understand the craft and who understand writing for characters instead of plot.  Absolutely nonsensical plot from beginning to end, as if the script was a 2nd grade writing project.  Every character was wasted because JJ and Chris Terrio had no interest in taking on the challenge.  At least The Last Jedi dared to be a film with a coherent story.  Characters constantly expositing plot is not a story, and it is unfathomable to me that these guys were allowed to write this screenplay.  Zero craft."
"Jun 11, 2020",neutral,"As a Star Wars movie, this is really disappointing.

Final Rating: C"
"Jun 11, 2020",negative,"COMO ES POSIBLE esta es aun peor que la anterior, es una busqueda sin sentido, una perdida de tiempo de los personajes por que no logran NADA en la mitad de la pelicula para al final tener un Deus Ex y ganar sin un sentido, no hay drama, los personajes que eran malos ahora son peores, un sin sentido... si pudiese colocar menos estrellas lo haria..."
"Jun 10, 2020",positive,"This film is being unfairly slammed.  Daisy Ridley's performance is amazing. Some great stuff here, and none of the cringes associated with the prequel trilogy."
"Jun 10, 2020",positive,"Well, story is reeeealy idiot (don't blame the movie), but i like the movie itself"
"Jun 10, 2020",negative,"The 3rd worst star wars movie to date and with a bad ending. Still, the first watch I passed a good time"
"Jun 10, 2020",negative,"I don't think this movie is as bad as some people says. It was definitely the best theater experience compared to the rest of the trilogy, although when you think about it the plot makes no sense at all. Palpatine returning and getting killed the way he is killed is a terrible idea, not only because undermines the whole OT and Anakin's redemption but also because it makes him look like a dumb idiot who can't stop shooting lightning until half of his face is melted. The protagonists dynamic between each other is decent, although individually the characters are not compelling at all. Rey is not a memorable hero, Poe is the same character as in TFA and Finn is just... there, yelling and playing with space horses. As inclusive as this movies are supposed to be, the writers are too cowards to romantically pair the only two characters that have some sort of chemistry in the whole trilogy, Finn and Poe. Instead, they find a female romantic interest for BOTH of them. Kylo and Rey kissing in the end is as funny as dumb, he was literally Hitler a few hours before that but hey, he is good now! The whole wayfinder search was boring as hell and ultimately pointless as Kylo just smashes the damn thing, the attempt to put Leia in the movie by using unused footage from TFA is passable at best and the whole concept behind the Palpatine's fleet is just awful. The fact that the ships don't know which way is up still irritates me, and I don't understand why did they think that making them all capable of destroying entire planets was a good thing. Even with all these terrible mistakes, there are some aspects of the movie that are decent. The music is good as always, the visuals are stunning, the movie in general is pretty entertaining and the lightsaber duel, even though is nowhere as good as the ones in the prequels, is decent. Oh, and Babu Frik is incredibly cute."
"Jun 10, 2020",positive,"Don't get me wrong this movie had some major problems. But to rate it a 1 or 2 is idiotic. The acting is good. The directing is good. The fx are good. The music is good. The script isnt very good. The pacing is not good. But it is far from a bad movie. the biggest problem with the movie is there is too much going on. Movies that are 1 or 2 stars are movies like Burt Wobderstone, Tremors: a cold day in hell, Bright, attack of the clones, and Independence day resurgence. Sites like this where people rate good movies as s*** just show that not everyone should have a voice."
"Jun 9, 2020",negative,"When you set out to create a further trilogy to one of the world's most beloved franchises, perhaps a rough storyboard is in order. It is clear that did not occur here. This movie is nonsensical garbage and has irreparably damaged my interest in Starwars."
"Jun 9, 2020",negative,"Rise of Skywalker feels like a fanfic writing by a 9 y/o. It was the scene where Chewie almost died onl for it to be revealed he was on another ship that I knew this was gonna be a bad movie. This was supposed to be the grand finale to an even grander saga, and it just fell flat."
"Jun 9, 2020",negative,It’s a Star Wars fan fic that does nothing bold and is more cute than it is touching.
"Jun 8, 2020",negative,Another movie ruined by JJ Abrams lack of direction and loss of interest in the story.
"Jun 8, 2020",neutral,"My score rating means that I half loved it and half hated it. At first I thought it was the greatest film in the world, but over time watching it over and over again, I realized that this film has a lot of problems and was very rushed from what I've seen. But although it does have some interesting moments. Palpatine  coming back was my favorite and so was when we called herself a Skywalker at the end to honor the actual Skywalker's. But of course as I said this film is very rushed and feels overwhelming to process. Kathleen Kennedy and Disney completely screwed over this movie. But it's not just them, I believe this movie was terrible because of Ryan Johnson's the last Jedi. After watching that movie and over again, I also realize that there was things in there that I hated, like, Luke becoming the asshole that gives up, and then in the end he's all OK I'm back now but I'm dying! It's just bullshit. And there's so many other things that I'm not gonna get into right now. I really want the JJ cut to happen. Time will only tell if that will actually happen. But if you're Star Wars fan who was completely disappointed with this movie but also loved some things about it, it's so fun to watch."
"Jun 8, 2020",negative,"The half star goes to look of the film, that was very crisp and spectacular. 
The plot was trash, the dialogue was cheesy, and the characters unfinished 
Rey is confused, Fin is made to look soft as twinkie filling, Poe is the Han Solo of the film but lack charisma, comedic timing and common sense.
Kylo Kylo Kylo, this is some BS How can he be the Bad Guy for 2 movies and then be Rey's love interest for thirty seconds. He's killed his father indirectly killed his mom, killed her allies and friends. So let's makeout! They teased Fin and Rey together since The Force Awakens, but then just drop that story arch to the wayside. Poe gets a love interest who we never see.  The Emperor as a villain was a Joke how can your villain spend the whole film hooked on a life support machine? How did the Emperor hide and build all those ships?
How where the rebels able to rally that many ships at the end?
So many plot holes not enough time talent and money to fill them. 
Peace"
"Jun 8, 2020",positive,"Well done. After Last Jedi...I was so dismayed, disgusted, and disappointed....that I chose not to see this one in the theatre. I just finally decided to watch it On Demand and it was quite good! JJ resurrected this from the ashes of the utterly awful Last Jedi. A very good film with a lot of much-needed call backs to true Star Wars form for us true fans. Thank goodness..."
"Jun 7, 2020",neutral,"Star Wars Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker, oh boy, we're in for a good one. The Rise of Skywalker is the conclusion the nine part Skywalker Saga that George Lucas began in 1977's Star Wars(a true fan doesn't call it a New Hope)! The part about it being concluding was the best part of this movie! The worst part about this movie, well, the actual plot, story and characters. They weren't handled very well. Ok, maybe General Hux was handled(almost) well. Let's just admit it, the Rey and Kylo kiss came out of nowhere! But still, it did a pretty good job with all the pay-off, fan-service and action sequences! Overall, it wasn't the best way to end the Skywalker Saga, but it definitely wasn't the worst way! But it still pales in comparison to the ""other"" conclusion of a years long saga made by a studio owned by Disney that was released in 2019! You know which movie I'm talking about."
"Jun 6, 2020",negative,"I saw A New Hope when it released in 1977. As a child I found it wonderous and inspiring. I remember leaving the theater and looking up at the night sky imagining X-Wings flying around in some far-off galaxy. What made Star Wars so incredible, and me a lifelong fan, was the simple hero's journey and struggle with good vs evil, multi-dimensional characters you could love (or hate), and movie magic that sparked the imagination. While we're all painfully aware of how Lucas blew it with episodes 1-3, Disney's 6-9 were just as bad, and in some ways worse. This series, and Rise of Skywalker in particular, represent the worst of Star Wars. The characters are flat and uninspiring. The story is a boring convoluted mess of politics and morally ambiguous ideology. And the hero's journey has become a punchline of political correctness. Now that this main story arc has come to an inglorious Death Star like ending, I implore Disney to get back to what made Star Wars the cultural and cinematic phenomenon it once was. Fortunately, offerings such as Rogue One, Solo, and The Mandalorian give longtime fans like me a new hope."
"Jun 6, 2020",positive,"Compared to the previous episodes, The Rise of Skywalker is probably one of the most carefully handled film of the sequel trilogy with an addition of iconic scenes and characters."
"Jun 6, 2020",negative,Absolute poo - I wish I could give this 0 stars.
"Jun 6, 2020",negative,"Is your brand getting stale? Is the market saturated? Is the fandom fatigued? JJ it! He'll leave it looking like Rome after The Vandals visited on holiday!
Get some spaceships and fly them around. Get some people with laser guns to run around. Get some people to wave their hands and make things flying around. Slap a Star Wars label on it and Bob's your uncle.
It had its moments, but like the last one pretty much not until the last 20 minutes or so. Wanna watch some thing good? Go check out Dr. horrible's sing-along blog. Want to watch a good Star Wars film? Try rogue one, or the first one (which was actually the fourth one…?)
This turkey is better than the holiday special but not quite as good as the battle for Endor."
"Jun 5, 2020",positive,"El capítulo final de la saga no tuvo el resultado esperado, se nota como JJ Abrams y equipo tuvieron miedo de entregar novedades y por lo tanto terminó la trilogía más reciente de Star Wars en más de lo mismo, personajes innecesarios, muy pocas referencias notables a los personajes anteriores, dudas sin resolver, y  la poco convincente resurrección de Palpatine, el cual ni siquiera justifica de forma inteligente ni sorprendente su regreso. Aunque cuenta con efectos técnicos de primer nivel, buenas actuaciones, la música incomparable de John Williams y escenas conmovedoras. En fin la decepción al final es notable y se siente que la trilogía terminó, pero no se siente como el final de la saga, aún así es una película buena que calzará bien cuando se hagan maratones de toda la saga."
"Jun 5, 2020",positive,"This movie clearly shows Disney has not planned the Trilogy, it deviates from last Jedi although I loved Last Jedi.
It was rushed, deviated although the Visual Effects are outstanding..Performance by the lead actors was good
There were many unanswered questions but this movie has not talked about it..Palpatine return was unnecessary 
The Fight sequence was good but not great although the Last Jedi between Kylo ren and Rey with palpatine was amazing
It would be amazing if they didn't bring back Palpatine and made Kylo ren the lead antagonist, this would have been a perfect end to the Trilogy"
"Jun 5, 2020",positive,"actually not bad, really not bad - but the previous movie fucked the plot a bit :((("
"Jun 5, 2020",negative,"The Backgrounds, Costumes and action scenes were amazing.
The lines seemed so cheesy and recycled from the old glory days.
Especially the zoom ins on Lando , they abused the technique too much.
Poe is a wannabe Han, Rey is a wannabe Luke. The only original character is Flynn but he´s way too self righteous to be taken seriously as a character hes more of an NPC."
"Jun 5, 2020",positive,"I was not a huge fan of The Force Awakens, and I super hated The Last Jedi, which forestalled me seeing The Rise of Skywalker until now.  Its a shame the first 2 in the newer series crushed the goodwill out of so many of the fans, because this is the only proper and amazing movie in the series.  Rise of Skywalker is essentially everything I had hoped for a SW movie to be since Disney took over.  It so perfectly nailed what I wanted, that I am actually sad that the series with the cast will not be continuing now.  Well done to JJ Abrams et al on this last and best entry.  Really good.  If you are like me and on the fence or just checked out after the first two films, please consider watching this one, if only to make up for the previous films in the series with an amazing final act."

"Jun 4, 2020",positive,"For those of us who enjoy every J J Abrams film; who also see him as one of the great story tellers of our time as Tolkien, and Lewis, me and my family enjoyed every moment of Rise of Skywalker.

"Jun 4, 2020",negative,"I have just watched 18 hours and 41 minutes of film just to catch up and watch this movie, and it definitely wasn't worth the time. The movie looked great I'll give them that. The animation looked realistic. That one scene of young Luke and Leia Skywalker fighting kind of through me off. The ending was... bad. (Spoilers if you think you can stomach through this) Rey dies, Kylo Ren heals her, they kiss, and then Kylo Ren immediately dies. What was J.J. Abrams thinking. As somebody that has, not until now has never seen any Star Wars movies, barely remembers any of the many minor events from this movie (along with the other 8 movies) and just found it ridiculous."

"Jun 3, 2020",positive,It was just OK. Not amazing or anything
"Jun 3, 2020",negative,Just an embarrassment to such a beloved franchise and ending so poorly.
"Jun 3, 2020",neutral,"The worst Star Wars movie ever made. The plot is not good and some of the choices were only made to extend this ridiculous and poorly written story. The beginning feels like a video game. So many quests. Uninteresting and boring. The 3rd act should be the biggest and most epic final battle of all time. But the execution lacked in emotion and action. The kiss was very uncomfortable and cringey. There was never this romantic connection between Rey and Ben, that this movie so desperately wants us to believe in. The rest was just an ok Star Wars adventure. Nothing more."
"Jun 2, 2020",negative,"Lile a lot of people I have been a fan since childhood, but this movie is just friggin' moronic. Almost as bad a conclusion to a great series as GOT."
"Jun 2, 2020",positive,I liked the movie a lot although the plot twists were lazy I enjoyed it beautiful end to the saga
"Jun 1, 2020",positive,"In the final chapter of the Skywalker saga, J.J. Abrams tries to course correct from plot decisions made in ""The Last Jedi,"" and while the film may lack originality, Abrams still delivers a nostalgic sci-fi adventure with superb performances and some spectacular action - specifically a water-soaked lightsaber battle between Kylo Ren and Rey at the remains of the Death Star."

"May 31, 2020",neutral,"L'attesissimo capitolo finale della nuova trilogia di Star Wars è una delusione totale. Dopo un'introduzione assolutamente perfetta, ideata e confezionata da J. J. Abrams, un secondo capitolo problematico, che vede il nuovo regista Johnson portare sostanziosi cambiamenti narrativi a tutto ciò che si era instaurato nel film precedente, ecco il gran finale, un film caotico che con molte difficoltà manifesta incertezza e indecisione dall'inizio alla fine. Si cerca di riparare la netta rottura narrativa presente tra i primi due capitoli, e senza una linea guida si cerca di salvare il salvabile offrendo agli spettatori ciò che si pensa possano apprezzare. Il risultato è un film con grossi problemi narrativi, un film che non si riesce a connettere con nessuno dei due primi capitoli. Il principale responsabile di questo fallimento è, a mio avviso, proprio il cambio di regista tra i primi due film: è stata data troppa libertà creativa a Johnson, il quale ha offerto una sua visione di Star Wars, totalmente distaccata rispetto all'idea originale di partenza. Nonostante questo, la regia generale è molto valida e tutti gli aspetti tecnici sono assolutamente perfetti, con fotografia, scenografie ed effetti visivi sempre sopra la media. Gli enormi problemi narrativi non sono sorvolabili e rovinano tutto il feeling generale dell'intera trilogia. Purtroppo il film rischia di essere il peggior film su Star Wars che sia mai stato fatto."
"May 31, 2020",positive,"Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker
A grand and delightful finale of the beloved decades old saga, that stays in its comfort zone for the better good."
"May 31, 2020",negative,"The movie wasn't terrible, but it certainly wasn't great either. They spent way too much time in the two previous films tearing down all our heroes and then realized they had made a mistake, so they tried to prop them all back up. It didn't work. Sorry. You burned that bridge with The Last Jedi and with all the social media attacks on the fans that didn't like what you did to their heroes. I mean, when you have stars and film makers attacking the fans, you've lost the narrative. Even Marvel hasn't learned that lesson, but it is Disney, so I guess it's to be expected."
"May 30, 2020",positive,better than episode 8
"May 30, 2020",positive,"I did not hate this at all! They tied up all the loose ends and plenty of fun action sequences. Sure it was clunky, but aren't all Star Wars movies? Solid concept, solid execution."
"May 30, 2020",negative,"This was the worst out of the new saga, character choices were dubious all round, *do you take the quick kill or the hard kill, whyyyy...
And how many  times can you hijak an empire destoryer?! Really.
No chemistry between charachters, made me crinje the whole time, story line was robotic, why did they even bother?"
"May 30, 2020",negative,Just a waste of time and money. I can't believe how badly they ruined this franchise.
"May 30, 2020",positive,"Much better than I thought it would be, and largely due to the performances. Ridley and Driver are again amazing. And I nearly welled up over the scene with Carrie Fisher."
"May 30, 2020",negative,Awful attempt at finishing one of the greatest franchises of all time. Do not waste your time unless you want to see some cool special effects.
"May 29, 2020",negative,"Its not the size of the threat or consequence if the heros lose that make you care its your emotional investment in it. You can find thousands of movies that have very small scale problems with small scale consequences if the heros fail that can still bring you into the stroy and make you seriously care. Just look at love stories.  If the couple doesn't get together and fall in love in the grand scheme of things it doesn't matter but it can still bring you to tears. The rise of skywalker is centered around 1,000 deathstars and wow what a surprise that no one cared and the fans weren't invested in it"
"May 29, 2020",negative,The best thing about this film is that it signals the end of the current trilogy that started off great and got progressively worse.
"May 29, 2020",negative,"I went into the movie with a lot of questions, but when I left, I had more questions than I did answers"
"May 29, 2020",negative,"it was kinda just boring, like Rays character arc failed in my opinion, it was nothing new, or that i hadn't seen before"
"May 29, 2020",negative,"ruins the whole main star wars arc 
this movie ruins all of star wars"
"May 28, 2020",negative,"Lame, stale, lacks presence, short on acting talent and is just old appearing."
"May 28, 2020",positive,I totally enjoyed the movie. I think it was an amazing way to end the Skywalker saga and you could totally feel the Star Wars energy during the movie. The character development of Rey and Ben was brilliant and emotionally complex and you can tell it is a more poetical version of the previous movies.
"May 27, 2020",negative,"Good visual, very visual so much visual. Story ? Confusing.. is it a new trilogy or stand alone ? I wish I was 16y again to feel less confuse ...seriously I only watch it for the visual after seeing it twice really cool"
"May 27, 2020",positive,"A fitting end to the Skywalker saga. I thoroughly enjoyed it, plenty of adventure, action, emotion and surprises along the way.  The references to every aspect of Star Wars on the big and small screen was a nice touch.  I do feel there were some missed opportunites like the Knights of Ren, but as a life-long Star Wars fan I loved it overall."
"May 27, 2020",negative,Screws over all the original movies
"May 27, 2020",positive,"good movie 
entertaining
i really like palpatine returns but actually that could be better"
"May 26, 2020",negative,"The movie was poorly thought out, and clearly only focused on pleasing the generation that grew up with the first trilogy, at the expense of the storylines of the new characters. The newly introduced characters like Finn, Rose and Poa could have had much better stories and well thought out backgrounds and motivations. They should have had a more concentrated bad guy because kylo was clearly conflicted since the beginning of the trilogy and then bringing in palpatine had no correlation to the new generation. It seems they had no plan to actually give the characters purpose, they just wanted to tie up there stories, and they didn't do it in a good way."
"May 26, 2020",negative,"Bummer.
It appears that the plan to remake the original Star Wars trilogy despite the Lucasfilm contract of sale explicitly prohibiting alteration of the Lucas Era films was carried out. Working so hard to get a callback shot of Chewie in chains ... member that?
Like every story post buyout it's big on flash and low on substance. Like scavenging, every idea in these new films was picked up because the creative individual who collaborated to build the Star Wars universe left it behind.
Criminally unimaginative."
"May 26, 2020",negative,"The overall feeling through the whole movie is that too many things are happening too fast and for no reason.
The relationship with the new characters introduced in this movie looks forced and fake because they didn't spend time in developing them.
It seems like the wanted to undo everything set on The Last Jedi, and ran out of time to tell the story straight.
Sadly a huge let down for any fan of the series and just a bad movie."
"May 26, 2020",negative,"I series of badly put together scenes with awful acting. I finally decided to see it, downloaded, I didnt even bother to go to the cinema, and I was not disappointed, it was as bad as expected. 
Watch the animated series instead much better stories and fights and for some reason they make sense. I have rewatched them several times not sure I will do with this sequal trilogie."
"May 26, 2020",positive,"It was really, really good. Many people feel it was rushed and that things were not explained properly, and there is truth in that. On the other hand it is such a treat that I think it would be a disservice to oneself to scrutinize how they found a Sith knife or how exactly how that helped them find a Wayfinder. Sure, I would sometimes have preferred something more plausible, but these are just story telling apparatus that doesn't detract from the real joy of the overall experience."
"May 25, 2020",negative,"This movie was awful. It breaks so many in-universe laws and destroys the lore. Not to mention, the pacing is awful, just going from action set piece to action set piece as well as the lazy writing. They bring back Palpatine (ruining the Chosen One prophecy) and don't even bother to explain how! The amount of plot holes and continuity errors are countless. The lightsaber fight is also extremely underwhelming. It has no music, no emotional value, and treats lightsabers like medieval battle axes weighing hundreds of pounds. Absolutely awful. It tries to cram way too much stuff into one movie. And the ending is just unbelievable. The amount of frustration that comes from the line Rey says at the end is unimaginable (unless you've seen the movie, of course). This movie is a disgrace to Star Wars and an insult to film making."
"May 25, 2020",neutral,A weak way to end this newer trilogy. It's a lazy film that will barely keep your attention. The worst of the Star Wars franchise to date. (First and only viewing - 5/10/2020)
"May 25, 2020",negative,Worst movie since Phantom Menace.
"May 25, 2020",negative,"Emporer palpatine coming back completely negates the entire Skywalker trilogy! Anakin Skywalkers arc from episode 1 to 3 was him slowly being manipulated by palpatine until he eventually palpatine turned him and Anakin had no will to turn on his master. In 4-5 he learns that he has a son, and this almost transforms his mind to thinking that he doesn't need the emporer anymore. In 6 he overcomes his fear and "" kills "" the emprorer, thus completing his massive 6 movie arc and this sees the prophecy of the chosen one fulfilled, he finally brings balance to the force. Now with palpatine back, none of that matters. Another thing was the completely rushed pace of the movie. There is also a lot of lazy editing and plot holes the size of a galaxy. Another thing is the terrible lazy writing and the use of something called a "" maguffin "". A maguffin is an object that solely exist to advance the plot and is something that terrible writers use when they have no other way to advance said plot. In this movie the maguffin is the sith way finder, which serves no other purpose than to advance the plot through the finding of these objects. Another huge thing that annoys me about this movie is how they tried to copy the pivotal moment in Avengers Endgame at the end of this movie. In Endgame Thanos says "" I am inevitable "" and then Iron man says "" and I, am iron man "" and then snaps, Blowing away Thanos and saving the day. In ROS palpatine says "" I am all the sith "" and then Rey says "" and I, am all the Jedi"" blowing him away and saving the day. The main thing about this movie that still absolutely pisses me off is how at the end she calls herself skywalker. How fucking dare you call yourself a name that you have not earned! The entire movie everyone is preaching how you shouldn't be afraid of who you really are, and then Rey decides to hide it all behind a fake name that is respected throughout the galaxy. All in all this is a complete failure as a movie and as a peice in the Star Wars trilogy. I encourage anyone who is reading this to watch the original trilogy and Revenge if the sith in the prequel trilogy if you want to know what compelling stories and plots look like in a Star Wars movie. I would never recommend any true Star Wars fan watch this movie. I'm not actually sure who likes this movie."
"May 25, 2020",positive,"My first viewing of this movie was that it was okay.  The Last Jedi had done so much damage to the Star Wars franchise that no single movie could undo that mess within only a couple hours.  But Abrams did the best he could and found a way to make it all work.  The death of Carrie Fisher seriously affected the development of this movie and it shows in the storyline which seems nonsensical on many levels.  Upon my second viewing, I started seeing more of this movie start to shine.  Critics scoff at the so-called ""fan service.""  But there's a difference between mocking ""fan service"" and showing respect on established canon.  I appreciated seeing people like Wedge make this movie.  Ultimately, this third trilogy fails to conclude the Skywalker story arc because The Last Jedi had removed the setup from The Force Awakens, forcing Abrams to rush the trilogy conclusion into 2 hours rather than the summed 7-8 hours for a trilogy.  But even though the third trilogy didn't elevate the franchise, 2 of the 3 movies were enjoyable.  But I do wish there was another movie with Rey at the forefront.  I feel they could've done more with her.  And please bring back more dynamic lightsaber fights.  The sword action of this trilogy was so lumbering.  The last act near the very end began to have that faster dynamic action that was reminiscent of the prequel trilogy."
"May 25, 2020",negative,"Man, they really took it seriously when we asked ""could they can make it any worse than the Last Jedi?""
It's bad, it's really bad, first Star Wars I've fallen asleep while watching it."
"May 25, 2020",negative,Lost continuity with the prior movie but more fun than the last movie that is the worst of all of the series so meh.
"May 24, 2020",positive,"The main problem for ‘The Rise of Skywalker' (and for JJ Abrams in the writer/director's chair) is that it has to (re)correct the course that the previous film set, undo as many mistakes as possible, and somehow tie up everything and everyone's stories from the previous eight films. That's a tall order, maybe an impossible one. Inevitably, it feels messy and disconnected, not leaving anywhere near enough time to cover everything and deliver a focused effort. 

The newest trilogy as a whole is, arguably, a disappointing affair that just went wrong in too many places. Nevertheless, considering all of the above, Abrams' has done an admirable job with the final film that shouldn't be too disappointing, at least for casual fans; that is to say, there are a lot of epic scenes that utilise a lot of the best things about the ‘Star Wars' universe and, just as importantly, some great character development in the right direction."
"May 24, 2020",negative,"Maybe if you are the new caretakers for a much loved franchise, and you're adding a final trilogy, you might think of planning a full coherent storyline that is respectful to everything before it, and is a trilogy worthy on its own merits.
Disappointing."
"May 24, 2020",negative,"The Long-awaited installment to finally end this train wreck of a trilogy, and boy this does not help in the slightest. (Quick side note, I totally didn't pay to see Uncut Gems and then sneak in to see Star Wars as a protest against Disney and not wanting to give them my hard-earned money). The Marketing itself as the end of a nine-part saga with JJ Abrams himself stated in multiple interviews but more feel like it's the merciful end to this jumbled mess of a Trilogy that lost it stride as soon as The Last Jedi was released and immediately became controversial among the fan base and mainstream Hollywood critics praising the film to no end. When I first saw TLJ in theaters despite the issues I had with it on the spot I had a blast but after a few days critical thinking it made less and less the flaws became more apparent and more kept popping up, and the Humor was not only childish but Inter fears with scenes that could have added great dramatic tension. Now fan backlash for questionable decisions is nothing new in this franchise dating back to the holiday special the sequels and prequels, but the backlash to this film and how it was handled left a fatal rift not just between critics and audiences but in the fan base itself because whenever its brought up it's like bringing up politics in the middle of a holiday dinner 🍽 table with some very opinionated in-laws, it almost always boils down to shouting matches, name-calling, animosity between each other, and in the process ruin everyone else's a good time. 
Now for the movie itself as it is every bit as disappointing as the leaks made it out to be and it feels like it was hacked together by constant reshoots, re-edits, test screening, and rushed last-minute ideas that were given no thought or time to develop naturally in the story. For example, it's obvious to any Star Wars fan even if they only watch the theatrically released movies 🎥 that The Emperor's return makes absolutely no sense in the context of this trilogy story as his story clearly ended in 1983 with Return of the Jedi along with Anakin's redemption and the Skywalker saga. With the prequels love em or hate em are there just add some more lore and background to the galaxy 🌌 at large and how there was always a much bigger game at play. But with this movie not one of them gives me a hint of what's going on in the galaxy at large, why did the new republics stop pursuing ex imperials, why weren't they prepared for another potential conflict if it arises, why are they so incompetent and why should I root for them defeat the First Order, and now the final Order speaking of which I could get a grasp that they just wanna return the empire to its former glory but these villains are a far cry from the original even the droid army was more intimidating then these guys because at least they didn't fall for some dumb yo mama prank calls. In fact the more I think about the film it could plot holes The Movie 🍿 as just thinking 🤔 about it makes less and less sense. Writing-wise the only good thing about is that the new main characters are finally all together going in adventures and even have a few decent and well-acted scenes together (when they're not being told to read forced marvel humor). Even then it was still too little too late as their dynamic should have been built upon throughout the Trilogy and had nowhere near the camaraderie of Han, Luke, and Leia.
On a technical level it is stunning to look at. The VFX and practical effects are something to be appreciated and kudos to the make and prosthetics department for all the neat looking alien 👽 designs. But for a film 🎞 of this magnitude this should be an automatic given with its more than $250million budget back by the biggest film studio in Hollywood and has the best artist-designers and VFX technology in the business at the click of a button or phone ☎️ call away. Too bad it couldn't save the dodgy editing poor choice of shots and clumsily choreographed lightsaber duels as its ether Medium close-ups or extreme wide an awkward balance of either to close or too far (yes I'm making the bold statement that these are the worst duels in the history of the franchise). Being an Indie filmmaker watched several small budget projects and been on multiple film sets I've seen experience so much more being done with so much less all because they have an undying passion to tell the story they want to tell without having to abide by mainstream norms. Overall I know I'm gonna have quite the debate with a few friends 👬 who for some reason loves these films, and I do wish I saw this with a bigger group of people to talk to right afterward, I did have a few good conversations with some strangers as I was walking 🚶out and I give Star Wars episode xi the Rise of Skywalker a 3/10"
"May 23, 2020",negative,I've never wanted to walk out of a movie more badly than this one. It literally goes back in time to ruin the other trilogies.
"May 23, 2020",positive,"So much better than the previous episode, JJ Abrams was always against it having to undo the mess made by TLJ. He has done a good job and rectified a lot of the issues created previous. The film is enjoyable and brings a fitting end to the Skywalker saga and was really well done how they made use of the unused film of Carrie Fisher."
"May 23, 2020",negative,"Worse film by far, it destroy all the precuels and the originals"
"May 23, 2020",negative,Easily the WORST of the three new Star Wars movies (Episode 6-9). The other two were just as god awful.
"May 23, 2020",negative,What's to stop Palpatine from being cloned again?
"May 23, 2020",positive,The visuals are fantastic and the cast is amazing and it brought a fitting end to the Skywalker saga.
"May 23, 2020",negative,"This movie was just a picked up of Disney trying to please the fan with reference of the good old movies and an old predictable Disney movie. At almost every moment of the movie I could predict what was gonna appen. Also the logic was totaly gone, I am not a big fan of the Star Wars trilogy but even myself was asking questions about the Force and other Jedi and Sith things that I knew was just an shitty explantion for the movie to continue and to justify the actions."
"May 23, 2020",negative,"Nope. Complete horse ah*t!
Where to start?
What a mess!
When the 6 legged horses hit the screen I was outta there"
"May 22, 2020",negative,"It was all over the place and it made no sense, a stain on the Star Wars saga"
"May 22, 2020",negative,"This is what happens when you do storytelling by committee and don't lay out clearly the overall story arc for the trilogy at the beginning and adhere to it. There are plenty of plot holes and headshaking moments to go around, from going to a planet to find a wayfinder and discovering a magical knife that will lead them to it completely by accident, to being in just the right spot on another planet when they discover the knife is also a locator for said wayfinder, to jumping in and out of hyperspace with reckless abandon (still remember Han Solo's advice to Luke: ""jumping through hyperspace ain't like dustin' crops, boy. It requires precise calculations...""), to the ridiculously stupid and unexplained rescue/resurrection of Palpatine after Return of the Jedi, to the forced kiss between Kylo and Rey, to Kylo's miraculous recovery after being thrown over a seemingly bottomless chasm, to yet another Death Star/Starkiller/planet exploder weapon, to yet another ridiculously simple flaw in said weapon, and so on.

I don't know how a group of adults (using that term loosely here) sat in a reading room for this and did not see the gaping holes in the plots and the complete disregard for suspension of disbelief, which is necessary for any movie to be compelling. I sat through this, painfully aware that I was sitting in a theater being forced crap that made no sense, and ultimately stared blankly at the screen to watch the moving pixels only because I made the commitment to finish this sad trilogy. If the characters turned and stared at the camera for laughs it would not have been any less disrupting to my suspension of disbelief than the poor storytelling and flashing and noise at the end.

On a positive note, this is at least mildly more entertaining than The Last Jedi, due to Abrams' better treatment of humor, and better story pacing. To be fair, a lot of stuff happens during this 2.5 hour film, but it's always better when things happen for a reason, and so much of this movie happens for no real reason, other than to sell toys or compensate for the damage done by TLJ. As visually stunning as it is, the movie is just a horrible example of storytelling, and ultimately I walked away from this trilogy in the Star Wars franchise painfully aware that it IS a franchise, and that none of the new characters are especially likeable, not even Rey, who rightfully earned the title of Mary Sue due to her inexplicable ability to master Jedi skills that took Luke Skywalker years and much effort to develop...all because of her blood line. Rey, Poe, and Finn are all very shallow, forgettable characters who emote, but don't convey real struggle or desire and achieve greatness almost by entitlement. Poe magically maneuvers spaceships impossibly fast around targets and never misses, Rey goes from picking up Luke's light saber to being a saber fighting master over what? A few months? She never changes her outfit once throughout the whole trilogy! And Finn? He occasionally shoots and blows up a TIE fighter and shouts ""whoa!"" when he does, and through luck manages to avoid his own death at least a few times. As I said, completely shallow and forgettable characters.

So glad this is over, like one feels after watching a loved one suffer a long illness--sad, but relieved."
"May 22, 2020",positive,Much better than The Last Jedi.  Still could have been better.
"May 22, 2020",negative,"In an overly complicated and unfortunate story arch, there are moments to celebrate that have the adventurous spirit of Star Wars. However, primarily the villain plot point is a mass disservice to all the previous saga episodes. The conclusion of this movie dissipates the conclusion of the original trilogy, and unfortunately, ruins said outcome. The themes, visuals, score, etc are spot on, but the actual plot is a horrid mark on the amazing sage as a whole. The previous episode left us with so much promise of a bright, expansive future for Star Wars: while this depressed that notion. It is convoluted and ridiculous enough to pull one away from the story while watching, and question if they are watching Star Wars or an excessive parody?"
"May 21, 2020",negative,"So disjointed and everywhere! The pacing is breakneck, and for good reason too, because if it was a little slower you'd have to time to think about how ridiculous everything that's happening is!
Such a shame they didn't plan out the production of these movies better. This was a failure of leadership and planning."
"May 21, 2020",negative,A film that puts fan pleasing higher than quality. Nobody wanted chewie to get that goddamn medal 30 years later!
"May 21, 2020",negative,"complete and utter nonsense, shouldnt even be considered cannon."
"May 21, 2020",neutral,"It's not trash but it's definitely the worst movie of the trilogy. It's disappointing because the first two movies were good even if they hadn't so much connection between them, and this last one could do a good job and make the other ones have meaning, but it just looks like a solo movie. Moreover, even if you analyze it as a solo movie, it's not a good movie, a Star Wars fan may have felt shame with this movie, but I think it's not a waste of time for those who watched the 2 previous movies."
"May 21, 2020",positive,"I really enjoyed the movie and how it kept you on a ride, like while I was watching I thought the movie was going to go one way and went in a different but also really good moving way. Obviously this is just my opinion you should watch it for yourself and see what you think!"
"May 21, 2020",negative,Absolute garbage. The laziest cash grab. Fitting end to the recycled nonsense we have been subjected to again and again.
"May 20, 2020",negative,"The Rise of Skywalker did his best to redo the plot of The Return of the Jedi, which gave an unoriginal, boring and inconsistent (with the rest of the trilogy) movie.  At the end of this movie, we find the galaxy in the exact same state it was after Episode VI, and we reached this point by breaking a lot established lore along the way.  How ironic that a movie about a limitless universe had to be given a plot so repetitive and predictable."
"May 20, 2020",positive,Great music by John Williams.
"May 20, 2020",negative,"I barely understood the plot, uninteresting, jumbled, and draws too much on what came before."
"May 20, 2020",negative,"I didn't like it when I saw it in theaters, but had a much bigger revelation when it came out on Disney+ and my friend and I watched it again. Like the Prequels or The Room we like watching bad movies to make fun of them, but to my absolute amazement it wasn't even fun to laugh at. It was so incredibly boring that I just found myself dosing off with nothing to say. The only fun we had was yelling ""REY!!!"" every time Finn did. The whole thing is just so empty. I remember watching TLJ and hating the part where Luke drinks the milk. I remember just like ""ew, gross"" but now I'm like ""At least that scene makes me FEEL SOMETHING"" TROS makes me feel nothing. It's such an empty shell of a movie that I might as well be a toddler staring at a spinning mobile and some flashing lights.

And why does everyone keep blaming JJ but never bring up Chris Terrio? Why did anyone think that bringing the writer of Batman v Superman and Justice League would somehow be a good idea?"
"May 20, 2020",negative,"What a sour way to end the sequel trilogy. From the start of this film, it should be glaringly obvious to the viewer that there was no conversation as to how the sequels should be laid out before they were made. Each installation was the respective creatives winging it with minimal effort to even reference the story that had come before it. The Rise of Skywalker is the peak of this trend, as the film itself seems to be a desperate search for some kind of conclusive end to the sequel trilogy and Star Wars as a whole. But given how lack luster, ham fisted and tone deaf this grand finale was from start to end, for me at least, the saga ends on Endor."
"May 20, 2020",negative,"A rushed thoughtless end to what was the most disappointing trilogy in Star Wars history. Riddled with plot holes, untied story arcs and ridiculous mcguffins. It did one great thing, united those who loved the prequels with those who didn't, in confirming which trilogy was the worst."
"May 20, 2020",neutral,The film fine. It was beautifully made and the actors did a pretty good job but the story never drew me in and it was quite confusing especially after watching The Last Jedi. I enjoyed it but would not want to watch it again
"May 20, 2020",negative,"The movie was actual trash 

I hate all the new Star Wars movies that Disney makes 
Rough one and solo were good movies but holly crap the sequels are disgusting"
"May 20, 2020",negative,They couldn't defeat palpatine on the previous movies because they only used one lightsaber. The trick was using two.
"May 20, 2020",negative,"Despite the good acting the writing was the opposite. Not only did they reverse all the feats of the original trilogy characters, but it also proved useless and nonsensical to the rest of the subpar sequel trilogy. The editing of the movie gave it a ridiculously fast pace. The entire movie attempts to catch up for lost time from TLJ. A lot of time is spent reversing a lot of the strange decisions made in TLJ too, which could have been a refreshing change for the sequel trilogy-- but the change was pulled off so lazily. The reinsertion of Palpatine was just a bad decision on the writing team's part. It makes little to no sense in the pre-sequel canon. Overall the sequel trilogy proves to be completely detached from the rest of the Skywalker story line, and this final nail in the coffin just solidified my disdain for the trilogy. Music is great, and the saber duel is pretty good. Many plot holes too."
"May 20, 2020",negative,"What a waste. All the potential to take the story and finish it in a meaningful way was destroyed by apathetic writing, bizarre narrative choices that flew over the head of most movie watchers and annoyed die-hard lore fans, and the inability to create anything of substance or joy."
"May 20, 2020",negative,The audience score of 86% is not accurate for how many people have rated this movie terribly. Its also been at 86% for months now with no change despite thousands of new reviews coming in. RT locked their score for some reason. This movie is terrible and Disney should be ashamed of the sequel trilogy as a whole
"May 20, 2020",negative,An insult to the fans.
"May 20, 2020",negative,"Not only is this movie objectively bad, but it actively undermines the story told by the original trilogy. "
"May 20, 2020",positive,"The amazing and epic finale of the Skywalker Star Wars saga! Disney put together a great film that pleases fans of Star Wars and the general public alike! While not as critically or deep like The Last Jedi or The Empire Strikes Back. The Rise of Skywalker truly captured the Star Wars spirit and you can tell by how much of a fan JJ Abrams is for the Star Wars universe! Daisy Ridley's journey as Rey finally gets the well deserved ending she struggled for throughout the films. Adam Driver's performance as Kylo Ren again was one of the best on screen and without any words can sell his character's performance. C-3PO having a larger role was great too and the new alien characters were fantastic! Lando's return was amazing. Mark Hamill killed it as a force ghost and the use of Carrie Fisher was bittersweet as the final chance we will see Princess Leia again. John Boyega as Finn is a bit underdeveloped, but still glad to see. The ending is as epic and reminiscent of the celebration at the end of the Return of the Jedi. Rey's final scene was truly earned and I am so glad of her new name that she worked so hard for!"
"May 20, 2020",negative,"Well, I'm finally writing a review, because I didn't care to see Rise of Skywalker in theaters. Anything that followed the storyline of The Last Jedi was going to be garbage anyway, but aside from that, RoS suffers from lack of continuity to the previous trilogies. Like TLJ, there are so many things that happen in RoS where it's like ""Well why didn't this character do that move in ""Episode whatever"" to avoid this problem or defeat that enemy?"" And there are way too many coincidences as well. Getting into specifics would just take too long here. I'm not saying the Original Trilogy doesn't have flaws, and the Prequel Trilogy is loaded with cringey moments (but can largely be fixed with good editing), but at least the PT maintained decent continuity and honored the OT. The entire Sequel Trilogy was a jumbled up mess of rehashes, breaking continuity, and disgracing the original characters that made Star Wars so popular in the first place. And bringing the Emperor back to life? That's just bad, desperate writing. The one good thing about RoS is finally seeing some interaction between Rey, Finn, and Poe all together. But it's far too late for it to mean anything now. That really should have begun in The Force Awakens. TFA started off okay (despite doing the A New Hope storyline rip-off), but as soon as they broke continuity by having Rey go from nothing to a super force goddess in the space of a couple days in TFA, I knew the ST was in serious trouble. And then TLJ was far worse than anything I could have imagined. RoS wasn't as bad as TLJ, but it was pathetic and sad to watch. Nothing against the actors or production crew, but the writing of the entire ST is garbage. I guess they were in a rush to try and make money fast rather than give more polishing to pre-production to create something truly great, make tons more money off of it, and have fans be excited for more. Now Star Wars is nothing to get excited about, well, the new Star Wars anyway. It's the biggest cinematic failure in history. But the old Star Wars is still wonderful after 40 years! But Disney is so rich, they probably don't care."
"May 20, 2020",negative,"The Rise of Skywalker was a mindless cash grab, going against not only The Last Jedi but against the whole of the Saga previously. Multiple continuity and lore errors, a nonsensical plot and an ending that did not spark any genuine emotion. Just a representation of the lifeless corpse that is the Sequel Trilogy"
"May 19, 2020",positive,"FIVE STAR EXCELLENT !!! 
A film which should unite the fans base after the last film split it in two , a fast paced film which brings a touching sense of nostalgia  to the true  star wars fans . The Best Film in the trilogy for sure."
"May 19, 2020",negative,"I finally bit the bullet and watched it on Disney+. It was so much worse than I feared and my expectations were already low. Quite possibly this is the most creatively barren film ever to appear on movie screens in wide release. It is one thing to play it safe with the most expensive film franchise acquisition in the history of cinema, but it is quite another to wilfully reduce it to a theme park ride without even attempting to fool the audience into believing that they are actually witnessing a story unfolding on a screen"
"May 19, 2020",negative,"Another embarrassment. The Last Jedi was worse, but my hopes for the trilogy to be redeemed by this movie was crushed. Terrible movie."
"May 19, 2020",negative,I couldn't keep up. watching it was like sitting in a 3 hour classroom of flat earth. heart breaking.
"May 19, 2020",negative,Too interested in appeasing the worst critics of The Last Jedi - not at all interested in good storytelling.
"May 19, 2020",negative,Really missed the mark for what it could've been. So many missed opportunities for them to wrap up the saga in a satisfying manner and leave minimal plot points without conclusions.
"May 19, 2020",positive,"One of the best STARWARS movies!
I really enjoyed it"
"May 19, 2020",negative,Didnt represent the jedi order didnt represent luke sky walker the way he should have been the whole 3 movies were a disaster force awakens was good left off well then the last jedi and it went straight to the bottom very disappointed
"May 19, 2020",neutral,"Wow, frankly I don't know what to say, when I went to the cinema to see The Rise of Skywalker on December 21st I was excited, I had appreciated the first two films of the sequel trilogy and I expected not to be disappointed, but I already had doubts about how they would made to bring Palpatine back into the saga, after he had died by falling into the Death Star reactor which had subsequently exploded, this to emphasize that he had died disintegrated. The film begins with the phrase ‘the dead speak', and this statement combined with the phrase that says Palpatine ""the dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural"" is the only explanation for the return of the emperor. This is the first plot hole, but it's a huge plot hole. In the first 6 minutes the film has already shown us three settings united by an insufficient montage but made with the help of excellent visual effects. The film goes too fast, 2h 20m, of which 8 minutes of credits, are not enough for the Skywalker Saga finale. Going forward we discover that Leia is training Rey, in the meantime the Resistance has the confirmation that Palpatine has returned, now I have a question: why did Palpatine announce his return? Wouldn't a surprise attack with his new fleet have been smarter? Previously Kylo had joined Palpatine who had proposed to give him his fleet in exchange for Rey's death. Another question arises, why does Kylo accept? The First Order already has a very powerful fleet, in that situation he could not have accepted and killed Palpatine. After various events Rey, Finn, Poe, Chewbacca and C-3PO reach Pasaana, here we are introduced to a new jedi power, the ability to heal wounds through the Force, this is another plot hole, where Rey learned to use this power? We don't know. At this point the editing of the film finally becomes acceptable, in the previous chase scene on Pasaana he had hit rock bottom. At this point the movie cannot make a choice: Chewbacca dies, but it turns out that he is not dead; Zorii (a new character) first wants to kill Poe and five minutes later asks him to run away with her and when he refuses she gives him the most important thing that has, a pass for the First Order landing areas; finally the C-3PO memory is erased, but then R2-D2 reinstalls it. At this point Rey meets Kylo Ren who tells her that she is Palpatine's grandson, this is fan service, the writers took a random fan theory and chose it, Rey was made Palpatine's grandson to destroy the work of Rian Johnson who had made her the daughter of anyone important, a choice that I had appreciated. Speaking of destroying Rian Johnson's work, do you know why Palpatine returned? Because Snoke died and therefore Kylo Ren could not be made the main villain. Among other things, at the beginning of the film we discover that Palpatine created Snoke as he did is not explained to us. At this point the film improves, there is a good duel between Kylo and Rey, a father and son scene between Han Solo and Kylo, ​​and the long-awaited final battle. However before we get to the final confrontation we have a scene between Rey and Luke in which Luke reveals to Rey that he and Leia had always known that she was a Palpatine, why didn't they tell her before? Afterwards we fight on Exegol, here we have to thank John Williams and his always wonderful soundtracks and Visual Effects, as they make the ending more epic than it really is. At this point we find out that Palpatine had no precise plan, first he told Kylo to kill Rey, then when Rey comes to him, Palpatine changes his mind and asks Rey to kill him in order to become the new sith empress, finally when Rey refuses and Ben comes to help her, Palpatine discovers that he can absorb the vital energy from the two and uses it to come back to life and attack the Resistance fleet with lightning (since when can it be done?). In the end Rey manages to kill Palpatine with the help of all the other Jedi and I appreciate this. The film then ends on Tatooine where Rey buries the swords of Luke and Leia and assumes the surname of Skywalker, to many this thing has bothered me not, or at least not particularly, in the final however in addition to the Force ghosts of Luke and Leia I would have liked to have seen those of Anakin and Ben too. The truth is that in this film Palpatine should never have come back, not only because he was dead but also because he would have canceled the sacrifice of Anakin. In this film the main villain should have been Kylo Ren."
"May 19, 2020",positive,"it was pretty good. VERY rushed. it was hard to follow along because of all the questions and more the previous 2 had created and was kind of fan service. still it was better than the Last Jedi. but I think anything is really better than the Last Jedi. I don't think it quite lived up to be the epic finale It was made up to be, the visuals were good and there were some good parts but either than that pretty okay."
"May 19, 2020",negative,"Trashy from start to finish, terrible choices that undo any good that was set up before, like beating a dead horse. Way too busy, and really just uninspired fan-service."
"May 19, 2020",positive,It's good - I'd recommended it.
"May 19, 2020",negative,Who thought it was a good idea to bring Palpatine back?
"May 19, 2020",negative,THIS IS NOT STAR WARS!!! THIS IS CORPORATE DISNEY TRYING TO MAKE PROFIT AND TURN A BELOVED LEGACY INTO MCU MERCHANDISE!!! THIS MOVIE IS THE WORST AND ERASES EVERYTHING THAT STAR WARS LORE WAS!!!!
"May 19, 2020",negative,"(spoilers) At first, I did like this movie. However, the more I think about it the more disappointed I am. This is kind of an entertaining film, it's a bit rushed but that doesn't bother me too much. The problem here is the writing. Everything that has been done in the first 6 movies is erased. Palpatine's return makes Anakin/Vader's redemption arc pointless. Also Luke Skywalker's efforts to put an end to the empire is now pointless just so some new disney character can get some credit, which pushes me to dislike Rey more and more.. Force healing, Rey and Ben use force healing in some rather major ways, which removes any sense of danger from Star Wars and also pokes quite a few holes in 1-6. Why didn't Obi Wan use healing to save his master? Why didn't Anakin use healing to save Padme? Why didn't Luke use healing to save vader? The list goes on... Now, apart from the major plot holes created, let's talk about characters. Same as the last jedi, Finn is now useless and serves no purpose to the story, he's just there to scream ""RRREEEEEYYYYY!!!!"" Poe does get some development here, but his character is still somewhat forgettable. Rey is still dull and boring, unnecessarily powerful and not relatable. However Kylo Ren/Ben is actually cool in this movie, and is now as powerful as he should have been in the first place. (apart from that force pulling ship and healing, that was dumb). This movie does do a little for Luke, Leia, Han, and Lando. The only reason I would somewhat like this movie is Kylo/Ben and everything else is just bad."
"May 19, 2020",negative,Absoulute trash. At every cross road they came across when it came to resolving plotlines they decided to avoid the road at all and throw themselves of a cliff. The whole movie not only goes lightspeed plotwise but I could swear at dome points it felt like they literally sped it up. The whole thing could have been less awful if at least they did the ending right instead of having a 2 second bossfight and an incestuos kissing scene between characters that no one wanted together.
"May 18, 2020",positive,"I am a lifelong Star Wars fan. With the struggle between the Force Awakens and Last Jedi, this movie ended up being, ""Meh."" Palpatine returning was a high note, but he never reached his potential. Certain points in the movie had us cheering and yelling, ""No!"" But, they were few and far between. Seeing Billy Dee Williams come back was a delight (albeit brief). Kylo Ren's arc had its best moments at the end, making us wish for more. Rey's arc fell flat. All-in-all, they could have done better. Clone Wars and the Mandalorian gave us much better endings."
"May 18, 2020",negative,What a piece of garbage. This was somehow worse than Last Jedi.
"May 18, 2020",positive,"Certainly the best of the three. Not great not terrible. It's more fan focused this time. Which is fair. Give the people what they want. Its rushed. Very rushed. I cant get everything. There was nothing that made me really angry here at least. But it's nowhere near the original trilogy. Or even the other starwars media such as the Clone wars TV show ect. Music is fantastic as always.

Its meh."
"May 18, 2020",positive,"It's a good state wars movie...
It's definitely unlike anything we come to expect 
I recommend watching it with an unbiased broad view towards Disney star wars instead of comparing kit to previous installments"
"May 18, 2020",negative,A quite unsatisfying end to a giant inconsistent mess of a trilogy...
"May 18, 2020",positive,Considering the crap of TLJ and the vacuous A New Hope copy that was TFA - I kind of loved it. Ridiculous stuff at the end though and ridiculous closer.
"May 18, 2020",negative,"C'est une mauvaise suite a l'épisode 8 et même a l'épisode 7 et une mauvaise conclusion a la trilogie et la saga. Le film est plein d'incohérences, tout le potentiel qu'il avait est gâché. Le film est bâclé et n'a répondu a aucune de mes attentes. Cela dit, c'est un plutôt bon divertissement. Pour finir, je décrirais ce film comme un ramassis bâclé de fan-fiction ridicule"
"May 18, 2020",negative,Rise of Skywalker ruins previously established Star Wars Canon. The idea of Force Healing ruins the whole plot of the prequels. Bringing Palpatine back was a weak idea and it yet again proves that JJ Abrams can't come up with an original idea.
"May 18, 2020",negative,"Disney ruined this franchise, they used bringing back the emperor as another way to get fans in the theater and grab cash quick. JJ just read the Star Wars legend books and threw it in the rise of skywalker."
"May 17, 2020",negative,"It was ok when watching it in theaters, but when rewatching it, I realized it's pretty boring and the plot sucks.

A lot.

also they brought back Palpatine, ruining the 1000-year-old prophecy of the Chosen One"
"May 17, 2020",negative,The somewhat entertaining tragedy of poor writing and bad choices.
"May 17, 2020",negative,That was the biggest puddle of dog diarrhea I've ever seen. I could eat a bowl of alphabet soup and crap out a better story than that garbage.
"May 17, 2020",negative,Horrible horrible horrible movie and especially acting
"May 17, 2020",negative,"What a mess. All the potential, three movies, and only one that’s coherent. This one is better than the second in this trilogy, but that’s faint praise. Just more ridiculous things slapped together and no sympathetic characters so no earned emotions. I felt much more emotion watching “LEGO: Batman” than through this entire trilogy. "
"May 17, 2020",negative,"Nice story elements, but there was absolutely zero flow to the film. Everytime I got interested in the plot, there was an abrupt scene change.

This like the movie was directed by a squirrel."
"May 17, 2020",negative,"Movie is entertaining but It's a lot of bullshit made up on the spot acting like it was planned from the start but really wasn't. A lot of people give this movie a pass because it was trying to ""fix"" the last jedi and a lot of people actually like this movie because it ""fixed"" the last jedi and/or ripped on it but I think this movie and this trilogy could've been great if they didn't try to please everyone, had a plan from the start, and actually owned up to what they made instead of making a movie to ""fix"" the last jedi and in the process rip on it at the same time. best way to describe this movie is a dumpster fire. Whenever I think of this movie and the sequels as a whole, I just get disappointed and sad."
"May 17, 2020",negative,Rubbish - yet still better than the last two.
"May 17, 2020",negative,"More plot holes than ships that magically appear at the end of the movie. 

Absolutely garbage fan service from start to finish. Giva meesa Jar Jar over this."
"May 17, 2020",positive,"The movie has some plot holes. However, the emotional impact and the overall entertainment value makes your forget about it as you watch. It's an epic adventure and conclusion to the Skywalker Saga. I will miss these characters greatly."
"May 16, 2020",negative,"This movie sucked first of all the diologue was terrible it made it sound like a mix between a Disney show like Austin and ally, and an SNL comedy special. Disney is trying to remake the hype the original trilogy got, by remaking Han Solo as Poe Damon, and kilo ren as darth vader, and Rey as Luke.  In addition the most famous droids in the Galaxy both R2 and C3PO had little to no showtime and hardly a place. To add to this they remade the feud darth maul and Obi Wan had as the feud luke and kilo had. In addition they add in all these stupid little character that have no real importance to the story line (Rose, Finn). In conclusion this show sucked."
"May 16, 2020",negative,A poorly paced movie of story vomit that I am just hoping will become legends so I can forget that it ever happened.
"May 16, 2020",negative,The Saga ended with Return of the Jedi
"May 16, 2020",negative,"The lack of character development, plotholes, plotarmor and the luck of the main cast in every situation is just amazing. The good thing is: I won't look forward to new Star Wars content. What an utter disapointment."
"May 16, 2020",negative,I can't believe how bad the JJ Abrams Star Wars movies have been.  Thank God they are over.
"May 16, 2020",negative,"Yes the film is visually appealing, but the enjoyment stops there.  As a 90's kid I was brought up on the OT and experienced the PT in my youth; both were fantastic.  The story arcs were well thought out and the character development was shown really well in Lucas's Star Wars.  This film however just feels cheap, and comes across as a last ditch effort to finalize and make sense of the Disney trilogy.  Bringing Palpatine back..  His return to the franchise makes Darth Vader's sacrifice completely worthless, it undermines the entire arc of Anakin Skywalker being the chosen one and bringing balance to the force.  More force powers..  Disney forgets that when they introduce something 'new' that it affects everything past and present, some of the main issues found in the OT and PT could have been easily rectified using these force abilities that they've just made up. Disney had potential with the sequels, however after the huge mishandling of the TLJ which split the fan base, the TROS plays it safe with a bland quest like story and uninspiring ending to franchise.  For god's sake please leave KOTOR and the Old Republic alone"
"May 15, 2020",negative,Disney's commercialism ruined the end of the masterpiece series.
"May 15, 2020",positive,So much better than The last jedi! Feels like a true sequel to The force awakens.
"May 15, 2020",negative,"Rise of Skywalker serves up heavy doses of fan service which ultimately fall flat because they lack the emotional resonance of the films they reference. The film jumps quickly from one jaw-dropping visual to the next, hoping the audience won't notice it is taking moments it has not earned--not logically, not emotionally. 

To cite just a couple of many possible examples: Rey's overcome of the villain? It didn't require a hero's journey to overcome a flaw, just a second lightsaber. Finn, Poe, and Rey embracing at the end? We must believe there is an intense bond there because there was witty banter in the first act and, hey, they look like they might be crying.

In the end, Rise of Skywalker is cotton candy--a powerful sensory stimulation, but not filling."
"May 15, 2020",positive,Great film! Made up for the last one and saves the trilogy!
"May 15, 2020",negative,Awful. A poor end to a struggling trilogy
"May 15, 2020",negative,"Ugh. That nearly sums up my reaction to this film. The only reason it gets a full star is because the 8th was worse. That is this movie's only saving grace. I know that a lot of the bad story, character development and premises can be tracked back to the previous shit show but that doesn't mean this movie didn't suck. It was a chore to watch. I literally just wanted to keep skipping ahead because I didn't care what was happening. It is not an engaging or entertaining movie. I won't rewatch even a minute of it on Youtube or while sitting down to marathon Star Wars. It is that bad. Save your money and/or time and rewatch the good Star Wars movies...UGH!"
"May 15, 2020",negative,"Spoiler Alert:


At the end of the movie, when rei kills palpatine, Jar Jar Binks should have come from the shadows behind the throne ""Yousa thought he was da sif lord, but noo, ita was meesa"" and proceed to butcher rei.  kylo, instead of getting out of the hole, slinks back down after seeing the horrific sight.  rebels lose, set up for next movie w/ Jar Jar Binks as main villian.  Ende"
"May 15, 2020",neutral,Its flashy and fun to watch but by the end its too convoluted with plot holes. Too many things are vaguely unexplained or not at all. So many things feel un earned due to lazy writing.
"May 14, 2020",positive,"I was pleasantly surprised at how well the Rise of Skywalker handled Leah and her part in the saga despite Carrie Fisher  passing away over a year before principal photography began on the movie.  I am glad they built scenes around footage they had previously filmed of her in character and were able to complete her story that way.  The movie did seem to jump and fly at times too quickly and in a seemingly random way but after having seen it twice the movie did a very good job of tying up lose ends and carrying the observer through the entire saga to its conclusion.  

I did not like ""The last Jedi"" at first but after going back and watching it probably about 3 times my attitude has changed and I do like it.   I love the way Luke shows up towards the end to stand up (even if he was a type of telepathic holographic form) against the 1st Order and allow the Rebel Alliance to escape certain destruction at the hands of the Empire.  I loved the way Yoda showed up and worked  Luke through the problems he had with handling the Force and how his fears were probably the one thing most effective in holding him back from his potential.   The conflict and yet connection between Kylo and Rey was very interesting and I knew it would play a big part in the ""Rise of Skywalker"" as it did.

This is also what Luke had to convey to Rey as he appeared to her in ""Rise of Skywalker"" that she had to turn lose of her fears.  She had to realize that she was NOT alone.  Every Jedi that ever lived was alive in her now.  She had much more power and capability than she ever imagined.  She WAS up to the challenge.

If you like Star Wars as I do,   If you liked all of the first three and at least tolerated the prequil trilogy of Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones, and Revenge of the Syth,  and if you had any appreciation at all for The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi I believe you will appreciate this film.   It is not perfect but it does a GREAT job of wrapping things up.

One of my favorite things about this film is that they made a part for one of the greatest musical composer, conductors, and score writers in history John Williams in the movie.  There is a little shot of John Williams as a repair tech working on a set that included an artifact drawn from every film he has scored and that has been nominated for an academy award.  This included Jaws, Star Wars, Schindler's List, Home Alone, The Patriot, Fiddler on the Roof, Memoirs of a Geisha, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, Saving Private Ryan,   It was a real treat to see him in the movie now as an Actor even though the above referenced music covers a period of over 60 years and his age is over 90 years old.

This movie gets two thumbs up from me.  I enjoyed it and would recommend it to any Star Wars fan."
"May 14, 2020",neutral,1st it must be said it was impossible to delivery a quality ending after TLJ. As expected ROS failed to close out the Skywalker trilogy in an enjoyable way after a promising start with TFA. This movie had potential but ultimately found itself catch in-between trying to walk back some of the more questionable decisions from episode 8 while at the same time advancing the current story. That level of ambition was far too much for a 2.5hr film. In the end it didn't do enough to retcon episode 8 and didn't leave enough screen time to tell a competent story. Which was the worst case scenario.
"May 14, 2020",neutral,"The whole movie feels like it's riding off of past movie themes instead of creating something new. When it does attempt to create something new, it dumps the information into the movie without any past explanation of evidence of it existing before this movie. Even with that in mind, the movie still has amazing action sequences and effects that fill the movie with eye pleasing scenes."
"May 14, 2020",negative,"Watched it 3 times hoping that somehow, somewhere I would find some redeeming quality in this movie...but it doesn't exist.  This movie is terrible, but I guess it is a fitting end to the dumpster fire that was the trilogy headed by Kathleen Kennedy, Rian Johnson, and J.J. Abrams - for that reason alone I give it a half star.  Otherwise, it deserves no star."
"May 14, 2020",positive,Decent movie considering it had to wipe out all the sh*t of the Last Jedi!
"May 14, 2020",negative,A visual and narrative trainwreck. This film was the feature-length cinematic equivalent of losing my religion.
"May 13, 2020",negative,"This movie ruins Star Wars. Luckily I can look past this trilogy and watch the original 6 films in peace; however, this film implements TRASH writing and GARBAGE storytelling to convey what seems like a 16 year old's fan fiction brought to life with millions of Disney dollars. Palpatine's return after Ep 6 fundamentally destroys nearly 30 years of Star Wars character development and story. To enjoy this movie is a SIN

My Rating: Bad"
"May 13, 2020",negative,The overall result is nothing but pure fan service crap.
"May 13, 2020",negative,"JJ Abrams returns to conclude the entire Skywalker Saga. And it went... not good.
First, let's get the positives away. Star Wars Episode 9: The Rise of Skywalker looks really beautiful. The VFX's are amazing.
And the score. The score is also amazing. But what would you expect with John Williams.
And then nothing else makes sense. Sure there is some good moments thrown in here and there, but there are not many of them. 
And don't make me start on Palpatine..."
"May 13, 2020",negative,I'm upset I even tried
"May 12, 2020",negative,Rian gave JJ nothing to work with so this was all retcon to try to bring back the fans Johnson alienated.  Didn't work.
"May 12, 2020",positive,Don't care what others say I frickin love this movie.
"May 12, 2020",negative,Anti climax to the new trilogy with many unanswered questions on the story and characters. tried watching again last week and found myself watching you tube videos halfway through. Just not worth watching full stop
"May 12, 2020",negative,"Wow this was bad... it wasn’t even “so bad it’s funny”, it was just boring"
"May 12, 2020",negative,The worst Star Wars film. Doesn't even feel like a franchise movie.
"May 12, 2020",negative,"If you are looking for a movie with little substance or weight, cheap fan-service moments and dialogue overflowing with exposition, then you'll likely love The Rise of Skywalker.

The ROS blatantly retcons and undermines the message of The Last Jedi. Instead of continuing the narrative set before it, the movie spends most of its time attempting to make a group of angry fans who would rather relive old moments happy, than explore the endless possibilities of Star Wars stories.

While visually stunning with moments that are fun and enjoyable, the movie is mostly forgettable. The face-paced nature of the movie has you jumping from one place to the next while using expositional narrative to carry its story.

The character arcs also created by The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi are almost completely undone. For example, Finn no longer cares about the rebellion but his concern is again, only on Rey and the possibilities of his story as an ex-stormtrooper are wasted. Similar things can be said for Rey and Po and characters of significant importance, like Rose, are sidelined for the sake of appeasing fans.

This movie had the potential to be a movie that could have been a groundbreaking conclusion to the Skywalker saga. Instead, J.J. Abrams plays it safe and misses the opportunity. Ultimately, that is why this film will fade from memory and will be overlooked by many in the future."
"May 12, 2020",negative,Thank you for ruining the Star Wars trilogy
"May 11, 2020",negative,"From a technical point of view, it's an amazing action packed movie; with intense sounds to great visuals. That's all that's going for it...

Really, it's a difficult and messy story that doesn't explain much, and concludes on probably the most dreary of notes, thus resolving - well - not a whole lot. There are more questions than answers, making this probably the most disappointing of this new trilogy."
"May 11, 2020",negative,"They tried so hard to make it good, and yet it doesn't show, it was predictible and ridiculous at some parts, the only thing i can't define yet is if this was worst than the last jedi"
"May 11, 2020",negative,"Horrific plot. 

Zero work was done on creating any meaningful character development. By the end of the movie, there was no reason to be attached to the characters, and so the producers seemed to choose instead to amp up the XTREME Xcitement to eleven by making MORE SHIPS with BIGGER GUNS and BIGGER LIGHTNING and BIGGER LASERS than EVER BEFORE, rather than by creating any sort of character we cared about.

Additionally, the plot was painfully contrived, deeply inconsistent, and woefully pointless.

This movie is loud and meaningless.

Shame on you, Kennedy. You somehow made a worse piece of garbage than either of the two preceding dumpster fires."
"May 11, 2020",negative,"86% 
uf people, did you watch the same movie that I watched?
Crap crap crap."
"May 11, 2020",negative,"I'll first say, to Abram's credit, the prelude reveal in the title scroll illustrates exactly what you're in for, lighting the exit sign for every fan and casual movie goer.

Incoherent action sequences and blaring fan service are the least of this movie's  problems, with rampant ex machina being some of its most egregious.

It simply doesn't bother to tell a story. It is supplemented content to tie up pesky plots and subplots, patch together diverging narratives, and retrofit a dramatic conclusion. I won't start in on the unsolicited MacGuffins that serve as plot linchpins. 

The Rise of Skywalker is a masterclass in unnatural dialogue, poorly developed characters, shameless plot devices, and flawed structure. Every film and screenwriting student has something to learn here, and for that reason and that reason alone this movie justifies it's existence."
"May 10, 2020",positive,"Was a movie of contradiction. Was not a great ending to the saga. The movie felt rushed. The ending to the movie was okay. I wish Chewy or C3PO actually died instead of magically surviving. Also they shouldn't have made the Tie Fighters into triangles that made no sense. Also the jokes weren't that good. Also, did the JJ Abrams lose his memory and forget what Finn was going to tell Rey. In the end it just didn't up making a good movie."
"May 10, 2020",negative,"I went into it hearing all the bad reviews...and i think the worst part is...i will probably forget most of this movie in the next day or two.

I remember the prequels because there was something to remember but...this one? nothing. at all. it was...sorely lacking. in many ways. the end is unsatisfying, the deaths in the movie...the emotional payouts aren't there; it's just...a movie that seems to me to be there for the name only.

Now, the actors did good, won't deny that, but a good actor can only do so much with a script. There were things that were left hanging and...given my general overall detachment from this part of the Star Wars Saga...I won't be buying supplemental materials because...I don't care enough after watching all three movies and the ending to this one to actually find out the answers to my questions."
"May 10, 2020",negative,"Rian Johnson has made some great films, but the last Jedi sure isn't one of them. In an attempt to fix what Rian started, Abrams made some quick decisions and some strange and out of place plot choices to try and fix the problem. It didn't quite work. It wasn't his fault entirely, I blame Disney, and Rian for a wasted finale to the beloved franchise. Disney should have left Abrams to continue his world building and stayed with the director that was so successful at the force awakens. Rian Johnson just wasn't the right director for the job with the outlandish choices he made in the last Jedi and as unfortunate as it is, Abrams's rebound from that didn't work."
"May 10, 2020",positive,I hate TLJ with a passion. Glad JJ was able to fix the mess Rian left behind.
"May 10, 2020",positive,"The sequel trilogy will go down as a prime example of the importance of building a road map when you plan on having multiple movies tell a single story.  It's painfully obvious that they did not have one, which makes for a somewhat frustrating finale.  Still, The Rise of Skywalker manages to deliver an enjoyable, action-packed adventure that gives closure to this roller-coaster of a trilogy."
"May 10, 2020",neutral,"There was so much crammed into this that an unrelenting series of increasingly incredible coincidences were necessary to link things together and make the plot work; never a good sign. Everyone just happens to find everything they need instantly, exactly the right people randomly appear for no apparent reason at exactly the right time, etc. It actually had me laughing at how silly it all was.
The action sequences were mostly fast and cartoonish in that there was so much destruction but few of the good guys even got hurt, whereas for the bad guys it was unrelenting carnage. Stormtroopers and First Order ships were just there to get shot and blown up, without ever accomplishing anything or even being a credible threat. The Emperor's force lightning, apparently now so amazing powerful that it can selectively target and cripple hundreds of good-guy ships scattered among the bad-guy ships, once turned off, had no lasting effect; it doesn't even fry their electronics; they just got shook up a bit. Despite some ships shown as being on fire, they all magically get better again as soon as his attack stops. Like I said, cartoonish. It was so silly. Consequently, it's hard to care about any of the characters. More like a computer game set to ""Easy"" mode than a movie."
"May 10, 2020",positive,Very satisfying completion of an amazing journey
"May 10, 2020",negative,No story or plot whatsoever and makes a mockery of the franchise while undoing the former characters successes with lazy cheap writing thrown in
"May 10, 2020",negative,"This is what happens when a Z move has money behind it   
Plenty of explosion but the worst dialogue I've ever heard"
"May 10, 2020",positive,"A strange movie throughout, which brought an unemotional mildly satisfying end to the Disney trilogy. Considering the horrendous setbacks of Episode 8, this movie was a decent attempt to cleanup the plot and wrap up the trilogy on the part of JJ Abrams. it had many setbacks, and many good visuals, but somehow failed to evoke any emotion either positive or negative, despite it being the (current) end to the Star Wars saga."
"May 10, 2020",neutral,"Visually stunning and not as dreadful as The Last Jedi, the Rise of Skywalker is still disappointing in both writing and acting.  Innumerable flaws in continuity and plausibility along with very uneven dialogue left me lukewarm at best."
"May 10, 2020",negative,"omg that was a big pieace of shit, all the decisions of the characters were so annoying and stupid, they have huge budget to make a fucking great movie but what they decide to do? a piece of shit whit good efects"
"May 10, 2020",negative,"The short version: 
This film tried DESPERATELY to be what Avengers Endgame was. And it failed miserably. Lacking the consequences, heart and mystery that builds every star wars movie."
"May 10, 2020",negative,"A Force Awakens was a fun roller coaster that brought back a lot of what I loved about Star Wars, The Last Jedi then pushed the story forward in an interesting way and showed that anyone anywhere could be special without having to be born into it, unfortunately The Rise of Skywalker then backed down or reversed a lot of the interesting decisions Rian Johnson made and gives us a lot of fan service in the hopes of racking in LOTS AND LOTS OF MONEY. It made a billion worldwide so I guess it succeeded. I disagree with a lot of the creative decisions in this movie including bringing back a clone of the Emperor who died in Return of the Jedi - JJ Abrahms is great at reboots but fails to push things forward or give us something new, which is why people had loved Star Wars and Empire to begin with."
"May 10, 2020",positive,"Best movie in the Skywalker Saga. Rey,Kylo, Palpatine unbelievable incredible performances from Daisy Ridley, Adam Driver and Ian McDermid. P.S beautiful use of Leia in this movie and Luke too. GO WATCH THE RISE OF SKYWALKER!"
"May 9, 2020",neutral,This movie is unexciting but the comedic sense to it saves this movie.
"May 9, 2020",neutral,"Whilst several parts of the film appear to go out of their way to destroy the original star wars characters, the second half acknowledges the existence of a better trilogy, and offers a sufficient conclusion with better music."
"May 9, 2020",negative,"Visually stunning, as all modern Stars Wars movies are (thanks Disney!), but there are far too many plot holes to ignore in this failed attempt of a movie."
"May 9, 2020",positive,An absolutely beautiful conclusion to the saga. Wow. 
"May 9, 2020",positive,"Was disappointed in TLJ, but was pleasantly surprised by this film. "
"May 9, 2020",negative,Star Wars:The Rise of Skywalker is the most convoluted Star Wars film that failed to end as a conclusive chapter to the Skywalker Saga.
"May 8, 2020",negative,"Somehow it's even worse than when I saw it at the movie theater! Somehow they introduced like 50 new powers, palpating turned into the god of thunder, and the skywalkers took plapatines side over their own kid. Makes no sense"
"May 8, 2020",negative,"A confusing, non-sensical attempt to conclude a trilogy that was uninspired from the start. It's hard to even know where to begin. The pacing was insanely quick, to the point where they needed to speak exposition to progress the narrative, all of the remaining, previous accomplishments achieved by the PT and OT characters are undone (mostly courtesy of revisionist history). MacGuffin after MacGuffin, this movie is driven forward by the quest for random artifacts that feel bizarre in the Star Wars universe. Characters arcs aren't fleshed out, in fact they reduce the characters back to their basic form (except the Mary Sue who somehow becomes even more powerful than she was in the previous films).  I question how this film made it past the writer's room, because of how incoherent it is. But given the previous 2 films in the trilogy, it seems to be consistent in quality: Garbage."
"May 8, 2020",positive,"The best-paced installment of the ""Skywalker Saga"" is weighed down by unambitious and lackluster storytelling. The most ""creative"" twists come when a character appears dead, but in true Disney fashion, is still alive"
"May 8, 2020",negative,"From insane coincidences, to the flagrant recycling of plot points & characters, this cash grab nearly got me kicked out of an Alamo Theater for laughing too hard.  Amazing special effects, great camera work, mediocre acting all around, and writing worse than an ed edd & eddy episode. If you never knew what star wars was, and watched it on mute, you could enjoy it."
"May 8, 2020",positive,a great way to end this 40-year saga. May The Force Be With You.  Always.
"May 8, 2020",positive,"Rise of the Skywalker has quite a few issues but it also has a lot of good things about it. To see all of the characters fleshed out and finished with their story is heartwarming. It really encaptures the feel of the old Star Wars movies, with some satisfying character arcs. One thing the movie does is abandon all of the stories that have been layed out by the previous two movies to go off in a different direction and there are a few continuity errors. The first 30-40 minutes gave me whiplash but I do really recommend to see the Skywalker saga come to a close."
"May 8, 2020",negative,"Didn't hit the nostalgia button everyone talks about. Saw familiar characters.. oh boy, went no where. Just like the plot of almost any character. Redo of previous movies. No explanations of anything that came about. Ex., palapatine (how?) Rey 'Skywalker' (no?).. Random massive fleet (ok?).. Why did Liea die so suddenly?.. I could go on and on. In short: the visuals were awesome. The story and character development were beyond sub par. Decent movie if you're not a fan of star wars. Horrible if you are. Find a new director."
"May 8, 2020",negative,"There is a bunch of sloppy mistakes like continuity errors and weird edits that individually would not be worth commenting in a comedy but they are so numerous it not only ruins the movie but the whole saga if you consider this part of star wars.

Like a date with a boring supermodel, you get excited and it sounds like a good idea at first."
"May 8, 2020",positive,My absolute favorite Star Wars movie now! I can't stop watching it over and over. What a satisfying way to end a series.
"May 8, 2020",negative,Terrible. Practically a fan fiction written by an 8 year old
"May 8, 2020",negative,It was the worst possible way to end this saga
"May 8, 2020",negative,"Krustytheklownsmoking.gif 
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT!"
"May 7, 2020",positive,This is an amazing conclusion to the Skywalker Saga!
"May 7, 2020",positive,"For almost the first two hours the show was very boring. The ending did breath some life into the film, but...."
"May 7, 2020",negative,"very shit, very very shit"
"May 7, 2020",neutral,The first half wasn't bad at all. The second half is a train wreck and a wildly unfit conclusion (for now) to the Star Wars saga. This is poor writing and directing at its finest.
"May 7, 2020",positive,Loved it. Just need some better writing for Poe.
"May 7, 2020",positive,"LO MEJOR DE ESTA  TRILOGÍA FUE EL DESARROLLO DEL PERSONAJE DE ADAM DRIVER ¨KYLO REN AKA BEN SOLO¨. PORQUE EN EL DESARROLLO DE LA HISTORIA, SU FONDO Y SU FORMA, BROER. DEBE EXISTIR UNA CONSISTENCIA ENTRE UNA PELÍCULA Y LA OTRA, NO PUEDES DEJAR HISTORIAS INCONCLUSAS."
"May 7, 2020",negative,"I loved both The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi (contentious I know!) and had been really looking forward to the conclusion of this trilogy. The first two films seemed to have managed the transition from beloved legacy characters from the original saga and the new cast.  This final movie seemed well set up to focus on Rey, Finn, Poe, Kylo Ren etc and take the story in a completely new direction. 

For whatever reason (from what I have read it was a reaction to criticism directed from fans towards The Last Jedi) most of the ideas and themes set up in the Last Jedi are jettisoned in The Rise of Skywalker and instead of a progression this film regresses and gives us a Star Wars by numbers movie, rehashing old themes and forcing in old characters who do not really advance the plot and would probably have been better placed in one of the previous instalments (Lando) or not at all (Palpatine). Whilst The Force Awakens did basically follow the same structure as the original Star Wars films it managed to feel fresh;  the inclusion of beloved characters worked as their connection to new characters was well constructed, they advanced the plot, gave the film a huge amount emotional centre AND we had the promise of where the exciting new characters would take us. 

For me The Rise of Skywalker was completely inconsistent with the previous two films, did not conclude the story arcs of any of the new characters to anything like a satisfactory conclusion and rendered the conflict between Rey and Kylo that had been well developed across two previous films a limp side note rather placing it centre stage where (for me) it should have been. The reintroduction of Palpatine was a huge disappointment, made little sense and (again for me) ruined this film as well as tainting the conclusion of the original trilogy in Return of the Jedi. 

Concluding a series as big as this is clearly no easy task and this film seems to have suffered hugely as the filmmakers lost their nerve, backtracked on the groundwork set up in the previous instalment and instead produced a Star Wars by numbers film that left me cold."
"May 7, 2020",positive,"I am a huge Star Wars fan ... I know this did not keep in full line with the trilogy but don't care, i absolutely enjoyed this movie!!  Full Star Wars through and through, much better acting than the pre-quils (of course... what isn't?  Alf was better than those...).  5 stars, well deserved."
"May 7, 2020",positive,"With the bad taste of, the last jedi, still lingering. It took a little bit to get in to it but JJ Adam's did a great job fixing the mistakes and made the movie enjoyable, and restored star wars for me  . Seems like critics have no clue what people like."
"May 7, 2020",positive,"Entretenida, pero a mi parecer, la peor de esta trilogia.
No digo que es pesima, solo digo que las otras dos son mejores, un final que carece de epicidad, y personajes desperdiciados como Hux, y el mismo Snoke, no me gustó el hecho de que fuera un ""titere"" de Darth Sidius. Pudo ser mucho mejor, pero igual la disfruté. No hay pelicula de Star Wars que no me haya gustado."
"May 7, 2020",negative,"Took a franchise that had already ended well, opened it back up, and added more unnecessary content."
"May 6, 2020",positive,Expertly crafted finale to the original Star Wars story. Lacking the fun and charisma of the early installments to does a decent job of wrapping thing up.
"May 6, 2020",negative,"Horrible disappointment to allow Abrams to direct this saga.  I am really surprised that they didn't create a 3rd Death Star to blow up and instead opted to resurrect Palpatine out of the blue instead. 

If ending a meal with the worst possible dessert in the world to leave the taste of lifelong disappointment in your mouth is how you want to remember the evening, plug your nose and grab a spoon to gag on.

My only hope is that someone, some day who can tell a legitimate and coherent story will revisit the last couple of installments to do Stat Wars justice."
"May 6, 2020",negative,"Honestly, I felt bad for JJ.  He was effectively written into a corner by The Last Jedi.  When the main bad guy is killed off prior to the final act, it kind of makes it hard to worry about the good guys, especially when the main good guy (or girl) doesn't seem to have any possible chance of losing anyway.  It felt like mediocre fan fiction.  While I appreciate the effort to try and fix what happened in the prior film, it was too much shoved into a single film.  Maybe if JJ had two more films, he might have been able to make it work, but even then I doubt it."
"May 6, 2020",negative,"Film looks good and has some decent, if predicatable, set pieces. Talented people worked on these epics. However, it also has plot holes you can drive a star destroyer through and so many unanswered questions. Most importantly, I just don't care about what happens to the characters, even (and this is heretical) the original ones. Another franchise ruined in the pursuit of $$$ (a tear slides down my gradually aging face). Whatever happened to original storytelling and character development? Oh wait...that would mean taking some risks."
"May 6, 2020",negative,"JJ and Disney make a piece of banta shit:
Shitty script
Shitty characters 
Shitty camera

Good Lord, please make JJ never make new movie in any universe I love."
"May 6, 2020",negative,Mildly entertaining and that's about all.  for the end of a 9 part Superseries...incredibly disappointed!
"May 6, 2020",negative,"WOW! This is how Disney decided to end it? To say it was disappointing would be an understatement. To say it was a rotten, stinking pile of garbage gets closer."
"May 6, 2020",negative,"::Spoiler Alert::  The first 30 minutes or so are kind of fun but once this thing gets rolling, it falls apart quickly. I can get past the fact that a lot of the themes and even characters are recycled if it serves the story but nothing is explained. How did Palpatine survive? How does Ben / Kylo go from a destructive sociopath to all of a sudden being good again? Why would Rey's parents just leave her on a desert planet, with no one of importance / concern to care for her? Who is Palpatine's son? How did Palpatine get a son? What did Finn want to tell Rey that the movie made seem so important? Why did Finn and Rose break up? What is a force diad? What is the diforce? How are people sometimes revived but sometimes die permanently? So many more questions.. But if you like cool graphics, lasers and maybe have never seen any Star Wars pre Episode VII, you may get some enjoyment out of this. Unfortunately for someone who has invested over 30 years in this franchise, this is recycled garbage."
"May 6, 2020",negative,"Absolute crap. I can go on and on about lack of antagonist/protagonist development, rational, story, good acting, good fights and so on, but in reality this movie closed out a trilogy of garbage.
 
JJ Abrams said it best ""You just never really know, but having a plan I have learned–in some cases the hard way–is the most critical thing, because otherwise you don't know what you're setting up. ""

Watch it drunk otherwise its a real challenge and chore to get through in one sitting.

If it was possible I would put negative stars."
"May 6, 2020",negative,"This is the second worst Star Wars movie. Only episode 8 was worse. The story is terrible, the acting is mostly terrible, and the fight scenes are horrific. It's bad enough most of the characters are crappy knock offs of the original trilogy. It's amazing the with Disney money and already tons of great potential story lines the made this shit trilogy."
"May 6, 2020",positive,"TROS tries to fix last film's mistakes with a satisfying ending, but it is not enough to save this trilogy."
"May 6, 2020",positive,I seriously don't get why this was so poorly rated... Wayyyy better than Last Jedi
"May 6, 2020",negative,"Overall, the new Star Wars movies have been very good films, very bad Star Wars. 
Not this one. This was a terrible film, and downright offensive Star Wars. I did not have high expectations, but I did not think this was possible. I don't think any piece of entertainment media has ever pissed me off as much as this dumpster fire."
"May 6, 2020",positive,"Really enjoyed this movie. There were a few corny bits BUT: Healthy dose of action, drama, adventure, and sci-fi. The set pieces were great. The story was good. The acting wonderful and so human. The CGI was great. The star-fights were great. We really cared about the characters and their welfare. 

Solid movie definitely recommend."
"May 6, 2020",positive,"As a final installment in the Skywalker Saga, I think that this wrapped up the narrative very well. We followed our heroes the whole time and barely ever cut away from them. The film was fast-paced, lots of travel, lots of character development moments, and a kick-ass finale. I think that is the best ending to this Saga that we could've gotten, in my opinion."
"May 6, 2020",positive,"4 and a half. The Rise Of Skywalker is a mostly well constructed, cute, funny, emotional sci-fi ride. It has confusing moments, and the action isn't necessarily too mind blowing, like Last Jedi, but at towards the end, the final battle, is where the visuals are really striking and the action is wild. This movie is a bit easier to understand then other ones, too. I might love it. The action and visuals are still fun throughout the film though, with a Stormtrooper surprise......"
"May 6, 2020",positive,It was pretty good but I felt the Last Jedi was better. Rogue One is still one of the best of the newer films. The Force Awakens is the best among the new trilogy. Han Solo had some great moments. Now my wife loved the Rise of Skywalker. But for me it wasn't the best. I was hoping for better.
"May 6, 2020",positive,"Lots of fun to watch. Still not as good as the Force Awakens, but it wraps up the saga nicely."
"May 6, 2020",negative,Return of the Skywalker is a well crafted movie. Too bad the movie is nothing but a mash of fan service and is a knock off Return of the Jedi.  The characters don't make any sense and there's no continuity from the last film.  Truly disappointed.
"May 6, 2020",negative,"From a connected trilogy and universe standpoint, the movie reverts and takes an easy way out of a difficult situation. Appeasement is a terrible policy and one that ruins this movie. However, the film is still amazingly well made and beyond huge plot holes, still has some really amazing individual scenes."
"May 6, 2020",positive,"It's striking how the scores are contrasted in this movie. Themes I enjoyed - The Prodigal Son - Ben Solo/Han Solo; Hope is worth fighting for and dying for; Skywalker's are those who give their life for others. 

I gave 5* because I know Star Wars. If I hadn't seen some of the no -movie story line it would be hard to understand how the Emperor is still alive, etc. and would probably have given it 4* since the story would seem fragmented."
"May 5, 2020",neutral,The script wouldn’t have passed an entry level writing class. Technical aspects were good.
"May 5, 2020",negative,The WORST movie from the entire saga for shure!!
"May 5, 2020",positive,"This film is amazing. I mean, there were problems here and there, the plot was a little bit hit-or-miss, but the characters, the music, the scenery! It was an immersive experience, that while significantly different to other Star Wars films, still gave you a semblance of the same feeling."
"May 5, 2020",positive,It could've been better and I would've given it a higher rating if Disney didn't cut Hayden Christensen scenes out of the movie. Overall it's a decent movie but it's a lot better than the last jedi. I wish Rey wasn't so powerful so fast while it takes other Jedi years to train. Those are my only complaints this movie is decent
"May 5, 2020",negative,"So boring, I just wished to fast forward, A STAR WARS MOVIE? Thats crazy, but true, so bad, just bad."
"May 5, 2020",negative,Same plot gimmicks as other Star Wars movies.
"May 5, 2020",negative,"Terrible, the visuals were there but it honestly didn't feel like star wars, the plot is all over the place and there was never a moment where it made sense, watch the clone wars instead it's better"
"May 5, 2020",negative,"Unfortunately Star Wars is dead in terms of movies folks. 
Whatever Star wars was is gone and whatever this is isn't worth your time."
"May 5, 2020",negative,"What a mess. The plot was just all over place, Force Skype/Teleport made even less sense and Rey was basically a god at this point. Also she killed Palpatine, so why didn't he possess her? Why didn't Palpatine take a suicide pill and then just hop into her body?? I don't even know if I can say it's better than Last Jedi 🤮.

Finally, how is this still at 86%??? I call shinanagans!!!"
"May 5, 2020",negative,Come on. Are they even trying anymore?
"May 5, 2020",positive,"On the back of the bullshit that was The Last Jedi this film starts off very fast paced and with not much meat on the bones. Clearly chasing down and rectifying the errors of its predecessor. 
Not a perfect film to start with but it was needed! Sadly..
When The Last Jedi holes have been plugged as much as can be the film finally starts to get some weight and really picks up! Really enjoyable film, not perfect. Still a few flaws but more in line with the Star Wars universe and gives the story we all wanted following on from The Force Awakens."
"May 5, 2020",negative,"The movie spits in the face of anyone who cared enough to delve deep into the books or comics and have good understanding of the force. Suddenly the new trilogy changed the force to be wizardry with no explanation, rules and limitations. I could forgive anything else, but that is destroying the main foundation of Star Wars.
Also the ""And I am Iron Man"" ending made me cringe."
"May 5, 2020",positive,loved it from start to finnish. a amazing conclution to the star wars saga
"May 5, 2020",negative,Worst movie ever ! :(
"May 5, 2020",negative,"Terrible. Awful writing. Nothing but MacGuffins. Overacted (Adam Driver and Mark Hamill were the only non-cringey  actors). Full of plot holes. I still have no idea what this trilogy was about, it was that bad."
"May 5, 2020",positive,"A very messy film. Tons of plotholes and tons of things never even explained. Which in turn makes a lot of things they were trying to do feel unearned. With all of that being said I was still entertained all the way through, and a couple scenes were actually great to watch. Overall a forgetable below average film to waste the time."
"May 5, 2020",negative,"Tens of thousands of star destroyers magically raised from underneath the surface of a planet, complete with trained crew. Riding bothans in a charge against blaster fire on top of a star destroyer. Ren kissing Kylo. Why? Nothing makes sense here, it's just nice scenery and drama that no one cares about. Does anyone read these scripts at all? What are they paying Bigelow for?"
"May 5, 2020",negative,"The reason why I am giving Rise of Skywalker such a low rating is because it is so incredibly lack luster. This movie follows an extremely formulaic plot. It did not deliver a single challenging moment for the audience; everything it did was nicely wrapped up in a neat little package. The struggles that Rey faces as a character are a copy and paste version of Luke Skywalker's, except far far less convincing. This movie had opportunities to be innovative, but chose the easy path. 
The ending of a trilogy really needs something more than what we got here."
"May 5, 2020",positive,"I for one thought this movie was amazing, I thought it tied up the story very well, definitely a must see for fellow Star Wars fans. Now this is just my opinion, I know some people haven't cared for the past few ones (I loved those ones too) but I really thought it was a great movie, and I think any fellow Star Wars lover should at least see it once🙃. Definitely one of my favorite movies🙂!"
"May 5, 2020",positive,"I don't care what the toxic Star Wars prequels fanboys says about this movie, I liked it, it has a good ending of the saga, great visual effects, Sound and some nostalgia. The story is good but its not my favorite movie. I think this movie fixes The Last Jedi mistakes and I appriciate it, its my 3rd favorite Star Wars movie."
"May 5, 2020",positive,The Rise of Skywalker does have its moments of epicness. But some might say that the only satisfying part was that it ended.
"May 5, 2020",negative,"What a train wreck of an ending. What the devil is going on with this ""instant disappearing"" crap? It was lame in the previous movie and its lame here as well.

A good movie would've had some tragedy such as Rey dying and Ben Solo taking over...like its supposed to be! Noooo....instead we now have Rey ""Fake"" Skywalker. How lame and predictable. I could've slept through the whole movie and told you what happened at the end."
"May 5, 2020",positive,Star Wars Rise of Skywalker (2019) I think I like this film better than Force Awakens but I think that this film proves to me that it is an unnecessary trilogy because basically the ending of the film was resolved in Return of the Jedi and they just retold A New Hope- Return of the Jedi with different characters. I like the visual look of this film. I thought the idea that C-3P0 could not read Sith was dumb. I thought the fact that the Sith language is just Sith rather than another term was unoriginal and not convincing. I thought it was bogus that C-3P0 memory had to be wiped in order to be able to translate Sith. I did like having C-3P0 with a wiped memory but I did not like that that aspect was not played around very much. I was not convinced with the Emperor having a Hidden Imperial fleet with Star Destroyers with planet destroying devices attached onboard. I will admit that I did not feel as upset by this film as I was by Force Awakens or The Last Jedi. I felt like the new characters were cool but they did not have enough to work with to get me invested. I did thing the idea of Hyper space jumping was dumb. I was also not a fan of these new Force powers that are in the film like Ghost Luke Skywalker now able lift up an X-Wing out of the water. Emperor Palpatine able to electrocute a Rebel fleet in the sky by himself. That was bogus and unconvincing. I liked the world building but in some ways it felt smaller rather than bigger. I liked some of the new introduced vehicles in this film. This film did get me going really? A lot. Because they went in directions that are completely unnecessary and bigger does not always mean better. What got me was how many times Ray ditches her friends in this film. Does not even tell her friends where she is going. I thought the Leia scenes were done okay. I wish that we saw more of Ghost Luke and Lando in this film to help with the plot. We saw more of Leia that Lando Calrissian or Luke and that surprised me since the actors Billy Dee Williams & Mark Hamill are still alive so I would have thought that a bigger role would have been give to them. I thought that this film provided a proper resolution to Leia & Han Solo. I was glad that we did get one more scene with Han Solo to give that some resolution. 
"May 5, 2020",positive,"After 5 underwhelming prequals and sequels, the writers finally write a GOOD Star Wars movie! I also mostly enjoyed the Rogue One moviewhich was truer to the original franchise than 1,2,3,7,8. IX Was by far the best Star Wars movie that has been made in the last 2 decades."
"May 5, 2020",negative,The ending was bad. There was no bromance at all!
"May 5, 2020",positive,Since this series had disappointed me I the past I  was very apprehensive. The movie was excellent with great special effects and storyline.
"May 5, 2020",positive,A great conclusion to the Skywalker story. My only complaint is that I had to wait over over 20 years for the ending of the story to be told. However it was worth the wait for it to be done right.
"May 5, 2020",negative,Force healing bad. Movie bad. Bad movie. Bad...
"May 5, 2020",positive,"The movie wasn't too bad, however this is the worst trilogy in Star Wars."
"May 5, 2020",positive,"Fitting ending, reincorporating favorite lines and moments, bringing many stories to a close."
"May 5, 2020",negative,"Right from the title card, I had to ask myself if this was written by a toddler? The plot is convoluted and makes no sense at all. WHY is there a giant fleet of planet-destroying starships? Remember Palpatine, the antagonist that Luke and the rebels fought so hard to defeat? Yeah, he's back just cuz. Like this movie together with the other 2 sequels has ruined Star Wars for me and completely spits in the face of the original trilogy and true Star Wars fans. anyone who gave this movie more than 2 stars was A: someone who doesn't care about Star Wars and just likes action. B: Thinks trolls 2 is an epic cinematic masterpiece but thinks The Lord of The Rings was ""boring"". C: paid by Disney to write a good review. I could go on forever about just how bad this film is and I strongly question how this made it to theatres, maybe the test screenings were conducted with a live Pidgeon audience??? Whatever, I'm done. This movie sucks. Watch the clone wars. and JJ Abram's only talent is ruining things with Star in them."
"May 5, 2020",negative,"Bad, didn't like...."
"May 5, 2020",positive,"I gave it 4 stars cause its NOT The Last Jedi. I believe  they wasted an opportunity,  for instance, being someone who was there when Star Wars first came out in 1977, and it was just called Star Wars, not episode 4, the think that it attracted to me was the battles in space. They could have made the last battle spectacular.  But in the end it was just ... okay. But as far as the story, it was pretty good. Yes answer's were made, but new questions as well. I can give you a lot of flaws , a lot of what they did correct, but I believe the important question is, "" was the ending worth it?"" The answer is yes, definitely yes."
"May 4, 2020",negative,"Poorly made, terrible flow to the story...Absolute dogshit...."
"May 4, 2020",negative,"This movie made NO sense. Ironically, this movie is the opposite of Avengers: Endgame, both semi-finales to huge Disney franchises that came out in the same year. While Avengers: Endgame was slow at times, it was so well done in terms of character development and action (at the end). However, Star Wars: Rise of Skywalker is a clusterfuck. Somehow WORSE than The Last Jedi, the movie is filled with plot holes and rushed plot development (I already found 10 huge plot holes within the first 5 minutes). I would not recommend this film to anyone, except for if you want to make fun at a movie. What makes this film even worse is that the original director's script with concept art leaked and it looked amazing; possibly could have even been the best Star Wars movie since the original trilogy (which, btw, I am not a fanboy of the originals, but this movie is terrible)."
"May 4, 2020",positive,"So I liked more in the film that I didn't. However I have some feedback. 
Awesome parts - Luke grabbing the light sabre, Hans solo returning to speak to kylo. Palpatine repeating old famous lines from the other trilogies. Kylo rens kiss with ray. 
Negatives - I really felt that more could have been done, for example when ray heard all the Jedis voices, why not put them all around her as force ghosts. Each giving her more power, Anakin, obey etc all around her. That would have been awesome. I also felt that it was at some points spoon fed, the original films didn't need to spell it out for you to understand. Overall was much better than the other Disney films."
"May 4, 2020",negative,"I think the worst part about the Disney trilogy is how much potential they had. Like, the Ideas of a stormtrooper turned rebel, and Han Solo and Leia's son being a Sith are fascinating. But they just fucking ruined it by having a board room write the whole thing, and turning it into pure shit."
"May 4, 2020",negative,"No me voy a extender mucho. Si eres fan de StarWars ni la mires. Pobre guión y argumento y ni por asomo es una película de StarWars. Si eres fan y masoquista, plantéatelo como un mundo aparte, si no sufrirás un colapso."
"May 4, 2020",negative,"I will concede that this is not an easy film to make.  However, many of the decisions I felt were offensive.  Forcing new characters in that didn't matter, new Jedi powers, expanding old plots and you're just left with an empty, forgettable mess.  Like many of the remakes this too was a letdown."
"May 4, 2020",negative,"Wow, more Star Wars garbage! It is just a poorly recapitulated story of the original which was great! Acting was mediocre, the plot was tiresome, and I hope we have seen the end of Skywalkers.  Rey was a pitiful excuse for a Jedi, and Kylo-Ren was a lame Sith.  So far the only saving grace for Star Wars lately has been the Mandalorian installment. Don't let JJ Abrams or Rian Johnson touch that one or else it might be ruined also."
"May 4, 2020",negative,"It felt like they fed an AI the scripts of the last 8 movies and told it to churn something out that would please everybody. I really think there was a way to respect the decisions of the last movie while also creating something that more fans would have found satisfying and this movie definitely was not that. The leaked Trevrow script sounds like it would have definitely been a much more satisfying, even if flawed, conclusion to the Skywalker Saga then this trainwreck was. I was really disappointed but at least I have the other movies and tv shows to fall back on and remind me why I fell in love with this series in the first place"
"May 4, 2020",negative,"There is no words that can express how awful this movie was. The plot, the ways they used the force, the acting, the graphics, the battle scenes... Awful... Just pure awful. Everyone that participated in this movie should be ashamed and should have no right to make another movie."
"May 4, 2020",negative,"This movie can really only be described with one word: Garbage. I didn't think the sequels could get any worse, but somehow they managed it. Before ""Rise of the Skywalker"", I was sure the folks at Disney were just throwing random crap together, confident that the Star Wars brand would carry even the worst atrocities. But at this point I can only assume they're deliberately trying to destroy the Star Wars franchise for some reason."
"May 4, 2020",negative,This is painful to watch
"May 4, 2020",positive,Mediocre at best. The characters were shallow and the story is ridden with plot holes.
"May 4, 2020",positive,"Not to be mean or anything, BUT WHY DOES THIS HAVE A WORSE RATING THAN THE PHANTOM MENACE!!!!!"
"May 4, 2020",positive,"There no reason to hate the movie just because it might be the last movie, you gotta like it or hated at the same time"
"May 4, 2020",negative,I liked last two minutes of it. To bad the rest of it was just bad :(
"May 4, 2020",positive,"I've just seen the movie as I was staying away from star wars since ""The Last Jedi"". I agree the first 20-30 minutes are pretty jammed with plot and I'm glad to tell you the rest is nearly a masterpiece... I wish they had a little more cash and time to polish every scene to its fullest! That being said this movie made some really bold choices and is seriously respecting everything that came before it, even ""The last Jedi""! Best one of the three! Gotta see it again with another boycotter... Thank you J.J. for a very good Star Wars movie...."
"May 4, 2020",neutral,"There was a lot riding on this last instalment. The story was crammed and nonsensical, the script was meh, but most importantly there are several points in this movie where some characters should just stay dead. Far too much resurrecting."
"May 4, 2020",negative,"Absolutely terrible jumble mess of a movie. With some good moments, but overall just not good at all. Starts like a hot mess and ends with one of the craziest roller coaster of emotions that make you think they had no idea how to finish this movie. Leaves a bad taste in your mouth even with all the camels in it. Ugh."
"May 4, 2020",neutral,"A very disappointing, unsatisfying end to the Skywalker Saga"
"May 3, 2020",negative,"Despite a stronger story than its predecessor, still a disappointing entry into the Star Wars legacy."
"May 3, 2020",positive,"Better than the Last Jedi, but too much was crammed in (too little too late) - no real character development and farcical repetition.  Great action scenes but its all been done before better in Ep1, 2 and 3."
"May 3, 2020",positive,"I'm in two minds about this movie , the first being I'm not a child anymore so maybe this isn't aimed at an adult audience and also you will never be able to better a new hope or the empire strikes back. 
One of the downsides is Lando was brought it too late in this new triology and really he deserved to be brought in earlier. On a positive, the way Leia was kept in the final instalment despite Carrie Fisher's passing was handled very well."
"May 3, 2020",positive,"The movie was a good movie but it lacked a few major details in my opinion. At the end of the movie when Rey hears all of the past Jedi voices you hear Anakin Skywalker's voice. I was expecting more of Anakin as he was the first Skywalker to become a Jedi. We did see Luke as a force ghost help Rey, but what about Anakin? If he where to ever show up as a force ghost I think the best time would of been just before Rey defeats Emperor Palpatine. Now because Anakin was once Palpatine's apprentice he knew he enough about Palpatine that he could talk to Rey and tell her to get up and they would defeat him together. All the voices do end up giving Rey enough strength and courage to defeat Palpatine on her own, but if Anakin where there to help her the scene would of been much more powerful and stuck with the audience. Now I can't lie and say that all the past Jedi voices telling her to ‘Find the light'‘Get up' and that she was not alone and they had her back wasn't good because it was. Again Anakin would of made it more powerful because not only was he Palpatine's apprentice he was Luke's father and to mention Luke was Rey's master before he passed away. The Rise of Skywalker really did link these last three movies together, but if Anakin was more than just a voice and was a force ghost I feel it would of linked all nine movies as he was the one to start all this. It wasn't just Anakin either it was also Finn. While Finn and Rey are sinking in the sand Finn says he has something to tell Rey. Now most people would be thinking it was ‘I love you', because they thought they were about to die but what if it was something different. At the end of the movie Finn can feel Rey dying ,but only people with potential Jedi powers can sense those things right? Because Finn never told Rey his secret it leaves the audience wondering if his secret was that he was a Jedi all along and that's why he couldn't fulfill his duty as a stormtrooper. Beside Anakin and Finn the movie wasn't bad. A few details here and there, but I would recommend this movie to a Star Wars fan and see what they think. These are just some of my opinions and what I thought could of been better. Star Wars the Rise of Skywalker is a good movie it just had a few tweaks here and there that needed to be adjusted."
"May 3, 2020",positive,Can't go wrong with the newest STAR WARS movie. Especially with JJ Abrams back on board. All expectations are met with the only minor flaw being that it's overwhelming amount of complex space politics can only be completely understood by the most hardcore fans of the franchise.
"May 2, 2020",positive,This movie closes better than the third the saga. At this point it's difficult to be original and popular in the same time. JJ abrahms is a real entarteiner.
"May 2, 2020",negative,"The only character that I care about is kylo ren and I was looking forward to see his arc in this final skywalker saga. But...no...they killed the only remaining skywalker so someone else can be the one!!!
They wasted Adam driver talent for this??!!!!"
"May 2, 2020",negative,Who is to blame the one who wreck the ship motor or the one who crashed it ?
"May 2, 2020",negative,"First, no one cares what the critics think except maybe their mothers, but that just supporting their little person. However, in this case, they are correct. This movie was horrible. I would say it ended the franchise as JJ's reboot of Star Trek did to that franchise.  But to be fair, Ryan did that. The only way to see this movie is because, well, you wasted your life on the last two, so screw it."
"May 2, 2020",negative,"I'm a big Star Wars fan.  This is a bad movie.  It's corny nearly every second that Rey and Kylo Ren AREN'T on the screen.  70% of this movie is cringing to corny lines by the other actors. Finn is THE WORST...everything the character says is stupid or cheesy and the acting is just bad. 
This movie was made for children or for people who like Fast & Furious.  There is nothing good about it...its just a giant waste of time and an embarassment for people who love the franchise.  I'll stick to the originals and Rogue One and pretend none of these other childish garbage films were made."
"May 1, 2020",negative,"This film was better than TLJ but lacks any sense of imagination and uniqueness as a story and a film. JJ spent more time retconning the events of TLJ than actually telling a story. This film is plagued by fan service i.e giving chewie his medal for ANH. If you look as this film by itself it is a decent movie, however if you look at this film in the trilogy and the saga than you start to see some patterns that occur. Overall the film is a disappointing end to the Skywalker saga and you would be better off forgetting about this trilogy."
"May 1, 2020",positive,Great last chapter of the Star Wars Saga!
"May 1, 2020",positive,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Having seen the original in the theater, when I was 14, I have been captivated with each additional movie. I found this to be a fitting ending to the saga, and will be thrilled to add it to my collection."
"Apr 30, 2020",positive,A great way to end the series but sets up a lot of possibilities that do not follow thorugh.
"Apr 30, 2020",negative,"pointless, left literally angry at what they did"
"Apr 30, 2020",positive,Really enjoyed this one.
"Apr 30, 2020",negative,"Bringing back Palpatine turns this film in a wrost film of star wars, destroy all of was constructed in order films."
"Apr 30, 2020",negative,A disappointing end game for a legendary series. Too many holes and lack of continuity. A tragic end to what should have been an epic final. The cinema i watched it at had an underwhelmed audience who drifted off in the latter half of the movie. Should have used the director/ writer from the Mandalorian which was awesome.
"Apr 30, 2020",negative,"Better than 8(obviously) but still a bad movie. The humor is super cringey, the writing is awful, it again tries to feed off nostalgia, the plot is super weak, the visuals are amazing. This movie spends half the time undoing what happened in 8, the other half is less than mediocre. Predictably there is no story arc or character arcs across this trilogy."
"Apr 29, 2020",positive,"After the abysmal film that was The Last Jedi, I went into The Rise of Skywalker pessimistic. But regardless I wanted to see the movie because I am a Star Wars fan and I wanted to give my honest opinion on it. So after renting it on prime video and watching it. To my surprise, I loved the movie. It was entertaining, fast-paced, and action-packed. Most importantly it felt like I was watching a Star Wars movie. It was back to being a space adventure movie about good vs evil. The Last Jedi, while a Star Wars movie, felt more like a miserable nightmare. Rian Johnson, the director of The Last Jedi, subverted expectations, didn't answer any questions, and disrespected the saga. JJ Abrams came in and cleaned up the mess after The Last Jedi.

We get our heroes back working together in Rey, Poe, Finn, C3P0, BB8, and Chewie. We learn about Rey and why she is strong with the force. We finally also get to see her train with Leia. It was also great to see Rey have an internal struggle with figuring out who she is and where she fits in the galaxy. It made her character seem more human. Kylo Ren continues to be the best part of the sequel trilogy. The scenes with him and Rey are the best parts of the movie. We also get more back story with Poe and Finn. C3P0 and Chewie also really get there moments to shine in the movie. Luke Skywalker is back to being the optimistic mentor who respects his father's lightsaber again. I thought they did a great job of handling with Leia after Carrie Fischer passed away. Seeing Lando again was also a nice touch. And the new characters that get introduced (like Zorri Bliss, Babu Frik, Jannah, and General Pryde) are also really good additions to the story. Emperor Palpatine was pretty cool as well. A lot of his senses felt like something out of a Horror movie. The visual effects were outstanding. Especially in the space battle scenes. The lightsaber fight scenes were intense as well. I thought the movie had a nice and fitting conclusion to the trilogy.  

The only issues I had with the movie was the Nights of Ren were underutilized. I would have like to see more of who they are and a bit of there origin. There were some other minor issues here and there but it didn't stop me from liking the movie. 

Overall, I loved Star Wars The Rise of Skywalker. It was nice to have JJ Abrams come in a finish what he started with The Force Awakens. As someone who was personally disappointed with The Last Jedi, Rise of Skywalker really helped patch things up for me. I commend JJ Abrams for doing so. (You could even watch Force Awakens and Rise of Skywalker back to back while plucking out The Last Jedi completely.) This movie and The Mandalorian have reinvigorated my faith in Star Wars. I am looking forward to seeing what comes next. 

Overall score: 9/10"
"Apr 29, 2020",positive,"Great movie with lots of awesome scenes, the ending was weird though."
"Apr 29, 2020",negative,Only good character is kylo ren and his redemption arc was just a crappy rehash of Vader's redemption
"Apr 29, 2020",negative,"A one-dimensional, boring, forgettable, predictable, cliche, derivative, formulaic mess meant to appeal to the lowest common denominator and get the highest box office value. Endgame actually put time, effort, and thought into their franchise, but this feels more like Game of Thrones Season 8. Ridiculous pacing and a parody of its former self. With the cringe comedy of The Big Bang Theory and the manufactured drama of a soap opera, I am baffled as to how professional writers were paid any amount of money to write this movie. No memorable dialogue or reveals, no compelling plot points, and nothing of substance. Maybe the back and forth between Rey and Kylo was okay, but that's it. Feel free to take a bathroom break at any point."
"Apr 29, 2020",negative,"No risks taken, weak story (and I mean WEAK. It is even STUPID at some points, nearly as bad as the last Jedi), uninteresting characters and everything seems rushed. You don't even get time to breathe or even try to understand the plot."
"Apr 29, 2020",negative,The movie felt like they were trying to save the story from the garbage that Rian Johnson put it in.
"Apr 28, 2020",negative,"Wow this movie is hilarious! It doesn't quite scale the comedic heights of that chuckle inducing  masterpiece, 'The Last Jedi', but it's still pretty funny never the less. I would say it's a little strange that Disney would take arguably the greatest sci-fi movie franchise in history, and turn it into a comedy franchise, but few could argue that they're not funny. Also very pretty. The rise of Palpatine is a comedy of epic coincidences, that once again is stunning and brave in the way it has dealt with the franchise cannon, and total disregard and seemingly hatred for any of the origional characters and massive passionate fan base. 
If I were to walk into my favourite steakhouse, order (and pay for) a steak, only to be told that, no you're  wrong, you're getting the fish, then I would have to leave and never support that business again. Same here, I walked into my favourite sci-fi franchise and paid for some great swashbuckling sci-fi adventure, with gripping plots and characters I cared about. At least twice now I have been sold a comedic turd. Vacant and soulless. Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, still shame on you. Disney killed Star Wars. RIP."
"Apr 28, 2020",negative,"This film is a fitting example of how a billionaire corporate company can annihilate something that was something short of a masterpiece (the original trilogy). This film was an insult, not just to the fans but to the universe's creator, George Lucas. He entrusted Disney to continue what he sold in a hope that his films will go on, only for his ideas and story to be completely shot down into flames, casting him out of having any say in what was to happen to his own franchise. They spent the majority of the film retconning every tiny mistake Rian Johnson created in The Last Jedi, meaning the film felt more like damage control than an actual story being put in place. The lightsaber battles were bland and had no emotional connection to the characters I felt. The choreography wasn't great, but was definitely an upgrade from The Last Jedi's choreography. One of the only redeeming qualities this film holds is the great score composed by John Williams, shame this was his last one. The film was nice to look at, at certain times. This film manipulated the audience by using nostalgia from the previous films as a walking stick to get from start to the finishing line, and god is it noticeable. It completely derails character arcs such as Finn's and Rey, but most of all, the prophecy of Anakin Skywalker. Watch the film at your own risk. What a terrible way to end the saga, it didn't land nor did it do the character's justice or its predecessor films. This was awful."
"Apr 28, 2020",positive,Without Rey it's nothing but still not enough to make it worth the name Star Wars.
"Apr 28, 2020",negative,"Terrible pacing, ridiculous (even for a science fiction/fantasy) plot, retread of long dead emperor, a massive secret fleet ? Who are the crew of this massive fleet? You'd think they'd show a commander, no? Ray's self discovery continues, boringly.... Just tiresome nonsense with some obligatory light saber fights bla bla bla."
"Apr 28, 2020",negative,"A very lacking experience, with numerous plot-holes, the whole thing just redid everything the other two did wrong but worse. Every new character was just like Phasma - does nothing then disappears. The story was confusing, and a lot happened that made no sense. I can't really get into it without spoiling anything, but the movie was quite lackluster.

Of course the CGI and special effects were great, but for story, the movie is a waste of time."
"Apr 28, 2020",positive,We loved this movie! If I could give it 10 stars I would!
"Apr 27, 2020",negative,This movie was mediocre because of how things just didn't make sense.
"Apr 27, 2020",negative,Disgraceful conclusion to the Skywalker Saga.
"Apr 27, 2020",negative,Felt very forced. It really felt like that they were forcing a new plot.  As a longtime Star Wars fan I am very disappointed. And on a new note where was Hayden Christensen? 🤣
"Apr 27, 2020",positive,"It is far from the best SW movie but the acting is great it is very entertaining,  It could have been an amazing movie but it's to short runtime made it average."
"Apr 27, 2020",negative,Disney garbage for the canon will not be considered. In the oven such a story. This cancels all the first six episodes.
"Apr 27, 2020",neutral,"WARNING: THERE ARE SPOILERS HERE

Overall, this movie was disappointing. If it wasn't a Star Wars film, I would have liked it. But this just didn't follow a Star Wars logic. I'm not saying all Star Wars films have to be the same, but this just had so many plot holes that a regular Star Wars movie wouldn't have. The story in general was just stupid and rushed. If you know Star Wars, you know that Palpatine was killed by getting thrown off of the Death Star. And somehow, without explanation, TROS brought Palpatine back. Bringing a dead character back is stupid, and without explanation? Come on! That was the biggest plot hole for me, but there were many others. In the last Star Wars film, The Last Jedi (which was even worse than TROS), our hero Luke Skywalker had passed away. Jedi can come back as force ghosts, and Luke did. But here's the thing: force ghosts cannot interact with the real world. They can talk to certain people, but they cannot use the force on real things in the real world. Anyway, the ghost Luke used the force to lift a ship out of the water for Rey. Let me say that again. The ghost Luke used the force to lift a ship out of the water for Rey. In Star Wars, that cannot be done! It does not apply to Star Wars logic! Another thing I didn't like about TROS was the unoriginality. Kylo Ren was the antagonist, but in the end, he became good. I wouldn't have a problem with that- if it were original. In the original Star Wars trilogy, Darth Vader became good! Making Kylo Ren come to the light side was so cliche and unoriginal! For me, you can only do that with one character in this franchise- and that character was Darth Vader. My very last error I would like to talk about is simply the fact that things happened way too fast. It was almost impossible to follow the story. They just jumped right into it without any sort of development. As much as I would like to go over more plot holes, I will now go over what I did enjoy. For all Star Wars movies, the music is great. I could say the same about TROS. John Williams has once again done a good job. Another thing I liked was the action. The one fight where Rey fought Kylo Ren was probably one of my favorite parts of the whole movie. There were plenty more good action scenes as well. My overall review for this movie is 2.5 stars out of 5."
"Apr 27, 2020",positive,It's good. ‏‏‎ ‎‏‏‎ ‎
"Apr 27, 2020",negative,"Terrible film in a terrible sequel series. Why did fans like this? Oh yeah, blind nostalgia."
"Apr 27, 2020",negative,"I was disappointed in many aspects of this film. I wasn't a fan of the new force that can teleport objects. The entire series the New Order had been likened to Nzis (from outfits, to speeches, to how they walked), which would make Kylo Ren Hitler.  5 minutes after Kylo reforms himself Rey kisses him. What?? If you value your time skip this film"
"Apr 26, 2020",positive,All I can say is the critics got this one wrong. This was actually good.
"Apr 26, 2020",positive,"Dirigida a todos sus fans, ésta película es desenfrenada desde los prólogos y se hace lugar por si misma omitiendo varios cosas de The Last Jedi. Por esto, en distintas ocasiones, la trama se ve bastante ayudada por distintas casualidades. A pesar de todo, mantiene un alto nivel de efectos especiales y la espectacularidad que caracteriza a Star Wars, llevando así a un gusto final para la saga y los fanes, pero no tanto para los críticos de películas."
"Apr 26, 2020",negative,"Better than the last one... on most aspects... but huge plot holes and filled with Deus ex machina. Bland conversations and cheesy feel good actions that are quite ridiculous. It relies almost only on nostalgia because of their incompetence of creating a credible Star Wars atmosphere. Sad. 
The best thing would be to pretend this new trilogy never existed."
"Apr 26, 2020",negative,"Mira, de momento no puedo aprobar esta película, y no solo por su horrible guión, sino por el hecho de que este se siguiera. Esta cinta demuestra que nunca hubo un verdadero peso creativo en la nueva saga, que nadie llevaba el timón y algunos de los que prentendían hacerlo ni se molestaron en intentarlo de verdad. Un guión tan absolutamente garrafal y mal construido deberia estar prohibido viniendo de lo que se supone ser una de las mejores compañías del mundo (Disney), la parte de la industria más relevante (Hollywood) y una de las franquicias mas influyentes de la historia. Es una verguenza. No lo digo como fan solo, sino como creador también.

La salva algun que otro momento entretenido y grandes efectos especiales, punto."
"Apr 26, 2020",positive,I loved it and I just can't understand this critic score at all I think this was an amazing movie and a heart touching and emotional end to trilogy if not saga.
"Apr 26, 2020",positive,It was alright. Not the best. Better tho than The Last Jedi.
"Apr 25, 2020",positive,"This was the only sequel trilogy member I actually enjoyed. The Force Awakens failed to excite me much, while I frankly disliked The Last Jedi. I'll say it's among my top 3 of the total 9, sitting at maybe #2 overall.

It reeks of fan service, but hey, I am a fan."
"Apr 25, 2020",positive,"When watching the movie, there was a lot happening to take in. Yes, I feel the movie answered many questions, and yes I also do feel The Rise of Skywalker ties in nicely with The Force Awakens, therefore leaving out The Last Jedi which to me is great."
"Apr 25, 2020",negative,Boring boring boring boring...need I say more? What shameful ending to an original masterpiece
"Apr 24, 2020",negative,"Made no sense, horrible plot decisions when there were so many other good ways to go."
"Apr 24, 2020",positive,Not a perfect film but it exceeds in what it's trying to do
"Apr 24, 2020",positive,"My review of this movie may be controversial, but I loved this movie. I think I almost passed out from the action, which I loved. There was so much to answer, and they answered all of it. One downside was that they tried to fit too much in, but that didn't hurt the movie too much. It was just a masterpiece and a great way to end a saga going for 42 years."
"Apr 24, 2020",negative,Rushed and chaotic. Filled with plot holes and breaks what was previously stablished for its own nonsense benefit. Not trully planned nor a real Star Wars story.
"Apr 24, 2020",positive,A fairly good movie but the problem with Star Wars is they kill so many people like it is all in a days work and on every planet they never use space suits which is ridiculous. The movie was rushed and could have been a hour longer.
"Apr 24, 2020",negative,"It's so sad, so many childhood memories destroyed, and it gets worst than that"
"Apr 24, 2020",positive,"I laughed through the first two hours. It was like someone created a list of all the Star Wars characters and best moments instead of doing some serious writing, and the producers accepted it. After two hours, the movie caught my attention like any good movie. I would watch this again for the laughter snd the quality ending."
"Apr 23, 2020",positive,"I really liked it when Rey was revealed to be a Palpatine. what I don't really like about the film is I feel like at the beginning when Poe and the crew were lightspeed skipping, I feel like that was a bit rushed. But other than that I really liked the film. Good Job guys!"
"Apr 23, 2020",negative,O MY God... Disney completely  killed all of George Lucas's work and creativity from my point of view. I wish I could have unwatched the trilogies that came after the death of Darth Vader.
"Apr 23, 2020",negative,"Terrible. Just as the two movies before that one. Just like George Lucas said: ""There is nothing new."" Just a boring collection of stuff stolen from the first three (good) movies."
"Apr 23, 2020",neutral,That is not how the Star Wars sequel trilogy ends.
"Apr 23, 2020",negative,This movie throws everything we that was abstablished out the window and saids ha no. Every single scene in this movie made me think that makes no sense and that stupid. The characters in this become kinda boring to watch. Force healing is one of the stupidest thing added in this and this movie doesn't deserve to be called a star wars movie
"Apr 23, 2020",positive,"I was hoping that for the end of the Star Wars saga, the final chapter would have been spectacular. But I was sadly disappointed in this film...after all of the hype, this film did not live up to the expectations of the ""Final"" Star Wars film or the ""conclusion"" of the main Star Wars chapters.  

The movie was not terrible, and I would recommend watching this film if you are a fan of Star Wars, but it was disappointing how the final chapter was scripted, particularly the storyline was not surprising whatsoever.  

I would give this 2.5 stars if not for the excellent acting by the cast, and the fact that it is the final Star Wars film from the main storyline."
"Apr 22, 2020",negative,jj you failed us. you tried to please everyone and yet you pleased no one. i am numb from this being the last star wars episode. this gave me no hope. palpatine won in the end. all the skywalker s are dead
"Apr 22, 2020",negative,"It was an awful film, mainly because of the comedic film before it (The Last Jedi).  If The Last Jedi had followed what The Force Awakens set up, then this might have been a good conclusion.  Bringing back Palpatine was just desperate by Disney and Abrams.  Shockingly bad film.  Luke raises the X Wing which he should have done in Last Jedi, Rey gets taught by Leia etc etc. Very poor film.  I do not recommend anyone to watch this.  The Force Awakens and Rogue One are the only decent Disney Star Wars to watch.

The building of the Star Destroyers was also desperate, and they were built underground.  They don't know the way up?  Anything that goes away from the earth they just rose up out of is up.  ""They can't tell which way is up out there"". What an awful script, awful story, which followed on from the ruins of The Last Jedi.  Terrible film and terrible sequel after The Force Awakens."
"Apr 22, 2020",negative,Oh boy just terrible.
"Apr 22, 2020",negative,"I went to the theatre thinking to myself :"" well the last jedi was bad, but maybe this last movie will have more action, a better story an well ... more star wars"" but honestly it barely felt like anybody thought about the plot or the characters. The movie is full of moments that are made to make newborn babies laugh but if you're any older than two weeks it's just taking you out of the story. Honestly, it's still better than the second one but, even with all the action in the movie I just found it boring and uninteresting. It just felt like I was watching a bad parody movie that was supposed to copy star wars. It was just sad."
"Apr 22, 2020",negative,"Not even so bad it's funny, it's just bizarre. This is nothing about pleasing hardcore fans and pissing off others, it is just an out and out badly made film. Unwatchable."
"Apr 22, 2020",negative,"No. Wanted to like it, I really did. Just no."
"Apr 22, 2020",negative,"Was expecting it to be along the lines of Rogue One but it really left a lot to be desired. I do have to admit, it was better than the Last Jedi. Not much but a little"
"Apr 21, 2020",positive,I feel that since the Force Awakens the films haven't been as good and sadly this film falls into that category. Emperor Palpatine is one of my favourite Star Wars characters but I felt underwhelmed about his return. I feel the previous films were so good why introduce old characters like Emperor Palpatine. But what I really disliked was that Rey is now a Skywalker. That bothered me.
"Apr 21, 2020",negative,"This is quite possibly, literally the worst movie I have ever seen.  Every frame is an insult to cinema.  Every line is vacant, every scene vacuous.  The pacing challenges the best of human perception - one really needs multiple viewings to take in the full breadth of mediocrity on offer. Imagine Batman 4ever but with 5x the budget and zero imagination and you just had a passing thought that is more cohesive that this movie.  If all of the errors, disappointment, failure, and unresolved potential of Season 8 of Game of Thrones could be distilled into a single movie it would not be near as unsatisfying and distasteful as this movie.  This movie is an insult to the human spirit.  I put more effort into this bs review than the writers put into the script.  I can't believe this movie was actually made.  This is real?  This fugin movie was actually filmed, edited, and realeased..."
"Apr 21, 2020",negative,"the good people always win, the bad people always lose, also good people never die and also bad people always die. but i don't get it why you kill the bad guy who came back to light. damn i love that character. come on break the rules make some different. That's get more and more predictable."
"Apr 21, 2020",positive,"For a movie, It was good. As a fan though, this is more that just any movie. If a certain important main character hadn't been killed off at the end, I'd give it a five."
"Apr 21, 2020",negative,"Many of the issues with The Rise of Skywalker don't stem from actual problems with the film, but more so Abrams and company trying to retcon everything the previous director had done with The Last Jedi, instead on focusing on making the literal last film in a saga and delivering on it. This trilogy's strong point was in its beginning, with The Force Awakens, and with a director-change, it feels so discombobulated. I won't even get in to the fact of how disappointing the return of Emperor Palpatine is either."
"Apr 21, 2020",negative,Nothing like the original StarWars.....story line all over the map....
"Apr 20, 2020",negative,"Driver and Ridley were reasonable. The rest of the acting was questionable at best. The script and plot were horrible. Cinematography and sound track were good but fell short of great. Overall, a major disappointment for a movie I had high hopes for."
"Apr 20, 2020",negative,"Where is the 88% of audience members that liked this movie. This movie was so unoriginal. I had hope that JJ was gonna fix it. If you saw Return of the Jedi, you have seen this movie. Don't bother."
"Apr 20, 2020",neutral,"I don't love the Star Wars films the way some do; I saw them as a child, I enjoyed them, and I bought a few related toys. But they never retained the place in my affection they have for some. With the 9-film cycle now concluded with this film, I look back and count a total of 3 decent films; let's be honest, 33% is not a great hit rate (Return Of The Jedi, and the first two films in this latest trilogy). This one takes all that was good about the previous episode and tramples all over it with bad story-telling, a whole load of deus ex-machina that reach the level of absurd, and some decent performances struggling to make themselves heard above the din. I'm kind of glad it's all over, to be honest."
"Apr 20, 2020",positive,"Incredible. There's a lot of people (particularly online) who'll try and put this trilogy down, but there's no satisfying some people. The people who worked on this film love and care about Star Wars and this film reflects that. Don't listen to the hate."
"Apr 20, 2020",negative,I'm just going to pretend this last trilogy doesn't exist. Butchered it.
"Apr 20, 2020",negative,"Oh My God, It Is Official. I hope to God I never see another Star Wars movie ever again in my life.  Sweet Baby Jesus this was bad from start to finish. Only the most desperate star wars fans would want to see this drivel.  Script, direction, acting, dialogue, story, plot device, and on and on and on was offensive to the senses.  This is the equal to the Godzilla movies, where anyone who is not a pure zealot sees it for what it truly is...rubbish, and the Star Wars' ""War Boys"" will fight tooth and nail just to see anything of their god on film again.  J.J. Abrams just can't help but trash beloved well established film franchises. This movie was rubbish."
"Apr 20, 2020",positive,"The movie is enjoyable but doesn't make sense to that what we saw in the last jedi. There are also many things that would have been perfect in the movie, these things were also shot by the crew but were cut out from the end product (like anakin a focegohst oder a Finn&Poe kiss)"
"Apr 19, 2020",negative,"So blah. No risks, just generic fanboy service. I miss Lucas. He knew how to take risks and make something original."
"Apr 19, 2020",negative,"Lo único que tiene de bueno son los efectos visuales. La película es realmente mala, tiene muchas cosas sin sentido y los guiones son pésimos.

Solo la vi entera para ver como terminaba la saga, pero realmente no merece el tiempo."
"Apr 19, 2020",negative,"Garbage in its purest form, here Disney reaches the culmination of the destruction of the first 6 films, passing through the lining all the mythology of Star Wars, throwing x the toilet the prophecy of the chosen one, putting some insufferable protagonists with whom I am not capable to empathize, despising R2d2, making Rey more powerful than Master Yoda just by training for a few months, making him win a Palpatine in the end and to finish shitting everything seen until episode 6 taking the Skywalker surname. All this in broad strokes because if I start to make one more criticism, my idle would spend the whole night."
"Apr 19, 2020",negative,How does JJ Abrams still get to make movies? I love Star Wars with all of my heart. This was like fan fiction written by a group of school kids.
"Apr 19, 2020",negative,It was awful. To fast. Not logical. Dumb conversations (realy dumb). No explaining how palpatine came back and how he was able to create such a huge army. In all it was dumb movie. Disney should ne ashamed and should sell the rights dir the movie. Disney destroys star wars with all the dumb stuff.
"Apr 19, 2020",negative,The franchise has lost it focus.
"Apr 19, 2020",positive,"The time for craping on Star Wars is at an end. Sorry folks we just didn't get the series we hoped for.  In the Rise of Skywalker, we get a sincere attempt by those involved to give a disappointed fan base a solid final outing.  As a fan, I appreciate it. However, in the end, the entire Star Wars saga comes down to the marvelous, mysterious, Rey being manipulated into hating Palpatine so she can join the dark side because she is (SPOILER) Familia.  After all, Disney is a family company. Not only is she related to grampa Palpatine (who actually is a clone of her Grandfather) but she also is related to all the Jedis who have come before her because...the force. It's ridiculous, it's a bit derivative and played out, but it's well-acted, the film looks great, there are a lot of fun action scenes and it's one last time to hear John Williams expand his melodic universe.  And Disney, just some advice, next time use Dave Filoni and not Katleen Kennedy."
"Apr 18, 2020",positive,better than Last Jedi and Solo but way worse than Rouge One and Force Awankens
"Apr 18, 2020",negative,Not as bad as TLJ. At least it's finally over.
"Apr 18, 2020",positive,Had some weird plot twists
"Apr 17, 2020",negative,"Worst pacing ever, so many flaws after flaws after flaws with storytelling. After watching all the movies and side movies, and all animated shows, this is the WORST STAR WARS Movie Ever made."
"Apr 17, 2020",positive,Great ending for the new trilogy. I loved every minute of it. Star Wars is alive!
"Apr 17, 2020",positive,"It had its moments, but it story was very disappointing."
"Apr 17, 2020",negative,"This feels like a major step back from the previous film, one devoid of creativity or passion"
"Apr 17, 2020",positive,When I saw this movie I had to really think about how I felt about it. It's not bad but it could've been way better. Characters could've been explained better and the story could've been explained better. The plot is really messy and the acting is okay. The humor is toned down a lot compared to the Last Jedi but overall I think this was a disappointing conclusion to the Skywalker Saga. This trilogy could have been way better than it was and it is really disappointing the decisions that were made. So it's fine but could have been a lot better
"Apr 16, 2020",positive,"I thought the acting and producing was brilliant, highly recommend"
"Apr 16, 2020",negative,"Rise of Skywalker is amazing but, you can’t end the Skywalker saga, AND DO NOT SAY REY IS A SKYWALKER BECAUSE SHE ISN’T SHE’S ACTUALLY THE ENEMY OF A SKYWALKER A PALPATINE!!!"
"Apr 16, 2020",negative,"If I could give 0 stars, I would. Since I was a kid, I have LOVED star wars; from a New Hope to Revenge of the Sith. The newest trilogy, while it is visually sufficient (it's a star wars movie) the story line literally regurgitated the original (ep 4-6) with one exception: Palpatine. Of course, I'm talking about ""legends"" star wars (since I don't recognize the new star wars, its cannon) where Palps had hundreds of clones; plus, Ben Solo wasn't evil, his older brother Jacen Solo was (complicated story). This movie leaves more questions than answers and was a complete waste of time to actual star wars fans. It's just a travesty, over used cash grab and I regret watching this film."
"Apr 16, 2020",positive,Star Wars 9 é o melhor filme de todos os tempos
"Apr 15, 2020",positive,"So I've seen and read numerous reviews by raging nerds, who deny themselves fun because whatever star wars lore they bought into. Please, do not let those reviews spoil YOUR fun with the movie - sure there are some minor plot-holes here, but let's be frank : who the hell cares, if you can't hyper-space skip in milennium falcon. Since the nerd culture is now mainstream, it seems there's easily milions of people who care for such bs. And yes I too was raised watching original Star Wars on VHS and yes I too despise the prequels. That said, I utterly enjoyed watching and rewatching the new trilogy, including this one which made so many ""critics"" salty. See the glass half full, take the zen approach is my advice here. The light side will help you overlook some minor lore-heresies (pointed out by sith possesed youtubers) and just give in to the spectacle. That's it, now go and watch it."
"Apr 15, 2020",positive,"This did justice to the series. I was entertained, with the action, characters, and storyline all pretty well done."
"Apr 15, 2020",positive,I thought the story was good but should have been great considering this was the end of the legendary Skywalker arc. Or is it? Hmmm the way it ended leaves you hoping for a whole new Skywalker arc. The acting was average which diminished the quality of the film also by the end I really thought Finn and the other cat were annoying. Thankfully Daisy Ridley saved the movie!
"Apr 15, 2020",negative,"Rian was right. Don't make films for fans. If you want to enjoy star wars, rewatch the prequels. JJ had a tall order; it's not that he failed; he never really had a chance to succeed. Disney was single handily the best and the worst thing to happen To the franchise."
"Apr 15, 2020",positive,"Full Disclosure: I am 45 years old. My Mom and Dad took me to my first movie at age 3. Guess which movie........ Star Wars in 1977!!! It changed my life!!! I am so happy with the direction that the franchise has gone. Episode 1, 2, and 3, yeah I get it, a little cheesy. Still loved each movie. Episodes 7, 8, and 9, ABSOLUTELY loved what J.J. did!!! Thank You sir! Would love a Rey Skywalker solo movie........"
"Apr 15, 2020",negative,I'd rather have spent the time doing something else. It hard to keep watching a series that didn't go anyway but most of all it was even fun to watch. Was the 2nd best of new trilogy but of all the movies it'd be 8th out of 9 of the rest of Full series
"Apr 15, 2020",positive,Great starwars fun. I enjoyed the plot and character twists. The jokes were good and story was great.
"Apr 15, 2020",positive,"I got so immersed into this movie that I at one point shed a tear. I even laughed because I was so happy about things happening in the movie. I have been pretty invested in Star wars lore. I am a big fan.

This might be the best movie I have watched in years. and I watch a lot of movies.
My advice. Make your room pitch dark, bring some snacks. Put this movie on and enjoy.

EAT FRESH."
"Apr 14, 2020",neutral,It's a very bland movie that doesn't know what it wants to be and has too many plots in one film but I enjoyed Ian McDiarmid back as Palpatine and most of the acting was pretty good
"Apr 14, 2020",negative,"J. J. Abrams has failed. With a poorly-paced, oddly-written (the dialogue is comparable to that of the Prequels), ailing film, the Skywalker saga is over. Protagonists are unlikable. Palpatine has (somehow) managed to bore me. I am quite convinced the initial script simply read ""Insert deus ex machina here"". The film does feel like a preschooler playing with his older brother's Star Wars toys. Character arcs are nonexistent. Individuals once cunning, such as Mr. Sheeve, are now moustache-twirling knuckleheads incompetent past belief. Half of the film revolves around our cast of ""protagonists"" working off the information of an imperial defector to find the Palpaplanet. There are far too few redeeming qualities. Unlike most Abrams films, ROS is anything but visually pleasing. Random and unnecessary references are shoved in unnaturally. The Knights of Ren are dumber than B1 Battle Droids. Lando magically show up on some desert planet at the perfect time. Overall, this is the petty conclusion to a great series."
"Apr 14, 2020",positive,"J.J. Abrams is a genius! Fantastic ending to an impossibly difficult multifaceted story. Great fun. Wonderfully acted. Incredibly cool visuals that J.J. Abrams is known for. As a huge Star Wars fan since the first movie came out in 1977, I think this is the best possible ending to the Skywalker saga I could've hoped for. Bravo J.J. Abrams!"
"Apr 14, 2020",negative,This movie totally sucked. Didn't captivate me in the slightest bit. All I could think about was going home after the movie having to pee and I was unable to pay attention to any of the movie. It was just overall boring for whatever reason. Couldn't tell you anything about the story line.
"Apr 14, 2020",positive,I really enjoyed rise of the Skywalker yes it is probably like  marmite you ether love it or hate it .
"Apr 14, 2020",negative,"To be honest, the film was a let down. It reminded me of a fetch quest in a video game. Get the not ""holorcorn"" to find the..... I won't spoil the rest but you see where I'm going with this. The resurrection of what seemed like a completely destroyed Death Star form Ep. 6 was a flimsy choice at best. The film ties up loose strings such as snoke but, I didn't find them satisfying. All and all I'd rather watch Ep. 1 with a plot that is leading somewhere."
"Apr 14, 2020",negative,"Messy ending to a messy trilogy.
This whole trilogy was a lazy excuse for Disney to make money on the nostalgia of fans and their children"
"Apr 14, 2020",negative,"Not even remotely close, to being as good as any Lucas film..."
"Apr 14, 2020",positive,"The screenplay was a little bit confused, maybe the way the had to told the history into only two movies. Even thought is still a Star Wars, wich is very hard to give a bad review. Just didn't like the way the use some tools in order to solve the whole story. Besides that, considering the photo, special effects and so... you won't waste your time."
"Apr 14, 2020",positive,This was a great way to end the franchise in the Skywalker story and easter eggs from the very beginning calling back to the very first movie this was a fantastic end
"Apr 14, 2020",negative,"A huge mess..Non existent dialogue, zero character development, flat story...I couldn't find anything good in this ""movie"" and i really tried"
"Apr 14, 2020",negative,Star Wars The Rise of Skywalker was from my point of view wars very fast paste. There were not a lot of twists and turns which makes movie not as entertaining as other movies of the trilogy because you can guess what will happen so easily. And the film was not an original idea it was pretty much like the episode six. Over all it passes the time but it definetly was not a master piece.
"Apr 14, 2020",negative,"Damn shame. Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker shows an immense lack of imagination for the future of Star Wars in my opinion. I was a big fan of The Last Jedi. I thought it pushed the series into bold new directions and for a while there I was super excited for the future of the Star Wars franchise. But, none the less. The Rise of Skywalker squanders that. With an unfocused plot, poor character choices, dull scenes, and bland execution, the concluding chapter of the Skywalker saga is only kept above the surface, by great music, performances, and a likable cast.
New plotlines are suddenly introduced without much reason to be there. Muggufuns are brought in and abandoned. Character's pasts are revealed, but they are either contradictory to the other two films or fail to be given an enough time to develop. Paced in seemingly a breakneck, yet at the same time so boring its slow way. You will either love the movie or hate it, with not much in between. A movie meant to reunite the fanbase only ended up dividing it more. I could go on. This film left me with a sense of lost hope for the franchise because everything that we had been building up too ended up being that the only way to defeat the emperor, would be to use two lightsabers instead of one. ""Ah, that's what we were missing this whole time."" If you are a Star Wars fan you have already made up your mind on it. And if you're a casual audience member you won't end up caring all that much anyway."
"Apr 13, 2020",positive,This movie was really amazing. I loved this movie. This is Star Wars! It was a good movie. Was it perfect? No. Was it great? Yes! It had alot of fan service. I really enjoyed it!
"Apr 13, 2020",positive,"I've always been a fan of Star Wars, I loved every minute of this. No idea why some people slated it. Brilliant."
"Apr 13, 2020",positive,The final entry and conclusion to the epic Star Wars saga is a huge improvement from its predecessor but still doesn't live up to the episode that started the trilogy. The Rise of Skywalker is riddled with familiar tropes and cliches which is surprising as it's directed by J. J. Abrams who directed The Force Awakens. It seems his vision for the trilogy took a bad turn when Rian Johnson took the reins for The Last Jedi. Yet there's a lot to enjoy in the action sequences and nostalgic bits so it's worth the time of you watched the first two movies.
"Apr 13, 2020",negative,They should've focused on a better script rather than pushing up nostalgia down our throats.
"Apr 13, 2020",positive,"I thought it was pretty good. The last one wasn't. No surprise the ""critics"" are so far apart from the audience on both of these."
"Apr 13, 2020",positive,"This movie took a lot of heat when it came out but after re watching it I do like it. A few plot jumps but given the fact that they had to wrap up the saga they did a good job. 

The acting was passionate and real.  The special effects were outstanding and their ability to include unused Carrie Fisher footage in the film was a fabulous."
"Apr 13, 2020",positive,Really do not understand the hate for this movie. I just do not get it. I thought this was one of the best films of the franchise
"Apr 13, 2020",negative,"A laughably bad finale for the Skywalker sequel trilogy.

J.J. Abrams directed his space adventure movie Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker (2019) like it was his first movie by lifting shots and story beats from other classic movies all to attempt to recreate the magic that was A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi. Boy, Abrams fails spectacularly alongside curiously incompetant producer Kathleen Kennedy calling the shots from the shadows like Emperor Palpatine. Just going back to Palpatine because they had no new ideas was a warning sign of this colossal waste of 142 minutes. Abrams' uninspired direction leaves much to be desired with the same old Star Wars ideas being tossed around by his unimaginative script. Whereas Rian Johnson disrespected Star Wars lore and concepts with The Last Jedi, J.J. Abrams worships Star Wars too much to try anything new at all.

I will start out with the few positive takeaways I got from The Rise of Skywalker. I like where this saga ends, Palpatine dead, Kylo redeemed, Rey independent with her own agency, Poe redeemed with a love interest, and Finn redeemed with a love interest. It's satisfying and respectful of Star Wars, George Lucas, Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, and Harrison Ford. The Rey and Kylo lightsaber duel is passionate and thrilling, Rey challenging Kylo's fighter in the desert is cool, Finn having faith in The Force is nice, and lastly it's sweet of J.J. Abrams to give Mark Hamill a proper sendoff as Luke Skywalker the Jedi Master instead of his horrendous character assassination from Rian Johnson in The Last Jedi. Michael Kaplan's costumes are neat. I adore Rey's white Jedi robes and Kylo's black garb for sure. Overall, I liked these aspects at the very least.

The problem is everything else. The editing is unintelligible as you never know what is happening. The movie starts off with no real establishment of where characters are or what their actual motivations are now after The Last Jedi. A brief opening crawl is not nearly enough to engage you. The cinematography has a few neat camera choices with a striking wide shot of Rey inside the broken Death Star, the seaside lightsaber duel, or the A New Hope homage with Rey in the dual Sunsets. The issue is all the rest of the movie has this cheap CGI glow and overly cluttered mess on screen that you cannot follow anything.

Daisy Ridley is charming and cool as Rey Skywalker giving it her all in these awful films. She makes the whole movie watchable as Daisy is likable and relatable as Rey. She effortlessly fits into this space sci-fi adventure with her impressive combat choreography Ridley painstakingly learned and got fit for all while killing the dramatic acting. Adam Driver is excellent as Ben Solo with endearing dramatic suspense, while also being intimidating as the hulking Sith behemoth Kylo Ren. John Boyega finally gets to act normally as the likable Finn with Naomi Ackie as his new love interest Jannah. Oscar Isaac finally gets to act as the suave and charming Poe Dameron, especially endearing alongside the ravishing and cool Keri Russell as Zorii Bliss. I wish we saw more of Russell!

Carrie Fisher is good as General Leia Organa, but a far cry from her legendary performances as Princess Leia. She lost all her fire and warmth sadly. Rest in paradise, Carrie. We all miss you. Mark Hamill looks like he was relieved to get a nice moment with Rey as the wise and kind Luke Skywalker. Harrison Ford cameos with a tender, not phoned in for once, role alongside Driver. Billy Dee Williams is surprisingly endearing and charismatic still as Lando Calrissian. Ian McDiarmid remains phenomenal as Emperor Palpatine also known as Darth Sidious. Even Anthony Daniels is fun as C-3P0 even though Abrams focused more on the other droids.

Domhnall Gleeson is brushed aside as General Hux for a gag, meanwhile the imposing and talented Richard E. Grant gets little to do as Allegiant General Pryde. Lupita Nyong'o is wasted again as the ugly CGI creature Maz Kanata, who is supposed to be an oracle of sorts. I just wish they put Lupita in Star Wars in space alien make-up instead. Kelly Marie Tran got to redeem herself for her horridly overacted, awkward, and cringe inducing performance from The Last Jedi as she's very natural and likable as Rose Tico in The Rise of Skywalker. I adored seeing Billie Lourd cameo as Lieutenant Connix. I actually wish she got a much larger role. Too much time is wasted on odd subplots, ugly CGI monsters, goofy alien puppets, and ugly space battles instead of developing characters or telling an interesting story. Disney clearly couldn't care less.

Even John Williams' score sounded tired of Star Wars at this point. He gets a cute little cameo though. In all, I'm just glad we are all done with this mediocre franchise that used to capture our imaginations. The original trilogy will always be fun, the prequel trilogy is still embarrassing, and this sequel trilogy is a horrendous cash grab that recreated the previous films with no charm. Rest in peace Star Wars, I had fun with you for a time."
"Apr 12, 2020",negative,"Jumped the shark. Poor writing, looks great...but garbage."
"Apr 12, 2020",positive,"I'm not sure why everyone was so disappointed in this movie.  From all the negative press I wasn't sure what to expect, but I really liked it.  I liked the struggle that the characters had to discover who they really were and the ending.  Sorry the series is ending."
"Apr 12, 2020",positive,It's a good way to end the saga. Some questionable parts but overall must see
"Apr 12, 2020",negative,"Lucasfilm and Disney. They have such money, special effects, and abilities but made such... suc ... there is no logic, no explanation, no character development, no adequate idea. This is just a Guinness record, how not to do."
"Apr 12, 2020",negative,"JJ Abrams/Disney/Lucas totally dropped the ball on this one and have been doing ""Damage Control"" ever since.  Overlong disjointed lesson in how not to make a movie, let alone end a series.  Instead of story and plot you got pointless kung fu scenes and journeys to no where and the dredging up of long dead characters that made no sense.  The Luke Skywalker saga was done at the end of Return of the Jedi - the ONLY reason for bring back the old cast members for this trilogy was to introduce the new cast - but JJ Abrams or Disney or both seem to have last sight of that in their effort to utilized outtakes of the dead Cary Fisher instead of writing a real ending and paying for real - live- actors.  This movie is a train wreck from start to finish - and only serves to make you appreciate the excellent story telling of the Last Jedi more - Thanks Rian Johnson!"

"Apr 12, 2020",negative,"I watched Rise of Skywalker on bluray again. 
And it's even worse than I remember. 
Endless, meaningless side quests, interminable arguments over accessing a robot's hard drive, characters regressing to flat, one-dimensional plot devices.
Disney (or JJ Abrams) really thought ""The Trio"" was the main draw of the Sequel Trilogy. That's the only reason I can imagine for turning KyloRen/BenSolo into a supporting player whose only purpose it to deliver clunky backstory, then die and be forgotten."
"Apr 12, 2020",negative,A disgrace. This movie is incredibly dumb.
"Apr 12, 2020",negative,Disappointing finish to the most recent trilogy.
"Apr 12, 2020",positive,"Thank you, thank you, thank you JJ Abrams. The universe is again what it should be, as the trash that was The Last Jedi fades from a bad memory into nothingness. "
"Apr 12, 2020",negative,"While I don't hate it as much as TLJ, TROS is without a doubt the worst written Star Wars film bar none."
"Apr 12, 2020",negative,"This movie lacked heart and soul. I used to really like Abrams, IDK what happened... It's a bad movie and a bad sequel in a terrible trilogy. It makes me so depressed when I brood about what Disney, Johnson and Abrams did to Star Wars :("
"Apr 12, 2020",positive,Loved it - most unique and exciting of the last three. Thought it was a great end to the Skywalker legacy
"Apr 12, 2020",positive,"I really don't understand why the critics hated this movie. I think JJ Abram did the right things to make a truly ""Star War"" movie instead of what he did with ""Last Jedi"", a good movie that please modern movie critics, but departs from energy and dynamics of Star Wars a little bit. I think people just need to chill. If you don't like the movie, maybe it is just that the movie is not for you.

As a Star War fan, this is a great movie and a suitable ending for this story arc."
"Apr 12, 2020",negative,"Having been a fan for 43 years, and trying hard to like it. This disjointed mess, was the crowning achievement in laying star wars to rest, by Disney.  The characters are two dimensional parodies. It's easier to pretend,  this and the past 2 films didn't exist, and preserve a childhood joyful memory."
"Apr 11, 2020",negative,"Poor planning and writing from the first two films caused this to be the worst film in the new trilogy.  It's a turd.  Existing fans should watch it to judge for themselves, but for all others it should be avoided.  The plot is horrible and feels like you are watching a knock off of National Treasure.  The clues to track down the new threat from the Empire don't make any sense.  And why would the empire hide valuable military resources when they could have been used earlier.  The force powers are also extremely exaggerated and several new abilities were created.  The final showdown is very anti-climatic and you will laugh as rebels run across the top of star destroyers.  Given the length of the film you will be wishing for it to be over.  They did wrap up the mystery of Rey's origins nicely, but the journey was painful to watch."
"Apr 11, 2020",negative,"The last episode of the latest Star Wars trilogy was sooooooooo bad, I cannot even give it one star. Not all the budget in the galaxy could have saved this movie. I can write a trilogy about why it was so bad, but let's summarize and say there was no story to tell. None. The movie keeps stealing from past glories, which could be fine as it is the continuation from an old story, but they just copy/paste and it just looks like a counterfeit  copy of what this story used to be. The bar scene at Planet Kijimi ? And Poe's scene about an unpaid debt? Really ? Give me a break!
So, check this movie if you are 9 years or younger. Plenty of kid-friendly scenes...is Disney's story after all. The empire won."
"Apr 11, 2020",positive,"The movie was very well done. After hearing all the criticism, I expected less than what the movie was. I get that many fans were butthurt because the story didn't go the way they wanted, but get over it. This was a great movie."
"Apr 11, 2020",negative,"The plot here is just incoherent. J.J. Abrams obviously had to do back flips to try and undo Last Jedi, and Ep. 9 really suffers for it. ""The Room"" makes more sense logically. I liked Last Jedi better, and I'm probably in the minority. RoS has great looking set pieces, a few good and funny moments, and a few cool x-wing and lightsaber fights, but it's a disappointment. The characters in this trilogy have been ridiculously overpowered. Maybe in these 3 movies or in ep. 9 it explains how they can just resurrect ppl via the force, but I certainly couldn't tell you how based on this jumbled mess of a trilogy. The worst thing is, it could easily have been epic."
"Apr 11, 2020",negative,"Such a bad episode. I am a fan, but seriously? Clearly could have been done better."
"Apr 11, 2020",negative,Too much story in one movie. A bit silly story line especially on the revival of the emperor.
"Apr 11, 2020",negative,The worst and cringiest ending to an amazing modern trilogy. Waste of 40 + years of amazing character development. Just terrible.
"Apr 11, 2020",negative,Finally watched it online for free. Too much going on that it's confusing and feels that it should of been a game not a movie. It didn't connect well to the others. Episode 6 was a better end to the Skywalker saga. These sequelogy should of been planned better. This is NOT the BEST of the Skywalker saga. There is no Skywalker left. Rey isn't a Skywalker and she'll never be a Skywalker. A Skywalker can be named by blood and she doesn't have the blood which means she has to marry to become a Skywalker but do not say she is because she is definitely not. Reboot the sequelogy PLEASE!!!
"Apr 10, 2020",negative,Ill make it short and sweet. The force is apparently broken and now you can do any and everything especially... I best not give them any idea's.
"Apr 10, 2020",positive,"Discordando da maioria dos críticos, achei muito bom o filme, não vou dizer que seja perfeito mas isso nenhum é, por isso dou 5 estrelas"
"Apr 10, 2020",negative,"Disappointing end to one of the greatest stories ever told. This one was better than the last one. just narrowly. The first installment of the new trilogy skated by on nostalgia and a general thirst for new Star Wars. Unfortunately Disneys acquisition proves this was all about money and pumping out as much Star Wars as quickly as possible with complete disregard for the property itself. This and the last felt hastily written and sloppy. It could just be that I grew up with Vader and the original characters, but I had a hard time believing or feeling like Kylo or Rey were so much stronger than their predecessors. The original trilogy had 3 year breaks between movies, both of these last two could have used at least an extra year, especially after the last one had to be rewritten. Snoke felt like a total throw away and why they didnt take that opportunity to insert a more compelling already existing character from the expanded universe or whatever its called now is a missed opportunity. It feels like Snoke was being built for something else and then plans changed quickly so they killed him. Why rush one of the most legendary and beloved stories ever? If it wasnt ready, delay and rewrite, people may be upset, but is that worth ruining Star Wars over? I suppose it is if youre only interested in money and could care less about ruining art. I could go on and on about everything that didnt work, but its easy enough to find those with a simple search. They may as well have ended this by having Jar Jar being the mastermind behind everything, studying the dark side and re-emerging as Darth Jar Jar killing everyone and flipping off the camera."
"Apr 10, 2020",negative,Such a terrible finish for the new trilogy.  Same old formula.  A surprise real father revelation.  Bad guy gets redemption.  Rebels win.  Blah blah blah.
"Apr 10, 2020",positive,"Never listen to the critics. Audience score only.

Excellent ending to this Triology."
"Apr 10, 2020",positive,It was entertaining.
"Apr 9, 2020",negative,"This movie took 0 risks,  it utilized the original characters as background stand-ins like a tree in a child's christmas play. It introduced it's main villain after 40 years in a text scroll. Anytime you thought someone died or sacrificed themselves they were brought back, making almost every scene meaningless. This by far is the worst Star Wars movie ever."
"Apr 9, 2020",negative,"*SPOILERS* I really felt like this film was made by someone with ADHD, this little review will be done the same way to honor it.  Those scenes in the first half went so fast, with so much happening it became really hard to care at all about anything as there was no time to let anything breathe.  Cast chasing after a thing that doesn't really matter, new supporting characters that are introduced that don't really matter either.  Stupid banter between Finn and Poe.  Rey continues being a Mary Sue.  Kylo Ren was the best imo, definite improvement to his character after TLJ, wish the writers were better to him.  Bringing back Emperor Palpatine?  No other ideas than to bring back an old character and ruining Return of the Jedi?  Hux?  Pfft.  Overall plot absurd.  Constant reminder of other films though.  Ceasar from Planet of the Apes.  Sandworms of Arrakis.  

Oh and Finn had something he wanted to tell Rey.  Said so multiple times but never did.  Okay then...  Oh and he's Force sensitive or something?  Maybe?  Hinted but went nowhere again.  What was that stupid fight on horseback on top of Star Destoryers?  Force lightning that destroys entire ships.... Sigh."
"Apr 9, 2020",positive,"I personally adore the movie despite the pacing, writing choices, and plot points in film, but it ties everything together in a proper satisfying way to make a proper satisfying ""Star Wars"" finale. I couldn't be more in love with this movie than I've ever been with episode 7 & 8. JJ Abrams you stick the landing"
"Apr 9, 2020",positive,A very thrilling and fun conclusion to the sequel trilogy with some missteps along the way. But still really enjoyable!
"Apr 9, 2020",negative,If you thought the Last Jedi was bad...oh boy
"Apr 9, 2020",negative,This was unwatchable. It took me three sittings just to finish it as I kept getting irritated by the awful acting and poor writing in this film.
"Apr 8, 2020",positive,"Me mantuvo entretenido, eso es lo que cuenta."
"Apr 8, 2020",positive,"8.6:10 I liked it. I can see where the criticism of “fan service” comes from, but who doesn’t like a nice ending? I’m also not a giant Star Wars nerd to begin with. "
"Apr 8, 2020",positive,"Entertaining, but not the conclusion I had hoped for after Episode 7 and 8 (both of which I loved)! Pacing is kind of a mess and I'm not a huge fan of the Palpatine stuff. The best/most redeeming part of this movie is Kylo Ren's growth as a character. As a film it's okay, but a bit disappointing. I'm still hopeful for the rumored JJ extended cut which might fix some of the pacing issues at least despite some of the story choices that I disagree with."
"Apr 8, 2020",positive,best star wars fillm ever is as good as the orignal Trilogy i love it it had a great ending for the saga
"Apr 8, 2020",negative,"Plot hole after plot hole that was somehow supposed to tie this whole trilogy together... As generic as it gets for casual viewers, 100 trivia pieces for fanatics who know the lore down to that star wars lego booklet from 1997."
"Apr 8, 2020",negative,"What should have been an epic finale to a 9-Part 40+ year series is instead a half baked, barely sensical nostalgia trip that runs out of gas far before its conclusion. The screenwriters should have spent more time in the writing room, and less time listening to the trolls. "
"Apr 8, 2020",negative,Absolutely deplorable
"Apr 7, 2020",positive,Awesome ending to this saga. I wish Abrams would have done all three.
"Apr 7, 2020",negative,"One of the worst movies ever, I guess the fault is from the Last Jedi since there wasn't much to do about it."
"Apr 7, 2020",neutral,"This is by far the star wars movie that has unsettled me most from all of the previous installments. I consider myself a fairly big fan of Star Wars but this film seemed to break all of the rules set in the other movies. Fast paced and relentless, I did not seem to have the time to enjoy moments that could have been taken advantage of in a much larger scale. It is a fairly good way of ending the Skywalker saga but it did not appeal to me."
"Apr 7, 2020",positive,"I really like this movie. The reason why is that it felt like a Star Wars movie. It contained the same themes we've come to expect from the original trilogy and I think that's a good thing. I like the fact that it tried to undo the damage done by TLJ. TLJ didn't feel like a Star Wars movie to me.  It felt like the moody, emo sister of a Star Wars movie. Apart from a really poor plot, and overt virtue-signaling, that was what was so jarring about TLJ. I see people complaining that this movie ruined the character arcs of TLJ. First, apart from Rey and Kylo, there weren't any left after TLJ. I cared so little for the main characters in TLJ that I thought I'd never want to see TROS. Second, ruining character arcs was TLJ's principal sin and trying to restore some of them was TROS's principal virtue. 

People can go two, very different ways on the fan service that TROS provides. Some say it's cheap. Others will say it makes for an enjoyable ride. I'm in the latter category. Let's assume there weren't real problems with TFA and TLJ. This sort of all-in, all-present ending movie is just the kind of movie I'd expect to finish off the Skywalker storyline. We all appreciated that about Endgame, probably because that's what we've come to expect from literature and movies that tie-off a big universe of plots and characters.  

Was it the best Star Wars movie? No. Did it contain some just-so stories or a deus ex machina or three? Yes. Still, I enjoyed it. I liked seeing an end to the story of the Skywalker family and its long, arduous battle against the Sith. That's what this movie was. It wasn't a story about Poe, Finn, Rose, and, to some extent, I can also say that it wasn't all about Rey either. That's what I wanted. I wanted a Skywalker movie. I wouldn't expect the final installment of the Harry Potter franchise to be about Ron or Hermione, nor would I want that."
"Apr 7, 2020",negative,"Managed to be even worse than Episode I.
Only good thing is John Williams music."
"Apr 7, 2020",negative,"Easily the worst movie in the entire saga. It entirely makes The Last Jedi unnecessary, despite what the writers may think. Instead of spending time continuing the story from where the previous movie left the characters and developing them further, this episode either ignores character arcs, or outright changes them. To make it worse, there's no character development of any kind because the characters are constantly feeding the audience exposition in order to get to a finale that is exactly like the original trilogy finale. This shouldn't be a surprise when a character is forcibly brought back only to be another character's method of redemption"
"Apr 7, 2020",negative,"There was no emotional impact, the editing was shoddy and the interconnection between scenes held together roughly with duct tape; there were so many plot holes involved due to trying to cover up 'The Last Jedi,' it was phenomenally criminal...and simply put, the entire SKYWALKER SAGA (the HEART and SOUL of the Star Wars storyline and franchise) was reduced to insignificant nothingness and wiped off the map. A true disgrace. 

If you like fast-pace storylines, visually stunning scenes, a lot of action, and interesting cinematography, then you're in for a treat. If not, don't waste your time."
"Apr 7, 2020",positive,"I thought this was a perfect end to the latest trilogy in the Star Wars saga. Full of non stop action and excitement,it was a feast for the eyes, as well as some heartfelt moments. "
"Apr 6, 2020",negative,"Bad, predictable story. Very poor or nonexistent character development. Bad guys that seem tacked on rather than central to the story. Good guys, bad guys and seemingly unlimited resources that just appear out of nowhere. Surprise! not.
A sad so called conclusion to a once great universe that really died with the release of the somehow worse Ep VIII. Such a sad, sad waste."
"Apr 6, 2020",negative,This movie feels like it was written for children where the plot moves the characters to progress the storyline instead the other way around.  The logistics of the of the plot thread onm the final order makes no sense.  Only good thing about this movie is it's oversized budget to make the movie visually appealing.  The last scene of the movie kill the entire franchise.
"Apr 6, 2020",positive,"If you are expecting amazing action sequences and very good acting for a final farewell, then you will be fully satisfied of this very entertaining film. If you are looking to poke holes at all of the plot points, then you won't enjoy the movie."
"Apr 6, 2020",negative,The cinematic equivalent of taking a dump in your own fridge.
"Apr 6, 2020",negative,"Look, if you didn't want to make a Star Wars movie, then don't make a Star Wars movie.  There's plenty of other people who have better ideas."
"Apr 6, 2020",negative,Absolute rubbish..worse trilogy so far
"Apr 6, 2020",negative,Truly ruined George Lucas legacy.
"Apr 6, 2020",positive,A great arrangement of all the characters past present future in a combination of great action and violence.
"Apr 6, 2020",negative,If you haven't watch the original and prequel trilogy. You'll like it. If you understand the star wars universe lore. This movie broke all of it. Like the Last Jedi
"Apr 5, 2020",negative,"Aunque puede tener momentos gratos, es general es un desastre narrativo. ""Fan Service"" forzado y parches para recomponer los cambios que introdujo la película pasada."
"Apr 5, 2020",negative,"I can’t believe that Disney dove into this trilogy without a plan. TFA set up questions that still don’t have answers, TLJ was trash, and this movie is PROOF that they didn’t have a plan going into this. The pacing in this film is awful, the lightsaber fights ? forgettable, and whatever lore and rules were left in the Star Wars universe utterly abandoned. I remember when this universe had rules and I miss those days. SPOILERS from here on out. The plot of this movie was so convoluted and confusing. It seems that the characters only progress because of luck. Too much stuff is in this movie for the 16 hour period of time and half of it is unnecessary. Why is Lando in this movie? Why is Poe’s power ranger girlfriend in this movie? Why is Jannah in this movie? These people are unneeded; they clog up time that could be spent on fixing the pacing and answering questions. So Palpatine has returned in this movie with basically no explanation other than “The dark side of the force is a pathway to many abilities some may consider to be unnatural”. Palpatine’s return is a huge slap in the face to everyone who ever cared about Star Wars, prequel fans and OT fans alike. It was Anakin’s/Vader’s destiny to throw Palpatine down that bottomless pit and then the Death Star EXPLODED with Palpatine in it. Bringing him back ruins literally everything in those six movies. Anakin was supposed to be the Chosen One and that was mentioned over and over in the prequels and the Clone Wars. Now it’s all pointless! ... And guess how Palps is defeated? Rey deflects lightning into his face. How are we supposed to believe he’s dead when he survived all the previous things in all the other movies? I was actually fine with this movie in the beginning, even though the Poe and Finn in the Falcon chase was utterly pointless because the movie wanted some action. The point where the movie really went downhill was when Lando showed up for no reason and disappeared. And then the stormtroopers flew and we heard “They fly now!” ... why are they surprised? C3PO has seen a ton of stuff and Finn used to be a stormtrooper, for crying out loud! They should know that jet packs exist! For some reason our heroes fall into quicksand and fall into a cave beneath. Is that how gravity works now? ...The moment that destroyed all the rules was when Rey force healed the snake/worm. It makes the movie feel like there’s no stakes because the force can magically heal people now (and resurrect them too, as seen later). Heck, in the Phantom Menace Qui-Gon DIED... why didn’t Obi-Wan just force heal him? And I don’t understand why Rey thought it was safe to attempt to heal it... then it makes the way out of the quicksand... For some reason Rey goes into the desert and stands out there. There’s no reason for her to do this. Then Kylo charges at her with his tie fighter/silencer ship. If he wants to kill her, he should use his guns. If he doesn’t want to kill her then he shouldn’t ram his tie fighter into her... what is character motivation? Rey does an impossible flip and DESTROYS his ship. It explodes and tumbled and BOY, THAT’S AN EXPLOSION. But both Kylo Ren AND the ship both survive. You heard me correctly. Kylo doesn’t have a scratch but you could say “the force”. But the ship was literally blown up on screen... and you see it perfectly together later in the movie. THEY DESTROY IT ON SCREEN AND THEN FORGET. And it’s the same ship, not a similar one because it has the way finder in it! WTH. It looks like Rey kills Chewie but he doesn’t die. Then later the gang gets on Ochi’s ship which still works somehow to see the merchandise and the power ranger. C3PO’s memory gets wiped but then is fine by the end of the movie because R2 had a replacement. It feels like nobody is in danger. There are so many stupid things in this movie. The Death Star was completely annihilated in ROTJ but somehow there are still remains of it. Kylo’s helmet was completely destroyed in TLJ but is easily fixed in this movie. Rey sails across a rough ocean and doesn’t die. Finn says that he has something to tell Rey but he never tells her. Hux is the spy, but the motivation makes no sense. Luke acts like TLJ never happened. Leia’s dialogue feels weird because she’s dead, and then when she dies in this movie it’s so strange. They should have killed her last movie. When Rey and Kylo finally team up against Palpatine, Kylo has a blaster but then it magically disappears because this movie doesn’t have an ounce of consistency. The finale rips off Endgame, and you are left wondering why the bad guys don’t just tilt the ships, and how Lando got so much backup. Palpatine doesn’t say anything cool except quote prequel lines. Rey defeats him easily. Why should we care? She’s way more powerful than everyone. She is literally shown levitating in this movie. When she dies, Kylo revives her, and then... they kiss. Their relationship in these movies is so toxic and awful and everyone groaned. Then he dies. He should’ve lived and Rey should’ve died, and the entire world would’ve been happier with that ending. At the end Rey buries Anakin’s lightsaber in SAND. She calls herself Rey Skywalker, and literally anything else would’ve been better. So in conclusion, what the hell. I suppose this is slightly better than TLJ, but wow, this movie is BAD and a huge insult to fans. "
"Apr 5, 2020",positive,"Because of my low expectations, I was entertained. The Star Wars universe is so absorbing after all. But the return of the emperor, etc, that was such a bummer. Such lack of creativity. They could've made a better ending."
"Apr 5, 2020",negative,Great visuals without integrity. A lot of things should not happen in the movie.
"Apr 5, 2020",negative,Lacked all the nuance of Star Wars.
"Apr 5, 2020",negative,A few cool effects wrapped around a flat story and characters who exist solely as collections of quips.
"Apr 5, 2020",positive,A perfect ending to the Skywalker Saga. I absolutely loved it!
"Apr 5, 2020",positive,"In the previous movies, scenes lingered and deepened, so actors could work with what was happening and you could become part of the story. This one skipped between scenes too much. The ending also really bothered me. What happened to a commemoration or a story telling of what happened at the end. He was the partner significant character. What happened to his essence? Where was the chat with Luke, Han, Leia and Ben? Etc. It feels quite deflating. Finn also, the previous movies really allowed the actor to shine. He had little to work with and that was disappointing."
"Apr 4, 2020",negative,"Well, the production is done well. But all the takebacks of the Star Wars Galaxy is intelligence insulting. Oof!! Terrible story! Does too much taking-back and creating its own rules (which is trust shattering) to really be a respectable addition to the series, when it could've continued exploring and expanding the series while honoring what's been already established. smh"
"Apr 4, 2020",positive,"This was a great movie. Great story, great cast, great sets, and great action sequences. The best of the newest 3 for sure! It was nice to see the great nostalgic moments as well. Well executed!"
"Apr 4, 2020",negative,"WELL, as a star wars film; this was awful, nothing as bad as the last Jedi but nothing as good as the last Jedi, a preety forgetable movie"
"Apr 4, 2020",negative,I expected a lot more from a Star Wars movie.  Thoroughly disappointed. Waste of money as far as far as I'm concerned.
"Apr 4, 2020",negative,Very boring. What a waste of time. So predictable.
"Apr 4, 2020",positive,"Bloody awesome, had a bit of everything going for it."
"Apr 4, 2020",positive,Awesome. So much better than the last one.
"Apr 4, 2020",positive,"Jedi is obsoleted, please bring Yuuzhan Vong in, bring Thrawn back ."
"Apr 4, 2020",negative,The entire movie felt rushed with no clear idea of where it was going. Its definitely not worth buying. This is the only time where it feels good knowing this was the last movie and no more garbage is to come.
"Apr 4, 2020",negative,Terrible. Steaming horse shit has more appeal.
"Apr 4, 2020",positive,"After the dumpster fire that was The Last Jedi, I had little hope for this movie.  It's hard to maintain any tension in a trilogy when you kill off your primary antagonist in the second movie.  So needless to say I was expecting this movie to be epicly bad.  I was wrong.  I knew that in order to salvage this franchise some mental gymnastics was in order and digging up a long dead character was it,  it was my only complaint, but to be honest, I couldn't have thought of anything that would have done better.  The tension was high and I even thought the good guys might lose.  I have never been so glad to be wrong."
"Apr 4, 2020",positive,"The Rise of Skywalker had a lot of weight on its shoulders. Other than having to clean up the mess that was The Last Jedi, the movie was pretty good for what it was. It was a good fan service for all superfans of Star Wars, but my biggest issue is I left wanting more out of the franchise. I struggled with the fact that this movie ended a legendary series. It was good, but it wasn't enough."
"Apr 4, 2020",negative,Sooooooo bad. Just so bad. It was bad enough to make me like the original series less.
"Apr 3, 2020",positive,Decent ending to a terrible trilogy.
"Apr 3, 2020",negative,"My god, I don't even know where to start. This movie is basically JJ Abrams having a petty fight with Rian Johnson. This entire trilogy is just pathetic. This movie is clearly the worst of the trilogy. At least with Last Jedi, it had a theme. It wasn't all over the place, and it had a ""vision"". It knew what it wanted to be, it was just executed poorly. The same can't be said for TROS. It's just bland, and an absolute mess."
"Apr 3, 2020",positive,"Best SW of the last six, cohesive enough to be enjoyed, beautifully filmed and nicely acted (even Adam Driver seems finally at ease as Kylo Ren)"
"Apr 3, 2020",neutral,"Weird, somewhat cool, totally unhinged"
"Apr 3, 2020",negative,"Incredible special effects, and amazing casting and set design. Worst plot ever. The more you think about it the less it makes sense. so far behind Lucas' original. Best to start with a 3 story treatment and  a narrative arc."
"Apr 3, 2020",positive,"I thought the final film (as of now) in the Star Wars saga was really good. I thought they tied everything together really well. I was surprised when I saw that they brought Darth Sidious and Lando back. I really liked the final scene, when Rey visited Luke’s childhood home from the original. It was really nostalgic."
"Apr 3, 2020",positive,"The movie is not bad but not great either. For a Star Wars film when compared to its predecessors, and for a story to end a saga, it is actually quite a let down."
"Apr 3, 2020",negative,This was such a disappointing movie to me. I grew up watch Star Wars. While the fight scenes were awesome. The story was garbage.
"Apr 3, 2020",negative,That is absolutely the worst star wars film out of all 9
"Apr 3, 2020",positive,We need a perfect ending like Endgame.
"Apr 3, 2020",negative,This final chapter is like running over a kids beloved dog and then thinking you can make up for it by giving them an ice cream.
"Apr 3, 2020",positive,JJ did his best with what he was given thanks to TLJ.
"Apr 3, 2020",positive,"Not sure why the ratings are low, it was a very good movie! Worth watching. Action was great, acting was awesome."
"Apr 3, 2020",positive,Much better than I thought. I find peace ;)
"Apr 3, 2020",negative,"7, 8 and 9 are an insult to everything that George Lucas did. 8, for example, is being taught in film schools as an example of what not to do when making a film. the plot of the three films is radically inconsistent."
"Apr 2, 2020",negative,"Was this movie made in a huge hurry? Did they not have time to work out the script and dialogue so that everything people say doesn't sound stupid? And how did the actors all downgrade in their acting abilities?

This conclusive episode is such an incredible disappointment, and it really feels like they just made a cheap story just because they knew they're going to make buckets of money off of the movie and franchise regardless of how it turns out."
"Apr 2, 2020",positive,A fun entry into the Star Wars universe!
"Apr 2, 2020",positive,The movie should have been called Star Wars: The Rise of the Dead. Dead characters keep coming back until Skywalker is omnipotent. I enjoyed the special effects and the action scenes.
"Apr 2, 2020",negative,Just one of the weakest Star Wars movies ever. They could have had a way better plot then the one they came up with. Mostly I just feel no one tried their hardest! Definitely worse than Cats that came out the same day! At least that movie tried!
"Apr 2, 2020",negative,"The third instalment was always going to have a tough time, I was hoping that they would have learned from their mistakes but I guess not. Turn your brain off and just get through it."
"Apr 2, 2020",negative,"Whiskey Tango Foxtrot. 
They should have fired the screenwriters. Actually they should have made them pay for the cost of the entire production.
I want my money back."
"Apr 2, 2020",negative,"Terrible. Unfortunately they tried desperately to fix what they screwed up with the Last Jedi. I’m doing so, they rushed to undo the sins of the past and instead it became a jumbled mess. So disappointing more than anything. It seemed like nothing was thought out. No ideas were allowed to naturally unfold and characters made such unrealistic decisions, gestures, and conversations with other characters. It was almost too corny. Even for a Star Wars film. "
"Apr 2, 2020",negative,"It was obvious the last 3 films weren't written together as a trilogy, I will not be watching anything from Abrams, Kennedy or Johnson and I hope they don't touch anymore beloved franchises.  How ridiculously written that the emperor can strike down a whole fleet with just his powers.  Yoda is one of the strongest jedis and there is no way he can do anything close to what the emperor did in the Rise of Skywalker.  The move felt too rushed and the force was not treated like anything close to the previous movies.  Too bad too since the actors and actresses did a good job for what they were given, the directors and the screenwriting however were just so poor in understanding a big franchise.  One wonders why Disney picked these people, anyone else even a new director probably could have done better."
"Apr 2, 2020",positive,"Loved it! Saw it 3 times in the theater and forced myself to wait for the blu-ray. So much better than TLJ, so relieved. Thanks J.J. Wrapped up the saga very well even if many details went unexplained due to time constraints. I would have preferred a longer movie or parts 1 and 2, but am very happy to have another SW movie to enjoy."
"Apr 1, 2020",negative,I'm a big Star wars fan ever since I was a kid and this movie just discredit the other films and it didn't make sense compared to the other films yes it had good action scenes but this was a forgettable movie
"Apr 1, 2020",negative,"Very disappointed.....

All the writing, production, quality actors trying to put 100% into a script that may have been okay for a ""B"" class movie at best. That is all I can say. took a great franchise with a huge fan base, and ended an epic adventure that spanned decades with a ... meh..."
"Apr 1, 2020",positive,"This is in no way a perfect movie. It's also not a perfect Star Wars movie. However, this movie is way better than the Last Jedi. The Last Jedi was an absolute disgrace made by a man who had zero respect for the original movies.  Anyway, The Rise Of Skywalker is a fun movie that wraps up the saga in a mostly satisfying way."
"Apr 1, 2020",positive,The movie was amazing. Could've been better but it was amazing!!!!
"Apr 1, 2020",positive,"While it would've been extremely hard to be a worse movie than the last Jedi, this didn't do much to get me excited. The lightsaber combat especially was lackluster, they moved slow and with big movements, I understand them doing that for episode 7 but, they have supposedly been training and still Rey and Kylo suck at fighting. The story in general was unimpressive and palpatine was only there to get people to spend money at the theater. I've been a life long fan of star wars and it has pained me to see Disney ruin it so completely."
"Mar 31, 2020",negative,"awfull, terrible, total waste of my time"
"Mar 31, 2020",positive,"Very bland, I found myself bored throughout the film. Trying to appease old star wars fans. Had its cool moments and nice visuals but in the end lacks a lot in my opinion. The finale was entertaining and the only memorable moment, altough it made me scratch my head in confusion because of the characters relation and interaction."
"Mar 31, 2020",negative,Script sucked. What a disgrace to the Star Wars name.
"Mar 31, 2020",negative,"They were horrible, even if I buy into that Hans is killed by his son, ok. But, Mom who has the same powers as Luke never feels what is going on inside her son ? Nor does his uncle Luke has no credibility. If we consider, Luke is the last Jedi standing, we would see as Yoda did a progression of a prodigy to pass the torch or knowledge to. Instead we see an angry Hobo, ( as my friend in England called him ) , just evaporate into dust. Again he does not appear even as a specter as his mentors did, again not connecting the story lines. He should have taken her Light Saber and shown his, THAT should have had the sentinel yellow light. It was not there, the writes failed to make a connection of transference of power, training , teaching of Jedi philosophy to this new Jedi. A pissed off , scared Sky walker just turns to dust, suggest that the light was and is weaker than the darkness, therefore the light is lost already. That evil has more ways to with than the enlightened good just again loses contact. Look, if you are trying to rip off the bile don't forget Jesus made it clear, just using his name of his fathers immediately cause the demons to be cast out and the light overwhelms and burns out the darkness. So, what are we left with, Hans is killed by his son, Mom and brother do  not feel how screwed up the kid is and he runs off to be a villain and somehow while dying gets his mothers soul, which she could have shared with him while she was alive, HAD she , trained, studies or even worked with her brother to understand and master the powers she allegedly was born with. To say bad, dissapointed, poor story telling . Total garbage to this great Saga is an  understatement."
"Mar 31, 2020",positive,"Extremamente carregado, muitas pontas para serem amarradas que foram deixados para apenas um filme , além de escolhas horríveis e revelações de parentesco sem nenhum sentido. A única coisa que se salva são os efeitos especiais impecáveis como sempre."
"Mar 31, 2020",negative,"Spoiler Alert!

The worst scenario ever. Everyone is happy, almost nobody died, and they even kissed each other. Even though, the most powerful fleet consisted from maybe tousand destroyers was against some stuck of bad fighters."
"Mar 31, 2020",negative,"I felt that the writers and directors were not sure where to go with this story or the characters, and so we got a over the top story ending and some boring character interactions.

Sadly, I think that a lot of films end up like this with a lot at stake (big budget) and too many cooks in the kitchen."
"Mar 31, 2020",positive,Really great ending to the franchise.
"Mar 30, 2020",positive,"So, the Rey trilogy comes to an end. Fortunately, we had some sparks from the nostalgic essence brought by George Lucas' first trilogy with the iconic characters such as Luke, Han Solo, and our favorite droids, but never fulfilled.
The Rise of Skywalker lacks a deeper unique story, which mostly makes us feel like if we were watching the Last Jedi remake with a weird twist involving the new characters. The special effects obviously have improved through the years making this movie visually richer. but having that in mind this should make a world of difference for the producer's story by making fans dive into a more original Star Wars movie."
"Mar 30, 2020",negative,"What can you say. Saw the original movies as a kid and they were great. Now its come down to this. SW8 was terrible. Only watched this because my friend bought it for some reason and let me borrow it. Same continued stupid plot as 8. Not going to discuss most of the plot, but really, the plot involving Palpatine, Really? I won't give this a 1 just to be a Debbie Downer. Good special effect and most of the actors hold the line. Its just the plot that's so far fetched that I'm surprised Vader didn't show to kill everybody to save us all from any future movies of this franchise."
"Mar 30, 2020",positive,"Honestly I thought I was very good, more coherent than a lot of people say. I liked how it corrected a lot of the Rian Johnson retcons. I can't see why it has so many haters. 
  The only issue I have with it is that it's a Star Wars movie and it's really all based in low altitude. 😂 lol"
"Mar 29, 2020",positive,I enjoyed it both times I went to see it.
"Mar 29, 2020",negative,I would give it zero stars if I could
"Mar 29, 2020",negative,Holy fucking crap that was awful
"Mar 29, 2020",negative,Worse than the last jedi. The only reason that this gets a review is because of Mark Hamill
"Mar 29, 2020",neutral,"Disappointing movie, I expected something better for the ""conclusion"" of this saga"
"Mar 29, 2020",negative,"I would say the movie is garbage, but that would be too kind.  It is aggressively nonsensical, as if it were an experiment in how much preposterous bs could be shown in a theater before audiences rioted."
"Mar 29, 2020",neutral,"No amount of special effects can hide the fact that this is a retelling of Return Of The Jedi with some Empire Strikes Back thrown in for good measure. Its just not that original. The story goes at such a fast pace, with so much full-on action that you don't really get a chance to settle into the film. If you are a Star Wars fan you will watch it and enjoy it, but it's no classic which would stand up on it's own merit."
"Mar 29, 2020",positive,Perfeito. Sou apaixonado por Star Wars e adorei a volta d(spoiler)
"Mar 29, 2020",positive,"As a stand alone film, it isn't bad, unfortunately it isn't really a stand alone film. It's the end of saga, and sadly I don't know if anyone could have ended in a manner befitting the franchise's impact on cinema. Nothing about it is bad, but then again, nothing about it is really all that stellar. It makes the prequel nearly irrelevant."
"Mar 28, 2020",positive,"This movie was filled with nuggets of everything we love about this saga.  Rey was badass, full of heart and her battles with Kylo Ren epic."
"Mar 28, 2020",positive,Rey is a shining example to young women everywhere to be the hero of your own story and not the side piece to somebody else's. Loved her and this trilogy!
"Mar 28, 2020",negative,"simply awful, just like previous two, one of the worst trilogies around."
"Mar 28, 2020",positive,"This is exactly the kind of movie that makes me wonder why anyone would listen to critics.  Awesome movie, this coming from a lifetime (born in ‘77, yeah same year) MASSIVE fan.  Seems like these ""critics"" are so stuffed full of themselves that they can't appreciate a good Star Wars movie."
"Mar 28, 2020",positive,Action packed. A great close to the Skywalker Saga and much better than some rather pedantic fans are saying.  Looking forward very much to the next saga
"Mar 28, 2020",positive,Lazy storyline. It was essentially a remake of return of the Jedi.  The visual effects were cool. Lame ending too.
"Mar 28, 2020",negative,"This movie was a complete pile of garbage. Disney has done a horrible job managing these new Star Wars films. When they purchased Star Wars from George Lucas, Star Wars was like a goose capable of laying golden eggs. If they had managed this film series correctly, they would be putting out golden eggs for movies. Instead they killed the goose and are putting out crap like this film and The Last Jedi which has driven most of the fans away."
"Mar 28, 2020",negative,"There was ofc lots of horrible acting, but that was no surprise. A disappointment as a movie, but also no surprise was all the throw backs it included. It tried to sum up so much it crumpled under the weight. I felt The Rise of Skywalker tried too hard to please everybody, and thus ended up pleasing nobody (well some idiots lol).

The entire new series was not only made up of little original material, but what was original was VERY predictable, and practically painful to watch."
"Mar 28, 2020",negative,What a wasted opportunity. Fanfic could do much better.
"Mar 28, 2020",neutral,"You know. If you want a story just shy of the Justice League movie on plot, character development, and overall direction with enough overdone effects work to surpass every Star Wars franchise combined then THIS is your movie. Overblown on its' own ego. So happy this saga is over."
"Mar 28, 2020",negative,Wasn't even funny bad. Just cringy bad.
"Mar 28, 2020",negative,The story looked like a train-wreck.  Guess the good part is it finally over with.
"Mar 28, 2020",positive,"As a Star Wars fan, I am excited to see the Skywalker storyline come to an end and look forward to new adventures in the future."
"Mar 27, 2020",negative,"I had read the reviews and articles, and decided not to go see this movie when it came out. Just finished watching this and wow. Just simply wow.

Not being versed as a screenwriter, director, producer or any of the hundreds of occupations needed to make this kind of movie I am honestly amazed at how something this bad got made as the final Star Wars movie of the whole saga.

Nothing makes sense in this movie. The motives, the arc, the dialog, the plotdevices. None of it works. 

The only redeming things for me were the set designs and the Sith throne room.

This was a two hours and a half wasted."
"Mar 27, 2020",positive,"I liked, but I would like to see the J.J. Abrams cut of the film."
"Mar 27, 2020",negative,"This movie was poorly made and it shows. It adds so much to the trilogy trying to smash everything into one movie which results in the jarringly fast pacing. This feels like JJ Abrams just undid everything Rian Johnson did in The Last Jedi, and then just remade the entire last two movies of the trilogy. This is honestly more like a video game campaign story then a movie. The reveal of Palpatine being alive is so forced and so sudden. The plot points are forced and the final battle is just a direct copy of avengers: endgame. I really feel like Rose Tico and Finn were wasted characters and Poe just turned into an asshole for some reason. I did really like that scene when Han Solo confronts Ben; that was honestly beautiful. I also liked Babu Frik an insane amount, but besides that, this movie is so dissapointing."
"Mar 27, 2020",negative,"Rushed, unfinished and with little if any thought behind the script."
"Mar 27, 2020",negative,"The worst Star Wars that they could produce. No consistency, no plot, no suspense! meaningless dialogue and pointless scenes. It makes the prequels look descent...."
"Mar 27, 2020",positive,"I'm one of the few that enjoyed the curve ball Rian Johnson threw with The Last Jedi. Although it would have been nice to see J.J. Abrams make the occasional bold move, in The Rise Of Skywalker he unstitches and resews plot points from the predecessor. The pacing in the first act feels rushed and could possibly be an entry in to the saga on its own. However, it serves as a perfect ending for the Disney trilogy."
"Mar 27, 2020",positive,"The fact that Insidious has a higher rating than this Star Wars movie tells you everything you need to know about how reviews often reflect people's expectations more than the actual quality of a movie. This addition to the franchise is decent and entertaining, as one would expect from J.J. Abrams. That it is rated lower than one of THE WORST movies ever made -- Insidious -- is beyond me, but clearly reflected in the difference between the audience score and the reviewer score. I would consider the audience rating when deciding whether to see this or not."
"Mar 27, 2020",positive,"So, having finally gotten round to reviewing this, it has gone down dramatically in score since first walking out of the cinema. While as a single, standalone Star Wars movie I would easily give it four, maybe even four and a half stars, after seeing it again and judging it against the rest of the sequal trilogy, it has dipped substantially. It is still a very enjoyable, very well acted and made film with incredible action sequences and an uplifting ending. However, it is a jumbled mess of a movie trying to please the ones pissed off by its (admittedly better) predecessor, TLJ. The worst of the three sequals just from a lack of wasted potential, trying to damage control and shoehorn in as many cheep nostalgia references as possible to hide the disservice it does to any character that isn't Rey or Kylo. But, after all of the negativity, props to the incredible performances of both Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver, and for making it an overall sti fun movie."
"Mar 27, 2020",negative,"As far as a plot and script goes, it feels like I was watching something a film student put together on the last Sunday evening of the semester after spending the rest of the school year on a bender. ""I didn't have enough time to get it done."" Abrams essentially transformed all the efforts, accomplishments and sacrifices of the previous films' characters into an abyss of null and void. They died and sacrificed for nothing, ""watch my movie, those were a waste of your time,"" says JJ. If this was anything other than a Star Wars movie, I would have walked out on it about half way through, I really wish I never walked in on it. Special effects were great, it shows how the craft has matured over the years, that's it! Blown opportunities for character development, arc or making a logical movie. Too much fanboy ingratiation, while still leaving loose ends unfinished. What a shame. I've been a Star Wars fan since the 70s and have endured mostly sub-par movies, but I keep coming back because it's a great universe of possibilities, but for some reason no one has been able to get it right since the 80s. This latest trilogy started without originality; then it was blamed for becoming too original by all the fanboys; now it fights to get back to mediocrity and recycling old SW nostalgia but settles on the absurd. This is THE WORST Star Wars movie ever, and I didn't like any of the green screen prequels, but would gladly watch the Phantom Menace over this any day. I might even watch the Holiday Special before watching this again. I feel like I need to apologize to George Lucas for saying anything bad about the prequels because they look like masterpieces compared to what this latest trilogy became. The Force Wakes Up was forgiven for being unoriginal, but we were glad to have SW back. Last Jedi was going in a new direction and that was ok as long as they could pull it all together. There were still major problems with it, but I was willing to go along if they could fit it into the arc of SW, but no, JJ had to try to hit the reset button and work as a customer service rep trying to make the fanboys all happy by addressing every complaint right down to Chewbacca getting his ""long-deserved"" medal which is beyond stupid. Our moans during the movie turned into laughter at the embarrassment of this steaming pile by the end. Why can't we get a good writer/director for this franchise? It will be the first SW movie I won't have in my personal collection."
"Mar 27, 2020",negative,"The fact that thus film has the audience score that it does is proof that society has absolutely no standards when it comes to entertainment. 

This film was flaming hot garbage. A failed attempt at nostalgia and was as empty units storytelling as it was intellectually. This film felt like a half baked mess that simply included throwbacks to the original trilogy simply for the sake of winning older fans over in the Hope's that they would oversee how vapid the entire experience was. 

There is absolutely nothing memorable about the characters, plot, story mechanics, or even the visuals. It felt more like a desperate attempt to recapture Return of the Jedi than its own individual and unique film. Instead, it caters to the low hanging fruit.

If you enjoyed this, then I can only assume your a simpleton and an idiot with the IQ of an average houseplant. Yes, you're entitled to your opinion, but your opinion is wrong."
"Mar 26, 2020",positive,"Creo que esta película que debió ser la mejor es la que menos funciona en la ultima trilogía. Los personajes no terminan de crecer, no evolucionan, magnifican la historia que en si no se siente magnifica en absoluto. Sacan bajo la manga personajes muertos, apelan a la nostalgia desde un mal enfoque. Aun así los efectos la salvan y algunos cierres que quedaron bien."
"Mar 26, 2020",negative,"""Twas brillig, and the slithy toves"" is how begins a poem that makes more sense that this saga finale. Scenes are not setup and you are thrown around different destinations, action and plot points causing massive confusion from the very beginning and in such a way you lose interest quickly and just want this to be over."
"Mar 26, 2020",neutral,"Wow. The more I think about this film, the more I realize how horrible it actually was. The more I think about this film, the more I appreciate The Last Jedi. When I originally went into this movie, I had very low expectations because of the reviews I saw, but after I had seen it for myself, I was pretty impressed. With that to say, it has now been about three months since I've seen this movie and I've had time to digest it some more and I can confirm that my opinions about it have definitely changed. Sure there were a moments in there that were a nice nod to die-hard fans but in all honesty, those were the only good parts. This movie was rushed and completely meant to retcon the events of The Last Jedi. The character arcs were sloppy (with the acception of Ben Solo), the storyline was not well thought out, a lot of characters and things were just crammed in there and we didn't have any context about them or have time to get any context about them. I really could go on and on with the flaws of this movie but this review would be much longer. I grew up having Star Wars be my #1 most favorite movie franchise, but after this disaster of a trilogy that Disney botched so horribly and ruined for a lot of die-hard fans, it no longer is. I'm going to have to give that honor to the MCU. Considering their worst movie out of 23 of them was one that really wasn't all that bad; Thor: The Dark World. Honestly, if you ask me, I don't think it was that hard to develop a successful trilogy and a good conclusion to the legendary Skywalker saga. Disney has done a tremendous job on movies in the past as everyone obviously knows (they've even created a theme park after their movies) and I feel like with this trilogy they had one job. JUST ONE JOB and they couldn't even get that right. I guess we'll have to wait for the Mandalorian or future Star Wars movies to do the trick. Although it didn't end how I wanted it to, I do have to give credit to this franchise for basically being my entire childhood. So Star Wars, thank you for the memories. We've had a lot of highs and lows but mostly highs and for that, I am very grateful."
"Mar 26, 2020",negative,"(SPOILERS) This movie is a prime example of disney ruining everything they buy the rights to. This movie makes no sense logically. As a movie in general, it's too rushed and throws everything at your face in order to cram the crummy characters' plot lines into the movie. Emperor Palpatine felt thrown in because they killed off Snoke in a stupid way in episode 8. Rey being a descendant of Palpatine was a decent twist, but felt as if the writers just thought of it while writing the script of episode 9 because they didn't know in the last 2 movies. As a Star Wars movie, it is obvious that George Lucas had  nothing to do with this movie. It makes no sense in the Star Wars universe at all. George Lucas' vision for his movies have been thrown in Disney's trash can and I, along with many others, hate to see it. I was optimistic with Episode 7, which gave this disney trilogy a lot of potential, but this movie along with episode 8 made me disregard Disney's Star Wars movies as canon. If you want to watch Star Wars, watch episodes 1-6."
"Mar 26, 2020",positive,"I'm still wondering about some plot holes, otherwise it was a fun watch."
"Mar 26, 2020",negative,Laughably bad. Who approved the script? Jeez. Absolutely terrible. Fan theories written by middle school kids could have been better.
"Mar 26, 2020",positive,"Hilariously bad, but also boring. And everything was dumb. So so dumb. Frustratingly dumb. Written terribly, pacing is jarring, the tone is wrong, the comedy is cringe, and the dialogue is awful. Also the stupid callbacks and unsubtle winks were lame. Graphics ranged from decent to outdated videogame. The tension was manufactured, and the characters were inconsistent. Palpy was enjoyable of course, until he went out like a sucker. It all lead up to a disappointing climax."
"Mar 26, 2020",positive,"Repeat viewings definitely helped me appreciate this movie more.  I loved Force Awakens and remember seeing Last Jedi and wondering why I didn't latch onto it.  Waiting two years to see Luke pitch the lightsaber over the edge was a real letdown.  This movie definitely tries to fix a lot of plot points I didn't care for in Jedi.  As a few reviews probably mention...this would have worked better as two films.  However if you don't think too hard about the logic of the story and sit back to enjoy...it's definitely a fun time.  A lot of people my age who grew up with the original trilogy (I was born in ‘77) give this round of movies a hard time.  It won't ruin your childhood...and yeah it's pretty clear Disney didn't have a set game plan (or one from  Awakens to Jedi), but it comes to a close with some great effects and crowd pleasing battles.  Their are some obvious throw backs to keep viewers of the older films entertained and more than a few plot points you may pick apart.  However if you want to sit back and see the new trilogy come to a decent close...I think it's done in a more than partially entertaining way.  A fun time...wish they'd do another one but we have Mandalorian in the meantime."
"Mar 25, 2020",negative,This Sucked because it was just Fanservice. none of it made sense
"Mar 25, 2020",negative,this is terrible. I am very sorry that Disney ruined this story
"Mar 25, 2020",positive,"This is definitely the best movie of the sequel trilogy. I love this movie a lot. I know that some of the critics aren't a fan of this, but I really do enjoyed this movie. This movie helped me like the sequel trilogy even more. I really like the story to this movie. The main issue with this movie is that every star destroyer is a Death Star, and that there's thousands of them which didn't make sense as much."
"Mar 25, 2020",negative,Terribly disjointed. Tons of contradiction with itself and the two previous films. Nice special effects but still garbage.
"Mar 25, 2020",negative,"Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker tries to please all sides of a divided fanbase, but fails miserably at pleasing anyone. Its existence also begs the question of whether the sequel trilogy was needed at all."
"Mar 25, 2020",positive,"So, Star Wars The Rise of Skywalker is here, and everyone is hating on it. But why?
Well, the movie does have it's problems. The story is messy, and there are quite a few things to question. While there are bad things, there are also good things. I personally thought The Last Jedi was okay, but not great. I think haters of The Last Jedi will probably enjoy this movie, but Last Jedi lovers will hate this movie. This conclusion to the Skywalker saga may not be too satisfying, but it is enjoyable. Final Verdict: 6/10"
"Mar 25, 2020",negative,"The Last Jedi: “Well, at least I hold the title of being the worst Star Wars film ever.” Rise of Skywalker: “Hold my blue milk!”"
"Mar 25, 2020",negative,It felt like the movie was going super fast one scene there at the base and then the next their flying in the Millennium Falcon.I don’t see the point of even have Rose Tico as a character at all if you are going to give her such a small part in this film but giver her such a BIG part in the last movie.
"Mar 25, 2020",negative,"After this and the last one from the star wars saga, i think The Phantom Menace has serious competition for the worst part în a movie franchise. And, dear Disney, even if you probably are the biggest player în movie industry, you can t match the imagination and vision of Luca..Star Wars is not for you...for me Star Wars ended before you made the new trilogy..."
"Mar 25, 2020",positive,My all time favorite Star Wars film EVER!
"Mar 25, 2020",negative,"If it isn't destroying what The Last Jedi built up, it is destroying Star Wars Lore in general. Nothing makes sense, nothing works, and it could have worked! But it was a fanfic of disaster!"
"Mar 25, 2020",negative,"What a load of stinky cheese. This movie is better suited for 5-8 year olds. Bad story, bad fight choreography, just overall mediocrity. The only thing it had going for the movie was that it was kind of pretty( special effects and some scenery. What at your own peril."
"Mar 24, 2020",negative,"You expect way more for the last chapter of the prominent Star Wars but you end up with a bad written scenario, a rushed one where apparently Abrams is just ""doing his job"". It was a HUGE deception."
"Mar 24, 2020",negative,Was difficult to find something I didn't hate in every 5 minute block.
"Mar 24, 2020",negative,"Very week story structure which doesn't even recognize the events of the mess the the last Jedi was. No consistency whatsoever with the story changing what we knew about the original trilogy with rey being the strongest Jedi ever (even though she trained mostly alone) with godly powers. The other main characters were almost useless and the villain made no sense wiping Anakin's sacrifice in the return of the Jedi. If you only watch this trilogy and didn't really care about thinking about what is happening it probably won't bother you that much and you will be able to enjoy the movie, but for SW fans it is just a disappointment. To resume, from 1 to 10:
Story: 3- a real mess. The force is magic sent by god to the only person in the entire universe capable of healing deadly wounds (even kylo ren died for saving Rey). Side characters being there or not wouldn't change anything since palpatine could destroy everything with his lightning powers and Rey for some reason was able to reflect it... even though GOD DAMN DARTH VADER died from it in order to kill palpatine which should be dead anyway.
Visuals: 9- Only good part
Characters: 2- don't know almost anything about them and what we know happens off-screen and we just have to accept that the 3 main characters are best friends just because. 
As a stand-alone movie for casual movie goers: 6- its not a bad time...
For fans and as a part of not only a trilogy but a also a 9 movie story: 2- its bad... Prequels were bad but at least the story was consistent. The sequels and the rise of Skywalker are just a mess"
"Mar 24, 2020",positive,A very good end to the saga.
"Mar 24, 2020",positive,"good but the got the name of the pathfinder thingie got wrong, its name is suppose to be a holocron"
"Mar 24, 2020",negative,The worst ending possible for a great movie franchise. This and Endgame are both splitting images of each other and both of them suck
"Mar 24, 2020",negative,"Not only the worst Star Wars movie but quite possibly the worst movie I have ever seen. The plot comes from nowhere, in no way is there any link to the previous films in the trilogy and then the plot goes nowhere as well. Every reveal is hollow and evidently just aiming to tug at the low hanging balls of nostalgia. Bloated fan service mess than just isn't Star Wars."
"Mar 24, 2020",positive,Most enjoyable star wars movie from start to finish made for me. Rey saying she is a Skywalker at the end was cringe but easy the most fun I've had with any of the star wars movies.
"Mar 24, 2020",positive,Bloody EPIC! YAAAAAAS!!!
"Mar 24, 2020",negative,This movie proved to me that the Sequel Trilogy is vastly inferior to the Legends Continuity because at least Legends didn't betray their original source material.
"Mar 24, 2020",negative,"very very shallow
good for kids, small kids"
"Mar 24, 2020",positive,"While this movie was in no way perfect, I felt it did everything it needed to perfectly.  While I'm sure it had its share of plot holes, it really did a great job of closing up some of the more serious holes created by the previous film and if you've made it this far in the franchise, I think you owe it to yourself to give this one a watch.  You never know till you try and this one made me a believer again."
"Mar 24, 2020",positive,"Dispite the length, this felt like the absolute shortest Star Wars film I've ever watched. Too much nostalgic moments, and not enough of progression. I guess the Star Wars we've come to know and love has been hashed way too much. I look forward to a totally new direction."
"Mar 24, 2020",positive,"Surprisingly, Star Wars Episode 9: The Rise of Skywalker ties up many loose ends and kind of repairs the sloppy horrible everything done by director Rian Johnson. Star Wars 9 actually left me somewhat satisfied with the Saga. I hated Star Wars 8 very much, I mean really hated it! Star Wars 7 had several problems too but alas 9 actually left me not hating the series so much. I won't give anything away but if you saw 8 and pretty much-hated everything star wars after seeing that pile of crap converted to film then you may actually be somewhat happy to see this film. I'll just leave it at that, Star Wars 9 is worth seeing."
"Mar 24, 2020",negative,"stuped, it was a waste of time. It lacks everything that a Star War movie should have"
"Mar 23, 2020",positive,this movie is amazing
"Mar 23, 2020",negative,I guess new Star Wars films are not for me or maybe they are objectively boring.
"Mar 23, 2020",neutral,"Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker suffers from a frustrating lack of imagination, but concludes this beloved saga with fan-focused devotion."
"Mar 23, 2020",negative,"Man, this was bad. The worst of them all. Not even disappointed anymore.. it was expected..."
"Mar 23, 2020",positive,Feels a bit rushed at points but is overall awesome!
"Mar 23, 2020",positive,"A satisfying, thrilling and very exciting conclusion to a beloved saga. Not sure what else could have been done that would keep people happy. It's like when The Last Jedi came out loads of people whined about it so much and so it's obvious that JJ Abrams tried you counteract that. Then he gets slayed for ‘pandering to fans nostalgia'. We are truly living in a world where people just love to complain. Just enjoy the movie or don't - everyone these days thinks they're a movie critic!"
"Mar 23, 2020",positive,Un final épico para la franquicia.
"Mar 23, 2020",negative,"Well, if it was a B series movie with plenty of money it should be great, but all show inside has no sens in the saga.
Look like a quick made movies with no scenario and so many insconstancy with the rest of the saga and the rules of the force and Star wars universes.
Not seing it keep the magic intact, seing it makes you vomit. I hope that Disney never do such a disaster again."
"Mar 23, 2020",negative,"Just one contrived, sappy scene after another. Terribly predictable, every seen feels telegraphed and forced."
"Mar 23, 2020",negative,"There was talk of fixing the damage TLJ did to Luke's character.  Instead we got a 2 mins in a cameo scene.

This was not even a movie.  Just characters chasing mcguffins that lead to next mcguffin, that finally leads to palpatine for last half hour

The ending was as bad as it gets
Tlj did more disrespect to star wars.....but this was a way worse film.
Star wars is permanently damaged"
"Mar 23, 2020",negative,"Due to the lack of popper build ups, the payoffs completely fall on their face rendering the entire thing emotionless.

The plot is just a macguffin to find a macguffin to kill an evil guy that has no reason to even exist. Additionally, many of the plot elements are just contrived, often to no benefit.

At least the trilogy is over."
"Mar 23, 2020",negative,Another garbage Disney twist ...
"Mar 23, 2020",positive,"The better movie of the trilogy. Sure, it was the same old formula, and the twists were obvious, but at least it's over. Beyond that, the cinematography and score were beautiful; the acting & dialogue were much improved as well!"
"Mar 23, 2020",positive,"Entertaining, but cheesy at times. Too many hinted at love triangles that would’ve been better left out "
"Mar 23, 2020",positive,"Possibly a bit too fast paced but an excellent conclusion. Honestly, it has to have been hell trying to correct the massive blunder which was The Last Jedi"
"Mar 22, 2020",positive,"Очень странный сюжет, не логическое поведение персонажей. Не достойный финал саги. Единственные плюсы это отличные спецэффекты и боевка."
"Mar 22, 2020",negative,While the quality and graphics of this movie are spectacular. The story not only falls flat to make you feel something but rather destroys itself. Even if you judge this movie as a stand alone you can find yourself pointing out so many issues on how the story progresses. The movie fails in all fronts except design and graphical visuals. Every character action will leave you feeling annoyed or bored.
"Mar 22, 2020",negative,The only interesting things in the movie are the vissual effects and the last battle
"Mar 22, 2020",negative,"I truly hope the Skywalker saga is dead, this was the worst of the 3 after E6. It's time to focus on stand alones or slightly overlapped stories."
"Mar 22, 2020",negative,It's not even a movie. It's a string of cliches.
"Mar 22, 2020",negative,"See I knew this would happen. Last Jedi messed around with the formula so much that following in from it was never gonna be anything but a muddled mess. R2D2 was massively underused and I think that's an embarrassment, C3PO got his moment s to shine finally though so happy for that. The new characters I still don't care about at all. Classy way to deal with Carrie fisher passing all in all. Daisy Ridley is great but Rey is still mostly boring and badly written. And the emperor..... what on earth was all that about. All in all I'm severely non shocked by how the movie turned out but still sad"
"Mar 22, 2020",positive,"This movie is over hated on. Sure, some moments are a little bad. The first act of the movie has a lot of pacing issues, and it would have been better as a three hour cut. Despite the problems, this is my favorite Star Wars movie.

*SPOILERS*
Bringing Palpatine back felt weird at first, but it makes sense having him as the big bad. The Reylo kiss felt awkward and unnecessarily added. The battle above Exegol felt very epic."
"Mar 22, 2020",negative,"A result of a movie where at least half of it nothing important happened (Last Jedi). This movie felt rushed and stuffed full off scenes where no one plot point flowed into the next. Nevermind all the bits of the movie that were done for the sake of a twist or to be cinematic. I'm generally good at enjoying even a movie that's been panned (ignoring plots holes at times as well as ham-handed trope inclusion), but this had me checking my watch several times. We all know episodes vii-ix were created more to make money than to tell a story, but Last Jedi and Rise of Skywalker made it obvious past the point of enjoyment."
"Mar 22, 2020",positive,It's not perfect but it definitely corrects some blunders made by the previous installment.
"Mar 22, 2020",positive,"My favourite movie of the Skywalker Saga, visual effects were awesome, nostalgia was incredible, acting was great, the end was beautiful, in Episode 1 Anakin said that the problem with the galaxy is that no one helps each other, here we saw that the galaxy finally fought together to defeat the evil. Beautiful movie."
"Mar 22, 2020",positive,"Disney really dug their claws into this movie. Big decisions were made for no real reason other than to shock the audience. Star Wars has changed so much over the years it's unnerving. Rey's character growth was stunted by her origin reveal, while other characters were either reduced to minor roles or narratively ignored. It was all flash and no bang."
"Mar 22, 2020",negative,"Star Wars Episode 9 focuses heavily on bombastic action and exagerated fanservice instead of a compeling story and a coherent narrative, which ultimately results in a dissapointing movie and the worst of the Skywalker Saga."
"Mar 22, 2020",positive,It was alright but bring back Palpatine was just stupid
"Mar 22, 2020",negative,"First of all I want to make it clear that I am a star wars fan, but of those who are not against the new stories, I loved rebels, rogue one is very good and they have only defended themselves although tabien is a little lazy.

But this last trilogy is FATAL and this last movie is ABOMINABLE.
He leaves more questions than answers, he says goodbye to so many wonderful characters and in such bad ways that they are sad.

If I start to say everything that is wrong I honestly never end.
But let's talk about the most ridiculous:
-Armitage hux spy? his reasons, I don't want kylo ren to win !! what??
-Ray, she had enough of a little training to become almost a goddess of force who could have become empress !! osea sidius had to learn for years and she just woke up one day and is the greatest thing that has happened to her by force, she controls minds, throws lightning bolts, she has a super sixth Jedi sense and she has HEALING POWERS, she only needs to throw laser your eyes and freeze with your breath
-kylo ren osea how many times he was asked to be good suddenly he loses against ray his han appears, that nobody tells us where he comes from or if he is not a ghost in the force, but he appears and convinces him to become good, so just 3 minutes and zaz is good, says dad and throws his red saber
- The emperor bone this dude is suddenly dying and what a coincidence two super powerful jedis arrive, but that in front of a dying sith they cannot be more than insects and apart from what coincidence he can take life from them so he absorbs their energy and does everything powerful and begins to throw rays TO THE SKY, which is not the most surprising if not that with its rays it begins to destroy ALL of its enemies, but when those rays that brought down my ships are focused on ray for all rays with its saber, so WHAT? oh and so the WORST ENEMY SITH dies, the most evil and powerful dude, with his rays bounced by a saber -.-, so suddenly he is gone and the war and everything is over !!
BUM! Everyone happy; well less ben because he sacrifices himself to save ray and there with the death of ben the SKYWALKERs end there ah well but they do not end because ray decides not to be a palpatine, so just by his desire he says I am SKYWALKER then he dies lineage but does not die.

I'm sorry but I must say it:
GARBAGE ALL THE FILM IS GARBAGE"
"Mar 22, 2020",positive,"I loved it! What do you exactly expect from a Star Wars movie? This is no Shakespeare, we are talking about Space Opera. The picture was lovely, they give their most in order to entertain us. Oh BTW: I loved as well TLJ but that is for another post."
"Mar 22, 2020",negative,"I've never expected less from Disney, but they still surprised me."
"Mar 21, 2020",negative,"TROS could actually be better than this. I was expecting a lot more about this movie but I get absolutely disappointed. I loved some scenes tho but I was expecting more knowing that was the end of an incredible saga. 

Also, feel proud of daisy and adam, and all the incredible actors, they worked hard and did a good job :)"
"Mar 21, 2020",positive,"If Jumanji can fetch a freakin' 71% fresh.. Than Rise of Skywalker would realistically be scored about 1001%.
It's that good"
"Mar 21, 2020",negative,This movie vastly disappointed me... there’s nothing bold or new here
"Mar 21, 2020",negative,This movie is just bad in every possible way - major disappointment.
"Mar 21, 2020",positive,"Good Star Wars movie, moves at break neck pace. Kylo Ren & Rey are the best parts and moments in the movie. For what the movie gave me it's a good send off to the new trilogy"
"Mar 21, 2020",positive,"This is an enjoyable film and rounds the saga up fine! The film's biggest downfall is that it had to follow and fix the issue's from The Last Jedi, and JJ Abrams does the best he can with the limited room he had to take this movie in. 
It keeps you on your toes, it's fun to watch, there are some really cool moments and scene's in it and the big twist was something I (or I think most people) did not see coming, but was pulled off so well. 
The movie advances along very quickly, and would have been much better if it was split into two movies (although it would have meant for a quadrilogy out of Star Wars fashion, it would have done justice to the series), meaning it could have explored certain aspects more without rushing, given chance to have more grounding and better direction of the movie and could have developed characters and their stories more so. 
It was enjoyable to watch and a good time, other than over-use of lightning effects which made parts hard to watch at times, it was much better than it's predecessor (TLJ) and made for an enjoyable end to the saga. Not great, but good and enjoyable for what it had to go on after The Last Jedi."
"Mar 21, 2020",negative,Trash. It’s like they have superpowers but don’t use them. It makes no sense. 
"Mar 21, 2020",negative,"Wow, I would have never thought I might miss the prequels. But here we are.

What a sad mishmash of forced nostalgia and predictability."
"Mar 21, 2020",positive,"Watched it twice and enjoyed it even more the second time round. The filmmakers had the unenviable task of rescuing a story wrecked by a horrendous previous instalment and untimely death of a key cast member, and I think they did a decent job. Without being a great movie, The Rise of Skywalker (and The Mandalorian) nevertheless brings back a sense of dignity to the overall Disney canon. RIP Carrie Fisher."
"Mar 21, 2020",negative,"They basically throw away the story set up by the previous two films and create a wholly unrelated story. What was the point of bringing back Palpatine? In the end, it doesn't matter and nothing changed. Yeah, the so called fans and audiences like you are making Star Wars into a turd. And Star Wars, stop redeeming your villains. It get cliched fast."
"Mar 21, 2020",neutral,Made for a mass of peopple. Just not for me. Don't wanna see Star Wors movie for some time now. :(
"Mar 21, 2020",neutral,"Not Satisfying, the plot still had some unexpected twists and turns but the cheesy dialogues leave a lot to be desired. The acting was mediocre, felt like this was the weakest installment in this series spanning the nine films."
"Mar 21, 2020",positive,"Great movie the best way to end the trilogy of trilogys. If you're a true star wars fan you'll love it because it's STAR WARS and not to mention it ties everything together nicely with a lot of action, drama, and excitement. If you're not a star wars fan weird place to start but I'm sure you will like it if not miss 8 films worth of back story is much of a problem for you."
"Mar 21, 2020",negative,"Aside from the production values, the movie doesn't offer that much. I'm so relieved I'm not a SW fan, it's a disjointed and underwhelming end to this saga, nothing pays off."
"Mar 21, 2020",positive,"If the movie wasn't so crunched it would've been better. It was SUCH a pointless idea to have two directors, good lord."
"Mar 21, 2020",positive,I loved this movie it was so beautiful I cried so hard watching it.
"Mar 21, 2020",positive,I loved it! It was a great ending
"Mar 21, 2020",positive,A must see for all who have followed the Star Wars saga.
"Mar 20, 2020",positive,That it remembers that Star Wars is meant to be campy. It closed out the story well.
"Mar 20, 2020",positive,"The Rise of Skywalker feels like we're back in safe hands (JJ) and so once again, every moment is visually awesome, exciting, dramatic, and/or funny - the way Star Wars is supposed to be!! I watched it with a Ten Year Old beside me, saw it for what it was - a brilliant piece of first class entertainment! In other words, a great movie!"
"Mar 20, 2020",negative,Disappointed. The plot was predictable as the story unfolded. The filmatography and direction seemed like a b-grade movie made for tv piece. Truly disappointing end to the saga.
"Mar 20, 2020",positive,"Firstly so you know I'm not a hater. I won't have it The Last Jedi was terrible. For me it was one of the best Star Wars films, classic cinema.

This one, shame. Just too much crammed into it, that you spend half the time asking questions.
Would have made more sense to make 2 films out of it."
"Mar 20, 2020",neutral,"The big explosion after the train wreck that was this poorly planned new trilogy. A tragic disaster, but still makes for a big spectacle."
"Mar 20, 2020",negative,I don't know what I just witnessed. I could type a novel on everything wrong with this but real Star Wars fans already know and I'm glad I gave zero money to this film.
"Mar 20, 2020",neutral,meh. glad I saw it free on a plane.
"Mar 20, 2020",neutral,"So with this much budget, and huge huge fan base...they decided to not set up a straight up plan for the story? By knowing this is a new trilogy? 
Cinematography is great, special effects and I would say acting is on point too. But movies are watched for their stories mostly, and this one just makes no sense. So for merch/marketing reasons, you bring back literally everyone to the Star Wars universe from the dead, to make it bigger, better, etc.? Palpatine's return made no sense. This was really the best idea, or the greed was too strong to bring back a charismatic character, that most people recognize by the black hoodie? Shame on it, I used to be a bigger Star Wars fan."
"Mar 20, 2020",negative,"Bad movie.. Its pretty and effects too! But the story and plot is ridiculous! And the entire Disney sequel trilogy is just bad bad bad.. Also so much is ruined in this movie.. Force healing, Force skype calls, Force teleport items? I could go on.. its just bad! 
I would NOT recommend."
"Mar 20, 2020",positive,"I thought that Rise Of Skywalker was OK... The special effects were astounding and there was some nice character development on Rey, but the story was bland as dishwater."
"Mar 20, 2020",negative,This finished an awful trilogy. Even the prequels was better than this tripe. So disappointing
"Mar 20, 2020",positive,I think its a great movie an i know it has some problems but as a long time SW fan I loved it!
"Mar 20, 2020",negative,"What should I even say
Disney movies are all about Fan Service nowadays to be honest! Including all marvel films.
This movie was catered to teenagers & kids.
Unoriginal & weak. A Starwars movie that no adult would enjoy! 
Weak"
"Mar 20, 2020",positive,I guess the bar was pretty low after the RJ disaster... at least this was fun to watch.
"Mar 20, 2020",negative,This is a big disaster!!!
"Mar 20, 2020",negative,"Just sucks! This last trilogy was really bad. JJ Abrams destroy Star Wars. The episode 7 and 8 was bad, but this was awful, I really hate Star Wars now. 

Nothing works in this movie. Hopefully I don't drop my money in the movies and this was the only Star Wars movie can't see in theater. If you don't have see it, please, don't do it."
"Mar 20, 2020",negative,"Backtracks from the previous two sequel entries all for the sake of abruptly ruining character arcs. Writes out previously established characters all for the sake of plot progression. While the movie tries to explain already established characters, it still tries to introduce new ones. ""Tries"" being the key word here. The ever so mystical force is used to write the cast out of a series of roadblocks of the situations. Countless plot holes and approximately four different MacGuffins thrown into these sequences of quick-cut 30 second scenes one after another. Poor editing and sequencing with little to no enticing action or drama."
"Mar 20, 2020",negative,"Please stop making the same movie over and over. It's been since 1977 and the only Star Wars movies to show any creativity, beyond the first one, are The Empire Strikes Back and Rogue One."
"Mar 19, 2020",positive,"It´s a not so good film it´s not terrible but, not so good.One of the worst star wars and the worst disney triology."
"Mar 19, 2020",neutral,"I haven't walked out of a franchise movie this disappointed in a while...like, was that the ending of Star Wars? Literally, like...whoever has these new movies, they have an uphill battle."
"Mar 19, 2020",negative,"I hope they go the way of the Mandalorian.
This was entertaining, But a disappointment"
"Mar 19, 2020",neutral,"Combattimenti sempre più epici.
Trama onestamente poco credibile, il ritorno di Palpatine e il bacio finale con annessa morte non sembrano grandi trovate."
"Mar 19, 2020",negative,"This movie did what few ever could, It ruined the pervious movies retrospectively. Lukes story arc- meaningless. Darth Vaders sacrifice- pointless. The force? Who cares. Yoda? Just an old fool. Obi wan sacrifice and struggle? Not meaningful in any way. Who ever wrote this movie does not understand what star wars is and why people identified with it in such a meangful way. I loved star wars, hell I was a massive fan, watched all the movies as soon as they came out. I read the books..Now? I can honestly say its not for me anymore. Thanks Disney, great job"
"Mar 19, 2020",neutral,Not particularly groundbreaking in any way and kind of slogs through the plot but still has its moments. Really shows how Disney didn't have any plan whatsoever. It was clearly made specifically for the incredibly loud haters of The Last Jedi.
"Mar 19, 2020",positive,I thought the movie was amazing screen wise but there was a whole lot of plot holes like hyperspace jumping and how the palpatines skip a generation force wise all in all it was a good ending to one of my favorite series but I feel like they rushed it too much
"Mar 19, 2020",positive,"Similar to Episode VII in that it was neither bad not good. There was some nice action and interesting ideas, but it was also paced horribly and had some really stupid ideas. While disappointing, it wasn't an atrocity. 75%."
"Mar 19, 2020",positive,Some stuff redeemed but other wrong
"Mar 19, 2020",positive,"This movie, though the end of the Skywalker saga, felt like a rush job with far to much happening. Yes it had adventure, action, and a Gillian but no substantial story."
"Mar 19, 2020",negative,"If Jar Jar Binks were to show up in this film, it might have redeemed it.  This movie takes the previous film and throws the potential for a greatness away and leaves one to question the validity the entire saga.  The acting is superb but the storytelling and action scenes leave most to more questions that really need not be answered nor asked.  The most frustrating part of this film is the lack of respect it shows towards the Skywalker family.  Truly, this movie spits on Luke and his cronies.  Had I known this would happen, I wouldn't have gone to the theatre to see it.  No, don't waste your time on this film nor the next one.  JJ Abrams might have re-spun A New Hope but this film simply tells fans to stop enjoying Lucas' vision.  I'd rather read fan-fiction than re-watch this movie.  It's a dud.  Sorry Disney."
"Mar 19, 2020",positive,"Much better than the last two films, overall very busy, the plot thunders along so if you blink you might miss a key plot point. I liked that they finally explained where Rey got her force powers. One thing I think is important, be sure to carb load before you force heal someone with your life force."
"Mar 19, 2020",negative,Movie was awful. They have ruined star wars with this movie and the others
"Mar 19, 2020",negative,Not worth watching.  If you are a fan this movie will destroy everything you loved about Star Wars.
"Mar 19, 2020",positive,"Bittersweet as this was the last in the series. It was excellent, tying everything together. Thoroughly enjoyed."
"Mar 19, 2020",positive,"It's not terrible as The Last Jedi( I despise that movie ) But not as great as the prequel trilogy. Again, these movies only exist for the sequel trilogy to end in a cash-hungry trilogy that has no heart to the original George Lucas franchise we know and love. Lacks originality and fresh thoughts, but it is still a fun little movie for yourself to like."
"Mar 19, 2020",negative,"Got half way through. Felt like a bad fan fiction, like Hunger Games 3 or that last Twilight that no one remembers how it ended."
"Mar 19, 2020",negative,"Terrible pace, laughable story and dialogs (was this movie written by a child ?), shitty acting from most of the cast. JJ Abrams kept trying to say ""Well I agree with all of y'all, The Last Jedi was horrible, so just ignore what happened in it"". But at least, unlike TLJ, it was so random it made me laugh a couple times."
"Mar 19, 2020",negative,"Terrible plot, writing, and direction. First star wars movie I've ever seen where I didn't want to finish watching it."
"Mar 19, 2020",positive,"It is not the resistance who saves the day, but John Williams."
"Mar 18, 2020",negative,"Probably the most ""traitorous to the franchise"" movie ever made. 
So Palpatine says that he'll possess Rey if she kills him, 
so she kills him and now what? 
The movie ends insinuating Palpatine/Evil rules happily ever after. 
George Lucas must be fuming because he didn't turn up to the Premier."
"Mar 18, 2020",negative,"La película muestra tantos encasillados de cosas,que resulta ser un parcho gigante de una trilogía que defraudo."
"Mar 18, 2020",negative,It is a parody of a great series
"Mar 18, 2020",negative,"Stars Wars IX tries but fails in many ways to end a messy last 3 films. The first two Star Wars (IV and V) were ground breaking and plot driven cinema experiences, leaving fans wanting more. Then (in Episode VI) they gave us Ewoks (Oh look Star Wars fans, aren't the little teddy bears cute!!). They turned an adult franchise into kiddie land."
"Mar 18, 2020",negative,"A really bad Star Wars movie. It moves way too quickly, the scenes aren't given time to breath, and the final battle is one of the worst I've ever seen in a blockbuster of this magnitude. It's time for Star Wars to quarantine itself from the movie theaters, at least until they can find someone that can bring back some life & energy into this franchise. It's too bad, because I really liked the actors they picked for this trilogy."
"Mar 18, 2020",positive,"am a star wars fan, since I was a child, and this movie only tries to rescue all the inconsistencies, which was generated by episode 8, and trying to justify absurdities, ends up losing the essence of its story, a pity that Disney ended up destroying magic from star wars"
"Mar 18, 2020",positive,"Nice movie, everyone must to see"
"Mar 18, 2020",positive,"Movie was mediocre,but plot was bad. CGI and other things were quite good. It was very disappointing ending of Skywalker saga."
"Mar 18, 2020",negative,As insulting as The Last Jedi.
"Mar 18, 2020",negative,"The worst, most vile, most detestable movie I have ever had the displeasure of seeing. I hated almost every single thing about this garbage. The plot, the dialogue, the delivery, all pained me to watch, sometimes physically. If I had to give someone a modicum of kudos for this, it should go to the artists and costume people, they did a great job with what they were handed. The monsters that conceived this travesty in order to strip-mine our collective childhoods deserve nothing short of embargo. I will never purchase another Disney product, so long as I live."
"Mar 18, 2020",positive,"Good ending that imo, redeemed the whole trilogy. Plus, it was fun to watch, which I couldn't honestly say for TLJ."
"Mar 18, 2020",neutral,Definitely had some flaws but overall a good end to an amazing saga and I’m so sad to see it come to a close.
"Mar 18, 2020",negative,"Plot is bad. Who cares for whom is not understandable. Special effects and CGI are excellent. Having grown up on the franchise, I wish I had never seen it."
"Mar 17, 2020",negative,"Sad Robot. JJ and Rian Johnson dropped the ball with Star Wars. The final movie installment, of a trilogy that does not belong in the Star Wars universe. From the start, this movie destroys the history of Star Wars. It feels like an old TV show that took a weekend to write. I would love a Terminator style remake and Act like these poorly cast and underdeveloped storylines never happened."
"Mar 17, 2020",positive,"Hoo boy, here we go.

Disney's Star Wars trilogy clearly did not go the way they were hoping. Changing to such a different director for the middle film gave the trilogy an uneven feeling. Rian Johnson's vision was so vastly different from J.J. Abrams', resulting in a hard swing from Force Awakens to Last Jedi to this. This could have been solved at the production level if-

WHAT IN THE BANANA MUFFINS ARE YOU BABBLING ON ABOUT NOW? PRODUCTION SCHEDULES? DIRECTOR VISION? NOBODY CARES ABOUT ALL THAT, THEY JUST WANT TO KNOW IF YOU LIKED THAT MOVIE.

But that's the problem, 12-year-old James. There's so much more to film analysis than just saying whether or not you liked the film. With so many films coming out of already-existing franchises, it is necessary to view films in the context of their predecessors.

DUDE. CHILL OUT. IF YOU THINK TOO MUCH ABOUT THIS STUFF, THEN YOUR MIND IS GOING TO BE MADE UP BEFORE YOU EVEN WALK INTO THE THEATRE.

An excellent point. I know I avoided the Rotten Tomatoes page with constant vigilance in the week leading up to seeing the movie, and even then, I was still really nervous that J.J. wasn't going to be able to pull this off.

AND DID HE?

I guess. He got dealt a pretty raw hand of cards. His villain got killed off, some of his best characters were completely sidelined, and Carrie Fisher passed away. He had a very unenviable job.

FOR SURE. 

He was able to introduce a new villain really quickly, and had a lot of interesting plot threads. I guess my main complaint with both 8 and 9 is the editing; it feels like one planet hop should have been cut out to make the film tighter.

IT DID SEEM A BIT LONG. BUT YOU HAVE TO ADMIT THAT THE JOURNEY WAS FUN.

It did work internally, even if it felt a bit ‘video-gamey.' The references to previous Star Wars films were also great to see, especially in the third act.

OH MAN, THAT FINAL SPACE BATTLE WAS GREAT. THERE WERE STAKES!

There are always stakes, just not very much in the way of consequences. The only character arc that felt organic was Kylo Ren's.

HONESTLY, HE'S PROBABLY THE BEST-WRITTEN CHARACTER IN THE WHOLE TRILOGY. SHAME HE DIDN'T GET A GOOD ENDING.

It could have definitely been written better, but he at least got to close out his arc.

WHAT ABOUT YOUR ARC?

Say what now?

HOW ARE YOU GOING TO END THE ‘ARGUING WITH YOUR 12-YEAR-OLD SELF' BIT YOU'VE BEEN DOING FOR STAR WARS MOVIES?

Eh, who says it has to end here? I'm sure something from my childhood will get remade that I'll want to bring you back for. Until then, thanks for talking Star Wars with me.

MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU.

Ooh, I just shivered a bit."
"Mar 17, 2020",positive,The movie was ok but was not as well written as others in tbe series. The actors de to try but it just seemed chunky. But over all I did not mind it and watching it in the cinaplex thereater was worth the time.
"Mar 17, 2020",negative,"My lord ...  For me, this is the worst star wars ever.

A lot of nonsense scenes, forced situations, old characters that appear again magically...

I hope that Disney starts a new saga so many years after the original trilogy. New fresh story, new characters...."
"Mar 17, 2020",negative,"The Movie looks a lot like a trailer. You scratch your head for all the talent there how come, and I know they are paid a lot, don't the actors rebel and say something...it's just horrible!!!"
"Mar 17, 2020",positive,the plot was weak for this chapter like the other 2 sequels but the ending of the saga was satisfied for me so if you are a fan of star wars just you have to watch it love it or not let's hope that the next saga  will be great and good for us.
"Mar 17, 2020",positive,"Beautiful film, full of adventure and nostalgia. Were some plot points a bit forced? Sure. But was it a thoroughly entertaining film? Absolutely!"
"Mar 17, 2020",positive,I enjoyed the movie and was glad I was able to share the moments with my kids as my dad did with me. Not everything has to be great to be enjoyable and memorable. 
"Mar 17, 2020",positive,The director did the right thing on this one.
"Mar 17, 2020",negative,The death of Star Wars. Disney finally killed the series with this poorly written checklist movie designed to please everyone and no one at the same time.
"Mar 17, 2020",negative,"In the history of cinema there actually have been worse films. That said, this stupid lump of a film creaks along, bubbling with illogic, a ridiculous story and uninspired acting."
"Mar 17, 2020",positive,Palpatine said do it
"Mar 17, 2020",negative,"Lazy writing, horrible direction, absolute trash, physically painful to watch"
"Mar 17, 2020",positive,It is worth watching for Star Wars Fans.
"Mar 17, 2020",negative,This movie was clearly not set up and the return of Palpatine totally breaks Star Wars canon.
"Mar 17, 2020",negative,"Star crap, the worst ever. The series formula is just being recycled to death. Please stop, you have nothing left to give."
"Mar 17, 2020",positive,A lot of FUN! I enjoyed how they wrapped this story up.
"Mar 17, 2020",negative,"All around horribly done. The plot jumps all over, makes major reveals without backstory, and lacks any creativity. It feels like they tried to rob as many nostalgic moments from the original series and cheapened them along the way."
"Mar 17, 2020",negative,Heartbreaking to see these get more and more lifeless and sterile.
"Mar 17, 2020",negative,Kind of crap. Best of the new trilogy but not by much.
"Mar 16, 2020",negative,"What a load of unmitigated, convoluted, nonsensical pew-pew. What a bummer. They Games of Throned it. Let this be a lesson for all multi billionaire dollar franchises... they only ever existed because the word on the page meant something. Now, all they have is flashy spectacle and dripping sentimentality for when it was good. They never should have shot movie one, without having written parts 2 and 3. They never should have hired Riaan. I feel for the actors, some of whom are likely to go the path of Hayden Christensen, who had to be here for every minute. Even they must know in their heart of hearts what they made doesn't stand up to the promise of the potential of what that universe could offer if approached with intelligence, character and plotting. Sigh."
"Mar 16, 2020",negative,"No puedo creer que Disney, con todo el dinero que dispone para contratar buenos guionistas y buenos directores hallan aseptado esta basofia como el final de la saga galáctica mas importante que existe. Tratan de arreglar todos los errores de las películas anteriores de una forma tan apresurada que ni te enteras de lo que esta pasando y termino teniendo más huecos argumentales que las películas de Residen evil. Sin mencionar que los power up de Rei fueron ridículos desde la 7, y no pueden decir que su linaje lo compensa."
"Mar 16, 2020",positive,"It'll probably hold your interest, but the plot has its share of holes, and the characters are about as two-dimensional as you might expect from modern TV and movies.  Ultimately it felt like they were just redoing the original Star Wars.  Again."
"Mar 16, 2020",positive,"I understand why people hate this movie since it' basically episode 6. But I feel like this was a neccacary movie for the saga. some of the plot made no sense at all eg: Rey and Kylo defeat Stoke but then go back to fighting each other even after Kylo seemed like he came back to the lght side. that is only one example.

But all in all, I'm ok with this movie."
"Mar 16, 2020",negative,"This movie was so messy, confusing, incoherent, that the only way to describe it is insane. 
The hero is Rey simply an all powerful girl that has all the abilities needed to solve every obstacle without even breaking a sweat. 
Then there's the plot, every time they look for a lead a convenient lead giver (person or item) is right there to give said lead, and there is absolutely no point or motivation of it all beside the old star wars plot - Palpatine wants to take over the galaxy, Jedi rebels want to stop him.
everything else is exaggerated and unrealistic cheap plot devices to show how Rey the all powerful is better then the <put obstacle name here>...
In the end Rey wins the day, and says she's a Skywalker - because... reasons...?!

very very sad ending to a very sad trilogy that made no sense, so much so that George Lucas wants to take back the franchise from Disney and ignore this trilogy from the true plotline of Star Wars..."
"Mar 16, 2020",negative,"Very average, starwars really took a nose dive with the trilogy"
"Mar 16, 2020",negative,"Could it be any worse? This was supposed to be the great final movie that finished of the saga. It was absolutely horrible and uncreative. All the other Star Wars movies were just mindblowing and I understand it isn't easy to direct a final movie, but this, nope. Doesn't deserve 2 stars, I'm afraid."
"Mar 16, 2020",negative,Every trope in the book. Visually stunning. Absolute nightmare of a storyline/ ending to the trilogy.
"Mar 16, 2020",negative,This movie killed my childhood memories.
"Mar 16, 2020",negative,"This movie was really messy, I disliked it quite a bit. There were a few good points in the movie that I could pinpoint, but it was hard to find those points."
"Mar 16, 2020",neutral,"This is a disappointing end to The Skywalker Saga on many fronts, mostly due to some seriously flawed storytelling that should not have been given the green light. It's hard to describe how I felt after watching the end credits roll without going into the specifics of spoilers, but the way this nine-film epic wrapped up left me feeling almost hopeless but more than anything, confused. Rent it!"
"Mar 16, 2020",positive,"No soul in this one, lots of confusion and distractions. And why did they have to make Rey so moody?!? Why can't our lead be solid?"
"Mar 16, 2020",positive,"Absolutely loved the movie. What a difference it makes having a great director in JJ Abrams making this movie. The storyline, the characters, to drama, the fighting, everything fits together. Thank you JJ Abrams for giving us this incredible masterpiece!"
"Mar 15, 2020",negative,This movie was terrible. What even was that Rey Palpatine/Skywalker stuff? It made no sense. The movie makes no sense and has horrible editing. It's just a bunch of action. You're better off watching the John Wick or Taken trilogy.
"Mar 15, 2020",neutral,Ok film in the franchise
"Mar 15, 2020",positive,when all the ships showed up was one of the best part and there wasnt one part my family and I disliked at all
"Mar 15, 2020",negative,Es una tremenda decepcion para los fans de star wars. Una basura de pelicula.
"Mar 15, 2020",negative,"it was bad, destryed a bunch of things in the star wars universe, bad acting, bad direction, lacked imagination, bad bad bad"
"Mar 15, 2020",positive,I thought this was the best of the Star Wars series.  There couldn't have have been a better ending to the Skywalker story.
"Mar 15, 2020",positive,"Finally a satisfying story, now we can finally forget that trash Last Jedi was.
The ding dong critics complain that it was created just to undo the Last Jedi. Good, because that movie doesn't count for the fans. Rise of Skywalker cleaned up a mess, unfortunately it meant it crammed a lot of story into one movie, but so be it, it had to be done. Screw everything about the middle movie that doesn't need to exist."
"Mar 15, 2020",positive,I enjoyed this movie. A lot.
"Mar 15, 2020",positive,"Well it was not the best star wars movie.Force healing is my biggest complaint in the movie. The whole point of Anakin becoming Darth Vader was because he wanted to find a way to heal Padme. If force healing was around he could have just healed her and his mom. Also that force transport was kind of weird. But there were good things about the movie like the fitting ending Leia got, and Lando coming back is good, and yeah this is iconic because its the end of a saga. Although I did not like this movie that muchI would recommend it to any star wars fan"
"Mar 15, 2020",positive,An okay but satisfying end.
"Mar 15, 2020",negative,Terrible movie. Boring. Terrible messaging. Unearned emotional moments. Stupid.
"Mar 15, 2020",negative,"Easy plot, everything is the most important mission there is. Very little logic and more often a remake of the earlier movies. Still cannot connect to Rey. Really missing the learning curve that Luke had to go through. Rey is just the master of everything including using a skimmer she has not ever seen before in her time on a desert planet. I really miss the first movies and DIsney and Abrams are not capturing the feel."
"Mar 15, 2020",negative,"Shameful, sad, and overwhelmingly bad story. A fair ending to a bad saga. At least the special effects and the music can be saved. At least"
"Mar 15, 2020",neutral,After years of good story lines in Star Wars I find that this was not I was expecting in the movies and I would want Dave Filoni to direct this film because his experience in Clone Wars
"Mar 15, 2020",positive,I LOVED this movie. This is probably the best movie since the original Star Wars (now episode IV). A really good way to end the saga. I think there may be a lot of but hurt misogynists who don't like that a seriously bad-ass WOMAN carried this movie.  But Rae is fantastic and I was gripped at every stage. Truly an epic end to an epic saga.
"Mar 15, 2020",positive,"While the story did take a few shortcuts, I don't understand the level of hate being leveled at 'Rise Of The Skywalker'... certainly not to the extent where fanboys want George Lucas to return - who proved he can't write or direct his way out of a wet paper bag with the horrendous Prequels"
"Mar 15, 2020",negative,"I really tried to like it, I really did, unfortunately this whole movie seems forced. It looks like it was slapped together in the last few days before release...
Sorry Disney, but the characters deserve better, as well as the audience."
"Mar 15, 2020",negative,What a piece of shit of a movie. George Lucas did a big mistake by selling the Star Wars rights to Disney. So they ended up making this nonsensical trash.
"Mar 15, 2020",negative,Hot f**king garbage. Fun space adventure but THIS IS NOT STAR WARS. 
"Mar 15, 2020",positive,"Missing a 2nd movie , but a fun ride overal. To me it shows how J.J. could have made a fun tribute to the original if he had done all 3 movies. Though it still doesn't add anything to star wars. I was OK with the first movie , hated the 2nd and i actually like the 3rd one."
"Mar 15, 2020",positive,I loved the conclusion of the story minus a few annoying details but overall if you are a fan of Star Wars it will be a great time!
"Mar 15, 2020",negative,"maintenant les sabres laser ne sont pas assez forts pour couper des armes, du monde.. :)  horrible"
"Mar 15, 2020",negative,"If there had been more Richard E Grant, this may have been a better movie. Criminally underused.

The rest of the movie is just awful. Unintentionally comical, poor storytelling, and the ruining of an iconic scene fro. The original movie.

The usual bish bosh bang and great special effects, but the film was a big let down. Some more clinical editing could've saved this film, as with the previous movie (Force movement). 

A poor end and to a tri-trilogy and to the poor trilogy itself.

Rogue one continues to look more like a masterpiece. Lets hope they can maintain the quality of the Mandalorian."
"Mar 14, 2020",positive,"All negative critics are wrong !!! Sure, it has it's flaws, like some unanswered questions and unfilled parts, but overall The Rise of Skywalker happens to be the great ending to one big and beloved Star Wars saga. Way better than The Last Jedi if you ask me."
"Mar 14, 2020",negative,"I understand that I, as an expanded universe fan, am absolutely not the target for these movies. If you want an action-packed movie, and can get over sloppy narratives, deus ex tropes, and plot convenience, definitely watch this movie, otherwise it will take you out of an otherwise immersive experience."
"Mar 14, 2020",positive,I was 4 years old when I saw IV. IX was amazing because it brought me back to the magical fantasy I have loved my whole life. The circuit is now complete.
"Mar 14, 2020",negative,This movie was supposed to be the big climax of grand saga. Insted it feels like a fanfic written by a 9 year old.
"Mar 14, 2020",neutral,"Star Wars has always made me feel things, whether they be joy, sadness, anger, bittersweetness, peace, satisfaction, etc. I think it's important to note that this is the first Star Wars movie where, besides the Han Solo scene, I genuinely felt very little during the entire film. I genuinely think it is nearly soulless. And once I left, I was hit by a wave of feelings: disappointment, annoyance, frustration, confusion, and finally a sort of dissatisfied surrender as I realized this is how the saga ended whether I liked it or not."
"Mar 14, 2020",positive,"This is the best of the new trilogy. Ignore the critics, it seems to me that as a Star Wars fan from the very beginning (born in 1975) that the critics were almost trained to dislike this movie. As a passionate lover of the Star Wars universe, and not a big fan of the last two movies but still enjoyed them, I can say this was the best of the new three."
"Mar 14, 2020",positive,"Pode soar estranho para muitos, mas considero esse filme realmente o melhor da nova trilogia.

Por mais que nunca tenha sido um hater das prequels, eu sempre enxerguei seus defeitos e nunca considerei os dois primeiros episódios muito empolgantes. A Vingança dos Sith se salva com certeza, mas ainda assim possui erros que descendem dos filmes anteriores.

Mesmo sem um roteiro tão complexo igual aos episódios I, II, e III, as sequels foram muito mais divertidas de se assistir e animadoras do que eles puderam ser. Os personagens são muito mais carismáticos e possuem seus bons momentos, além de passarem mensagens muito importantes.

Rise of The Skywalker só foi mal avaliado pelos críticos por que eles amaram The Last Jedi, diferente da maioria dos fãs, só conferir as notas no Rotten Tomatoes que você perceberá. Enquanto o anterior passava mais uma mensagem de renegação do passado esse transmite a ideia de que seu passado não é suficiente para te prender mas que é impossível abdicar dele por completo.

É dissonante e isso que tornou a discussão tão difícil, mas apesar da ideia de The Last Jedi ter sido mais original suas falhas de roteiro foram para mim imperdoáveis. O episódio IX também possui erros, como toda essa questão da volta do Palpatine, os rastreadores Sith e até algumas conveniências, mas tudo isso é explicado pelo ritmo alucinado que o filme segue do início ao fim para trazer um final satisfatório a saga. Questões menores foram deixadas para materiais externos explicarem e mesmo que isso seja um erro terrível no cinema, se torna perdoável em um cenário tão rico em material diversificado que se tornou Star Wars.

Diferente de The Force Awakens que foi muito mais no seguro, esse conseguiu inventar mais coisas novas e trazer nova perspectiva a Força no filme. Caramba, eles conseguiram curar pela Força e transmitir a energia vital um ao outro! Muito melhor do que o voo de super-herói que a Leia teve no episódio VIII. 

Considerando as trocas de diretor e a desorganização que o filme anterior causou, Rise of The Skywalker traz um final agradável aos fãs que mesmo não tendo tudo o que queriam conseguiram algo para se contentar. O legado dos Skywalker é eterno e isso independe de haver membros vivos de sua família ou não."
"Mar 14, 2020",positive,"The rise of skywalker is a pretty good film overall. One of its main issues though is the pacing and the reveal of Rey's bloodline at the end of the first act. Besides that though, it did well and I think this was another hit for JJ Abrams."
"Mar 14, 2020",positive,Felt very rushed with no time to have any type of real feeling towards any climatic scene. Not a bad movie but not a great way to end Star Wars.
"Mar 14, 2020",negative,"Lacking imagination, formulaic was completely unimpressed"
"Mar 14, 2020",positive,"Seemed very cheesy, predictable, cliche, and just not well thought out in many parts. Ending was by far the best part, although it also definitely had it's demons."
"Mar 14, 2020",positive,"Wonderful!! Fixed the issues that made ""The Last Jedi"" so disappointing. Excellent end to the entire Skywalker saga."
"Mar 14, 2020",positive,If you really really know Star Wars you will understand how she is as strong. So good.
"Mar 13, 2020",negative,While the film was fun to watch and would have been great if it was not part of the Star Wars film saga. This show's no respect to the story and plot of the first 8 movies and what could have been an Avengers Endgame level of conclusion I was left feel blah and done with Star Wars.
"Mar 13, 2020",positive,This final Saga Star Wars Skywalker
"Mar 13, 2020",positive,"it has crispy visuals, although the story.......... is confusing..........."
"Mar 13, 2020",negative,"They fell short explaining certain characters in the story. It was rushed and they didn't get into any detail on how Emperor Palpatine survived they referenced that he had clone technology but, never confirmed he was a clone. Darth Vader being the chosen one of prophecy was all contradicted. In Return Of The Jedi the Death Star was blown into pieces. The way they shot the Death Star blowing up was a big nuclear explosion leaving the Death Star into ""space dust"" Rise Of Skywalker was lazy writing, poor character development. The only thing that looked good in the Rise Of Skywalker was the CGI they did with Princess Leia. Return Of The Jedi was the end of the Star Wars Saga. Rise Of Skywalker should've just been a 10 min youtube video dubbed as Disney's Official Fan-Film on their version of Star Wars.

I wish I could give it no stars. The reason why I gave it a low rating score. The Rise Of Skywalker didn't make any sense according to the story line Lucas left behind before he sold it to Disney. To me Rise Of Skywalker isn't canon. Entertaining to watch? Yes. but, it doesn't do justice on completing the actual series the fans followed. Too much contradictory to the story line on prior events and nothing really explained. 

Overall Conclusion:
The Phantom Menace should've been ranked higher due to the fact Darth Maul's character development and light saber duel were one of the most legendary fight scenes in the Star Wars Franchise. The Rise Of Skywalker didn't have anything memorable. Light saber battles were mediocre, nothing stood out. Just lots of recycled material with nothing new to put in the picture. The Rise Of Skywalker is Disney's Fan Film. So, They need to make another film that actually stays true to Return Of The Jedi Story or quit while they're ahead."
"Mar 13, 2020",negative,"It was like visual cocaine but Johnny Depp wasn't around to make it cool. I guess it was better than the book, which is backwards and sad... 

Also how is this movie ""most anticipated dvd coming"" if it has a score of half???"
"Mar 13, 2020",positive,Not sure why all the negative reviews other than a few things that didn't make sense from previous storyline. Overall I enjoyed it and liked many aspects of the movie.
"Mar 12, 2020",positive,Well it was like avengers endgame. I enjoyed it.
"Mar 12, 2020",negative,"trash, embarras ment"
"Mar 12, 2020",positive,"Despite the ratings the critics give the film, it's far better than the last movie. This time with a decent plot and getting rid of the space race, weak story arcs of the previous film. Though it has it's shortcomings and weird scenes, overall, it's the most original and best film of the trilogy."
"Mar 12, 2020",positive,A must see movie! Sad to see the end of an era.
"Mar 12, 2020",negative,"While it had its moments, and beautifully shot action sequences, this felt more like a fan film and Homage to #Reylo fans and The Last Jedi haters."
"Mar 11, 2020",positive,"I think this movie got way too much hate. I thought the storyline was great. Although, there were a lot of side stories.  It provided a lot of fan service and was one of my favorite movies. I came out of the theater loving it. I was so disapointed when i got home to the hate"
"Mar 11, 2020",neutral,So i didn't liked the movie in general but i gotta say the VFX and Fight Sequences were pretty good. But the writing was not good and i also didn't liked how Adam Driver's abilities were wasted.
"Mar 11, 2020",positive,"This film is very good, because it  has lots of wars.The ators are relly good. My favorite person is Rey. This movie happens in a galaxy, the story is about: Luke Skywalker, Rey and her cousin."
"Mar 11, 2020",positive,"This movie tries to course correct from Last Jedi. Explanations are shoehorned in. It pretends there are risks, but has no consequences."
"Mar 11, 2020",positive,"I personally really enjoyed this movie, there were some odd moments here and there but its a very good movie. Best of the new triology, and one of the bests of the saga. (Personal opinion)"
"Mar 11, 2020",positive,This was ok but I liked the original ones best. I miss Harrison Ford.
"Mar 11, 2020",positive,"Worst of sequels, does not fit to the rest of them. Uninventive and naive plot, unnecessary new characters, lots of unexplained things. Was not boring to watch, it just was nothing special, like the movie I am going to forget it existed couple days later."
"Mar 11, 2020",negative,This movie is a f-n mess. It is a result of lack of planning and reasonable logical scripting.
"Mar 11, 2020",positive,Awesome ending to an exceptional saga.
"Mar 10, 2020",positive,"I liked very much! I smiled, I cried, I had much fun!"
"Mar 10, 2020",positive,"Great movie, it felt like some things came out of nowhere (not spoiling it) but I loved it. (I may be a little biased because I'm a huge Star Wars fan)"
"Mar 9, 2020",positive,Love Star Wars story line  good 👍👍👍👍👍
"Mar 9, 2020",positive,"I find it hard to dislike much about any of the Star Wars franchise films. Special effects and cinematography were on point as usual. The main story was kind of basic and didn't seem to allow for a lot of additional story lines or action, as can be found in many previous Star Wars movies. The end became quite predictable and was almost a deja vu type moment. Not the best ending, but not the worst for a franchise with some varying plot performances."
"Mar 9, 2020",positive,"I enjoyed the way it flowed and the effects were incredible. Never took my eyes off the screen.
Cast well for sure."
"Mar 8, 2020",negative,"OMG you just killed off every Skywalker and gave the galaxy to the Palps!!! Gone is Vader redemption ark, gone are the true Jedi, gone is the true magic of Star Wars. Every character worth a darn are even interesting you killed. We all know Disney had to as they make no money from the well written, universally loved characters but they replaced them with mehhh."
"Mar 8, 2020",positive,Despite it's predictability and tight corner it's shoved in after the previous installments The Rise of Skywalker is an fan-pleasing and heartwarming end to the Star Wars saga.
"Mar 8, 2020",neutral,Didn't feel like original material.
"Mar 8, 2020",neutral,"Just doing way too much. Watch the originals and compare to this. In the originals, there was a simple goal with each sequence and not a whole long list of characters to squeeze into relevance one more time before we go. The whole ""oh no, X character died... oh wait, nevermind"" over and over was too much. Rey and Kylo reviving each other was too much. Bringing back Palpatine was too much. I'm okay with movies being made to print money, but they also need to have some artistic value or offer something relevant to the viewer. The whole sequel series adds nothing that is necessary to the Star Wars universe. This is the weakest of the sequels. That said, I was still entertained, for better or worse."
"Mar 8, 2020",positive,It was okay very pong I fell asleep 
"Mar 8, 2020",negative,"This was a story that should have been split up into 2 or more movies.  Hectic is the story line.  No time is given to absorb what you just saw, just on to the next toy advertisement.  This seems more like watching a 2 1/2 hour-long movie trailer.  The kind that treats you to what you'll see in the actual movie, create all the ""wows"" and ""awes"" to jack you up for the whole story, without giving you too many details.  But even if they stretch this out, they would still have to explain the horrible final battle sequence.  I don't want to ruin it by giving away any spoilers to those who have been lucky enough to have skipped this one, but chances are if you are reading this, you'll still see it when it is released for home viewing and understand why I feel this way."
"Mar 7, 2020",positive,"I loved how the characters were with each other the whole movie mostly and how the final sequence ended, ending a amazing skywalker saga."
"Mar 7, 2020",positive,My dad and I went opening night and loved it from the moment the movie started. The action was great and the cheesiness wasn’t as bad as the Force Awakens. I thought it was a fantastic way to end the Skywalker storyline.
"Mar 7, 2020",negative,A major downturn in the star was universe.
"Mar 7, 2020",negative,"Pure, absolute drivel. Pretty lights don't make up for an absolutely dreadful story. All character growth was erased with a swift, terrible decision. Seriously, Palpatine is Rey's grandpa? Is that supposed to be good storytelling? If I could get my 10 bucks back and erase the whole experience from my brain, I would."
"Mar 7, 2020",negative,"....so...so dumb. Rotten tomatoes says I need to say more about this movie...which I mean isn't necessary...but...SOOO, SO, DUMB."
"Mar 7, 2020",negative,HAHAHAHA. What a careless effort.
"Mar 7, 2020",negative,"Star Wars ended running on fumes and with a flat tire. What a sad ending for a great saga. This is what happens when businessmen write scripts. If you ever read a positive review about this movie by a ""professional"" critic, please send that critic to the trash bin. He doesn't know anything about movies or he's on the dark side of Disney's paylist."
"Mar 6, 2020",positive,It was a good movie. I felt things didnt tie together really well in some spots.
"Mar 6, 2020",positive,"No esta ni cerca de ser la mejor, pero tampoco es la peor. La historia no se sostiene mucho y no creo que sea el cierre que mereciamos, pero esta muy entretenida y tiene grandes efectos y momentos de accion"
"Mar 6, 2020",neutral,"It was alright.  They really tried to fix all the problems of the Last Jedi.  While the cast has really good chemistry, the writing just falls flat and you are left thinking about how Return of the Jedi already did everything Rise of Skywalker did, just better."
"Mar 6, 2020",negative,"The movie was very poorly written. I left before it was over. The film is a sad addition to the Star Wars universe. What were the writers thinking? Most of the movie is Rey doing random force stuff, with her boy toys following her around crying ""Rey! Help us!"", ""Rey! we need you!"", ""Don't do it Rey, its too dangerous!"". Complete malarkey."
"Mar 6, 2020",negative,"Watched twice in the cinema. It's a okay ending to a poor decade of Star Wars. I wish it was better, and that the movies felt like they belonged together rather than just having the same people learning the same lessons 3 times.

The movie is tonally and visually out of place from the first seven saga movies, but less disconnected than Last Jedi.

Also Star Wars is again suffering from the old problem of power creep. Something that happened in the older video games.

It feel like 2 movies, that are trying to cover the loss of its main villain in the previous movie, while trying to keep one star alive and not letting old hero's out shine the new ones.

Having said all that Ray almost seems to grow a little, but Finn is learning to be a hero again and Poe is basically proved to be the worst fusion of Han Solo and Luke Skywalker anyway."
"Mar 6, 2020",positive,"I don't understand how people cannot like this movie, I think it was beautifully produced and I loved the storyline, although the ending did leave me in emotional distress!"
"Mar 6, 2020",positive,Loved it was awesome it was our 1st star wars movie we have seen def going to watch then all now
"Mar 5, 2020",negative,"Ok, where do we begin?

Going in to this movie, i had my hopes set really high. Thinking ""Oh yes, something new and exciting"" But i also had my doubts when learning that Trevorrow had left the project and JJ jumping in again to finish the trilogy of. 

OOOOH BOY was i in for a big disappointment. 

This movie is a straight copy of Return of The Jedi, just as The Force Awakens was a copy of A New Hope. All the new random plotpoints just springboarded into this shitshow of a film, made me really, really mad. This movie made me feel that they simply made it as a continuation as if JJ also made episode 8, and that that movie was a basic copy of The Empire Strikes Back. 

Only thing i can really recommend in this movie is the visuals. Which are amazing, the score by John Williams and the group dynamic between Rey, Finn and Poe, plus BB8, Chewbacca and C3P0. 

Storywise this movie is a shitshow."
"Mar 5, 2020",positive,The special effects were awesome!  I loved the casting of characters.  Left the show feeling great!
"Mar 5, 2020",positive,"While the film is far from being a satisfying conclusion to the Skywalker Saga, the film does provide non-stop action and fun moments."
"Mar 5, 2020",negative,"Worse than The Last Jedi?  Not quite, but still very close to being just as bad.  Ugh.. Disney killed Star Wars."
"Mar 5, 2020",positive,"The movie was a little fast paced, and had a few details that didn't fit, but overall i enjoyed it a lot!"
"Mar 5, 2020",negative,"I rate it 8,6 out of 10!"
"Mar 5, 2020",positive,Best Star Wars movie since A New Hope! My only problem with the film is the reylo scene 
"Mar 5, 2020",positive,"J.J. Abrams returns to complete the third Star Wars trilogy with Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker.  In the wake of Supreme Leader Snoke's death former emperor Palpatine announces his return, leading Rey and a group of rebels to go in search of the Sith world Exogol; where Palpatine and his fleet are staging an attack.  Abrams and his writing team do a good job at correcting Rian Johnson's foul-ups in The Last Jedi, and at resolving the story threads begun in The Force Awakens.  Additionally, Ian McDiarmid's return brings a new energy to the series and Carrie Fisher is worked into the film impressive well using previously unused footage.  And the special effects and action scenes are incredibly well-done.  While it's not the Star Wars film to ends all Star Wars films, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is an exciting and action-packed space adventure."
"Mar 5, 2020",negative,"The Rise of Skywalker completely undoes the story of Anakin Skywalker, ruining the original trilogy and prequels in a desperate and unsuccessful attempt to repair the damage done by the previous two films."
"Mar 4, 2020",negative,I'm a film student. I've endured 4 hour long films of drying paint and I almost walked out of this one.
"Mar 4, 2020",negative,"Fan service, too little, too late. It was a failed attempt to correct course after the debacle the Rian Johnson movie, The Last Jedi was. Bad Writing, a convoluted story that made no sense within the Star Wars Universe that looked more like a videogame than a Blockbuster movie. Sad ending to a great creation."
"Mar 4, 2020",positive,"Lifetime star wars fan,  absolutely loved the final installation.  I think it retroactively made episode 8 good, NOT through retcons,  just ""subverting your expectations"" on how you initially interpretted the movie. Ben is love, ben is life"
"Mar 4, 2020",negative,"Movie Review:

Episode 9 didnt suck me in as the others did. It looked beautiful, sounded beautiful, but it felt wrong. Its hard to feel something for characters that abruptly do a 360 until they become unrecognizable. I felt more for Rey in her first few minutes of intro in TFA then I did in the 3rd installment where I should have been more invested. Kylo Ren seemed to be the only interesting character that had a clear arc planned out and was kept consistent throughout the trilogy. Wished there was more of him and less of the others. Full of bold, interesting choices that were quickly negated and turned pointless and meaningless. The plot was over reliant on mcguffins and were pretty farfetched if you thought about it. Regardless of what you thought of TLJ, JJ should of continued that story rather than retcon it. 

The story choices JJ went for makes The Rise of Skywalker not thematically nor narratively cohesive to the whole Skywalker Saga. The Last Jedi was at least telling you something, it had a message. Rise didnt have much to say as much it had things to show a particular niche of the fans to evoke nostalgia instead of paving the way for a new generation of they want Star Wars to live on past the original trilogy fans. And if you are into the lore, this movie makes the canon contradicts each other.  

Overall, I never want to not like a Star Wars film, that is the worst as a Star Wars fan. If Star Wars can be described in one word, it would be hopeful. This one is anything but that, it left me feeling hopeless. 

The highlight of this trilogy was Adam Drivers nuance and complex performance as Kylo Ren. If this move has one salvageable moment, it was the scene between Adam Driver and Harrison Ford."
"Mar 4, 2020",negative,It was better then the previous movie but i don't plan of buying this one on blue ray lol
"Mar 4, 2020",negative,"This movie is beyond garbage but very much in line with this blasphemy of a trilogy.
The day will come where Disney acknowledges just how badly these movies went and will work on a complete redo with a story more in line with George Lucas' vision.

In all these years under the Disney Umbrella, only Rogue One and The Mandalorian are worthwhile."
"Mar 4, 2020",positive,"I thought it was awesome. I liked when Kylo Ren conferred back to the bright side of the Force, especially after reviving Rey."
"Mar 4, 2020",positive,"Abrams does his best to salvage this trilogy after the dumpster fire that was the Last Jedi. I enjoyed the nostalgic parts of the film and some of the loose ends were tied up after they were forgotten about in TLJ. Overall Disney absolutely blew it with these 3 films. They had a golden opportunity to create an epic trilogy that would have transitioned the old guard to the new. Who? Really, who did not want to see an older powerful Luke Skywalker using all his force powers and saber skills at some point (not meditating to death). Oh well, what could have been...................... "
"Mar 3, 2020",positive,"The film makers had a heck of a challenge given the state that the trainwreck of a movie The Last Jedi had left the story in. Abrams and crew managed to make an enjoyable if rushed and slightly flawed Star Wars movie. It wasn't a satisfying end to the Skywalker saga, but it is a pretty good movie in its own right."
"Mar 3, 2020",positive,It was fast moving and not too hard to get what's going on. Nice to see the original characters in it!
"Mar 3, 2020",positive,"While there is a fair amount of odd choices and weird/unfinished plot threads, The Rise of Skywalker is a decent Star Wars movie. There are moments worthy of the Star Wars saga, especially the return of an iconic character and said actor's performance, the special effects and the setting. If the problems bother you enough, tt helps to revise some of the choices made in your mind as you watch. And you get some creative thinking practice!"
"Mar 3, 2020",positive,By far my favorite Star Wars movie ever! Great way to wrap up the story!
"Mar 3, 2020",positive,"Disjointed plot, convenient and simplistic solutions to problems.  Felt like the movie was rushing to get through itself."
"Mar 3, 2020",positive,"I felt complete as I stepped out of the theater. It is a good closure and probably in par with what I was expecting.
One of my favorite moment is with Leia's part and Chewie's reaction to it. There are also a few other moments I felt deeply connected with.
Of course, it has some flaws (but as any Star Wars movie, just think about it). I wished there were more space battles (like in Rogue One).
But still I liked this movie very much, so what else do I need ?
Now, the Star Wars saga needs to rest, the fans need to bring peace to themselves and perhaps one day we will be surprised by the next step taken. Again."
"Mar 3, 2020",negative,"A conclusion that disgraces the original trilogy and everything Luke Skywalker did. Full of clichés, false emotions and bad explanations. It all started out wrong, with Kathleen Kennedy already in charge and then it got even worse with her bizarre ideas of changing directors and allowing all this booger to be made. The result could not be otherwise."
"Mar 3, 2020",positive,"Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker (also known as Star Wars: Episode IX) is a 2019 American epic space opera film produced, co-written, and directed by J. J. Abrams. It is the third installment of the Star Wars sequel trilogy 🍿 

It's very good! 😀
I'd recommend it 👍🏼

A fitting finale...

EVERY GENERATION HAS A LEGEND"
"Mar 3, 2020",positive,I didn't leave disappointed. Order has been restored in the force.
"Mar 3, 2020",negative,The definition of running a franchise into the ground.
"Mar 3, 2020",neutral,It's a rush finale and forgettable movie.
"Mar 3, 2020",negative,"Par for the course for disney star wars. Horrible writing bad acting, the only redeeming feature is that (hopefully) no one is forcing you to watch it, so you can just turn it off, or leave and find something useful to do with floor time."
"Mar 3, 2020",positive,Liked the ending but thought it was drawn out too long.
"Mar 3, 2020",positive,I absolutely love that whole new generation is getting a Star Wars trilogy! It's so great to see fan favorites along with new characters. All nine of the Star Wars films have been so fun and this one is no different!
"Mar 3, 2020",negative,"J.J. baby, stay in your lane... maybe give lost a reboot."
"Mar 3, 2020",positive,Entertaining for a casual Star Wars fan.
"Mar 3, 2020",positive,It was too long with too many plot threads trying to be resolved from previous films.  It would of been better as 2 separate shorter films.
"Mar 2, 2020",positive,it was a awesome movie and I loved it
"Mar 2, 2020",positive,I really liked it! It tied up a lot of loose ends. Glad to have a happy ending!
"Mar 2, 2020",negative,How can the story be this bad! Only the visuals are good in this movie.
"Mar 2, 2020",positive,It was such a great movie and a fitting way to end a series. I will probably see it again.
"Mar 2, 2020",positive,"Overall, I found myself really enjoying this film despite the 1st half which does have forgettable moments and plot points. Despite my enjoyment, the first act really hurts my score and the entire film. The questions fans have been asking are finally answered, but granted, not everyone will be pleased with the answers. For me I found the film better than what I expected but I can't help think that some opportunities were missed, particularly during the setup/opening. Regardless, I feel Star Wars fans will find lots to enjoy as they go down memory lane with the greatest sci-fi franchise that ever lived.  7.3/10 - Walkden Entertainment"
"Mar 2, 2020",positive,A great ending to a great saga.
"Mar 2, 2020",positive,Great movie.  Dragged during the first half.  Really picked up after that.
"Mar 2, 2020",positive,It was a great movie & it explained some things that weren’t apparent before
"Mar 1, 2020",positive,It was a wonderful movie with an awesome plot to it. The one thing I was confused about was that Rey killed the emperor. Earlier in the series of movies Anakin was soppier to kill the emperor. It was an awesome movie other wise.
"Mar 1, 2020",positive,it was great but not awesome but a great finale for Star Wars movie
"Mar 1, 2020",positive,"The movie was heavily detailed and the new characters were great in this movie. I liked the new planets in the Star Wars franchise. My favorite character was D-O because he talked and not beeping, and he said funny stuff to Adults and Kids. I also liked there was adult jokes. Let’s hope they make a another Star Wars movie maybe 2022 in December. "
"Mar 1, 2020",negative,"A disappointing finale. There are huge plotholes (""somehow Palpatine has returned""?), the characters act so differently from how they behaved in the previous movies, Force Ghosts appear randomly and it just doesn't feel like a finale, more like a random movie in a series. Pity the Skywalker saga ended this way."
"Mar 1, 2020",negative,Star Wars the rise of Skywalker is the disappointing trilogy of the Star Wars franchise
"Mar 1, 2020",neutral,Star Wars Rise Of Skywalker is an ok movie. It will work for you if this trilogie is your first.
"Mar 1, 2020",negative,star wars the rotten tomato am i right like and subsbire
"Mar 1, 2020",positive,"Awesome movie. Don't go off the critics they only 
Crap butt crap movies"
"Mar 1, 2020",positive,"Loved it.  Wrapped up all the lose ends, and relationships for this trilogy (and some of the original trilogy.......watch Chewie grieving for Leia)"
"Feb 29, 2020",positive,It was a Star Wars movie and exactly what you would expect. 
"Feb 29, 2020",negative,"The movie is a sinking ship, leaking with plot holes and they try to fill these plot holes with random nonsensical corks, but it can't save it this movie is dead... or maybe not its alive again!!! Oh its died again.. no it's not its alive yet again!! This franchise been dead since the 80s.. no it's not it's been alive the whole time in secret out if nowhere!! The good guys are bad guys the bad guys are good guys everyone dead but still alive, this film was absolute nonsense. Was the director drunk or high? I left the cinema scratching my head trying to work out what exactly they were trying to achieve. It's like they were making it up as they went along. The film was so choppy they cut fight scenes and battles and between characters so much it was an utter mess of a film, if it wasn't Star Wars franchise this film would of been one of the worst performing films compared to budget ever made."
"Feb 29, 2020",positive,Took my son to watch . We both really liked it can't wait for it to be on 4K to buy it
"Feb 29, 2020",positive,"I felt the movie pulled me in and then again as the movie and music rose to drama multiple times. I felt the actors and shed tears at times. Very powerful and a meaningful send off after 9 seasons over the years. It left me satisfied as the different times from the past, new and old. I loved the movie and I will add ""The Rise of Skywalker"" to my set of these movies that were so entertaining and I will watch them over and over."
"Feb 29, 2020",positive,"I was born the year Star Wars came out. Growing up Return of the Jedi was my favorite movie. At one point I could recite it. The was Herculean task to wrap this beloved series up, but I thought the did a very good job. I honestly enjoyed it more the second time I watched it."
"Feb 29, 2020",positive,good ending to the saga
"Feb 29, 2020",positive,"Marvel knocks it out of the park again with another tear jerking emotional rollercoaster. After Thanos is defeated, the Knights of Ren and Palpatine reappear, and their galactic onslaught continues. Only by joining Supreme Leader Kylo Ren does she finally defeat them once and for all. LIGHTSABERS!"
"Feb 29, 2020",positive,"Great acting and effects.  Lots of surprises, and a couple of not-so-surprises.  Wraps up the story, but leaves some room for more to come."
"Feb 29, 2020",positive,Im the fan who likes all the movies but if you're the picky fan you're not going to like it. They did a lot of detail stuff picky fans won't like. But I had fun and that's what matters to me. Don't hate me.
"Feb 29, 2020",positive,The saga was brought to a very satisfy conclusion.
"Feb 29, 2020",negative,this film felt like a disappointment and has me wanting a better ending to the Skywalker saga.
"Feb 29, 2020",positive,Solid ending to a very average trilogy. It’s a shame this is what they did with Star Wars. Could’ve been so much better. 
"Feb 29, 2020",negative,Predictable tripe. May as well have been with by a 8yo.
"Feb 28, 2020",negative,"an hour in i looked at my gf and said ""do you even care how this ends?""
that's really all i have to say about that."
"Feb 28, 2020",positive,Kept my interest but .........
"Feb 28, 2020",positive,"I liked the movie very well.  It had a very nice closing finish.  It answered a lot of questions.  I really liked the flow of the movie, as well."
"Feb 28, 2020",negative,Garbage. Just sad. Tried to make 2 movies in 1 after mostly ignoring TLJ. Everything felt rushed. No emotional weight for anything. Worst Star Wars movie ever made. One of the worst movies of 2019. I wish I liked it. I really do. It was just bad. 
"Feb 28, 2020",positive,"For the end of the saga. This is the most disappointing film I've ever watched. The acting is fine but the story sucks, but I'm glad that I saw Lando Calrissian for one last time. The action sequences were ok as well. The third act was fine. Overall probably the worst since The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones. 6.5/10"
"Feb 28, 2020",positive,I like the idea of star wars but I never like the execution of them. And know the story behind the film it is depressing the lack of foresight and originality when there are so many storylines that i find vastly more interesting than the skywalker saga
"Feb 28, 2020",positive,"Entertaining, but the pacing was so fast there was no time for any scene to have any emotional impact. "
"Feb 28, 2020",positive,"There were some plot holes here and there, but in the end, despite what the rating may be, this movie somewhat manages to pull off an acceptable ending."
"Feb 27, 2020",positive,"This is an amazing movie and is an absolute masterpiece. The sequel trilogy is by far the best trilogy.








But this movie actually sucks dick"
"Feb 27, 2020",positive,"I like it, and it's not a problem if I like it ok. Just accept that i like"
"Feb 27, 2020",positive,I'd give it a 3.5/5 because most of the movie was boring and violent it was a................  A STAR WARS HORROR FILM!!!!!!
"Feb 27, 2020",positive,Action packed from beginning to end
"Feb 27, 2020",positive,"It was ok, saw it a second time and no change in opinion. Others before way better!"
"Feb 27, 2020",positive,"Much, much, much better than the previous movie in the sequel trilogy.  A respectable end to the series."
"Feb 27, 2020",positive,"A film series of this magnitude will always be heavily critiqued, and what a great deal of criticism there has been about this film! 

In my view, Star Wars needs to be a fun, action-packed fantasy allowing the viewer to turn their brain off and enjoy the ride. 

The film delivered on providing consistent relentlessly paced progressive action told through a character-driven storyline, with a large-scaled overarching threat that links all the films in the saga together.

I agree with some of the criticism the film has received since release, it's certainly not perfect, although neither was the original trilogy. I find it interesting that as a consensus, the general public seems to approve of ROS, film critics did not. 

ROS currently has a critic score of 58%, while the audience score is 88% on RT - somehow this film has been judged too harshly, and I can't help but feel that it's riding an unfortunate wave created by the controversial splash that was made by the Last Jedi."
"Feb 27, 2020",negative,"Better than Last Jedi but still, that isn't saying much"
"Feb 27, 2020",negative,well... someone finally ruined my childhood
"Feb 27, 2020",positive,It was like they tried to shove 3 different movies into one. It was probably better than Last Jedi but I expected a lot better effort from Disney. There better be at least three hours of deleted scenes in the blu ray or I am not buying it.
"Feb 27, 2020",positive,A great finale to these wonderful movies Ive been going to my whole life.
"Feb 27, 2020",neutral,"Gostei da idéia nostálgica do filme, é divertida, descontraída, persuasiva e até dá um ""Mind Blow"" I'ma vez ou outra. Entretanto, continua querendo fazendo o velho clichê de Donzela indefesa, saltos milagrosos, roteiro que procura sempre ajudar o protagonista, alem de ser raso."
"Feb 27, 2020",positive,"When the movie started, it took me back to the same feeling of excitement I had 22 years ago when the first movie came out.  The movie was a gripping conclusion to a saga of good vs evil.  There were great new characters and beings, but the movie also included characters from the beginning."
"Feb 26, 2020",positive,"It's hard to rate SW:RoS by itself, as many of its cons stem from The Last Jedi and resolving those plotlines quickly. RoS was a fast paced movie, missing much of what many Star Wars love about the series-dialogue. However, the action and CGI was incredible, and it serves as probably the best end to the sequel series that we could have gotten after TLJ.

Probably the biggest pro is that it sets up many different side series and movies in the future. Always love more SW!"
"Feb 26, 2020",neutral,"Honestly, it could have been a better way to end the saga properly...

The screenplay has huge issues, not to mention the lack of originality and imagination to create an intriguing plot. Despite this, it has potential as far as special effects are concerned. Cinematography and sound are both good, but honestly not that much as its predecessor (2017).
A good beginning that unfortunately drops down to a complete collapse at the end.

Final score: 5.5/10"
"Feb 26, 2020",positive,It was so good I watched it twice
"Feb 26, 2020",negative,"What an absolute expected failure of a story. Rey is as boring as ever, still a marry sue who is instantly loved by all. She can even summon the most powerful dark side power by accident. The force used to be mysterious and required training now its an all purpose plot filler. Finn is again wasted, which is a shame because he had such promise. Three films and he accomplished nothing. Both he and Poe have so much missed potential that is just left behind in exchange we get the return of the emperor. Oh boy. Don't worry guys it wasn't anakin Skywalker who brought balance to the force, who payed the ultimate price to destroy the empire he himself helped build in one last shot at redemption. No no no it's Rey the white bread protagonist of our nightmares who killed him. Not some pesky man whose entire storyline built up to him betraying his master. Nope it's Rey, forget anakin and luke. In fact you can just skip the OT seeing as nothing of consequence happens. I mean after all this is the story of Rey defeating the empire the OT was merely a speed bump for old man sheev seeing as he is now more powerful after being exploded. This movie makes so little sense it's not hard to tell it was designed by Committee. Is it worse that TLJ? I'm not sure. Bundle them together and chuck them both into the fires of mount doom."
"Feb 26, 2020",negative,"DESTROYS EVERYTHING!! the saga,the lore,and all u already knew about the jedis siths and balance"
"Feb 26, 2020",positive,"Great performances & effects, great art direction and explosions. But the dialogue!  Let's let this franchise end."
"Feb 26, 2020",positive,Definitely isn’t like the other Star Wars movies. Disney’s romanticized and magical style is all over this. If you keep that in mind you won’t be as disappointed.
"Feb 26, 2020",positive,"Fantastic conclusion to the saga! Fun, exciting, and well paced! Sure it skips a few plot points, but overall it is a really fun and exciting movie! Here's hoping it inspires future generations!"
"Feb 25, 2020",positive,I love how they went deeper into their stories
"Feb 25, 2020",negative,"Disappointing, better then the other two, but still weak plot and storyline.  They should have just made the Thrawn trilogy instead."
"Feb 25, 2020",negative,"Everything that was right about Last Jedi, it changed it in order to make fanservice. 
No development of characters (even with the amazing performance of both Adam and  Daisy), no time to actually breathe between scenes, and above all an unsatisfying ending which doesn't worth 9 movies as it should. 
Best: Adam and Daisy's performance, quite enjoyable and I hope I see more of them in other movies.
Worst: Rey as a Palpatine."
"Feb 25, 2020",negative,It's an absolute mess. I was bored after the first half and didn't care about what was going to happen. I laughed throughout most of the movie because it was so terrible. Countless resurrections and plot going faster than an x-wing drained all of the emotions from this movie. Still better than The Last Jedi though.
"Feb 25, 2020",negative,Who actually thinks this story made any sense. It was complete garbage.
"Feb 25, 2020",positive,"To have been a truly great movie, this movie needed to do something special and different and great just as the first movies were special new and great. I didn't get that wow wow wow this is new and great feeling. But I didn't joy the film. I think the ending was acceptable and reasonable and entertaining but do you really want to have this ninth film ending in an acceptable and reasonable and entertaining way? This was the time to really zap the audience for one last time and maybe it didn't happen. But it was a good enough film to have done the series proud and not have done a disservice to the rest of the other films.
Sprinkling in nostalgic moments was indeed moving for someone like me in my mid-50s, but not the wow wow wow moments of something new and dazzling. But they were lovely to have and that was a feature that Star Wars took advantage of to help spice the movie."
"Feb 25, 2020",negative,"Horrible movie... This almost feels like I was watching Cinderella in space, I'm glad they give explanation behind snoke creation ,but one of the most confusing question is HOW THE HELL WAS PALPATINE WAS ALIVE THE WHOLE TIME?? His body literally got destroyed in the Death Star and yet the movie never explained it. I am sorry but as a huge Star Wars fan I have to admit this is THE worst Star Wars movie ever, everything did not fit in the Star Wars universe because Disney made it too happy like some fairy tail"
"Feb 25, 2020",positive,loved everything! i have seen it multiple times in the theater. will watch it another 50 before i die an old woman!
"Feb 25, 2020",positive,Great movie! Tied everything together for the final episode. Wish it was shot with a little more light and not so dark.
"Feb 25, 2020",positive,Loved the continuation of the Star Wars families. Great characters and just exciting story lines and twists!  The same quality as all the others!
"Feb 25, 2020",negative,does it even matter at this point. who thought sequels so rapid wouldn't cause burnout for the series?
"Feb 25, 2020",negative,Please stop. Its so bad.
"Feb 25, 2020",positive,lots of action & plot going on. dramatic ending....but really long....hopefully this is the end of the Star wars saga LOL
"Feb 25, 2020",negative,"God awful. While I could go into depth explaining my hatred for this movie, ‘Star Wars: the rise of Skywalker Pitch Meeting' on YouTube all but sums it up quickly. I will list five things, however, that made the movie laughably bad: 1. No consequences (seriously? Nothing bad happens to any of the main characters?) 2. The kiss. Just why. 3. Force healing?? What?! Why?!! 4. Bringing Palpatine back just because and giving him the most basic and boring motives. 5. Rey. She's just a boring character in this movie."
"Feb 25, 2020",positive,Another great film‼️ Way better than I expected. This is one of the best Star Wars films. 
"Feb 24, 2020",negative,"I'd have to watch episode's 1 & 2 again to be sure, but this may have been the worst Star Wars movie I have ever seen.  This trilogy was absolutely the worst of the three.  There is not doubt about that.

They crammed in way too much.  They didn't fill any plot wholes, but created new ones.  The death of the emperor was a complete joke.  Anakin Skywalker's story arc loses its weight because of these films.  It is obvious the creative team had no plan for the story arc across episodes 7,8, and 9.  Its almost like they planned to trash the original trilogy."
"Feb 24, 2020",positive,"So for all the people who KNOW, star wars is just movies and not real, this movie was awsome..."
"Feb 24, 2020",negative,"Awful movie. I strongly disliked episode 8, but this one made episode 8 better in comparison. It also had the unique effect of undermining the entire 9-movie arc. There was not one memorable scene, performance, or line of dialogue. Absolutely abysmal."
"Feb 24, 2020",negative,More horrible trash from Disney Star Wars. It is so sad what could have been if Disney only had a plan and good leadership in place for these movies but sadly they didn't and still don't. This move makes no sense.
"Feb 24, 2020",positive,Great conclusion to an amazing series of movies!
"Feb 24, 2020",positive,Good movie - but it felt like The last season of game of thrones - too rushed. 
"Feb 24, 2020",positive,"Not giving any spoilers. I do have to admit J.J. Abrams had some big shoes to fill in completing George Lucas's saga in the Star Wars Empire. You could tell it was a corporate film finishing the legacy and not Lucas himself. It was good, I can only say it was not Lucas good."
"Feb 24, 2020",positive,Not terrible but definitely overhated
"Feb 24, 2020",positive,Loved how they connected it with the 1977 Star Wars without it being cheesy.  Loved to see the characters connect.
"Feb 24, 2020",positive,"Satisfying tie-up to the Star Wars saga. Remained true to George Lucas original vision. The plot was exciting, suspenseful, and witty (where it needed to be). Downside: the film is too long. Some of the plot threads were extraneous. The movie would have flowed better if it was no more than 2 hours."
"Feb 24, 2020",neutral,"The action was fun and the movie obviously has a large budget. The acting was good too. However, I found the story to be too much of everything working out for the good guys. They did a good job of tying everything up but I just want the Star Wars movies to be something that they aren’t - much darker. It was fun though."
"Feb 24, 2020",positive,"I Jomama enjoyed this movie a lot

SO WRITE GOOOOD REVIEWS OR ELSE"
"Feb 24, 2020",negative,Very boring. Confusing and full of macguffins that lead you other macuffins. Forced situations like healing the worm with the force. Why would she even attempt that if she didn’t know about it. Why didn’t yoda and kenobi ever use that power? Really poor outing 
"Feb 24, 2020",positive,"Star Wars: The Rise Of Skywalker delivers a exhilarating adventure that is both emotionally and visually beautiful. Leia's scenes are amazing and the new characters add extra flair to the film. Overall, it's a great end to the nine part Skywalker Saga."
"Feb 24, 2020",positive,It was amazing to see the Star Wars saga totally wrapped up like that. Great!
"Feb 24, 2020",positive,Very well done finale to recent trilogy!
"Feb 24, 2020",positive,the action was awesome
"Feb 24, 2020",negative,It was soooo painful. The Carrie Fisher scenes were awkward at best. The acting by the living actors was not much better. Kathleen Kennedy should step down from Lucas Films for the murder of a great franchise. More like rise of Palpatine.
"Feb 24, 2020",positive,This movie was okay.
"Feb 24, 2020",positive,Dont listen to the critics. We wanted a movie better than the last jedi and they delivered. It was a good time and I enjoyed it. Cant wait for it to release on digital.
"Feb 24, 2020",positive,Represented what the entire series has from start and now until the finish. Definitely the best of the last 6 movies.
"Feb 23, 2020",positive,"Really liked the movie pretty good wrap up to the skywalk saga but there is always room for improvement in any movie, but as someone who has always liked the StarWars series I liked the movie"
"Feb 23, 2020",neutral,Not enough space battle action
"Feb 23, 2020",positive,Best of the three. Made up for the Last Jedi which I initially rated really good after first viewing but after watching two more times would have rated it a lot lower.
"Feb 23, 2020",positive,Great cinematic experience while remaining true to the story.
"Feb 23, 2020",positive,"Was concerned that the ending to the whole thing would be disappointing.  It wasn't.  If you wanted to dig into some inconsistencies or ""why wasn't this brought up in earlier movies"" you certainly could.  But it was a decent movie!"
"Feb 23, 2020",negative,"The final installment of the insult trilogy which is the 'Sequel Trilogy'. Plot-holes everywhere, main characters who still had no character development by the end of the trilogy, which was substituted by shitty jokes and a plot which goes nowhere. 

All of these shortcomings made for an incredibly messy film which doesn't even stay true to the source material which came before it.

This is not cannon and never will be, fuck this garbage which is disguised as a 'film'."
"Feb 23, 2020",negative,completely disappointing
"Feb 23, 2020",positive,Movie rating with dialogue 1 Star.  Movie rating Without dialogue 5 stars.  The actors and story line get in the way of great special effects.
"Feb 23, 2020",negative,"Honestly just a boring movie, and a disappointment"
"Feb 23, 2020",negative,"It is tough to talk about the Rise of Skywalker without pointing out some issues about the film. As a movie itself, it has a decent story and is easy to understand. The issues in this movie were the following: the tone, the pacing, and some...I wouldn't say unsavory. Some scenes in this movie seemed out of place. Despite my average feeling towards this movie, I strangely recommend this still. The big key detail I have noticed throughout the trilogy (Episodes 7-9) is consistency. I wished that more time was given for characters such as Rey, Kylo Ren, and even Snoke (if only). It is a shame that this movie was the last (presumably) in the Star Wars saga.  If you have time, do check it out when you can."
"Feb 23, 2020",positive,"This makes the absolutely needed reconnections to the original Star Wars trilogy after the soulless awfulness of ""The Last Jedi"". Felt good with a rollercoaster of emotions, and a decent job concluding the saga. Special effects were great. The massive stormy ocean scenes alone are worth the viewing. Solid 4 stars."
"Feb 23, 2020",positive,"As a film, photography, set design, effort, polish, all the things that make up a good film are present and are great.  However, the one thing that needs to be present was missing, a good story.  I was disappointed in the story, as with all the previous movies Rey's skill and prowess are totally unearned and we never see her developing, we are supposed to just take their word for it.  It makes for an unlikable character.  And it isn't even the BAD GUY, it's supposed to be the protagonist!   You end up liking Kylo more than any other character.  I won't spoil it, but it could have been much better."
"Feb 23, 2020",positive,"For actual Story Line followers, Disney Deviated from the common storylines, agreed on, across dozens of Star Wars series authors.. a must see for those that are indeed, dedicated."
"Feb 23, 2020",negative,wasnt impressed and very long
"Feb 23, 2020",negative,I hated Rey being Palpatine`s relative! There are a lot of points that no match with Episode 8. Caracteres are introduced from nowhere! And unnessessary the lesbian kiss on the end.
"Feb 23, 2020",positive,Probably one of the best Star Wars I’ve seen in years.  I would go see it again.
"Feb 23, 2020",negative,"In one word, this movie is contrived. Bizzarely paced with no reverence for what has come before, any who have loved Star Wars - and good storytelling in general - should be prepared to be saddened."
"Feb 23, 2020",negative,"Adam Driver can only carry this trilogy so far. This final installment felt more like a jumble of settings and characters aimed at maximizing merchandising revenues than a well-crafted story. Ultimately lazy ""revelations"" that fail to push any boundaries, but instead play it safe for easy digestible nostalgia; the ""knife-matching-the wreckage"" scene feels like a goofy Indiana Jones knockoff. (2/5)"
"Feb 22, 2020",positive,this is my 17th time. I still laugh and cry. love the way it ties up the last 40 years of my life
"Feb 22, 2020",positive,"I felt that the first hour or so of the film was a bit rushed, but as the film proceeded, I felt it just got better and better. The ending was amazing, and Carrie Fishers send off was emotional but brilliant!"
"Feb 22, 2020",positive,It was exciting and interesting to see what happened to the old characters as well as the new ones.
"Feb 22, 2020",positive,"The Rise of Skywalker is not everyone's cup of tea. But I've got to tell you, two months later this might be my favorite Star Wars movie. I've seen it  5 times in theatres so far."
"Feb 22, 2020",positive,"This is a fun movie if your not too dialed into the Star Wars Universe.  For those who are die hard fans, this movie was a huge let down and missed so many opportunities.  I think it suffered greatly for having multiple directors helm the three movies in the saga."
"Feb 22, 2020",positive,"A masterpiece, the best end the saga could have-"
"Feb 22, 2020",positive,I enjoyed this movie!
"Feb 22, 2020",positive,Very enjoyable despite a horrible episode 8 digging a whole bunch of holes for this movie to get our of. Was a good watch from start to finish.
"Feb 22, 2020",negative,No vision terrible actors. Terrible writing very disappointed I thought it was impossible to get worse than the first movie Disney released but they did..
"Feb 22, 2020",positive,"Maybe I now like Star Wars, expect for the final epic ""The Rise of Skywalker"". Is good movie and ending of it is excellent, but on story, the character Rey it should be Luke & Leia's grandaughter, not Palpatine. But it is a excellent movie"
"Feb 22, 2020",positive,Best movie ever. So amazing and sad that it’s over.
"Feb 22, 2020",positive,Liked the character development and the plot regarding the whole Star Wars series.
"Feb 22, 2020",positive,Satisfying end to both the sequel trilogy and the entire saga. Leave your preconceived notions of what should or shouldnt happen and just enjoy the film.
"Feb 21, 2020",positive,One of the best Star was
"Feb 21, 2020",positive,The ending was not what I expected.
"Feb 21, 2020",negative,"The latest and probably last movie in this once great franchise!! Words cannot express my absolute horror when experiencing this for the first time. I hope that Disney learn from this travesty of a trilogy and we get a decent movie in the future, wishful thinking."
"Feb 21, 2020",neutral,Still fun as a Star Wars film. But a lot of random and unexplained things and events. Poor story and bad ending
"Feb 21, 2020",positive,I don't like star wars 8 I like star wars 9 the rise of skywalker
"Feb 21, 2020",positive,"Love the Star Wars episodes,  very good."
"Feb 21, 2020",negative,"Big fan here - while some if fan moments were great, after seeing it three times- I realize how weak the overall plot actually turned out. Bringing back a big bad actually seemed out of place as it was never the plan with episodes 7 and 8. I wish they had built more on the ideas of the preceding movies. They could have still given us fan moments but in a better overall story. "
"Feb 21, 2020",negative,Theres no damn way the audience likes this movie at 86%. No damn way. It was such a piece of trash that I cant honestly believe it.
"Feb 21, 2020",positive,I loved Star Wars.  I especially loved the merging of all the old characters as the story continues. I'd see it again.
"Feb 21, 2020",positive,Loved it the storyline plot &  characters all great this one was extremely emotional it got to me the only thing I didn't like was Leia & kayle Loren dying in this movie the characters were overwhelming the pure emotion & an unusual certaincy self doubt made this movie worth checking out
"Feb 21, 2020",positive,"Its fine i guess, its pretty dumb but its interesting but its not horrible but its just a dumb fun thin movie, you kinda hope for more cuz there's so much potential with cool characters, worlds and stuff but its just kind of a sily dumb movie, its not bad but its not great either, but its too weird to be mediocre or boring, its fine but I really wish it was better. The dialogue is really lacking and lots of characters pop up for 5 seconds with nothing to do. meh, I mean I liked some of the weird crazy stuff, tgat was the stuff I thought would be the worst but it was the best cuz it was so silly it was shocking. Hard to review"
"Feb 21, 2020",positive,"I’m not even a Star Wars fan, but this movie was very good!"
"Feb 21, 2020",positive,Did wish ending was different--great seeing all the characters from different movies!!
"Feb 21, 2020",negative,"I really don't know what to say about this movie.  I really would like to rant but I don't feel like typing so much.  Straight up this movie is terrible.  There are too many plotholes to count that don't make any sense in the continuity in the film's. Palpatine is back, for no other reason than  to replace snoke. They don't even explain how he survived or why he sent that ridiculous message at the beginning of the movie.  They did a complete copout and used see throwaway line from revenge of the sith about sith abilities being unnatural, just total rubbish and shows JJ is a complete hack whose gimmick is just making everything so mysterious and intriguing and than giving lame nonsensical endings.  They spemd no time discussing how Palpatine was able to survive yet they waste so much time in the movie on these ridiculous subplots and mcguffins, and new useless characters.  Kerri Russel's character was completely unnecessary and did not need to be in there.  I could pick this apart for hours, so all I'll say is this movie is garbage, nonsensical , and completely devoid of any vision. It's the worst star wars movie ever made, even though attack of the clones was bad and cheezy as least it made sense in the vision of the trilogy, but this movie makes no sense and is just overall ridiculous."
"Feb 20, 2020",negative,"Really disappointing. I was one of the few who loved The Last Jedi so this felt like an absolute mess in comparison. The visual effects are stunning and there definitely are some enjoyable parts of the film, but the plot is just characters running around from planet to planet. The palpatine reveal felt like a cheat, and the fact that his return was never explained was infuriating."
"Feb 20, 2020",positive,It was good. But seemed very familiar.  Was a lot like the first movie.  Left me with the feeling that there could be more movies to come.  Which would be great.
"Feb 20, 2020",positive,"I liked all of the sequel movies. This one was the least good of the sequel trilogy movies, in my opinion, but it was still absolutely amazing!"
"Feb 20, 2020",negative,Force healing. Palpatine never dies because reasons. Rey is the Avatar. Palpatine is the dark Avatar. It's simultaneously ripping other stuff off and also attempting to retcon the previous movie and also other Force rules. For reasons. This is the worst writing I've ever seen for this series.
"Feb 20, 2020",positive,Everything was just fine C display name and take that the
"Feb 20, 2020",negative,"grew up with the original three films , this film was a space turd compared to the original films."
"Feb 20, 2020",negative,"This movie was ass. It was too long. It was boring. The characters' entire development thus far was stunted. Their personalities were deflated. How could anyone have wanted Palpatine back in our faces? Awful. Literally laughable throughout. Rose and Finn got did so dirty, undeservedly so. The ending was the most unspeakable part. I could not have imagined something more ridiculous. To have a story this good and bulldoze it in this way is very impressive and disappointing. Justice for Rian Johnson."
"Feb 20, 2020",negative,Movie ok did not live up to its predecessors
"Feb 20, 2020",positive,This movie is a great mix of New talent and surprise tributes to the past.  Go see this movie and may the force be with you
"Feb 20, 2020",positive,"It was an awesome movie! What a way to end tha saga, it was my 3rd favorite of all the Star Wars series"
"Feb 20, 2020",positive,"This was the best Star Wars of them all!  Tied all of the original trilogy into the prequels & the final trilogy, bringing the original actors back into play as well.  Well done!"
"Feb 20, 2020",positive,Tied a lot of pieces together
"Feb 20, 2020",negative,alright but garbage at the same time
"Feb 20, 2020",negative,it was trash because luke likes it
"Feb 20, 2020",negative,"Yikes, this movie is a mess. I'm going to pretend it doesn't exist. It exists for the sole purpose of retconning an even better Star Wars film: The Last Jedi. The plot is incoherent. It's full of nostalgia thrown in for fans of the original trilogy, which wouldn't be bad, except the nostalgia doesn't make sense."
"Feb 20, 2020",positive,Another great Star Wars saga! Is there another one?
"Feb 20, 2020",positive,I really liked this movie. A nice ending to the storyline.
"Feb 19, 2020",positive,"I enjoyed watching this movie.  Way better than The Last Jedi.  I just Love Rey's character.  She kicks arse.  Kylo Ren never did it for me in this trilogy, but redeems himself, mostly, in this one.  Didn't exactly make sense to me, the Emperor's return.....but definitely didn't ruin the film."
"Feb 19, 2020",positive,"The Rise of the Skywalker was an excellent addition to the Star Wars universe. The film had great special effects, & a lot of the entire Star Wars story line comes to a conclusion within this movie."
"Feb 19, 2020",negative,"Something unexpected happened to me during this movie: I felt nothing. I could notice that the movie was doing everything it could to pull me in, with all the epicness and the nostalgia, pulling all the tricks it had... And yet, all I could see were the strings pulling the puppets, and a pupeteer going through the motions of a ""Damage Control"" performance, trying to please everyone and risking nothing in the process."

"Feb 19, 2020",positive,Like all Star Wars movies it's filled with great action and CGI and as the story progressed I would never have expected the way it ended.
"Feb 19, 2020",positive,I'm not a Star Wars aficionado but heard good things and had to see it.  It kept my interest all through and I enjoyed it.
"Feb 19, 2020",positive,"Great movie, it was a redemption to the last jefi"
"Feb 19, 2020",negative,2nd worst Star Wars so far
"Feb 19, 2020",positive,Several activities going on at once keeping you informed as to what and why
"Feb 19, 2020",negative,Pathetic. What an absolute disgrace.
"Feb 19, 2020",positive,Fun from start to finish.  Makes a few leaps of faith - but an adventure throughout.
"Feb 19, 2020",positive,Han / Luke / and Leia did it 40+ years ago. Now Rey /  Finn / and Poe did it 40+ years later. It was a fun ride.
"Feb 19, 2020",positive,I did not liked the 3rd act. Ben and Ray did good. 👍
"Feb 19, 2020",negative,One of the shittiest movies I've ever seen with no logic in any of the world or character actions that completely ruin star wars lore
"Feb 19, 2020",negative,"As the end to a saga 42 years in the making, ""The Rise of Skywalker"" is incredibly disappointing.

Every time a character dies in the film, just wait a few minutes. This issue of the lack of stakes is a continuous one throughout the film. Kylo Ren's mask, which was destroyed in ""The Last Jedi,"" has been rebuilt, yet its cracks, much like the film's, are showing. Chewbacca dies yet he is actually still alive, C3PO's memory is erased yet magically it is restored. 

The film's plot equates to not much more than an inane side quest in a video game that has you fast traveling from planet to planet in search of various thingamajigs such as wayfinder devices and daggers inscribed with secret Sith text. New characters like Zorii Bliss and Jannah feel like NPCs you meet along the way rather than living, breathing characters.

""The Rise of Skywalker"" fails to accomplish every one of its objectives: providing a satisfying end for the character of Leia (which was not an enviable position to be in given the obvious restraints), providing answers regarding Rey's past, concluding the Rey-Kylo relationship, and providing an overall satisfying ending for the trilogy, and saga, as a whole. 

Babu Frick may be the only redeeming quality of the film, but it is hard not to think that novelty characters like these are created merely for the purpose of selling merchandise and toy dolls, which has defined the production of the ""Star Wars"" franchise for decades. Sadly, ""The Rise of Skywalker"" is the latest example of what happens when filmmaking is pursued for the purposes of making money rather than artistic inspiration."
"Feb 19, 2020",negative,"Don't know where to begin. Commercial as to be crass. Re-hash the same themes and scenes from the precedent movies. Add a bit of Dr Strange Supernatural powers to the old mix and ... drive to the bank. 
Perhaps the worse of these all..."
"Feb 19, 2020",negative,"Cowardly, cowardly, cowardly
To pare a woman romantically with her literal mind rapist, torturer, and stalker is beyond disgusting and despicable.  At every turn they showed that they cared only for pandering to the absolute worst, bad faith criticisms of the previous movies.  JJ Abrams, I am disgusted."
"Feb 19, 2020",positive,Not my favorite Star Wars episode but in the top half. And it does a good job of wrapping up the story.
"Feb 19, 2020",negative,Abrams did his best to undo everything Johnson did in The Last Jedi but it was an impossible task. As with the last two films in the sequel trilogy the characters are plain except for Kylo Ren. This movie would have been good if it was split up to make the entire sequel trilogy. The pacing was fast so you didn't have time to catch all the massive plot holes that plagued it's 2h22m run time. On top of that Rey stole Luke's entire story. She even stole his sunset.
"Feb 19, 2020",positive,Story line  very uninspiring.
"Feb 19, 2020",positive,Really good and accurate! Love it!
"Feb 19, 2020",positive,The movie was great!
"Feb 19, 2020",positive,The movie was awesome!!!
"Feb 19, 2020",negative,"This is a bad film. It continues the Reylo b.s. from The Last Jedi. There are many things in the film that don't make sense. Overall, it excuses domestic violence (a la Reylo). Much like The Last Jedi, I won't ever own this on DVD. Evade this film at all costs."
"Feb 18, 2020",negative,"Hmm, 43 years to finish the 9 films. Did not meet expectations although wrapped long story arcs decently. Hate to note it, however too much gratuitous FX. Wandering story lines."
"Feb 18, 2020",negative,Way to many plot holes. Lame story shit all over the lore there was not one thing about this movie that made sense
"Feb 18, 2020",positive,loved it one of the best star wars movies
"Feb 18, 2020",negative,"This was an absolute disaster. This movie does not feel like Star Wars. Not only is it a badly written and terribly paced movie, but it is also a horrible Star Wars movie. The worst thing about this, however, is that it is the last movie in the skywalker saga. Wow.  It's a shame I have to give this movie even half of a star."
"Feb 18, 2020",positive,Excellent cast - so glad to have seen it with my family!
"Feb 18, 2020",positive,good movie. There are some things that I would change but overall it was a good movie
"Feb 18, 2020",negative,I was very disappointed as a long time Star Wars fan.
"Feb 18, 2020",positive,My boyfriend & I agree that this one has been the best movie of the series.
"Feb 18, 2020",positive,"It's a fun time. Pacing is a mess and it's super corny, but it's not horrible."
"Feb 18, 2020",positive,Classic Star Wars entertainment and must see!
"Feb 18, 2020",positive,Corny rather than moving & meaningful & thoughtful.  Its not George Lucas for sure.  TOO LOUD. RIDICULOUSLY LOUD!
"Feb 18, 2020",positive,Very well done - liked the twists with Rey
"Feb 18, 2020",positive,Great way to end Star Wars. Just enough to possible continue.
"Feb 18, 2020",positive,In the true spirit of the original Star Wars! A must for fans!
"Feb 18, 2020",positive,Great movie! It was a nice ride straight through to the end! A lot of nice moments for long time fans. Wraps up the 40 year saga nicely. You will love it!
"Feb 18, 2020",positive,Best ending to a phenomenal story we could've ever imagined
"Feb 18, 2020",positive,loved it even tho it will never be as good as force awakens because of how badly rian johnson ruined star wars 
"Feb 18, 2020",positive,"Great scenes, fairly confusing plot line"
"Feb 18, 2020",positive,i appreciated how this film pulled  all of the story together -- it was a fitting end to a great saga
"Feb 18, 2020",positive,"Great balance of action, friendship, love, comedy and creativity."
"Feb 18, 2020",negative,"Spoiler warning, they kiss, then Kylo dies right after, such a disappointment for a fan like me"
"Feb 18, 2020",negative,"Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is an extremely fast, messy, and overwhelming movie that loads all of its plot points into a shotgun and fires them directly into the eyes of its audience. However, the movie isn't actually the worst thing ever. It's certainly better than ""The Phantom Menace"" and ""Attack of the Clones,"" despite what some die-hard fans might say. But then again, ""better than garbage"" isn't exactly high praise either. It has some funny quips, some cool (if exhausting) action scenes, and a whole lot of lightsaber fights. But unfortunately, it simply fails to tell a compelling story in a way that is both narratively comprehensible and actually engaging to the audience. It is basically a Transformers movie with a Star Wars coat of paint. As Kylo Ren once said ""Let the past die, kill it if you have to."" And Disney has certainly followed that advice with this one."
"Feb 18, 2020",positive,"Story was disjointed and formulaic. Instead of one planet-killer Deathstar there were thousands of super ships with planet-killer weapons.

Too loud in the theater. 
Rather stay home and get it on cable

The seats were excellent powered recliners - worth the price of the ticket by themselves"
"Feb 18, 2020",positive,I loved the story line. And it wasn't predictable. Suspenseful with as always great special effects.
"Feb 18, 2020",positive,"Valiant effort in trying to correct the course of this franchise. The first third of the movie skipped around too much, but after that it found its pacing. Good conclusion to an “ok” trio of movies"
"Feb 17, 2020",positive,Not mad about the ending
"Feb 17, 2020",positive,Amazing ending to it all
"Feb 17, 2020",positive,I thought it was a great way to end the saga. They did it with all the information they had based on The Last Jedi. I know they probably wanted the same director for all three so there were some different interpretation of the 8th and 9th one. Overall the way it ended was amazing it came around full circle to episode 4 and tied into the first episode.
"Feb 17, 2020",positive,awesome storyline and action.
"Feb 17, 2020",positive,Great movie with tie into the last movies
"Feb 17, 2020",positive,great finish to the saga.
"Feb 17, 2020",neutral,"This movie lacks good pasting,a good story but it was better than the last Jedi"
"Feb 17, 2020",positive,I was not expecting the movie to go as it did!
"Feb 17, 2020",positive,Pretty good Star Wars movie. Seemed a little rushed.
"Feb 17, 2020",negative,Trash Like Trash Can
"Feb 17, 2020",negative,Terrible and pointless movie
"Feb 17, 2020",positive,Answers the whole series and sets up more movie/show possibilities. 
"Feb 17, 2020",positive,Action packed. Great wrap up of the story
"Feb 17, 2020",positive,"Faltou algumas coisas como:
- Anakin conversar com Kylo
- Uma luta de sabres entre Palpatine e Rey
- Aparecer os fantasmas da força do velhos Jedi"
"Feb 17, 2020",positive,I enjoyed it. Overall a satisfying end to the saga. Although I think personally that some things could have been handled better.
"Feb 17, 2020",positive,Good clean solid rehashed fun. Much better than the previous movie and infinitely more entertaining than the prequel trilogy
"Feb 17, 2020",positive,"Nonostante  saltelli a velocità eccessiva da un punto all'altro della trama, soprattutto nella prima parte della pellicola, fa esattamente quello  che uno star wars deve fare: diverte, commuove,  fa incavolare ed emozionare. 
Peccato per  alcuni aspetti della trama che potevano essere meglio approfonditi."
"Feb 17, 2020",positive,Great special effects. John Williams score.
"Feb 17, 2020",negative,"Stupidest movie, dumbest story line, would’ve been better if she would have turned evil."
"Feb 17, 2020",positive,A great end to the Skywalker saga.
"Feb 17, 2020",positive,the movie was so good that this app needs to put another 5 stars on
"Feb 17, 2020",positive,"Fantastic movie overall.
As a huge Star Wars nerd, I loved most scenes, shed a tear in one, appreciated the story, but it did leave some questions I want answered"
"Feb 17, 2020",negative,"Bad movie, ruins the entire story"
"Feb 17, 2020",positive,It was a little lengthy at 2.5 hours. The ending was somewhat confusing to me. I would give it a 7 out of 10
"Feb 17, 2020",positive,Great ending to a series that’s been such a big part of my life
"Feb 17, 2020",positive,"Same ol flavor, feel good formula. Check all the boxes for a family blockbuster. Sound editing and mixing is amazing and exciting. Glad to see the live costume characters. Felt cheesy with all the return characters, but still it’s Star Wars."
"Feb 17, 2020",positive,Loved it! Great way to wrap up the series
"Feb 17, 2020",positive,Loved it....worth the wait!
"Feb 17, 2020",positive,did not get out of my seat the whole movie!
"Feb 17, 2020",positive,While the writing is a hit or miss the rise of skywalker is a not so bad finale to the saga.
"Feb 17, 2020",positive,"Episode IX did not disappoint, action packed from start to finish."
"Feb 17, 2020",positive,糟糕透顶!历史会证明，迪士尼收购卢卡斯影业是一个巨大的错误!但是特效还是不错的！
"Feb 17, 2020",positive,Decent closure to the nine chapter story by George Lucas
"Feb 17, 2020",negative,"A sad ending to a great franchise. Feels more like a mish mash of characters lazily cobbled together into a reel than an actual movie. There are so many flat spots, ‘wtf,' and ‘why did they put this character in here' moments that it isn't worth the investment to bother caring. The Carrie Fisher footage is so poorly incorporated, it almost is offensive on a holo-Tupac level. If you love Star Wars, skip this one and imagine the film it should have been."
"Feb 17, 2020",positive,loved the storyline.  very suspenseful.  great visual affects.
"Feb 16, 2020",negative,Worst star wars movie I ever seen.
"Feb 16, 2020",positive,Great special effects 👍
"Feb 16, 2020",negative,Didnt like it it didnt seem like an actual movie as most of the time it was arrogant rey just running off
"Feb 16, 2020",positive,"I felt like somethings were missing out of this ending like one major thing the close of the love story for anyone everyone had a well maybe love story just to end it as it was i mean its star wars great film but as far as this movie goes it wasn't finished but i can tell they were like lets just end the saga and move on to the next which was a horrible way to go out reminds me of the horrid GOT ending like what is going on is the movie business in need of fresh new ideas and blood or are they just tired themselves of doing the same kind of movie. Like someone the other day mention to me why we can't have a sith movie which it would be assume to see the full power of the dark side and it would have to be rated R to be great. But honestly i just want to see more of what the force can do i always feel as if i never really get to see the full power of the force and the level of skills i can truly do i mean mind control, the push, lifting fighter jets or stopping them all expected. Give me something to wow me as the lighting coming from rey's hands did. Where is the power?"
"Feb 16, 2020",positive,Cherry on top of the pie what a way to end this saga
"Feb 16, 2020",positive,Saw it twice. Loved it both times. If I stop and actually think about it I start hating it. But it was just nice to see the main characters actually go on a clone wars/rebel style adventure.
"Feb 16, 2020",negative,Basically took a shit on Star Wars
"Feb 16, 2020",positive,It was anti climatic for a movie that was supposed to tie up the entire Star Wars saga
"Feb 16, 2020",positive,Amazing! Perfect end story.
"Feb 16, 2020",positive,"I really loved how this completed the saga for now! It was truly brought a fitting end to the Sith, I am sure for now!  Look forward to seeing how Disney and Lucas films takes the saga!"
"Feb 16, 2020",positive,Entertaining but not as good as the originals.
"Feb 16, 2020",positive,a must see for a Star Wars fan.
"Feb 16, 2020",negative,Absolute Trash movie.
"Feb 16, 2020",positive,"Maybe the appearance of the Emperor may be strange but, the movie accomplishes to give a great story and moments to finish with a gold-belt the Skywalker Saga."
"Feb 16, 2020",negative,Very predictable. I hope it’s the last one.
"Feb 16, 2020",positive,"With an excellent direction by J. J. Abrams, a formidable script by Chris Terrio and Abrams, a great story by Derek Connolly, Colin Trevorrow, Abrams and Terrio, a more frantic pacing, stunning and beautiful visual effects, which in my opinion, are the best of the entire franchise, exciting action scenes, a wonderful and unforgettable soundtrack by John Williams, a stupendous sound edition by Matthew Wood and David Acord and exceptional performances by Carrie Fisher (rest in peace, our princess), Mark Hamill, Adam Driver, Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, Anthony Daniels, Naomi Ackie, Domhnall Gleeson, Richard E. Grant, Lupita Nyong'o, Keri Russell, Joonas Suotamo, Kelly Marie Tran, Ian McDiarmid and Billy Dee Williams, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker manages to be exciting, memorable, epic and a more than satisfactory conclusion for the Skywalker Saga"
"Feb 16, 2020",negative,Worst closing of an already rotten trilogy i have ever seen. Childhood ruined.
"Feb 16, 2020",positive,A mí me gustó pudranse
"Feb 16, 2020",negative,Movie was a huge let down! The action scenes took forever and Ben died! It could’ve been better.
"Feb 16, 2020",negative,"They killed the original characters and delivered weak, ridiculous and instantaneous new ones.
The agenda on the new trilogy screw with it.
 I think that would be better with the triumph of the emperor at the end.
This is not a Star Wars film, and for me, the end of the trilogy was at Return of the Jedi."
"Feb 16, 2020",negative,2 stars only by the grace of Adam Driver's acting. A dumpster fire of retconning.
"Feb 16, 2020",positive,The movie is spectacular!!
"Feb 16, 2020",negative,"A disappointing ending to the skywalker saga. The writing is horrendous, scattered, illogical and all over the place. Still, there are incredible scenes backed with great performances, state of the art vfx and John William's masterful score."
"Feb 16, 2020",positive,It has everything that was missing from the previous episode. Deus Ex Machina all the time. Done quickly and without thinking
"Feb 16, 2020",positive,probably the best one
"Feb 16, 2020",negative,"A patchwork of a movie, with plot-twists able to embarass the cheesiest animes."
"Feb 16, 2020",negative,"I feel like Disney spent a lot of money to spam high user reviews for this film. It had great special effects with a garbage story that made no sense in terms of the larger established saga; and the best thing I have herd said about it is that it poorly attempted to undo the damage the previous film did.

I personalty saw this film as 'at best' creating stories for new characters for a future story while abandoning the lost cause."
"Feb 16, 2020",positive,"I loved the ending, it was sad knowing that Ben aka Kylo ren dies 😭"
"Feb 16, 2020",positive,"It's cringey, it makes little sense in the wider canon, and it makes me question the point of the sequel trilogy. But it's also fan service and emotional, and sometimes that's all cinema needs to do."
"Feb 16, 2020",positive,I really enjoyed it! They did a nice job cleaning up the mess made in The Last Jedi. They kind of went back to the basics of what made Star Wars such a popular movie franchise in the first place.
"Feb 16, 2020",positive,"I waited a while to see this one because the last few have been one disappointment another. Yet, I was pleasantly surprised how good this one was. It didn't feel heavy handed it was finally given a light touch. Loved the little twist and especially loved the conclusion."
"Feb 16, 2020",negative,All I gotta say is that there's never going to be a star wars like the first nor the second... 
"Feb 16, 2020",negative,"So disappointing but to their credit, they tried to give fans eveything they were missing from the last two movies. However, it was too little, too late. One movies is not enough to undo the damage done by the two previous star wars movies. Plus, all of the interesting scenes are given away by the teasers and trailers."
"Feb 16, 2020",neutral,"Ugh. Just a jumbled mess of scenes. Some were good, some were bad."
"Feb 16, 2020",positive,loved it ...kept me on the edge of my seat the whole movie...kept me wanting more. didn't feel like 2 1/2 hours long
"Feb 16, 2020",positive,"I mean, yes, I've watched all of the Star Wars movies, yes, even the bad ones. I thoroughly enjoyed this installment. As always it left off with an opening to continue the storyline, the CGI pieces were phenomenal."
"Feb 16, 2020",positive,Great fight scenes humor very entertaining!! Liked it .
"Feb 16, 2020",positive,WAY better than The Last Jedi but still has many flaws
"Feb 16, 2020",neutral,"A obra que quebra as suas experiências, entre as emoções e o senso critico."
"Feb 16, 2020",positive,Great dialogue and very classical. Was just looking for more special effect and lightsaber usage.
"Feb 16, 2020",positive,"I felt this film wrapped up the trilogy very nicely while leaving doors open for additional stories, as well as showing many callbacks to the original films."
"Feb 16, 2020",positive,"Overall I enjoyed the movie. There were moments when I feel it lagged and got boring, but only a few. I really liked how they tied in the previous movies by answering the loose ends."
"Feb 16, 2020",positive,J.J. Abrams did a masterful job in tying the Star Wars saga.  This was our 2nd time viewing Star Wars and we picked up nuances that we didn't notice the first time.  We thoroughly enjoyed the movie!!!
"Feb 16, 2020",positive,a powerful movie that wrapped up mostly a satisfying experience. Only sad that this had to be the end
"Feb 16, 2020",positive,Absolutely loved it!!! The twist was awesome!!!
"Feb 16, 2020",positive,"It was a good movie, had its flaws but you should definitely see it."
"Feb 16, 2020",positive,Really good movie with a lot of themes being completed.
"Feb 15, 2020",neutral,it's a good movie just not my cup of tea. not very much action!!!!
"Feb 15, 2020",negative,"Not worth the money. Words can't express my disappointment at this mcguffin fetch-quest excuse of a movie. If I get into plotholes, world breaking question marks and lack of character development I'll be here all day. Wish I could give a minus score."
"Feb 15, 2020",positive,"Excellent movie. Excellent special effects and as always, it delivers. I really enjoyed the little extra that was put in this film on Chewbacca. Would not have expected anything less from the STAR WARS franchise."
"Feb 15, 2020",neutral,"While being a fun movie that was enjoyable to sit through as a fan, the disconnect from the previous films and dedication more to please the fans than to tell a good story hurts it upon rewatches"
"Feb 15, 2020",positive,"A perfect ending to the amazing series. The treatment of the Princess Leia character was perfect and emotionally touching. It has everything that makes a movie great plot twist, amazing special effects, and character defining moments."
"Feb 15, 2020",positive,It was a great continuation of the Star Wars story. I especially loved the ending ( no spoilers here).
"Feb 15, 2020",negative,"Any excitement and promise of getting to know the fantastic new batch of characters introduced in The Force Awakens, and then left to find their OWN meaning in The Last Jedi was erased in this movie.  This trilogy started with a bang, had a wonderful twist of a second act, but finished with nonsensical fanservice from a loud minority of 'fans.'"
"Feb 15, 2020",positive,"Ive watched Star Wars since it came out 42years ago. Action packed, special effects, suspense, and love. It was great"
"Feb 15, 2020",positive,Eh a little over the place but still entertaining.  May piss you off if you are a diehard fan of the franchise.
"Feb 15, 2020",negative,The character upgrade is not happened and the story is croweded and bad.
"Feb 15, 2020",negative,"The worst one out of all of them, i dont know how they did it."
"Feb 15, 2020",positive,a little disjointed but answered a lot of questions
"Feb 15, 2020",negative,"Rise of Skywalker is a movie that tries to please everyone, while not spending the time to earn its heartfelt moments. An over focus on fan demands rather than a cohesive story structure and narrative."
"Feb 15, 2020",positive,Well done. In typical Star Wars fashion of course. Nice wrap up of the characters and story line.
"Feb 15, 2020",neutral,"Not the best, but it was good"
"Feb 15, 2020",positive,Had a good plot and was easily the best of the three new Star Wars episodes! I like where they took each of the characters stories and how they grew each character.
"Feb 15, 2020",positive,I thought it was a great movie with familiar themes. However it’s Star Wars and I wasn’t disappointed. The ending could have been a bit more conclusive but I thought the movie was very grasping.
"Feb 15, 2020",neutral,I almost feel bad for J.J. knowing what Riann Johnson left him to work with. Almost. This movie doesnt know what it wants to be. Too much humor in first act. Just over the top with one-liners. I did enjoy the retcons that were thrown in. Probably the best parts of the movie.  Also everything is just thrown at the screen and the movie is what's left that stuck. Was hoping for a better ending that was 40 years in the making. Thanks Riann Johnson
"Feb 15, 2020",positive,Love love love. People will disagree but be thankful we get more Star Wars. It may not be the story I wanted but it was someone’s story. So I’m glad it was made. Star Wars fans stop being so cranky and enjoy the sagas.
"Feb 15, 2020",positive,"It was great! Though Palpatine's return didn't make sense and the plot was a bit rushed, this movie definitely ended the saga on a much higher note despite its ups and downs."
"Feb 15, 2020",positive,"Non stop action, fantastic cinematography, and good story line. Loved it!"
"Feb 15, 2020",positive,A touching and beautiful ending to a epic story.
"Feb 15, 2020",positive,"Good way to end the series...if, in fact, it has ended!!"
"Feb 15, 2020",positive,Have been a Star Wars fan from day one. Episode IX does not disappoint. Great conclusion to an epic saga that started in 1977. Must see on the big screen.
"Feb 15, 2020",positive,what a way to end the Star Wars story. loved it.
"Feb 15, 2020",negative,"An awful movie that has a senseless plot that neither makes sense within the premises it sets out nor in connection with the other Star Wars movie in the new trilogy, let alone the rest of the series. It's a complete garble - great special effects, and in some ways a more interesting film that the other two of the new trilogy, but still terrible and nonsensical. The Star Wars Legends stories are the real Star Wars."
"Feb 15, 2020",positive,was ok. I'm past the childlike enamoration with the SW franchise but this was ok.
"Feb 15, 2020",positive,They did the best with what they had.
"Feb 14, 2020",positive,"Absolutely loved the movie, made up for the disasters of the last Jedi"
"Feb 14, 2020",positive,It’s exactly what you’d expect in a Star Wars movie
"Feb 14, 2020",positive,"A definite must see for Star Wars fans.  A nice wrap up of characters and plots as well as having potential for spinoffs.

Well Done Disney."
"Feb 14, 2020",positive,I love star wars and I think lots of critics are too hard on this franchise. It can also be said that the fans as a whole are too hard on these movies. It is hard to please everyone but I did love this movie.
"Feb 14, 2020",positive,Nice wrap up to the modern trilogy
"Feb 14, 2020",positive,"Good story! Great characters and adventure. The theme of THIS Star Wars made this a favorite film-  the redemption and act of goodness that changed K Ren from evil to choosing good, due to goodness & kindness demonstrated by Rae"
"Feb 14, 2020",positive,"I liked it. Obviously, the death of Carrie Fischer caused them to have to make changes but I found it entertaining, despite reviews I’d heard."
"Feb 14, 2020",positive,Great action Good story overall. Well acted and well directed. Would have been 5 stars except there were some pretty glaring missteps with the writing.
"Feb 14, 2020",positive,"THE BEST STAR WARS MOVIE EVER!!

Star Wars TROS is amazing! From the Cinematography to the adventure that awaits!! Its everything you want from a Star Wars Film. That is why in my opinion it is the BEST Star Wars Film!!

SPOILERS:

The film gets straight to the action with a crawl like no other. It pans down to Mustafar where we see KYLO REN slaughtering those in his way to get the Sith Wayfinder. It then takes him to Exegol and he meets EMPEROR PALPATINE, and the entire scene is spine-tingling!! Also, he doesn't explain how he survived which creates suspence.... Later on REY is trying to pull a transport and she erupts force lightning from her hand and she thinks she had killed CHEWBACCA. Eventualy though, we find out hes alive. C-3PO has his memory wiped which was a sad moment, but hope goes on when R2 restores his memory later on in the film. Also in the middle of the film, we find out Reys true lineage. She is THE GRANDDAUGHTER OF PALPATINE!!! She finds her way to the EMPERORS wayfinder on the remains of the SECOND DEATH STAR and faces her greatest fear... herself. She then fights Kylo as well. LEIA than speaks to Kylo through the FORCE and DIES. A vision of HAN SOLO then fully redeems BEN SOLO. Rey goes to Ach-to and LUKE SKYWALKER tells her of training his sister (by a flashback) and persuades rey to continue fighting. The Final Battle is incredible......... Ben joins Rey as she fights the EMPEROR! Palpatine then takes the life force of the 2 and finds out that they are a DIAD in the force. Then he chucks Ben in a pit and uses FORCE STORM!!!!!!! That was the BEST BIT!!! Then Rey hears the voices of the Jedi of the past..... beautiful. She Rises and proclaims ""AND I AM ALL THE JEDI!!!"" and with the strength of all the Jedi, defeats Palpatine once and for all. The last part of the film returns to Tatooine (at the home of Lukes uncle & aunt) and we see Rey buries Luke and leia's lightsaber and shows us her new one. Then a traveller walks past and asks who she is. Rey looks at Luke and Leias force ghosts in the distance and says,""Rey ............. Rey Skywalker..."" And the film ends with her looking at the twin suns......this was when I cried so much, so fitting, she was born of evil but she was not evil, she saw Luke and Leia as the parents she never had!

This film is mind-blowing! I 100% recommend it!"
"Feb 14, 2020",positive,Not a Star Wars fan but I was entertained by this movie. It is a worth a watch on the big screen with a good sound system
"Feb 14, 2020",positive,I would say it was good. Worth watching one time.
"Feb 14, 2020",positive,The perfect ending to my favorite saga
"Feb 14, 2020",positive,"Great action, humor and story telling!"
"Feb 14, 2020",positive,It was pretty good considering what The Last Jedi gave us...
"Feb 14, 2020",negative,"Ruined Star Wars; re: Anakin's arc and the extinction of the Skywalkers, Solos, and Amidalas while Palpatine lives on in Rey after ludicrously coming back from the dead. Such a mess and disaster of a movie. Literally made me want to die. Ben Solo was amazing however."
"Feb 14, 2020",negative,It was as if someone took all of the Star Wars movies of the past added some Harry Potter and stuck them in a blender and out spewed this film.  Extremely dissatisfying to watch.
"Feb 14, 2020",negative,"Much more enjoyable than episode VIII, but truly a disjointed movie. The lightning scenes were way too jarring, the plot buildup to how Rey is basically the avatar of the Star Wars universe without training is lame and poor writing. I was incredibly disappointed in the pacing of this movie and will not be watching it again for a long time"
"Feb 14, 2020",positive,Better than the last one but still predictable and not a fan of how far these films now differ from the old ones. Disney is just trying to churn them out and make a lot of money. 
"Feb 14, 2020",positive,"Enjoyed it, sorry to see them come to an end. Have always been a fan! Makes me want to binge watch all again!"
"Feb 14, 2020",neutral,"The cgi and graphic are cool, but not a good story, repeating plots"
"Feb 14, 2020",negative,Please no more of this crap worst acting ever
"Feb 14, 2020",neutral,"Just a bad movie.This movie tries to put 2 movies into 1 because it tries to make up for the mistakes in TLJ. The second act has some good moments(only some), but the first and third act is a joke. This entire plot line makes no sense."
"Feb 14, 2020",positive,Great movie lots of great actors! Killer scenes. Great effects!
"Feb 14, 2020",negative,I can't believe I am saying this but....it was even worse than TLJ. How the hell is that even possible? I know Ruin Johnson left  Jar Jar nothing to work with but wow. Just wow.
"Feb 14, 2020",positive,"it was good to see JJ Abrahms back at the helm, for a Star Wars movie it was a like a B+ , I wasnt blown away but i really enjoyed it. It was worth seeing in theaters"
"Feb 14, 2020",positive,"If there was a how to make a Star Wars movie video, this movie followed it to tee. It had all the right feels in all the right places."
"Feb 14, 2020",positive,This has been long overdue
"Feb 13, 2020",negative,Generic cash grab leading to a boring plot..... Not star wars
"Feb 13, 2020",positive,"It was an amazing end to an amazing series! I just love when Good triumphs over evil!
Very fond memories since 1977!
Thank you George Lucas!"
"Feb 13, 2020",negative,"The half a star rating may be a bit biased from my end due to the love I hold for this franchise. If you are to look at the movie as a stand alone entity it's still likely to be a 2 star experience at most. The Last Jedi while having it's flaws was a fresh look on the Star Wars story, this movie takes a u-turn on every decision made in the previous movie and crashes to a startling halt while trying to tie this whole mess of a movie together."
"Feb 13, 2020",positive,It was great. It was dark it was exciting and hopeful
"Feb 13, 2020",negative,"for the amazing cast they had ....... it's unfortunate how flawed and rotten it was I feel bad for those that followed star wars from the beginning, Id be pissed too if a series I loved was ruined by 2 different directors and shipping fans. the only good thing is the actors in this film become successful and do projects that deserve their talents"
"Feb 13, 2020",negative,"Pretty corny flick, even for a Star Wars film."
"Feb 13, 2020",positive,"As a major Star Wars fan, I was happy to see similarities with episode VI. I would recommend this movie to people who didn't enjoy the the previous two episodes like me. At the beginning the plot was slow and a little rocky, but the second half reminded me of why I started watching the saga in the first place."
"Feb 13, 2020",negative,It was hot nostalgic garbage. Waste of time and money. The plot sucked. Couldn't even think of a new villain so decided to bring back Palpatine
"Feb 13, 2020",positive,"Was slightly disappointed in all characters story lines.  I’ve watched ALL the Star Wars movies multiple times and can say the other movies were phenomenal!  I’m not a a scream writer, I can honestly say I would’ve liked to see the stories of all the characters.....end differently"
"Feb 13, 2020",negative,"The only thing that is not a disaster here is the performance of adam driver. The script lacking imagination, the characters that appear meaningless and an address that does nothing but highlight the flaws in all other aspects. In the end, what could have been simple fanservice it became a disaster, painful to see."
"Feb 13, 2020",positive,It was the best out of the more recent movies. There was closer. I felt it was rushed. This could have been a mind blowing movie. As it is. It's was good to see atleast once.
"Feb 13, 2020",negative,Hopefully Disney will put this franchise to rest.
"Feb 13, 2020",positive,Dragged on in some areas but in general it was good
"Feb 13, 2020",positive,"Listen, it's not the original trilogy, but it's still a good popcorn movie and an acceptable wrap-up to the Skywalker saga. Manage expectations."
"Feb 13, 2020",positive,"If you just love StarWars movies because they are about StarWars the you will love this one too. I have seen it 5x so far.  I think it's great.  Sure there are plot holes, everything has that.  But it is a great story."
"Feb 13, 2020",positive,I liked the story line and the outcome of the movie. The acting was amazing and the twists in the story where unexpected and tantalizing. In short the suspense was there and the emotions where real and touched me deeply.
"Feb 13, 2020",positive,Lots of action easy to follow stayed true to the series.
"Feb 13, 2020",negative,Is this the worst Star wars movie ever? Maybe but it has strong competition with The Last Jedi. Fans hate this but Disney doesn't care.
"Feb 13, 2020",positive,The return to Tatuione was a fitting ending but I was disappointed with the final fate of Ben Solo
"Feb 13, 2020",positive,Great special effects obviously. A nice twist of finding out who she really is( no spoiler alert) and bad guys switching sides was a surprise too. Hopefully there is one more in the making?
"Feb 13, 2020",positive,"wow, this was so amazing....
the acting was perfect. there was the right amount of story and the right amount of action this truly feels like the end of the skywalker saga I loved the surprises I loved every second of this film. the score was beautiful the cinematography was good in most parts, every second I was on the edge of my seat the shocks and surprises really did surprises me, it was truly an amazing adventure thank you to all the people involved in these films and may the force be with you."
"Feb 13, 2020",positive,"The last movie of the Skywalker Saga was absolutely a perfect ending to the franchise and it was absolutely amazing. The visual effects, original score and sound editing was excellent. It’s definitely a must see "
"Feb 13, 2020",positive,Really great end to an incredible franchise. Don’t listen to the negative reviews!
"Feb 13, 2020",negative,Disney has completey destroy Star Wars . This movie is  rushed mess! The whole trilogy was a mess with no clear direction.
"Feb 13, 2020",positive,This movie made me just about cry every time...  It is amazing...  It ties up the whole saga - I loved it!!!!!!
"Feb 13, 2020",positive,"Not the way I would have ended this epic tale, but the movie itself was fine. Fans should definitely watch, but moreso because its a Star Wars movie and not because its a masterpiece of film."
"Feb 13, 2020",negative,"Wow, JJ Abrams, what a disappointment. Totally disrespected the Star Wars tradition, fans and George Lucas. This movie was worst then Episode I! I mean, no mystery what so ever toward the plot. You couldn't spend more on how the idea of the Emperor came to be a zombie? WTF!! That's what that was, Zombie Emperor Palpatine. Next time copy a good story, not one already done!! Anyways, just wanted to tell Powell's don't waste your time with this one. Wait till Boba Fett film is made!! Hence Kevin Smith as Director"
"Feb 13, 2020",positive,"Best movie up there with Force Awakens , don’t listen to the haters 🤘🏻, you’ll love this movie!"
"Feb 13, 2020",positive,"A great end to the new trilogy,  full of fun action and nostalgia!"
"Feb 13, 2020",positive,"The plot was not the best. Completely unrealistic that Palpatine survived not 1 but 2 explosions. But the fam service throughout the film 100% made that almost obsolete. Hearing Anakin, Obi Wan, Ahsoka, all the Jedi at the end was incredible and gave me a nice good bye to the series I call my entire childhood."
"Feb 13, 2020",positive,"The acting was great, no dull moments, lots of intense action"
"Feb 13, 2020",positive,I liked the commradery of the characters and how it pointed at we are not alone even though the advesary wants to make us feel alone. I liked that Kiloren changed and began to help the good side. And liked the way it showed that those who passed on are still with us.
"Feb 13, 2020",positive,"A good end, but boy am I going to miss Star Wars!"
"Feb 13, 2020",negative,"Rushed, messy, and illogical. The movie is a spectacle to behold, partly because of the consistently great acting paired with consistently incredibly scoring and backdrops, but mostly because it is painfully obvious just how little either writer understood about what anything in the Skywalker Saga meant to the characters in the story or the audience watching it."
"Feb 13, 2020",positive,Great plot and storyline loved the way all of my favorite plot lines converged.
"Feb 13, 2020",negative,"Very poorly written. Without being biased, the writing and plot are all over the place and is attempting to capture all the nostalgia of the original trilogy in a single film, and the last-minute change and concept of Palpatine suddenly returning is ridiculous, especially in the first 5 minutes of the film's runtime."
"Feb 13, 2020",positive,"I would have given this more of a 4.5 maybe? This is a good movie, although slightly predictable. I felt like some things were left open vs. closing it all up. But, all in all, the movie was enjoyable. Its definitely worthwhile to watch."
"Feb 13, 2020",positive,"A little slow in parts., overall a good ending to the Star Wars series."
"Feb 13, 2020",positive,"Sound, visual effects, story line, tied all the episodes together!!"
"Feb 12, 2020",positive,"What it lacks in story, pacing and character, it makes up for with a great score, amazing visuals, and superb acting from all involved. And of course, Ian Mcdirmid is still killing it as the evil emperor"
"Feb 12, 2020",positive,"I thought the movie was great. I only wish they gave us one movie with Rey and Kylo Ren (Ben Solo) to give us a good show of their powers combined. The ending, however, was fitting enough. I love the series and I am looking forward to what comes next."
"Feb 12, 2020",positive,Loved it! Great ending to the Skywalker Saga.
"Feb 12, 2020",positive,I actually like the apology. They did a good job trying to give us back Star Wars.
"Feb 12, 2020",positive,This movie isn't entirely awful. Though it does have an okay ending to the saga the overall film is enjoyable. But the characters weren't well used and I didn't like them as much. Also some of the plot points and acting wasn't great and I feel this movie should have took more time to get the story and everything right as it did not. Rating B-
"Feb 12, 2020",negative,"How to take the best thing of the series (Kylo Ren character development) and throw it away. Not to mention everything else, like the Emperor implausible survival and shitty end."
"Feb 12, 2020",neutral,"The movie had a lot of moments I felt were supposed to be heartfelt but just came off as either unintentionally funny or pandering. It certainly wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either."
"Feb 12, 2020",negative,disney.... do better.... dont write your movies at the shareholder meeting.... please...
"Feb 12, 2020",positive,Great movie! I loved all the scenes with Kylo and Ray!
"Feb 12, 2020",negative,"Disappointing. What could have been a great conclusion to the franchise ended up being a trying to save what's left. Pacing was wayyy too fast, and dialogue and story decisions were laugh out load stupid. Only positive was Ben Solo's/Kylo Ren story arc coming to a good ending but that doesn't save the film. Hopefully it'll be a Long time ago in a galaxy far far away the next time a Star Wars film comes to theatre."
"Feb 12, 2020",positive,great finish. except i wanted to see rae and ren together
"Feb 12, 2020",positive,"Enjoyed the storyline and action. Was a little slow at times and seemed too long because of that, but left you wanting for the series to continue."
"Feb 12, 2020",negative,Terrible. Another franchise I used to love has been butchered.
"Feb 12, 2020",negative,"Worst star wars film ever, it's a rushed mess that relies on nostalgia and fan service to make people happy without having to think of anything original, and it messes up the 8 films before it doing so."
"Feb 12, 2020",positive,The best star war movie ever
"Feb 12, 2020",positive,"Good movie, I hated that kiss scene"
"Feb 12, 2020",positive,Didn’t like that Rae keep on taking off without her team / back up. !
"Feb 12, 2020",positive,"Not original or deep but thats not what star wars flicks are for. While the writing was painful and clichéd, the cinematography, action, flow of the story, as well as weapon/costume/environment designs were both compelling and inspiring. Adam Driver is an awesome sith lord."
"Feb 12, 2020",positive,"It bulges with fan service, but I really enjoyed it"
"Feb 12, 2020",positive,Its Star Wars! Whats not to like
"Feb 12, 2020",positive,"Exciting, with constant action and we finally learned Reys story. So glad the Force won, as we all knew it would, but wish we had been able to learn who Rey ended up with-so not entirely happy with the ending. Otherwise, great movie!"
"Feb 12, 2020",positive,Ties everything up and puts a bow on it. Great finale to the saga. Fun
"Feb 12, 2020",positive,Very good story line to tie up the last of the Star Wars Skywalker's
"Feb 12, 2020",positive,"Si eres fanatico disfrutas el momento, no la pelicula"
"Feb 12, 2020",positive,It was not up to Star Wars level.
"Feb 12, 2020",positive,It all comes to a satisfying end after the garbage dump that was The Last Jedi
"Feb 12, 2020",positive,Well made movie but the right decision to finish it off. The story is played out.
"Feb 12, 2020",negative,"The visuals are good, as I'd expect from a Star Wars movie. 

But the story and how they finish it is god-awful and an insult to this franchise!!!"
"Feb 12, 2020",positive,Best one of the new trilogy. Of course not perfect but very entertaining.
"Feb 12, 2020",negative,This was an actual slap in the face to anyone who cares about Star Wars. Trash storyline. It was all a load of BS fan service with no substance
"Feb 12, 2020",positive,Fun characters to root for but a very messy plot which has become the norm for this franchise.
"Feb 11, 2020",positive,Fabulous finish to a saga I enjoy!
"Feb 11, 2020",positive,I cried when Ren said her last name at the end. All pieces and folks in good place
"Feb 11, 2020",negative,"it was bad, very bad. To bad it's so bad."
"Feb 11, 2020",positive,I saw this movie in 4D and it was absolutely breathtaking. The action was undeniably better than the previous instalments. The character development has come a long way. I am looking forward to the future of this new franchise! 
"Feb 11, 2020",negative,That's not how the force works...
"Feb 11, 2020",positive,"The best of the skywalker trilogy, Adam driver's smile at the end was worth aiting for!"
"Feb 11, 2020",positive,A fastpaced movie that takes no time to breathe. It's non-stop and proves to be its downfall. There's definitely a great movie there but there are too many missteps that unfortunately stop that from happening. The return of Palpatine creates new issues and there are certain scenes that are very familiar from another Disney-owned franchise that ended a saga recently.
"Feb 11, 2020",positive,Nice action sequences. Alot of fan service. A couple items are alittle too blown up to be believable even in the star wars universe.
"Feb 11, 2020",positive,I loved the plot twist of Rey being emperor palatine granddaughter and Ben turning back to the Jedi
"Feb 11, 2020",negative,Waste of time.......
"Feb 11, 2020",positive,"It should have been 2 parts to this movie, I honestly felt Gypt out of the Darkside version of the whole movie. we had bits and pieces and whatever was that Warp jump moment between worlds they never ever talked about. but the story was pretty good and i wish the ending wasnt the ending. but if your a STARWARS fan just get this into your system and get it over with. your childhood will be questioned about what you just seen. 
HANJEDISOLO"
"Feb 11, 2020",positive,Loved all the twists in the story but it made it a long movie. I will buy it on blueray.
"Feb 11, 2020",positive,"Amazing film.  Best of the latest Trilogy.  Not sure why the vitriol, people need to sit back and enjoy more!"
"Feb 11, 2020",negative,"I don't have the words to accurately describe just how awful this movie was.  Story decisions made no sense whatsoever.  Worst Star Wars movie I've ever seen and YES, I'm including the prequels in that."
"Feb 11, 2020",positive,"A film that is a strong ending to the saga. I see why other fans and critics may not enjoy it, but it is a fun film with emotion and action putting a bow on the saga"
"Feb 11, 2020",negative,This movie is more for teens and youngsters.
"Feb 11, 2020",negative,They did something unforgivable with one of the most beloved characters of the whole franchise.
"Feb 11, 2020",positive,"I don't know why people hate it. It was a good Star Wars movie, obviously is not the Empire Stikes Back, but it was pretty good."
"Feb 11, 2020",positive,"Best movie ever of 2019. Don't listen to the critics on this one. And the perfect conclusion to any franchise, just like Toy Story 4"
"Feb 11, 2020",positive,"This was easily the best and most exciting movie in the new trilogy. However, too many mistakes and disappointments from the second installment (The Last Jedi) killed the momentum of the series. I am a life long Star Wars fan. I am glad that Dave Filoni is helming the Mandolorian with John Favreau, you can immediately see the difference. Back to this movie, the action and visuals are top notch. The story mostly sticks to gaining momentum toward the conclusion. There are a few missteps, but overall it is enjoyable and entertaining. Some folks will sit and stew with resentments for the direction and choices made and that will prevent their enjoyment. If you can look past all of that, it's worth watching. My advice is if you are angry, focus on another aspect of the universe. Just leave this one alone."
"Feb 11, 2020",positive,"The first 30minutes+ are a pretty bad experience to watch. The pace is way too fast, events and dialogues are brushed over, characters and relationships feel shallow.
It does improve when the pace slows down, but overall the closing of this trilogy is a puzzle of strange choices.
It would have been best to stick with 1 director throughout the three films, and not change the scripts at the last minute.

The best Star Wars film Disney has made so far is Rogue One, undeniably."
"Feb 11, 2020",positive,Ending does not exactly line up with the true story but was still an awesome movie!!! Hope there can be some cool spin offs.
"Feb 11, 2020",positive,Great movie! We loved it!!
"Feb 11, 2020",positive,.....................noice
"Feb 11, 2020",negative,"This was the end of a 42 year saga and would kill the franchise for me if it wasnt for the Mandalorian..
The film Starts out well then the whole thing turns into a disjointed mess.
Seriously dubious plot fiascos one after another, disjointed storyline.
To be honest it looked like the director didnt know where to go or how to end it.
Episode 4 (A new hope) had a story, a start, middle and end the Empire strikes back although darker had the same setting up Return of the jedi. boom a trilogy.
Episode 1,2 and 3 the prequels set up the in depth story, regardless wether you liked JarJar..
Then came episode 7 hmm ok  long awaited saga continues....with basically a remake of episode 4 done badly but on a bigger budget, better special effects.
But this Turd  the saga ending story left me feeling deflated.
I went to a premier and at midnight we sat ant watched it, two hours i could have spent in bed..  seriously deflated movie ending. people were asking if they could get their money back...one bloke went to clap and the people on either side of him asked him if he was out of medication.....
If JJ Abrams thinks this is good, I for one dont wat to see any more of his films, He broke Star Trek and upset the fanBase Now hes killed StarWars for so many people.
What a turd....Save your money if you want to see it itll be on freeveiw soon..."
"Feb 11, 2020",negative,Unbelievably terrible ...
"Feb 11, 2020",positive,This movie kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time and as a star wars fan it did not disappoint!
"Feb 11, 2020",positive,"Loved it. A great finale to a long-running saga. Is it perfect? Of course not, but it's a fun swashbuckling adventure which is what Star Wars is all about at its core. Also, my 6-year old was completely transfixed the whole time and has been playing lightsabers at home for days afterward. That's what Star Wars is all about."
"Feb 11, 2020",positive,Would give it more stars but it could've been  gayer
"Feb 11, 2020",positive,Solid new age Star Wars saga. Being raised on the originals the last six did not capture the imagination quite as much.
"Feb 11, 2020",positive,"I thought it was the funniest action movie I have seen in a long time. Apparently, the rest of the audience enjoyed the humor as well based on all of the laughter. While it tied all of the past story lines together, it did so in such a mishandled way that it seemed amateurish at best and incompetent at worst."
"Feb 11, 2020",negative,"Some good classic Star Wars moments, but it tried too hard to please all masters with the ending. As a stand-alone movie, probably a 3 star rating, but as the culmination of a solid trilogy, it was really a let down"
"Feb 11, 2020",positive,It was classic Star wars!!!  All the fun elements you expect!!  Fun Good RIDE!!!
"Feb 11, 2020",positive,"Great story (obviously), but also all the actors were exceptional: so believable. Filmed beautifully, and the CGI, bar none! Great movie: allowed me to forget for awhile and just live the story."
"Feb 11, 2020",positive,bring back ben solo!
"Feb 11, 2020",negative,Line Star wars. Hated this lame movie. Nothing interesting or new
"Feb 11, 2020",negative,the worst episode. this movie should not have been made
"Feb 11, 2020",positive,Was there for the first one and JJ Abrams did a great job on this one.
"Feb 11, 2020",positive,One of the best Star Wars movies. A very satisfying end to the Skywalker saga.
"Feb 11, 2020",negative,"Only went because my wife wanted to go.  Rather bland with no plot.  Lots of meaningless action.  If you didn't see the previous couple of bad Star Wars movies, you would not be able to follow who these boring people are.  I have always been a big fan of the original Episodes 4 -6, suffered through Ep. 1 Jar-Jar Crap and Ep. 2 Teenagers in Love.  Episode 3 wasn't too bad as it shows how Darth Vader came to be.  But I am done with the entire series now."
"Feb 11, 2020",negative,"Worst Star Wars ever made. Borderline disrespectful. ""Hey we've used the death star too much so lets just put the death star laser on hundreds of star destroyers and call it good"" Bad. They should be ashamed. Kylo Ren was never an intimidating antagonist. Bad trilogy. Not impressed."
"Feb 11, 2020",positive,"Wrapped things up nicely, the original, beloved references to character, an assumed connection better unfolded...I could have watched a few more hours more!"
"Feb 10, 2020",positive,"A Heartrefreshing End of a legendary saga as piece of my life.
All this defamating critics are of the dark side of the Force 😎"
"Feb 10, 2020",positive,Wow!! Hubby and I are Star Wars junkies and I have to say that this one ranks way high on my list of top Star Wars movies!! Great graphics and story line!
"Feb 10, 2020",positive,"It was fine. If you just enjoy seeing Star Wars movies you'll enjoy it, but if your a die-hard you will most likely find it annoying."
"Feb 10, 2020",positive,Is it a great movie? No. Is it a good Star Wars movie? Yes.
"Feb 10, 2020",positive,The movie was great and all but the end just wish it had a different ending.
"Feb 10, 2020",positive,I loved this movie. It is the best Starwars to date.
"Feb 10, 2020",positive,It was forgettable. 
"Feb 10, 2020",negative,"É o pior filme da história de Star Wars. A única coisa boa desse filme é a despedida da Princesa Leia. Porém temos um Kylo Ren que poderia ser muito melhor aproveitado e depois se torna um Ctrl+C Ctrl+v de Vader. Rey perde tudo de interessante que tem na personagem, principalmente o fato de não ser ninguém. E Palpatine voltar é um crime a trilogia original, é um crime para com os fans.  Finn não tem um desfecho e virá um personagem inútil da nova trilogia, a Rose nem aparece direito e Poe perde todo o seu arco de desenvolvimento e volta a estaca zero. É horrível, e meia estrela é o máximo que pode se dar a este filme."
"Feb 10, 2020",positive,Very entertaining nice to see all the old actors would recommend the movie if youre a Star Wars fan
"Feb 10, 2020",positive,Shut up. I liked it.
"Feb 10, 2020",positive,ending was ok but it could have had a better conclusion. Story line seemed rushed.
"Feb 10, 2020",negative,Boring preposterous @ times. Poor editing poor storyline. Disappointing
"Feb 10, 2020",positive,I liked it but hate to see it is the last one.
"Feb 10, 2020",positive,Loved return of all the original players. The unexpected outcomes were exciting.
"Feb 10, 2020",positive,Predictable plot.But as usual great special FX.
"Feb 10, 2020",positive,Absolutely loved the movie
"Feb 10, 2020",positive,"While it may not break new ground, for a lifelong fan like me who grew up with New Hope, this is a brilliant sunset on a series of movies that have provided a consistent source of entertainment for 40 years. For critics to look too closely at it for its cinematic worthiness is to ignore the nostalgia from which these movies grew and their value as an entertainment medium that goes well beyond box office receipts. 

A little comedy, lots of action, strong characters, not too complicated and easy to watch. I'm no die-hard fan, I haven't been to conventions or read the extended universe books, never even played a home video game, but I do consider Star Wars to be a fond memory from my childhood and one that through Rey's character especially, I have now been able to share with my daughter. 

I think JJ and his team did a great job and can't wait for its release on streaming."
"Feb 10, 2020",negative,"A convoluted story mashed up with endless action sequences.... I really wasn't empathetic towards any character and I really didn't care which side won, just wanted it to be over an hour earlier than it was."
"Feb 10, 2020",negative,terrible movie with many wasted chances.
"Feb 10, 2020",positive,Tear jerker with the death of Princess Leia
"Feb 10, 2020",positive,Very good movie!  Had a good moral ending.
"Feb 10, 2020",positive,special effects were great. the wat they pulled it all together for the final was alright
"Feb 10, 2020",positive,Loved it. Nice ending. Lots of action.
"Feb 10, 2020",positive,Loved this movie. Felt like it corrected a lot of mistakes and unanswered questions from the last Jedi. Was so tense throughout the movie I barely stopped to eat my popcorn. Didn't know what direction the movie was going in was kept interested at all times. Would deffo recommend.
"Feb 10, 2020",negative,Seemed to jump from scene to scene like a series of afterthoughts rather than a coherent story.
"Feb 10, 2020",positive,"Cameo shots, storyline"
"Feb 10, 2020",positive,My family and I enjoyed it.
"Feb 10, 2020",positive,The fight scenes were amazing.
"Feb 10, 2020",positive,The only disappointment was that it should have been made into 2 parts. Can't wait to see it again. The best of the last three😊
"Feb 10, 2020",negative,Rushed pacing doesnt begin to describe this mad dash of a movie that does not begin the finish character archs for anyone who isnt Rey or Kylo. Not to mention reverting everything from the previous movie and giving more seemingly meaningless fan service than any previous JJ movie.
"Feb 10, 2020",positive,Best of the three. The main characters were stronger and more purposeful.  The storylines concluded nicely rather than floating with weak purpose in the first two
"Feb 10, 2020",positive,"Not what I expected, but it raised more questions than answered.  Great action pieces, but the story was a rushed Return of the Jedi.  A must see for Star Wars fans though, but it can wait for video."
"Feb 10, 2020",positive,👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
"Feb 10, 2020",negative,I cannot unsee this movie 
"Feb 10, 2020",positive,It was really awesome
"Feb 10, 2020",positive,Force. Light sabers. Jedi. Bad guys. Space ships. What more do you need?
"Feb 10, 2020",negative,"Okay, so my last review for this gave three and a half stars. Now that I think about it, having rewatched it a few times as well as some other sequel movies, three and a half is four too many.
Episode IX is a disgusting spit in the face of every true Star Wars fan out there - an unimaginative, lazy, disappointing 'Star Wars film' that makes the Clone Wars movie look like a work of art. It has more plotholes than there are grains of sand on (retch) Kijimi, all solely to please a small clique of fans. You know, the maniacs who despise Rose Tico and enjoyed The Force Awakens with reverence, as if it wasn't just one long showcase of bad choreography and angy Solo boi. I mean, I don't like some parts of The Last Jedi, but it was at least creative.
This was not. This was fanservice. That's all there is to it - it's a heaping pile of fanservice.
What I most hate about this is the fact that Rey is a Palpatine. Why? So that you could have an excuse to give EA another Palpatine skin? The whole idea with Rey, which is what gave her so much potential as a character, was that she was the first main character of a trilogy to have no Force-imbuing family ties. This is what Episodes VII AND VIII were saying. She was a nobody, special only in her connection to the Force.
And then suddenly she's the Senate's granddaughter?
You know what would have gotten me to give five stars? Keeping the Trevorrow script. Now that was brilliant and creative, while still being sensible and consistent."
"Feb 10, 2020",positive,Best Star Wars movie yet!
"Feb 10, 2020",positive,Lot of action from the beginning. Fast moving.
"Feb 10, 2020",positive,Adam Driver was by far the best character in the trilogy. It was plot twisting when Rey had force lightning which only meant that she was Palpatine.
"Feb 10, 2020",neutral,"Unoriginal, takes too long to get off the ground, and, apart from the marvelous visuals, sorely disappoints.  This is not the end, either."
"Feb 10, 2020",positive,"+good storyline
+good plot twists
+strong female heroine
+good action"
"Feb 10, 2020",negative,"If you've been a fan of Disney Star Wars up to this point, there's a good chance you'll like this movie. Being someone who grew up on George Lucas's trilogies however, I was disappointed. A lot of obvious plot holes, and even when the surprise twist"" is revealed you'll probably see it coming a mile away. I didn't mind that Abrams borrowed so much from the originals when he made TFA, but at this point instead of appearing as a tribute, it comes off as lazy filmmaking. Better then TLJ, but then again, what isn't?"
"Feb 10, 2020",positive,It was a great movie
"Feb 10, 2020",negative,"If you hated Last Jedi, you WON'T like this. It relies on nostalgia to hide the bad acting and the throw in characters made to sell merchandise."
"Feb 10, 2020",positive,"It's the best of this Trilogy, but it should have been titled The Rise of Palpatine given the ending.  I would have enjoyed this movie much more, if the final confrontation was better, and I really wished they'd have switched the narrative at the ending for the 2 primary characters, in terms of who lived and died.   With it's given title, I'd have preferred Kylo live and be reunited with Leia at the end.  Given reality and Fisher's death, it would have been nice to give one of the original characters a ""happy ending"".  Hopefully Disney will get rid of Kathleen Kennedy and put someone in charge of Star Wars who actually loves it."
"Feb 10, 2020",positive,"While i understand that the typical old-fashioned Anakin Prophecy purist star wars fan probably disliked the movie because Rey and Kylo replaced Anakin in the role of bringing balance to the force. My argument against this is that Anakin had already fulfilled his prophecy fully after Episode 6, as he brought balance to the force (even if just for a short time). The sequel trilogy, in my eyes, is a separate story in which the Anakin prophecy is no longer a necessary part of the story."
"Feb 10, 2020",positive,Having Leah and Luke in the movie
"Feb 10, 2020",positive,It’s Star Wars what is there not to like
"Feb 10, 2020",negative,"A total shame for the Saga , this end the trilogy in the worst way possible and is a total spit on mr Lucas work and to all the Luke and Anakin Fans.  
The Movie itself if it was not part of a bigger picture would be alright but it is a aberation to the original story line of the first six movies .
How did Disney  give a green light to this misery , a comedy movie on this flop would be way deserved ."
"Feb 10, 2020",positive,"It was better than the Last Jedi, but it left to be desired. It is tied with episode 7 for being the second worsed Star Wars movie. It's a good movie, but just not a good Star Wars movie."
"Feb 10, 2020",positive,"It was good, but the ending was a little weird. I have watched it multiple times in theater."
"Feb 10, 2020",positive,It would have as okay . I mean I liked it but it really didn't have the thrill of the last one. You  could see what was coming before it happened.
"Feb 10, 2020",positive,was a serious let down for the final star wars saga film. expected more with the story and the ending and cheesy lovey divey scene could have gone without. total miss.
"Feb 10, 2020",positive,Good to finally have an ending to the story. A bit slow in places.
"Feb 10, 2020",positive,Good action all the way through! Good acting . Enjoyed it!
"Feb 10, 2020",positive,Over all a very good movie just some spots were a little bit corny and predictable.
"Feb 10, 2020",positive,thought it was exciting to watch. really enjoyed it.
"Feb 10, 2020",positive,"it had it moments, but not quite the ending i was expecting."
"Feb 9, 2020",positive,"The film is all that the critics say it is, messy, rushed, nonsensical, etc. But I enjoyed it. I enjoyed the familiarity of Palpatine even though it didn't make sense. I enjoyed that it was fast paced so that it could fit in all the nostalgia it could before drawing a close. I enjoyed the simplicity of the plot so I do not have to overthink the movie. I appreciate the fact that they made this movie for the layman and not the critics. Like all the other episodes, it has its issues but I think it was a fitting ending to a decades old saga and in time perhaps the critics will be kinder to the episode."
"Feb 9, 2020",negative,This was really really bad.
"Feb 9, 2020",positive,Not my favorite Star Wars movie but I still enjoyed it.
"Feb 9, 2020",positive,Had me on the edge of my seat. Fantastic finale!
"Feb 9, 2020",positive,Fitting end to the saga.
"Feb 9, 2020",negative,"Worst Star Wars ever. Disregards any continuity previously established because Lucasfilm was afraid of getting pushback from fans who hated Last Jedi. Terrible jokes, nonsensical plot, barely any continuity with the other films, and in my viewing, the audience groaned at two different scenes towards the end. Would not recommend, especially to diehard fans of the franchise. This is for a casual viewer who's never seen a Star Wars before, and it shows."
"Feb 9, 2020",positive,not nearly as bad as others reviewed it.
"Feb 9, 2020",positive,Great story line with many twist!
"Feb 9, 2020",positive,Finally made sense out of the trilogy and great send off of the characters from original trilogy.
"Feb 9, 2020",positive,"I have many issues with the story line of these last three Star Wars movies but I admit this was pretty epic. Still not thrilled with aspects of the story in this third movie but I have to admit I was absorbed nonetheless. Some people will see it as predictable, others will be shocked, others will scoff but overall, it's true to the SW legacy and satisfying to watch."
"Feb 9, 2020",negative,Undermines all 8 other star wars movies and was clearly written by people who don't actually know anything about Star Wars.
"Feb 9, 2020",positive,A truly fitting end to greatest saga!!
"Feb 9, 2020",negative,Nonsensical. You don't care about the main characters. Seems like the Emperor (thank you Disney for ruining the Vader's sacrifice and the ending of ROTJ) can just come back whenever and without explanation.  And the sudden love interest between Kylo and Rey was pathetic.  Just a reason for the House of Mouse to steal money from fans.  Kathleen Kennedy needs to go.
"Feb 9, 2020",negative,It lacked creativity and the ending was very confusing
"Feb 9, 2020",positive,"Unbelievable critics are so off these days, how in the world does the best of this trilogy get more poorly reviewed? They course correct most of the awfulness that was the Last Jedi, and you can't envy Abrams on the task he had to undergo especially with Disney's short turnaround. Many great moments, messy early plot but easily overlooked if you love the world of Star Wars. Best acting of all of the characters, love having Lando back."
"Feb 9, 2020",negative,"I've been a Star Wars fan for as long as I can remember. I grew up watching not only the original trilogy, but the prequels, and Clone Wars too. Now I'm, well not exactly grown up, but pretty close to it, and have Disney's Star Wars. The Force Awakens was good, The Last Jedi was great, and the Mandalorian is amazing. The Rise of Skywalker was the ninth and final movie in the Skywalker Saga, meant to tie all of the previous movies together in one big finale, and boy did it fail to do that. From the opening scene to literally the end of the movie I sat in my seat with my arms crossed just disappointed in what I was watching. The first act was nearly incoherent, the second was boring and infuriating at times, and the third, though the best part, still lacked much substance. From the Chewie take-out to the random re-appearance of the Emperor to the Rey reveal, I was just totally done with this movie. There were perhaps two or three references to the prequels, and alot of things that just felt packed in at the last second in a poor attempt to satisfy long time fans. Luke's drastic turn from what he was in TLJ to this made absolutely no sense, and the idea that Rey would *SPOILER* fall in love with the guy she stabbed a couple hours ago, and also that Palpatine reproduced with another human being, just completely took me out of the movie. Not to mention the total randomness of Finn's force-sensetivity, Rose's exclusion from the film's entirety, and fact that the 9 year old Anakin Skywalker programmed 3po so that he couldn't speak the ancient language of the sith. Overall, I did not like The Rise of Skywalker, and I would not reccomend watching it. Especially if you are a Star Wars fan."
"Feb 9, 2020",negative,"Forces to introduce new plots without needing it, perfectly they could be taken without having an impact on the plot."
"Feb 9, 2020",positive,"Its Star Wars. Nough said. I like it very much, but I knew I would. I thought the flow of the movie was spot on, and the light saber battles were awesome."
"Feb 9, 2020",neutral,"The energy between Kylo and Rey was strong--for me, the best part of the movie. Seeing Carrie again was poignant--I liked that her death was honored. 
 
The plot required too much suspension of belief to be taken seriously even in the context of a fantasy space opera. The First Order seems at once all powerful and helpless without the Sith Fleet. The viewer is supposed to believe the Sith Fleet is helpless without a navigation signal? That these very sophisticated ships cannot compensate? Or that they are simply waiting in line up formation to be destroyed? That somehow in the time of the final battle sequence a massive fleet made up of individual/independent groups managed to respond and get to the Sith Fleet all at the same time? That's beyond ridiculous and felt like a forced political statement without bothering to be creative about it. The 16 hours before launch felt artificial and a lot things seemed to happen during that time frame.   What kind of atmosphere did Exegol have? How close to the planet where the ships? Doesn't make sense the ships would be too close yet the rebels were charging on horseback on the exterior of a ship with no protection. Why is it that the Republic never seems to play any part? There was a lot of fighting but never enough build up to create tension. I never felt tense. Not once. This was a movie to see once and move on."
"Feb 9, 2020",positive,Wrapped up the series in a satisfying way
"Feb 9, 2020",positive,This movie is perfect. Perfect star wars movie. I also Want to see it again
"Feb 9, 2020",positive,"This is Star wars so I was hoping for some good old fashion light saber fight and battleship blowing up each other. I got what I was hoping for, but the ending was kinda rush in a way. They were still a few loose end and question that didn't get any answer. But for a star wars movie it was pretty decent. I hope they wont make any other..."
"Feb 9, 2020",positive,I enjoyed the movie! But it took 45 year's to finish the story!!!!! Would recommended this one.
"Feb 9, 2020",positive,"Exciting and rewarding conclusion. Will be criticized by some for the usual formulaic and nostalgic aspects but the acting (that evil voice!), action and emotion make it very satisfying."
"Feb 9, 2020",negative,"Tons of fan service, absolutely confusing script and no logic followed: that's The Rise of Skywalker. When you leave a story on the hands of a big corporation, the compromise with the previous events is null. The movie was supposed to be the third part of the story that began with The Force Awakens, although, most of the elements are either too new or too repetitive. No continuation can be found from the state things were in the second movie to the third. It's just people running, things blowing and nice visual effects. In this trilogy, Star Wars became a kids movie more than everything, because if you pay attention to the story and details, you will be quite disappointed, but if you want just to see some action and nice effects, following no logic at all, that's a great movie for you."
"Feb 9, 2020",positive,I liked it! Is this really the last Star Wars movie? How sad! I always enjoy these movies. 
"Feb 9, 2020",negative,worst star wars movie
"Feb 9, 2020",positive,"Sound volume was deafening, boardering on sickening."
"Feb 9, 2020",positive,It answered a lot of questions I had! They did a good job about the death of Leah!
"Feb 9, 2020",negative,"J J tried to fix the mess, but there are so many loose ends and stuff happening that the movie feels like a videogame. They should have left the old ""saga"" alone and created something new."
"Feb 9, 2020",negative,"Only slightly better than the previous film, but oh so boring! I used to love the Star Wars films...but this really was a snooze fest for me. I really felt nothing for any of the characters, and was quite happy when they were getting killed off, except when they brought that one back to life. Ugh. Anyway, Rogue One was better in that regard...I'll wait patiently for the next season of The Mandalorian, that is much better than this drivel was."
"Feb 9, 2020",positive,The story felt rushed. Why do we have to see political statements everywhere now? Star Wars should be just a good and entertaining story. Keep social and political statements out if it!
"Feb 9, 2020",positive,A good movie with an great plotline. There are a few things I liked more in the last movie but hey who's perfect
"Feb 9, 2020",negative,"The Force Awakens brought a fantastical world back in magnificent fashion, The Last Jedi challenged what blockbuster filmmaking can achieve. The Rise of Skywalker is about 2 and a half hours long."
"Feb 9, 2020",positive,"Although I do understand why some people may not enjoy this film so I say this as a person who watched this filming without any expectation, in the sense i hadn't watched the previous movies in a way that I cared of what happened like you do with Marvel?. I enjoyed this movie. Sometimes the story was a bit sloppy but it was good. Sometimes the action scenes were a bit overwhelming but still I would watch it."
"Feb 9, 2020",positive,"Everyone it's in a hurry to end this thing under 2 hours, place the fans, extend nostalgia and correct the path of the other two movies. I liked the movie as one unit, but not so much as whole because we still don't know what they where trying to reach."
"Feb 9, 2020",positive,"Fun and exciting, perfect for the casual Star Wars fan. The group of super fans I watched with had a ton of things to break down and discuss, so if your a die hard you may want to prepare for some deep thinking after you watch!"
"Feb 9, 2020",neutral,Slow paced and boring not a good way to end a good trilogy
"Feb 9, 2020",positive,Great way to end the saga. Loved the classic elements they put in for us long-time Star Wars fans.
"Feb 9, 2020",negative,Worst starwars movie ever don't see it not worth watching!
"Feb 9, 2020",positive,"it was great, the mystery revealed, the dark side vs the light,  shocking all the way to the end... awesome.."
"Feb 9, 2020",positive,"Everything you look for... Action, Suspense, Drama, Humor....Excellent finale to this Saga."
"Feb 9, 2020",positive,"I really enjoyed it. My teenaged daughter and preteen daughter really liked it. Fun, exciting, & humorous."
"Feb 9, 2020",positive,It was a good ending to almost 45 years
"Feb 9, 2020",positive,wow! didn't see it coming.!
"Feb 9, 2020",positive,Sad the run has come to an end.
"Feb 9, 2020",positive,"I'm a romantic.   I wish ( SPOILER)  


 Rae  and Ben could have lived happily ever after."
"Feb 9, 2020",positive,Loved the surprise in the story and also was sad to see one of the characters I grew attach to pass away.
"Feb 9, 2020",positive,It was a beautiful story
"Feb 9, 2020",negative,"Thank god it's actually over. Such a rich and great universe was created, but they're just releasing the same movie over and over. How many times can you blow up a big laser in space? ""Oh wait, I have an idea...why don't we instead have a fleet of big lasers!?!"" And what's with the increasing powers every single film? Save your money and watch the Mandalorian instead. It's way more interesting."
"Feb 9, 2020",positive,"entertaining, but not a great movie"
"Feb 9, 2020",positive,Loved it. An enjoyable movie and it tied up the sequel trilogy nicely.
"Feb 9, 2020",positive,"With what I have read and heard, my expectations were low, but I have to admit it was good, I really enjoyed it, I think they did a good job at repairing the story that last Jedi almost ruined!"
"Feb 9, 2020",neutral,"it was good....predictable, nice story"
"Feb 9, 2020",positive,"It’s was absolutely amazing, end to the trilogy and greatly expresses the meaning of hope"
"Feb 9, 2020",positive,Absolutely love Star Wars! Son and I had a great time at the movies!
"Feb 9, 2020",positive,Highly enjoyable story line and action. We were thoroughly entertained by Star Wars. The Century La Quinta is a great theater to see a movie.
"Feb 9, 2020",positive,Good movie if you're a Star Wars fan and are looking to have the series wrapped up.  The movie was a bit long and lacked any intrigue or mystery.  It was great that the movie included cameos from so many of the original cast.
"Feb 9, 2020",positive,"Completes the saga. The ""Band"" is back together. Loved the tie-ins to the previous episodes. Tied-up all the loose end.."
"Feb 9, 2020",positive,"Great movie, a must see."
"Feb 8, 2020",positive,Excellent ending very emotional and well finished ! Very nostalgic !! Like life itself !
"Feb 8, 2020",positive,Amazing just amazing. Kylo ren carried the whole movie on his solders
"Feb 8, 2020",neutral,Could be MUCH better but it was ok
"Feb 8, 2020",positive,Not bad. Good action. Not entirely predictable. Wait for it to come out on pay per view.
"Feb 8, 2020",negative,I'm not even sure if this was a Star Wars movie... disasterous
"Feb 8, 2020",negative,It's clear there was no vision with Disney in the overall direction of the 3 final movies. This was just a complete waste of my time. They should have stopped at force awakens.
"Feb 8, 2020",positive,"Star Wars: Rise of Skywalker might not be even close to be the series's best work, but it is still a satisfying conclusion to a beloved series"
"Feb 8, 2020",positive,Made me cry a couple of times! Very well done!
"Feb 8, 2020",positive,A well done movie. It easily kept my attention throughout with an interesting storyline.
"Feb 8, 2020",positive,"I would have given it 5 stars but the script toward the end took on more of a Disney animated movie character than a Star Wars character. Overall, I’m glad that I saw it."
"Feb 8, 2020",positive,"My recommendation to see it would be for true Star Wars fans.  It makes an attempt, although arguably a weak one, to bring the series full circle.  If you aren't a fan and are looking for pure entertainment, this may not be for you."
"Feb 8, 2020",positive,"The good:  all the people who were recently alive are in it. Good guys win . Lots of action. If you love all Star Wars, you will love this one, too.
The bad:  it is hard to know or like the characters.  The story doesnt make sense.   How the main character who did not have the power to win has all her power drained from her suddenly has the power to win with no explanation.  How the bad guy becomes a good guy without explanation for this transformation.  The story was poorly designed.
The unclear:   Significance of what was done at the end.  Is this it?   Is this an opening for another episode .  I dont think the writers had a clear plan when they wrote it & it could go either way."
"Feb 8, 2020",positive,"I thought the movie was fantastic. As always, the story line is relevant to many issues in todays society. The directing is on par with the other movies. The cinematography was superb. And I wasnt bored for even a second. The pacing was perfect."
"Feb 8, 2020",positive,"A nostalgia filled movie with a lack of direction and a convoluted plot but an enjoyable family film. 
Negatives:
There was a lack of consistent pacing throughout which lead to an elastic band like feeling of being flung across the Star Wars galaxy only for everything to stop in the middle act and then pick up again.
Themes and ideas introduced in TLJ were dropped in favour of a U turn approach which seemed to neglect much of LTJ's set up.
Lack of direction.
A weak villain who clearly was not supposed to be there.
Lack of development on our supposed main characters.
Too many fake deaths!!!

Positives
Babu Frik!
Once again the visuals are quite stunning, particularly on the watery planet (I looked it up and it said it was called Kef Bir if that means anything to anyone) and I quite enjoyed some of the shots between Rey and Kylo (one of the few things carried forward from TLJ) .
The acting, in particular Driver, was terrific as always and I quite enjoyed Isaac, in what little he was in, as he always played his role of comic relief with an upbeat and energetic feel.

Overall I found it to be an easy watch and fairly enjoyable just sit in the cinema have a nice time and don't think too hard about it afterwards as you may start to realise it doesn't make a lick of sense."
"Feb 8, 2020",positive,"Great special effects, story line and it ended well."
"Feb 8, 2020",positive,It was so good! Loved it!
"Feb 8, 2020",neutral,"Great movie.  Loved plot, characters and special effects"
"Feb 8, 2020",neutral,"It had Energy and Jaw-Dropping Visuals, but Fails when it comes to the Script and Pacing."
"Feb 8, 2020",positive,"I like this movie, but they did so many stupid things that shouldn't have been done, and that's mostly becasue they needed to somehow redeem everything that happened in The Last Jedi and they couldn't."
"Feb 8, 2020",negative,nothing but exposition completly disconnected from the last movie. Should of Made it 2 movies to cover all the random plot points that were shoved down out throats.
"Feb 8, 2020",positive,"This could have really been an excellent Star Wars movie, instead it was just good Star Wars movie. This Star Wars film is gorgeous and the score is fantastic! The sound is perfect! I wish all movies looked and sounded this good! There's also some really intriguing and inventive plot points and fun new realms of the Star Wars Universe we get to explore. 

The biggest flaw in the film was Princess Leia. They should have wrote her out the script. The old footage they use of her is so clunky and unnatural that it's actually very funny when it shouldn't be. Another one of my big problems with this film is that J.J. Abrams, Disney, and the movies other producers obviously do not think the American movie going audience is very intelligent. Some of the concepts, jokes, and editing are so condescending and absent of faith that I personally feel disrespected. Like all of the movies in this recent Star Wars iteration some of the characters and props clearly only exist to sell merchandise rather than to seriously provide depth, context, or humor to the plot. They've seemed to have forgotten why we loved C3PO and R2-D2. 

(Spoiler Alert) This Star Wars films helps correct some of the disappointing aspects of the previous Star Wars films but also suffers from the studio's inability to provide a cohesive narrative the ran throughout the trilogy. The reintroduction of Emperor Palpatine was actually really fun and super cool but also left me asking, ""Where the heck has he been?!? You just spring this on us now?"" I don't know whether or not I would have liked this movie so much if I didn't see it in theaters but I'm still glad that I did."
"Feb 8, 2020",negative,Terrible. Completely destroys not only the new star wars trilogy but potentially jeopardises all of the previous 6 movies also. Would rather forget this one existed
"Feb 8, 2020",negative,"un desastre, quisieron arreglar errores pasados todo el tiempo"
"Feb 8, 2020",positive,Chewbacca finally got his medal! What more is there to say than that?
"Feb 8, 2020",positive,"Nothing new here, felt like it didn’t fit together."
"Feb 8, 2020",positive,It was intense I love how we got to see so many original actors and it was just overall a great movie no spoiler alerts from me
"Feb 8, 2020",positive,Action packed as always. If comparing with the first Star Wars  that was still so ahead of its time. I think this is the last one.   Had to see finale. Nice to see Carrie fisher showcased. A must see.
"Feb 8, 2020",positive,A satisfying finish to great story
"Feb 8, 2020",positive,Once again Star Wars proves the rotten tomatoes critics dont know dick! The Skywalker finale (so far) does a good job of correcting course from the last film. Consistently entertaining.
"Feb 8, 2020",positive,liked it. would've liked it more if-there had been more interaction rae and ben.
"Feb 8, 2020",positive,Like the wrap up of the series.
"Feb 8, 2020",negative,"Um Filme não é feito apenas para fãs. A julgar por um filme solo, ele é péssimo, principalmente quando tenta utilizar coisas desnecessárias para agradar pessoas nos cinemas. Como um ""Fim de franquia"", para um Fã, é considerável."
"Feb 8, 2020",negative,"Yep, probably would have walked out if my husband hadn’t felt strongly about “finishing the series.”"
"Feb 8, 2020",neutral,I didn't see as much action from this movie versus all the others from the Star Wars world.  I bit long in the dialogue for my taste there are only so many back stories before you get bored and yawn.  Then what you want is a good old fashioned fight scene with the good guys kicking ass.
"Feb 8, 2020",positive,"I don't understand the professional critics.  They just don't get it.  This was a fun film.  Not the best Star Wars film, but certainly not the worst.  I'd put it in the top five.  Good entertainment, that should impress real Star Wars fans."
"Feb 8, 2020",positive,Nice wrap-up of Rey's story
"Feb 8, 2020",negative,Longest two hours I've spent in a movie theatre.
"Feb 8, 2020",positive,"Made me laugh and cry, loved every minute."
"Feb 8, 2020",positive,This movie was amazing!!! And had a perfect ending!!
"Feb 8, 2020",positive,A bit of an improvement over The Last Jedi. It is a lot to take in after watching it but it ended being satisfying enough
"Feb 8, 2020",negative,"Perhaps without the intrusion of the appalling ""Last Jedi"", the sequel trilogy could have been something better. But this is a movie that had to occupy itself with damage control from what preceded it.

Littered throughout TROS are moments where JJ Abrams has to concoct silly explanations for the universe-breaking actions in TLJ. ""Why don't we just perform the Holdo maneuver?"" One character asks in the latter part of the story, referring to the ridiculous moment in TLJ that retroactively makes a mockery of the entire Star Wars saga.

But even disregarding these damage-control moments, TROS is a movie without a voice or philosophy. Every instance of seemingly consequential action is later undone. There is no gravitas to anything. The plot is a video game sequence of actions into which the characters feel like they have been forced. There is nothing natural about their presence in the various locations they are required to be in for the plot to advance. Objects and characters magically appear to be exactly where they need to be, tricky situations are resolved by the right macguffin appearing at the right moment. None of it feels meaningful or significant. The character's skills and motivations almost become redundant in the face of the hand-of-god that seemingly moves them around the gameboard of the universe.

The only examples of quality to be found in TROS are in the visual effects, cinematography, costumes etc... And this is the tragedy of the sequel triliogy; clearly there was a lot of talent working on these movies, it's just a shame their skills were put to use in service of such worthless material.

Ultimately, the sequels are a stain upon the Star Wars saga that try to diminish the significance of the originals, undermine its characters and philosophy, and co-opt their success for its own twisted purposes.

There is only one rational response to this abomination. Pretend the sequels never happened."
"Feb 8, 2020",negative,Garbage. Don't make this shit anymore
"Feb 8, 2020",negative,only had to watch this out of curiosity
"Feb 7, 2020",neutral,"As a Star War “purist”- it was long, boring and lacked the quality of special effects that 2019 should have provided."
"Feb 7, 2020",positive,It was a fun movie. Can’t wait for it to get on FandangoNow so I can buy it and watch it all the time.
"Feb 7, 2020",positive,i loved it. cried 3 times
"Feb 7, 2020",positive,"Naysayers be damned! Star Wars fan from the start here; I found this installment to be filled with goodness: great art direction, special effects, acting, storyline - highly entertaining and satisfying."
"Feb 7, 2020",positive,"I liked it just fine. It's Star Wars. It was a bit frenetic and seemed rushed in some places, but it was pretty cool overall. Much more ""epic"" in scope in a lot of places. It was always going to be impossible to make everyone happy trying to wrap up this whole thing. It's almost become a cottage industry with people crapping on every Star Wars movie. This one is a perfectly decent wrap to the whole thing."
"Feb 7, 2020",negative,"Spoiler Alert! After the Last Jedi, I was expecting this movie to be terrible and it ended up surprising me but after some time to think about it, it isn't as good as it was on the first viewing. 
Pros: They make the last Jedi the second least important movie in the saga. THey fix most mistakes about the Last Jedi and Rose is barely in the movie. Kylo Ren is awesome again. The visuals are the best that Starwars has ever seen. There are some great moments like Kylo Ren almost beating Rey in a light Saber fight until Leia stopped him. Kylo Ren was the best character in this movie. Rey being a Palpatine is pretty cool. The scene with Luke Skywalker is pretty good. The score is good once again. The be with me scene in the final act was great. I also like Lando's return and C3PO's character arc. Kylo Ren's redemption was pretty good.

Cons: Bringing the Emperor back was a stupid idea because of the prophecies in the first six movies of Anakin bringing balance to the force and killing the Emperor. It doesn't connect well as a trilogy and it is all over the place. The pacing feels rushed and they could have used some explanation on how the Emperor can switch bodies. Leia's and Kylo's death was dumb because they died the same way as Luke. The sith troopers were disappointing and just stood there. Rey is overpowered and the most overpowered she has ever been. There were moments that should have been more iconic like Lando flying the Millenium Falcon with all of these other ships behind it. It feels like they try to copy some scenes from Endgame but they're not as good. The Emperor is inconsistent with his power and his death was lame. Reylo became a thing and I didn't like Rey saying she was a Skywalker.

 I'm going to give Starwars the Rise of Skywalker a (C-)"
"Feb 7, 2020",positive,"I wasn't bored, my headline would be ""an entertaining mess"". The cut scenes in the first 10 minutes were so rapid it was like the editor was flicking through a deck of top trump cards. After the disappointment of The Last Jedi I knew this final film would be impossible to make and I have total sympathy for J.J. Abrams. I had no expectations for this film, it's the first time I've gone to see a Star Wars movie and not cared about it. A real shame. The whole movie carries on at a great pace, there's lots to see and be dazzled by, but it lacks any scenes that bring the characters down to earth and allows space to ""just breathe."" The finale takes a leaf out of the prequel movies and sees how much it can fit on the screen in one go. It tries way too hard and when an impossibly large fleet of rebel ships appear out of nowhere I actually laughed. The concluding scene I did actually feel emotional and personally thought was handled well, but the movie as a whole was an attempt to fix the plot holes left by the Last Jedi and as others have said, it felt like 3 movies crammed into one. Clearly the lack of planning ahead of time for this trilogy has proved to be the undoing for this franchise. Nevertheless, there's plenty to discuss and the conversation and reinventions will most likely continue till long after we have all passed on from this galaxy. 

May the force be with you."
"Feb 7, 2020",positive,"Better than The Last Jedi.  Hated The Last Jedi.  Didn't feel it made up for some of the previous entry choices, but I did like some of the choices they did make in this round.  Makes me want to see Rey form a Jedi Academy and find Luke's child and continue on what I felt they should've done with Luke, Leia and Han, with recasts."
"Feb 7, 2020",negative,"The movie that killed the Saga.
Disgusting.
Ben deserves much better"
"Feb 7, 2020",positive,Loved it. Best of the trilogy. I'll get some unanswered questions in the comics. Can't wait for the next Saga! May the Force be with all of us!
"Feb 7, 2020",positive,I loved it. It had you on the edge of your seat the whole time.
"Feb 7, 2020",positive,"Not a bad effort, given the utter disaster that was The Last Jedi. Suffers from a too-rushed pace and lack of time for the characters to breathe, but that's what happens when you have to cram two movies worth of content into one movie since the Last Jedi was such a failure."
"Feb 7, 2020",positive,this was the best movie out off the last 3 good plot twist
"Feb 7, 2020",positive,Who saw that coming?  Kind of campy at the end
"Feb 7, 2020",negative,"Easily the worst of all the star Wars films.  It was rushed, non sensical, anti climatic and amateurish.  There wasn't a single awesome light saber battle or sufficient action to keep one engaged.  I've been watching star Wars since 1977 and this was a letdown of epic proportions.  Unlike, the other Star Wars films, I will never watch that mess again.  Save your money and do your best to remember the original characters as they were. These new characters and their boring, aimless direction will be easily forgotten."
"Feb 7, 2020",positive,"I felt like they pulled put out a 100% for the end of the saga, I just didnt like how It kinda dragged there towards the end. I'm not gonna lie, I fell asleep for a little bit."
"Feb 7, 2020",negative,"A jumbled mess of a film that was clearly rushed. There was plenty of wow factor with visuals, but no real substance to back them up. This could have been the plot of any garbage B movie that would go straight to streaming. If it wasn't for the branding and Disney money behind it, most people would agree that this is a piece of poor filmmaking."
"Feb 7, 2020",positive,Fine culminations even if too much to cover ...
"Feb 7, 2020",positive,I like star wars but id this movie didnt have the moniker it would be a mess
"Feb 7, 2020",positive,It had it's problems but giving it under 3 stars would be harsh
"Feb 7, 2020",positive,The movie ended weirdly
"Feb 7, 2020",positive,"I loved it. I loved everything about it. It had all the ingredients  for a great finale. I have been a huge fan of the Star Wars saga ever since the premiere started back in the 70's. I've watched and followed each episode. I fell in love with Luke and Han and Leia and Anakin, C3PO, R2D2, Chewbaca, Yoda, Obie Ben Wan Kenobi, and all the rest. I love that in the face of great evil and hatred that our protaganists always chose to be good and hope and  love prevailed. When all looks lost, hard work and faith works wonders. I am so attached to all of the characters just as if they were family members and I will sorely miss them. Just like all of the endings in all the other episodes, The Rise of Skywalker leaves you with a warm feeling of Joy and Wellbeing.  Bravo! Well done! Well done! Thank you LUCAS FILMS. The Star Wars saga has been so important to me through the years as I was awed and thrilled and saddened and enlightened. I may never be a star figher pilot and galavant around the galaxy saving many worlds, but I lived it and loved the fantasy created through each film. I really loved the way the writer was able tie every thing together in a wonderful way. I loved this film and all the others. I stayed and watched the film and all of the credits as if to saver and appreciate all of the thousands of people it took to make this movie and to say a respectful good-bye to my old friends and their stories. Farewell my friends and ""May the Force Be With You."""
"Feb 7, 2020",positive,Love from start to end
"Feb 7, 2020",positive,Completely blows away the TFA and TLJ. J. J. Really redeemed himself. Rey is actually human and relatable. My only two critiques are that Abrams couldn't resist copycating the original trilogy and trying to hint that Poe was like Solo didn't work for me.
"Feb 7, 2020",positive,"What an emotional end to the new trilogy. While some people may not like them as much, I really liked the direction they went and it all culminated perfectly in the end. I can't wait to see it again."
"Feb 7, 2020",positive,I would have given 5 stars. If they didn't kill off someone that you begin to care for.
"Feb 7, 2020",negative,"Literally no part of this movie was given a single moment of thought.
The first half of this movie is a continuous string of location and objective changes accompanied by awkward expository dialogue explaining each new place they go and thing they have to do. 
The second half takes the few good ideas in the dumpster-fire of the Last Jedi crushes them up, snorts them, then spits their dead remains into the audience's face."
"Feb 7, 2020",positive,"This makes me wish Adam Driver had been around to play Anikin... oh what a dream that would have been.
Strong acting! Well thought out and coherent movie that delivered. Really enjoyed this."
"Feb 7, 2020",positive,A wonderful film full of fun entertainment  throughout. A true theatre going experience.
"Feb 7, 2020",negative,This movie was hot garbage.
"Feb 7, 2020",negative,Un'offesa per ogni fan sano della saga e ogni essere pensante! Insensato dall'inizio alla fine e totalmente incoerente con cosmogonia e personaggi. Pura spazzatura della peggior specie! Hanno ucciso Star Wars!
"Feb 7, 2020",negative,Worst movie ever. Very disappointing.
"Feb 7, 2020",negative,"where do I start ... thankfully the Mandelorian is a step in the right direction, lets hope Disney learns from the mistakes made in this failure or a trilogy"
"Feb 7, 2020",negative,"One of the worst movies of the year. One of the worst Star Wars movies in the series. No script, dialogue was awful"
"Feb 6, 2020",positive,"What happen to the development of characters? The was plot was rehashed and flat, and interesting iconic characters like the Knights of Ren were left on the sidelines as an after thought.  The film is still entertaining, but at its lowest level. Potential wasted, characters wasted and almost my time wasted. I'm a fan so it's hard to not like Star Wars, but I expected more and left the theater guessing is this where the Star Wars franchise is going. I have hope."
"Feb 6, 2020",positive,"Best of the Disney Episodes, not the best Disney Star Wars Movie.  I would give that to Rogue One."
"Feb 6, 2020",positive,"Meh, it passed the time..."
"Feb 6, 2020",positive,Expectations going in were really low due to other reviews. Enjoyed most of the film. Story felt rushed for most of the run time. Overall a good film in my opinion.
"Feb 6, 2020",positive,It was decent...worth a rental. Kind of disappointing though
"Feb 6, 2020",positive,The seamless continuation of the whole story is perfect.  I think the last scene is a teaser that indicates there is more to come.
"Feb 6, 2020",neutral,This was a mess from the beginning. The characters are never really that strong and the story never hits home or even comes close the the originals. Its a good time if you're a Star Wars fan probably more so if you're not. I enjoyed it for what it was which was fan service. Some cool battles and horrible treatment of the original characters is what sums up this new trilogy for me. That just ends pretty much like Avengers Endgame but falls short.
"Feb 6, 2020",negative,3 words. what a mess.
"Feb 6, 2020",positive,"Satisfying enough conclusion. Plenty of fan service. Did it’s best to remedy the mess of the last movie getting back to the core, the Charles Yera. Didn’t feel political agendas in this one. Well paced. Giving 3.5 because it is better than an average movie but not as good as the best movies I’ve ever seen"
"Feb 6, 2020",positive,"Not the best Star Wars by any means, but it paid respect to all the main characters of the past 42 years. I did catch the line about the festival occurring every 42 years."
"Feb 6, 2020",positive,Entertaining movie but completely destroyed the Skywalker Saga. Not the end the audience was looking for at all.
"Feb 6, 2020",neutral,"There were parts that my wife and I liked, but things could have been much much better."
"Feb 6, 2020",positive,Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker was great and it's one of the best Star Wars movies of all time. The only Star Wars movie that was better is ‘Solo'. Great Movie!
"Feb 6, 2020",positive,"Awesome culmination of all the Star Wars movies! I loved all the touchbacks and memories! Great, great movie!"
"Feb 6, 2020",positive,Best Star Wars I’ve seen
"Feb 6, 2020",positive,"If you are a original star wars fan from the 70's and have an open mind and imagination, then you will be pleasantly surprised how they are able to tie up all the loose ends and come up with a ""CONCLUSION"" for all 9 movies. There will be a lot of people who think that they ruined the franchise, but everyone is entitled there opinion. Go see it and judge for yourself. It has been a great franchise and i look forward to seeing more new and imaginative stories and characters for the future. ""May the Force be with YOU""."
"Feb 6, 2020",positive,The majority of the movie didn't flow smoothly for me.
"Feb 6, 2020",negative,Not that interesting and acting was so so.
"Feb 6, 2020",positive,Love it! I wish there was a longer love story between the two main characters 😊
"Feb 6, 2020",negative,"Star Wars: Episode of backpain for Adam Driver due to carrying this entire trilogy.

Rise of Skywalker was exactly what I expected; Abrams typical rushing over all contrivances and plot holes in favour of brisk, colourful fun. Strangely that seemed to fit as an apt ending to this new trilogy, however, that also made it a terrible, terrible movie and a woefully underwhelming conclusion to the three trilogies of movies.

It reminded me at the worst moments of the worst moments of The Matrix Revolutions with Rey a sort of uninteresting 'force'-driven faux-Jesus with the powers of whatever the plot dictates and 'trust me' and 'I'm doing this alone' dialogue and every other soppy fool is just running to keep up with her rash, cringey actions. And to counter that, the best arc in VII, VIII and IX, belongs to Ben Solo, a Skywalker whose Rise is undoubtedly actually the titular rising Skywalker and not Rey, who I will defend to the hilt, should have been a nobody. I'm fully sick of watching films and long running TV shows where EVERYONE and EVERYTHING is connected, with head-spinning amounts of forced retconning. RoS is a stealth Ben Solo trilogy, Adam Driver is a superb actor who can even shine amidst this plot dreck, and Rey should have ended the movie announcing she is *just* Rey, ending the saga for good. Reshoots clearly did not allow for this.

Speaking of repeated tropes I HATE we have another ""Quick! Team A have to shut off the generator/beacon/lead ship/satellite/force field etc etc so that Team B can zoom their unlimited (but somehow we're told is dwindling) ship supply to pew pew something that Deus Ex Machinas a chain of explosions that saves absolutely everything ever. It's tired, it's cute in A New Hope, it's so boring now that I can't help but gloss over.

RoS also shits all over Rian Johnson's TLJ, and in doing so, actually made me appreciate it more! I liked Rose Tico when I saw how crassly she was sidelined and how much clear contempt there was from including her in the main proceedings; a simple fix would have been omitting that ridiculously uninspired Female Finn that Lando creepily comes on to at the end, and instead have had Rose Tico in a painful long term relationship with Finn, driven to taking up Finn's cause after falling in love with him and seeing how much she could help after The First Order took her sister from her, by having her emancipate the child soldiers of the First Order to Endor's moon, which would have facilitated a nuanced and fertile continuation of her arc and relationships and relevance. And the beats dedicated to Luke Skywalker not only directly contradict his character growth and story moments of TLJ, but I'm even sure he repeats the exact opposite dialogue from TLJ just short of winking directly at the previously outraged 'fans'.

What did I like? Besides the creatures, effects, actual directing work, cast and photography (with exception of the flashing lights, what a terrible way to start a movie)? Well, all the Reylo stuff was creative and surprising (I yelled out loud when he snatched that necklace!) and the throne room fight felt like a Rian Johnson move, which is to say an inspired and different way of staging a thing like that. And in every scant scene there's the mote of a good idea, but it's rolled over so fast and without sealing any of the gaps, that it squashes each one. I imagine that's to do with writer Terrios' comments about wanting to divide it into two movies. And Disney's adherence to having cake and eating it leaves moments like the Force Lightning or C3PO (with unfathomable screen time here) bereft of weight when they're reversed moments later.

Rey's powers were cool and she actually seemed powerful and the last of her kind, better than in Episode II where throwing disposable weak Jedi like fodder at the screen was a dumb idea; And it's good to see a genuinely strong female character battle with her dark and light sides. But all the fan references and easter eggs were ugly and awkward. And even the kooky side characters they introduced (however enjoyable) were clearly window dressing and distraction and merchandising.

Leia's arc and interactions are crass cut-and-shut moments lifted from other movies and it shows; it's cringey to be honest and starting the opening crawl with the death of Leia and revolving large portions of the movie around it with her communication through the force may have been better in retrospect and would have done her more justice. And the movie is plagued with a million other stupid decisions, I'm not even touching Palpatine or any of that shit. What a clusterfuck.

It's a shame that the new trilogy clearly started with the intention of building a new world, a new fanbase, with new leads but keeping a dash of that old magic, and after The Last Jedi (for better and worse) leaned into that full tilt; then Episode IX's 'course correct' is a last-minute, slap-dash rush to appeal to the older fans and hastily conclude 9 films instead of just conclude 3 films well, and in their own way and style.

So why give it an average score if it's a terrible movie? Well, as always with Abrams, it's a good experience in the cinema. I laughed, I cheered and I felt something, no matter how processed it was. There's a particularly accurate comment from RedLetterMedia to the effect of: ""With episode IX, Abrams took straw and spun it into bronze."" It's the best it could have been with the Disney Overlords pulling the strings and having to answer to ending 3 films, 9 films, constantly changing chiefs, grappling with fan expectations, predictions, backlash and time constraints. That's not an excuse, just a reality. There were always contrivances in Star Wars, but this film is hinged entirely on puffs of air; It's literally a popcorn movie, it's tasty but utterly pointless and you wouldn't go reaching for it again unless you had limited choice."
"Feb 6, 2020",positive,"Too many cameos for my liking, but certainly not as bad as some people made it out to be!"
"Feb 6, 2020",positive,"Too many cameos for my liking, but certainly not as bad as some people made it out to be!"
"Feb 6, 2020",positive,"There are many things to like about the movie — the light saber duels, the desert chase sequence — but I feel a let down by it because of the lack of any real character development and the disservice it does to the new characters, especially Rey, at the expense of shoehorning in all of the callbacks to the the previous trilogies."
"Feb 6, 2020",positive,"I have seen it twice now, and could watch it more."
"Feb 6, 2020",positive,"We thought is was great, it brought everything to a close."
"Feb 6, 2020",positive,Fantastic. Loved it.
"Feb 6, 2020",negative,Basura como todo lo último de esta saga...
"Feb 6, 2020",positive,Better than last few films in the Star Wars series... liked the tie in with the original cast members...
"Feb 6, 2020",positive,Loved the movie clash of of school new school characters and looks to be the wrap of a series and what a series it's been. Worth owning to complete your collection.
"Feb 6, 2020",positive,A very good action/science fiction movie.
"Feb 6, 2020",positive,"Great way to end the story, given where the last movie left it. Somehow able to recover the story with a meaningful, nostalgic send-off."
"Feb 6, 2020",positive,"I thought this was a fantastic finale to a trilogy I have seriously loved. It ended in a very satisfying way for me and I struggle to think how it could have been improved. I loved the character's arcs and how they completed their stories. Sure Finn could have had a better story but he played an important role nonetheless.
I loved the action and emotion in this film and am glad I watched it twice."
"Feb 6, 2020",positive,"It's a pretty solid movie in my opinion. If you were a fan of the storyline from The Last Jedi, then this one might not be for you as it retcons many things to try and ""fix"" the plot without risks. Has it's up and downs, but I'd recommend to any Star Wars fans out there."
"Feb 6, 2020",negative,"Nah mate, none of the characters are interesting and the story just goes nowhere. JJ did his best but yikes does it flop."
"Feb 6, 2020",negative,"Ahhh, I waited until is was a rental, and was still dissapointed I spent the $6. This trilogy had such potential, there are some scenes in this that show what this trilogy could have been....... but alas, it wasn't to be. Here's to hoping that Disney doesn't ruin Tano in the Mandalorian."
"Feb 6, 2020",positive,Was very good.  It would be good even if you had not seen any of the previous Star Wars movies.
"Feb 6, 2020",positive,I like this group of people in the movie.. this one ends with out leaving you hanging knowing there has to be a sequel .
"Feb 6, 2020",positive,Best Star Wars movie in a long time. Tied together the loose ends and lack of cohesion from Eps. VII and VIII in a truly satisfying way. A brilliant way to close out the Skywalker saga.
"Feb 6, 2020",negative,"Overall, pretty lousy movie. I was able to foresee generic movie tropes from a mile away, I found the CGI choppy at some parts, story pacing was too fast and confusing, etc, etc. Good time killer movie, I guess but not a good send off to the new Star Wars trilogy. :/"
"Feb 6, 2020",positive,I’ll liked that they brought all of the heroines back for one final current call.
"Feb 6, 2020",negative,Disney should have given Abrams the 2 part Episode 9.
"Feb 6, 2020",negative,"meh I stopped caring about SW, winks under eyepatch."
"Feb 6, 2020",positive,"Heard it wasnt good but thoroughly enjoyed it from the standpoint of a Star Wars appreciator, not fanatic so maybe I missed some things. But for two hours and 32 minutes I was NEVER bored."
"Feb 6, 2020",positive,I’m surprised by the poor reviews. This was my favorite of the new trilogy. 
"Feb 6, 2020",negative,Did not enjoy it. They are ruining the Star Wars franchise.
"Feb 6, 2020",positive,"Ehh, everything was too easy and convenient for the main characters. The new star wars really lack character development."
"Feb 6, 2020",negative,SORRY BUT THIS FRANCHISE WAS OFFICIALLY DONE WITH AFTER REVENGE OF THE SITH!!! 
"Feb 6, 2020",negative,There was nothing compelling about the story. I pretty much only enjoyed the new droid. I won’t be watching this movie ever again.
"Feb 6, 2020",positive,Didn't care for the way it ended
"Feb 6, 2020",negative,Movie was a mess.  Disney Star Wars is a mess.
"Feb 6, 2020",positive,Pretty solid ending to the Skywalker saga. Although some scenarios could have been different
"Feb 6, 2020",positive,"Far, FAR better than the last one, I felt. A little bit of “feel good/Disney” nonsense of course, but a decent wrap-up for one of the all time greatest movie franchises. I highly recommend if you’ve ever even sorta liked Star Wars; you’ll like this movie."
"Feb 5, 2020",positive,Star Wars movies never disappoint me 
"Feb 5, 2020",positive,"Really good! It was not my favorite, but still liked it."
"Feb 5, 2020",positive,Great way to end the skywalker saga. Had some flaws with Kylo and Rey but overall a fun movie experience and one of the great Star Wars films of this century.
"Feb 5, 2020",negative,Rae is a Palpatine not a Skywalker! Leia should have hugged chewie not Rae she had no history with Rae Rae grandfather destroyed Anakin Sywalker  and just basically WTF I hated this movie.
"Feb 5, 2020",positive,"One of the best Star Wars storie. The rest is what the fans saw in the last 20 years, changing a little bit here or there."
"Feb 5, 2020",positive,"REDEMPTION on multiple levels!
Do not hesitate to see this brilliant popcorn finale on the largest screen possible! Thank you J.J. !"
"Feb 5, 2020",negative,A decent ending to a forgettable trilogy that spoiled the true Star Wars.
"Feb 5, 2020",negative,"Despite the movie being mildly better than the previous *cough* movie, I can't find it in me to give it anything more than 1.5 stars."
"Feb 5, 2020",negative,Enjoyable enough if you're there for nostalgia and cheap entertainment. But thoroughly lacking if you're looking for more. 
"Feb 5, 2020",positive,"Had an amazing ending, but it needed a much longer runtime. Almost perfect fan service"
"Feb 5, 2020",negative,Worse than i could possible imagine. The script is a bloody mess.
"Feb 5, 2020",positive,This movie is the best out of all the skywalker Saga the cast is amazing and the theming and colours
"Feb 5, 2020",negative,"Emperor Palpatine was Gr8 even though it made no since AT ALL! and i had to invent my own version of how he survived dying TWICE. based on NEW cannon that apparently Palpatine knew of a shatter point, and used clones to facilitate his clones Snoke and himself...to keep some hold on the galaxy....SMH Disney . you should have listened to George Lucas and used his script. sigh so much for SW RIPieces"
"Feb 5, 2020",positive,"Was the best STAR WARS movie i could imagine. Was incredible, good characters, good plot, and an INCREDIBLE end!!! Was amazing, my favorite star wars movie and my favorite movie ever."
"Feb 5, 2020",negative,"Il finale della saga degli Skywalker non meritava affatto una fine così. Pieno di buchi di trama, incongruenze che portano in superficie delle faccende ormai chiuse nei vecchi episodi. Molto bello dal punto di vista degli effetti speciali, come del resto ci si aspetterebbe, ma per il resto davvero deludente. Sceneggiatura mediocre che non regge proprio il confronto con alcuni degli altir episodi. In conclusione, questo nono ed ultimo episodio, inizia male (a partire dalla solita classica scritta di riassunto di ciò che è successo prima del film) e finisce ancora peggio."
"Feb 5, 2020",negative,There’s such thing as too much fan service. The lack of cohesion in this trilogy is most obvious in this entry. 
"Feb 5, 2020",positive,"Other than the inadequate ending--which did no justice to the most compelling character of this trilogy, Kylo Ren/Ben Solo--this is a riveting and colorful blast through the galaxies. The end could have been so much better, which is a big factor in the disappointment expressed by many"
"Feb 5, 2020",positive,"Awesome movie, great visual effects."
"Feb 5, 2020",positive,Sad but fun movie that had some twist and turns I didnt see coming
"Feb 5, 2020",neutral,Completely forgettable. JJ did what he could I guess. Still wasn't that interesting.... and that's hard to achieve in a Stars Wars movie
"Feb 5, 2020",negative,"Anthony Daniels is the only saving grace at this point, that man's a national treasure."
"Feb 5, 2020",negative,"Trying to completely undo the previous movie in the instalment within the first 20 minutes was painful to watch, but the worst things about this movie are its weird editing that leaves more than one character discarded, its relentless nostalgic fan service and lack of originality stemming from Abrams's painfully reductive (stated) belief that, at its core, Star Wars has always been a story about Palpatines vs Skywalkers."
"Feb 5, 2020",positive,It was all around amazing!!!
"Feb 5, 2020",positive,"I enjoyed my time watching the film but I still noticed the flaws. But since the recent leaks from the original episode 9 script and concept art, I feel like this movie could have been much better and now I get the feeling that J.J. Abrams and Chris Terrio ruined the movie. They could have kept the original plan but they changed everything and not for the best."
"Feb 5, 2020",positive,"As with all the other Star Wars movies, this one did not disappoint. It was action packed, full of familiar faces and just very well done. I would watch it again!"
"Feb 5, 2020",positive,"I loved it!! I hear people complaining about all the callbacks to the original movies when that's what a story is supposed to do. This is not just one standalone film, it's the culmination of one long story. Also, it was definitely made for the fans of the original films, because the fan service was off the hook.
There was Lando, The Ewoks, Luke lifting his X-wing out of the water, Palpatine's return with a secret armada of ships, Luke training Leia, Rey taking on Palpatine with lightsabers belonging to the twins, Chewbacca finally getting the medal he never received in the original films, Rey shooting force lightning from her hands, the force bringing together a group of force-sensitive people to overpower the dark side, the voices of every Jedi that passed on and Rey fighting her evil self on the old Death Star. I enjoyed every moment of this movie. I'm definitely buying it when it's available.

These are The Last Days of Dark"
"Feb 5, 2020",positive,Don't understand why people don't like this movie is incredible!!
"Feb 5, 2020",positive,It’s back! This one was for the fans.
"Feb 5, 2020",positive,"Literally the PERFECT end to an amazing saga. Jaw dropping the entire time. Incredibly acted, edited, and directed. Driver and Ridley are electrifying. I can not for the life of me figure out why critics found this anything less than what it was; spectacular. Forget the critics, if you love Star Wars, you absolutely will not be disappointed."
"Feb 5, 2020",positive,lots of time to retell  a new hope but  satisfactory for a send out
"Feb 5, 2020",positive,Overall entertaining. More or less agreed with how things turned out but it was a good movie.
"Feb 5, 2020",positive,"Fitting end for the Star Wars saga.  So happy with it, I saw it twice in the theater."
"Feb 5, 2020",positive,It was amazing  paced very well  do yourself a favor dont listen to critics
"Feb 5, 2020",positive,Loved the “girl power” in the movie and more races being in the movie!  I miss George Luca’s vision of it though
"Feb 5, 2020",positive,I was moved to tears with the end of an Era.
"Feb 5, 2020",negative,Disappointing but not dreadful.
"Feb 5, 2020",positive,"Much better than I expected.  I fund little to smile about in the earlier two films, some things to smile about in Ron Howard's Solo film.  This film is an outstanding, incredible achievement of imagination and craft.  I suspect this is JJ's best film and best script, with his several collaborators.  The light saber fight choreography has never been better ever.  The acting has never been better.  

What I don't see mentioned in other reviews is the video-game angle.  The Rogue One movie played more like a video game than like a movie, lots to do, not much emotional engagement.  

Rise of Skywalker plays as a perfect hybrid of movie and video game, best elements of both, lots you culd do in a video-game AND lots of emotional engagement, even some originality (Luke and Leia) were bother sister.  Rei and Ben become brother and sister).  

I think more credit needs to go to the brain trust of writers, including Colin Treverow and JJ, two masters of breathing fresh life into old IPs, sometimes strikingly original new life.  

The trailers suggested the movie could be overly sentimental fan service, a ""Star Wars greatest hits.""  Every Disney Star Wars has tried to be ""Star Wars greatest hits.""  I found the story engaging over and above the hundreds of ""greatest hits"" moments.  Quite an accomplishment.  :)"
"Feb 5, 2020",positive,The movie was bright-hearted.I love it!
"Feb 5, 2020",positive,Great and of the Saga
"Feb 5, 2020",positive,Excellent Film. Hate to see the saga end!
"Feb 5, 2020",negative,Really awful. Would have walked out in the middle if I hadn't promised my mom I would watch it with her. I never thought I'd say I miss the prequels. This was that bad.
"Feb 5, 2020",positive,LOVED IT!!!!!!!!!!!! SEEING IT AGAIN SATURDAY!!!!
"Feb 5, 2020",positive,"Definitely flawed esp when it comes to pacing, but ultimately a satisfying finish that demonstrates it understands what's so great about the series."
"Feb 5, 2020",negative,The Rise of Skywalker feels convoluted and rushed as the only thing the charachters do is search for plot devices to move the story forward. JJ Abrams tries to undo the events of The Last Jedi and it ends up feeling like this conclusion to the Star Wars saga leaves more questions asked than answered.
"Feb 5, 2020",positive,Great job incorporating the older movies into this one.
"Feb 5, 2020",positive,It was ok. It finished the series. But still a let down for anyone who wasn't a huge fan. HAlf of the movies were bad........too bad they made them for kids.
"Feb 5, 2020",positive,"Honestly, I'm a bit disappointed. The movie felt extremely rushed. I definitely think this movie would have gained better reviews had it been split into two parts. I find that the story lacked information and had too many loose ends. That being said, the visuals, acting, and humor make up for some of the shortcomings of the film."
"Feb 4, 2020",positive,Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is an excellent film. It is about the surviving members of the resistance who face the First Order once again. Carrie Fisher and Adam Driver give fantastic performances. The screenplay is well written. J.J. Abrams did a great a job directing this movie. I enjoyed watching this motion picture because of the action and adventure. Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is a must see.
"Feb 4, 2020",positive,All over the place but overall fun. Several LOL lines/scenes. It brought in some memorable elements from the past in a good way. This was my favorite of the three sequels.
"Feb 4, 2020",negative,It just destroyed the whole saga
"Feb 4, 2020",positive,Good ending to the saga.
"Feb 4, 2020",positive,Best Star Wars movie ever! Action packed! Great way to end the saga. Daisy Riddley is awesome!
"Feb 4, 2020",positive,Wonderful adventure!
"Feb 4, 2020",neutral,"Well well well.....After a halfway decent FA and a terrible TLJ, ROS tries it's best to bounce back but fails in to many ways to save this trilogy."
"Feb 4, 2020",negative,not as bad as The Last Jedi
"Feb 4, 2020",positive,"I really liked the battle scenes, the outstanding special effects and the over all movie plot! I truly enjoyed this movie, eve thought l am not a hard core Star Wars fan."
"Feb 4, 2020",negative,"Oof, that was rotten."
"Feb 4, 2020",negative,"Wow, to imagine the amount of money that went into this, and the number of viewers who saw this, and this felt like some half baked episode of duck tales with better effects. I went in with low expectations, given the reviews, and was still like WTF am I watching here? There are better B grade video game cut scenes than this whole movie. Even with my AMC A list making it almost free, I want my two hours back."
"Feb 4, 2020",positive,"I liked that they brought Luke, Leia, Han & Lando back for the cameos in the end. I disliked the ending."
"Feb 4, 2020",positive,"It is a solid movie. Yet the smell of ""pre-owned"" is emanating through the whole. From flashbacks of X-wing rising out of waters, from throwing away lightsabers (it happened at least thrice during this movie) to the Big Battle in the end. During this battle authors literally recycled the shots from Episode VI (Emperor seducing Luke while Rebel fleet is being exterminated). That is one interpretation.
There is another one as well. This movie is a bridge. The link between my generation, and that of my children. My generation can enjoy episodes IV to VI and keep argueing if Han shot first (yes, he did). But my children - they need new heroes, new adventures. The story though - a fairy tale in the Galaxy Far Far Away, the dreams - of exploration, of alien cultures and species, of friendship and loyalty - they are the same.
Let the Force be with you. Always."
"Feb 4, 2020",positive,Better than Last Jedi.
"Feb 4, 2020",negative,"on this movie we learn that Vader's sacrifice was meanless. That responds how bad this is, don't even WATCH."
"Feb 4, 2020",positive,pleasing end to the saga. not the best though
"Feb 4, 2020",negative,I was waiting for it to be over.
"Feb 4, 2020",negative,Worst of all the Star Wars movie! Plot was horrible!
"Feb 4, 2020",positive,"Of the 9 Star Wars movies, I rate episode 9 as being better than all but the original (episode 4, 1977 the 4th episode of the story arc, but the first of the 9 movies to be produced and screened). It ties the series together, and takes is back to where it began. So if you've been putting off seeing the final episode, don't delay any longer, because it will only be in theaters for another 2 days or so, and it's well worth the time and money."
"Feb 4, 2020",neutral,"Predictable. A couple good moments, good fight scenes, but the plot is terrible... but what can I say... it is Star Wars!!! Go see it and have fun"
"Feb 4, 2020",positive,"Amazing. I'm obsessed. I'm a Star Wars fan and love alll the trilogies. The only people who don't like this movie haven't liked any of this new trilogy. If you enjoyed TFA you'll love this one. Way beyond my expectations!! I think the second time you see it gets even better and allows you to process what's happening more clearly. The acting, score, special effects are phenomenal, as usual. The nostalgic moments. The characters are fun. But the epic light saber fights, depth, connection, complexity, and chemistry between Rey and Kylo Ren's characters and their force bond really make the movie. I obviously have critiques, but given that the entire story wasn't thought out before the 3 movies were made makes it difficult for a super coherent seamless plot line (and villain). And after TLJ, with what JJ Abrams had to work with, I just accepted the whole Palpatine bit. To be fair, Palpatine really is the epitome of the dark side and the most terrifying sith we're all very familiar with, that's haunted both the previous trilogies so I just accepted that it would be a cool way to end the last of the Skywalker movies. My biggest critique is the very end. All the force ghosts should have been behind her. He had all the siths with him. The force ghosts should have appeared with their light sabers behind her. That would have been the ultimate hell yes!!!!! moment of the movie. Palpatine should have screamed in fear seeing them all and it would have felt like an epic justified ending with them all killing him together with her. That would have given more closure to this Skywalker saga for me, knowing that Anakin and Luke got to be part of that final take down of someone they already destroyed. Also wouldn't have minded kylo living and appearing next to Rey on Luke's planet, with Luke and Leia looking at both of them proud and at peace. And Ben and Rey standing with the moons. That would have left it more open ended as far as their future, their kids, more movies IDK GUYS lol. I loved it though so much. I don't ever write reviews but I just loved it haha."
"Feb 4, 2020",positive,I liked how it tied up the loose ends of the story.
"Feb 4, 2020",negative,"Same storyline as before, with all kinds of loose ends for future quarterly Star Wars movies.....it will get to the point where they will start numbering the movie sequels."
"Feb 4, 2020",positive,"Ok, but over the top."
"Feb 4, 2020",positive,Feel like the saga should continue
"Feb 4, 2020",positive,All good. Worth the time and money.
"Feb 4, 2020",positive,"People like to complain about things for the sake of it these days. The Film does lack some invention in certain areas but overall it's action packed and full of good fan service, really not much to dislike here."
"Feb 4, 2020",positive,Great visual effects
"Feb 4, 2020",positive,Well written!  Stars Wars fan must see !
"Feb 4, 2020",positive,"Good Movie, not Epic, definetly set up for another."
"Feb 4, 2020",positive,They really focused on drawing everything to a close. Honor paid to the whole saga.
"Feb 4, 2020",positive,"It was a lot better than I thought it was going to be.  The backgrounds were visually brilliant.  The directing was very nice.  The sound effects were topnotch, and the soundtrack was amazing, as always.  Better still, I really enjoyed the new cast.  The comedic elements landed pretty well and the dialogue was decent.  The writers definitely had to do some creative kung-fu to tie everything together, and I think they did a pretty deft job.  Overall, it was truly good and a nice way to wrap up the saga."
"Feb 4, 2020",positive,Good action. Could have been edited a bit shorter.
"Feb 4, 2020",positive,The storyline was very interesting and kept up with the story being told. Enjoyable for the whole family.
"Feb 4, 2020",positive,I really enjoyed watching The Rise of Skywalker
"Feb 4, 2020",positive,I thoroughly enjoyed seeing Palpatine resurrected zombie style!!!!
"Feb 4, 2020",positive,"Overall it wasn't a bad movie. I've certainly seen worse from the Star Wars franchise. It just wasn't a great one. I'm not unhappy with this movie in any major way, it's just that I was not excited either. No part of it truly felt surprising, and despite some engaging moments the whole movie felt too much like an obligatory tie-up of loose ends, like the movie had a checklist and was just ticking them off one by one without much enthusiasm. At some points I was looking at my watch wondering how much longer it was going to be. Sorry, it's a 3-star at best."
"Feb 4, 2020",positive,"Very good movie, I went back and watched it 2 more times.  No regrets."
"Feb 4, 2020",positive,Good conclusion to the big story! Consistent with series style.
"Feb 4, 2020",positive,Storyline and special effects were inredible
"Feb 3, 2020",positive,2nd best in the new trilogy. Overall a good ending to the Skywalker saga.
"Feb 3, 2020",positive,Really good finish to the Skywalker Saga. Very fulfilling story and conclusion.
"Feb 3, 2020",positive,Great collaboration. Visually intense. Loved the ending.
"Feb 3, 2020",positive,A great wrap to all the others - left an opening for future films.
"Feb 3, 2020",positive,"I'll likely forget what happened in a week, but it was fun enough whilst it was on screen, but very safe"
"Feb 3, 2020",positive,Amazing ending to long story.
"Feb 3, 2020",positive,i liked pretty much everything except the ending.
"Feb 3, 2020",positive,Tied things up pretty well
"Feb 3, 2020",positive,the entire movie felt rushed. would have been better if it had been 2 movies.
"Feb 3, 2020",neutral,It leaves a bunch of open questions that are never answered. It only sorta wraps up the Skywalker saga
"Feb 3, 2020",negative,"Literally one of the stupidest , most disjointed movies ever.  I guess you have to expect them to jump the shark on movie number 9."
"Feb 3, 2020",positive,A rehash of all the others.  Too many chases and light saber fights.
"Feb 3, 2020",positive,"If you are a Star Wars Fan, this was action-packed movie that filled some holes in the Star Wars Lore.  Haters are going to hate.  I loved it."
"Feb 3, 2020",negative,It so sad for me because this could been much more than it is
"Feb 3, 2020",positive,not even a star wars fan but I rllyyy enjoyed this!
"Feb 3, 2020",positive,Excellent. Did not disappoint. Very nostalgic.
"Feb 3, 2020",negative,The whole trilogy just didn't have a compelling or interesting story. It had great potential with great actors an actresses. But the writing and character development wasn't there to make sure that the audience really cares about the characters. The Fin and Rey relationship could have been better. And they should have had all the original leads in atleast one scene together.
"Feb 3, 2020",positive,Awesome movie and I’m not even into Star Wars! I took my 12 year old to see it because he’s a fan! Would definitely watch again.
"Feb 3, 2020",negative,"It is a terrible movie, the only good thing is the fan service at the end of the movie"
"Feb 3, 2020",negative,Dull beyond redemption
"Feb 3, 2020",positive,I loved it.  Was missing something though... WHICH could have been fixed had they planned the three movies out before hand.
"Feb 3, 2020",negative,"pretty much just watch ""robot head"" on youtube. it will all make sence. he describes every problem i had with the movie"
"Feb 3, 2020",positive,"Acting, special effects and how so many characters were made part of a long story since its inception"
"Feb 3, 2020",positive,What a challenge it was to bring this to a close.  From 1977 to this movie I have been on the ride. Did it all work?  I don’t know yet. It’s still seeking in. Was I entertained. Yes.
"Feb 3, 2020",positive,"Loved it as the end to the saga, had some holes to be sure but for a trilogy with  now clear direction from the beginning it felt like an appropriate and really the only way to close it out."
"Feb 3, 2020",negative,The ending was so dumb. This movie was all over the place there was no heart in this film
"Feb 3, 2020",positive,"It was entertaining enough, but not the best of the Star Wars movies from recent years (Rogue One was the best, imho).  Didn't really feel like the end of the saga. Some of the magical leaping/flying sequences seemed poorly done technically (think House of Flying Daggers style). Poe is an irritating character. Misogynist - always thinks he knows better than the women leaders what strategy to pursue.  All that being said, I'd give it a second watch to pick up on anything I may have missed in all the action."
"Feb 3, 2020",positive,I liked almost everything!!!!
"Feb 3, 2020",positive,"I recommend seeing The Rise of Skywalker with two nine-year-olds and a twelve-year-old.  After the film, they were so excited to discuss the events of the film, and so full of questions for me, that I didn't have the time nitpick.  It was fun, it was funny, it was exciting, and it had its share of touching moments. It was a Star Wars movie."
"Feb 3, 2020",positive,I thinks this was the best of them all such a roller coaster!!! Lots of great surprises!
"Feb 3, 2020",positive,Very long or seemed to be... dragged at parts
"Feb 3, 2020",negative,"Great acting by Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley.  Horrible storyline.  So many missed opportunities.  Star Wars fans wanted so much more than just another bang-bang-shoot-em-up with special effects and lasers.  Zero explanation of any of the mythology, great supporting actors' roles relegated to side-kicks, no redemption resolution for Ben Solo or the force dyad with Rey and finally Rey is evidently right back to where she was at the beginning...alone on a desert planet.  This could have been an epic tale and what sophisticated fans got was an epic fail."
"Feb 3, 2020",positive,"I really liked this movie. Great story, acting and cinematography. The only thing I could say that was lacking was the “closure factor”. Supposedly, this movie was supposed to close the current story arc, and so don’t think it did that well, if at all. Other than that, a great movie."
"Feb 3, 2020",negative,A terrible film and a blemish on wonderful childhood movie memory.
"Feb 3, 2020",positive,Gave a good conclusion to the saga but got a little hokey
"Feb 3, 2020",positive,Great end to the latest trilogy.  Loved the characters and storyline.
"Feb 3, 2020",positive,Loved all of it!! A lot of action
"Feb 3, 2020",positive,I thought it was very well done once again. A little predictable but hey thats Disney for you.
"Feb 3, 2020",positive,Just thought they finally started a new path to look forward to. No cussing!!!! No f bombs. Wow. So refreshing
"Feb 3, 2020",positive,"The action was almost non-stop.  The mix of old, beloved characters with the recent characters worked really well.  The integration of the nostalgic images into the current story line brings both a smile and a year to my face."
"Feb 3, 2020",positive,ancesters coming around to help rey.
"Feb 3, 2020",positive,Best Star Wars movie ever
"Feb 3, 2020",positive,"Ive been a fan since a new hope. I never thought I would like a movie better then some of the originals, but this is my favorite Star Wars film to date!"
"Feb 3, 2020",negative,"There was no George Lucas touch in it, it was too Disney safe! Weak ending to an amazing saga!  Wish it would have been different, better wait for it in Disney plus don't waste the money and that is coming from a hardcore starwars fan!!!"
"Feb 3, 2020",negative,FFS The choices were BAD ...
"Feb 3, 2020",negative,Cared more about pleasing a handful of fans than telling a good story. Squandered so much of the potential that the first two movies set up.
"Feb 3, 2020",positive,"I truly don't know what people could've expected to be done differently than this. I enjoyed Last Jedi but honestly it didn't add much to the trilogy and really just left everything up in the air. You left with the same questions you had going into it. This movie did as good a job as possible to tie up all loose ends and bring closure. I'm a Star Wars fan. I truly just enjoy the Star Wars universe. The people that trash this trilogy in my opinion are not. Clinging to the original trilogy and acting like anything that has come since then isn't worthy is ignorant and kind of sad. Just appreciate being able to experience new characters, stories and worlds in this truly amazing galaxy. I've watched everything and read many of the books. Some are better than others but I always come out glad I experienced it."
"Feb 3, 2020",positive,"After The Last Jedi I had very low expectations. Overall, I think this film was an improvement. It was very cartoon-ish and over the top but it did have some emotion payoffs."
"Feb 3, 2020",positive,Haven't we seen all these before since Abrams took over?
"Feb 3, 2020",negative,"Ugh, crazy disappointing."
"Feb 3, 2020",positive,"Very nice conclusion to the main star was timeline! The fact that palpatine never died was amazing, Rey being the granddaughter of sheev palpating was amazing! I would watch this movie over and over very good movie!"
"Feb 3, 2020",positive,A decent ending to this latest trilogy.
"Feb 3, 2020",positive,I thought it was a good movie. I love the twist with her being Palpatines granddaughter. I thought it was exciting. It was also a little sad. Good movie. Also you killed Ive ben solo which I was grateful for. LOL
"Feb 3, 2020",positive,"It was action-packed, but I wished JJ and crew paid just a little more attention to science.  Oh well, it's just a movie."
"Feb 3, 2020",positive,Lots of action and multiple good storylines.
"Feb 3, 2020",positive,I loved it. So many references to past movies in the franchise and the colors/sounds/pictures were just amazing. It was great.
"Feb 3, 2020",positive,I did enjoy it very much. Is it the best Star Wars out there...no! But its a fair conclusion of the Saga.
"Feb 3, 2020",positive,Felt like they rushed and tried to cram too much into the first half. Characters introduced but still felt no connection to most of the characters.
"Feb 3, 2020",positive,"Sure some on Rotten Tomatoes, like almost half them, prolly shoot for one side and I do too. Soar winners, losers. Like dropping life with bombs and keels. Bloom... o yeahs."
"Feb 3, 2020",positive,Loved the movie bit bought it was a little long. Great way to wrap up a lifetime of love of the Star Wars series and to watch it with my son was great. We watched all 8 over the Christmas holiday break and then school and commitments took over our ability to catch the movie until I pushed hard for it and we got it in last night.
"Feb 3, 2020",positive,All around awesome!!
"Feb 3, 2020",positive,It was a great story and way to end the Saga
"Feb 3, 2020",positive,Should have spent more time on who Rey's parents were and how she became the  ONE.
"Feb 3, 2020",positive,"The best one of the three! Glad Ren turned back to Ben. Palpatine was scary I wasn't too mad he reappeared. Rey did a great job as always. Carried the new franchise imo. She had a bit of a Frozen II scene were she dived over the water to reach the ship, after seeing a vision of her backstabbing grandfather from touching a relic. And Finn was Anna, screaming and chasing after her. That's Disney for you. "
"Feb 3, 2020",negative,"It lacks of coherence, like justice league or BvS  Is just scenes put together. The middle has great ideas that don't pay off. And the end is just ... Dragon Ball Z."
"Feb 3, 2020",positive,"The movie was pretty good. Wasnt Empire Strikes Back but not nearly as bad as The Last Jedi. With what little ground JJ Abrams was able to work with after The Last Jedi, he did great. Some things were beyond my Star Wars knowledge. But overall it was a very decent galactic adventure!"
"Feb 3, 2020",negative,"Unoriginal and unimaginative. The plot was so awkwardly put together that it ended up being a jumbled mess of plot-holes and irrelevancies.

And this is not to mention the thoughtlessness of bringing back Palpatine. Doing this completely undermines the moral and achievements of Episode VI. There were plenty of things they could have done without having to hurt Luke's story. Why not bring a villain from the comics into the mix? How hard could it have been?

Shockingly bad Star Wars film. Right on par with Episodes VII and VIII. It was an awful ending to an awful trilogy. Good riddance!"
"Feb 3, 2020",positive,A great ending to the saga! Lots of action and appearances from most of the characters from the other movies.
"Feb 3, 2020",positive,"I know the film got a lot of bad press, I understand what the fans didn't like. On the same token, I watch the Star Wars films for the visual beauty, the inspiration, and the foundation of what the films are based on. So, I'm a fan and the film was beautifully done."
"Feb 3, 2020",positive,I love movies and I love it all
"Feb 3, 2020",positive,It was the best one of all the Star Wars movies!!!
"Feb 3, 2020",positive,Really liked it this was one of the best of the nine.
"Feb 3, 2020",positive,Great special effects! Loved the entire movie! Great ending! Love how they add old elements/ props characters from all the old Star Wars movies!
"Feb 3, 2020",negative,If it wasnt part of the Star Wars universe and didnt have gaping plotholes then it would have gotten a 3 but it is supposed to be part of the Star Wars universe and that lowers the score
"Feb 3, 2020",positive,"Star Wars was exactly what it needed to be.  I saw episode IV when I was 13, and nothing will beat that.  This was a good final episode though."
"Feb 3, 2020",positive,one of the best Star Wars Movies
"Feb 3, 2020",positive,Like coming home to family. Good closure. CGI was great.  Story was....same old stuff with a few new twists.
"Feb 3, 2020",positive,Loved it!   Loved the themes and lessons and pretty much everything.  If you’re a Star Wars can you must see this !
"Feb 3, 2020",negative,"Music was great some visuals that were also great. But story line, writing, acting..all feel flat. I couldn't decide if it was bad acting or bad writing.  I found myself laughing at moments that were supposed to be momentous and groaning at the awful lines that were supposed to be humorous. So much made no sense at all.  I had avoided going for a while but got invited to go with friends just to pass the time. Verged on walking out. Just a mess."
"Feb 3, 2020",negative,What the actual f*** even.
"Feb 3, 2020",negative,This was a mess. A terrible ending to the Skywalker saga. I wish I could unsee it.
"Feb 3, 2020",positive,The best of the lot.
"Feb 3, 2020",positive,My family really enjoyed the movie.
"Feb 3, 2020",positive,"So good! I liked they finished it very well. No complaints on the production, story and acting. All was top notch! Disney did it again!"
"Feb 3, 2020",positive,"Loved by my eight year old, but men it was long."
"Feb 2, 2020",positive,"I love Star Wars, and I liked it a lot, but it rushed to wrap-up way too many timelines."
"Feb 2, 2020",negative,"About what I expected.  Silly at times.  The villians were much more interesting than the heroes. Good to see Leia, Han, Lando and Luke one last time."
"Feb 2, 2020",positive,Right where it left off...awesome!
"Feb 2, 2020",positive,I really loved the ending. It was emotional and heartfelt.
"Feb 2, 2020",positive,I applaud JJ and crew for making a satisfying conclusion to the Skywalker Saga. I will definitely rewatch this on Disney+.
"Feb 2, 2020",positive,Been a Star Wars fan since the first episode hit the theaters. This episode was epic and tied the whole saga together. Thanks so much 
"Feb 2, 2020",positive,You just have to love the whole darn series and this was a perfect last episode!
"Feb 2, 2020",negative,"How to undo any accomplishments of the original cast in a rushed, convoluted mess."
"Feb 2, 2020",positive,Maybe One Of The Best Movies Of The Saga !
"Feb 2, 2020",negative,"I'll be honest - I had absolutely no idea what was happening throughout the movie. Potential plot ideas were never explored, characters came and went without much explanation and, in the end, it clumped together to form a not-so-memorable movie. If you're interested in the plot, you can probably find a summary of it somewhere. Not worth the time to watch through what was essentially 90% filler."
"Feb 2, 2020",positive,"The final isn't the better, but the spevial effects l, the story and the music was good enough."
"Feb 2, 2020",positive,It was ok...I just wished Carrie Fisher well... you know
"Feb 2, 2020",positive,"It was a fitting ending to an epic story. I was sad to see it end. But I was not disappointed, at all."
"Feb 2, 2020",positive,Would have edited the horses riding on the spacecraft....didn’t need that part
"Feb 2, 2020",negative,Theo whole character development of Rey and Kylo was just utter crap.
"Feb 2, 2020",positive,It tied a lot of the storyline together and gave me some twists I did not expect.
"Feb 2, 2020",positive,A great way to end the iconic trilogy. Now Disney can work on original Star Wars content. 
"Feb 2, 2020",positive,it was f..k great...
"Feb 2, 2020",positive,"I’m definitely a Star Wars fan, and this was a solid conclusion to the Skywalker arc. However, I thought it lacked the charisma and energy of most of the other films. It seemed too dark and trite near the final battle. Glad I saw it, just wanted to come away a bit more exciting by it."
"Feb 2, 2020",negative,"I will probably never watch it again, which is sad considering its a Star Wars movie. How is it that the writers for Disney dont know about the fact that without tragedy, you dont have a very good drama???? How is it that writers employed by a huge company like Disney dont understand that war movies require tragedy for their drama to be effective??? 

It is sad that a 40+ year series ends in such an anticlimactic fashion, without the level of drama it deserved?  Bottom line is that a lot of characters should have died and STAYED dead for the EPIC level of tragedy and drama the series demanded. In fact, some characters should have DIED and STAYED DEAD the previous movie. NO LOSS = NO TRAGEDY = NO DRAMATIC VALUE = A DUD OF A PLOT"
"Feb 2, 2020",positive,"Rise Of Skywalker may not have much to offer up character-wise, but between the great effects, fair amount of heart, and full service to the films before it, Rise of Skywalker is enjoyable and far from the worst way to finish off the Skywalker saga."
"Feb 2, 2020",positive,"Surprising, I liked the movie! Unlike a lot of Starwars movies, it felt like it had an actual end instead of leaving you hanging. I loved how the original characters all showed up and cinematography was impressive."
"Feb 2, 2020",positive,Sad to see this saga end but loved every minute of it!
"Feb 2, 2020",negative,Worst Star Wars of fancies. 
"Feb 2, 2020",positive,Very enjoyable. Good pacing and a fun adventure. If you like Star Wars you'll have a good time with this one.
"Feb 2, 2020",positive,Great way to end the story line!!
"Feb 2, 2020",positive,It was ok.  It answered most questions.  They dragged it out a little.
"Feb 2, 2020",positive,"Amazing, JJ did a good job"
"Feb 2, 2020",positive,My wife and Is favorite Star Wars movie to date!
"Feb 2, 2020",positive,"Visually the movie is everything you want it to be. The vastness off space, the variations of different worlds, etc. The acting was good, however, the movie was a bit to predictable. You really have to suspend belief to enjoy movies these days."
"Feb 2, 2020",negative,"Terrible.  A zillion plot points with zero motivation for any characters.  Doesn't even feel like a movie, feels a story a 4 year would tell:  ""And then, and then, and then, and then..."""
"Feb 2, 2020",positive,I feel like I expressed a little more of the movie
"Feb 2, 2020",neutral,Couldn't quite recover from the disaster of the Last Jedi. They did what they could to repair the franchise but even bringing back Sheev wasn't enough
"Feb 2, 2020",positive,I hate movie critics.
"Feb 2, 2020",positive,The whole movie was great everything about it
"Feb 2, 2020",positive,Delete this..........
"Feb 2, 2020",neutral,It felt like the same plot all over again
"Feb 2, 2020",positive,This movie really tied all episodes together well. Wish the ending wasn't like it was but necessary. There was a lot of action and battle sequences that was very entertaining. The Skywalker saga will never die but be calm for a long time. liked the voices from the past. Their actual voices.
"Feb 2, 2020",positive,Like everything about it
"Feb 2, 2020",positive,i loved it. didn't see any trailers or pictures and went to watch it blind. and i loved it so much. i'm not hooked on the first trilogy so i didn't pay attention to what the fans hated in it.
"Feb 2, 2020",positive,entertaining even if storyline is cobbled together for new trilogy
"Feb 2, 2020",positive,"J.J. Abrams should have had the entire trilogy. The ""problems"" people had with this film was the result of J.J. correcting the awful mess the Ryan Johnson left. Johnson was given a perfect canvas to create something amazing, but instead (like an inexperienced child) he demolished everything, trying to make it his own. The Rise of Skywalker is fun, exiting and heartwarming! Everything J.J. Does best! The fact the he feels that he failed with this film is tragic. This was a fun Star Wars film!"
"Feb 2, 2020",positive,Perfect ending to a classic
"Feb 2, 2020",negative,"Let's just forget this happened and let people that make stories such as KOTOR , SWTOR and many other interesting ones, make the star wars universe ...."
"Feb 2, 2020",negative,"One star for some entertaining parts. Other than that, I basically spent the movie with ""wtf"" hanging around the back of my head. As a film, it want the greatest piece of work. Music was overbearing in some scenes, the story felt rushed most of the way, the plot was... I dunno, forced? Apparently there was no time for character development. Overall, it felt recycled, callbacks up the ass, recycled quotes from previous star wars films, special guest appearances by old cast members with roles that really weren't necessary... 
Spoiler warning! 
As a Star wars film, it was frustrating to deal with. I understand they went with the path that would please the most fans... But how about some originality? Maybe a story that didn't have to rely on the ""good vs evil"" trope since the ultimate evil had already been killed in the previous film... Oh, but wait a zombie sith Lord can now drain life force and create force lightning powerful enough to take down entire fleets! And also teleporting objects is a force power, now... But I guess that one was already implied in the previous film. Oh, by the way, this reanimated evil guy has an entire fleet of planet killers, more dangerous than ever before, with a massive crew/army that he somehow had access to. No explanation of why he didn't use it before... When he was emperor of the universe... But anyway, they can't navigate themselves out of a planet, but apparently all the rebels can easily guide themselves there... And the fleet gets taken down pretty quickly - only one had made it out and used it's laser to show it's destructive power.  
Is it a love story? Well, some lesbian kissing happens in the background but that's about as lovely as it gets. Well, my bad, there's another kissing scene, but it's uhh... I guess it probably got an emotional response from at least one person that saw it. The point is, friendship. None of the heroes ride off into the sunset with anybody to bang, but they have friendship. 
Also, force ghosts have force powers, but they waited until this movie to do anything with it, apparently. And why reduce the asian chicks role so hard? Did they really have to listen to the few fans that were triggered by seeing an intimate moment between people of two different races from the last film? Godamm it really felt like these writers/producers/directors were too scared to make something original. Please the fans. 

The only noteworthy parts - 1. c3po having a moment of artificial intelligence, feeling somber. 2. The hacker that rewired c3po's brain was cool, and it was funny/cheesy when he reappears at the end... (But why bring him to a space battle?) 3.... Something about the music festival scene felt original... Unnecessary, but original, nonetheless.
4(ish). Even though Palatine questionably brought back into it, it's still cool to hear him say ""do it"". 

But yeah, the film sucked. You can sleep through the first 45 minutes and it'll still make just as much sense. I bet if they removed the first 45 minutes, more people would actually have better things to say."
"Feb 2, 2020",positive,"I really enjoyed this film. Palpatine's return was excellent, but I wanted to see more of him and more about his relationship with Rey and his son. Special effects were great, as usual, and the characters actually had matured, especially Kylo Ren. The story could have been better and the ultra-fast passing could have slowed down, and let the characters develop more. This movie has deleted ""The Last Jedi""--GOOD. As far as the critics not liking TROS, they hold no credibility with me after how they gushed all over ""The Last Jedi"". That was a P.O.S. movie.

     If you didn't like this sequel, what did you expect after is was announce JJ Abrams would be writing and directing the first movie? That guy is an A list, second-rate writer. A good writer should have been chosen and a good director helm the film, and Lawrence Kasdan should never have co-written ""The Force Awakens"". He is another A list, second rate writer. The best thing he has written was ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" which was great, but his Star Wars record is not so great. He was co-writer of the ""The Empire Strikes Back"" only because the first writer (the good one) died."
"Feb 2, 2020",positive,"A really fun movie with great action and good humor. Ian Mcdiarmid once again does an excellent job as Palpatine, and the rest of the cast is also great. Rey is a lot more likeable in this movie and it's a good conclusion to the star wars saga"
"Feb 2, 2020",negative,The worst Star Wars movie ever.
"Feb 2, 2020",negative,"Non sqeuotorial writing and strobe lights were used equally in this pointless movie. This franchise has been through a lot, and I am in no way a purest to the series. But this movie, was bland starwars tropes, and bland Disney tropes competing for screen time. It was like eating a mouth full of plain white flour. You know what is in your mouth, and it isn't dangerous, but it is unpleasent nevertheless."
"Feb 2, 2020",positive,It fast pace good fun and pretty entertaining just don't think about to much
"Feb 2, 2020",neutral,"Great special effects as always. Story line is getting stale. This one had more angry, determined characters with less humor than some in the series. Ok for passing the time, but yeah, it's time to move on."
"Feb 2, 2020",positive,"Great music and production per usual. The movie was 2.5 hrs long, and still managed to feel rushed! It was so jam packed with action and jump cuts that at times it felt disjointed."
"Feb 2, 2020",positive,Great ending to an amazing story.
"Feb 2, 2020",negative,"The storyline, the acting, all aspects of the movie were either very disappointing or just bad. The only bright spot was Harrison Ford's appearance."
"Feb 2, 2020",positive,Very well done and a great ending to this chapter.
"Feb 2, 2020",positive,should have made a part one and part two fillm. too soon for Emperor Palpatine to die including the Admiral.
"Feb 2, 2020",positive,The action the previous actors from star wars in this one as well as the creators
"Feb 2, 2020",positive,"Amazing, no words to describe. Such an amazing plot, the thing is, its highly accurate with the books as well, they really did their research."
"Feb 2, 2020",negative,"just goes to show if you haven't got an destination you can't have an ending"" terrible 'disney' really terrible trilogy!!"
"Feb 2, 2020",positive,Loved every second of it. The Resistance lives!
"Feb 2, 2020",positive,Great end to the saga
"Feb 2, 2020",positive,Enjoyable end to the franchise but a missed opportunity for it to be amazing. The story took a few pointless turns that didn't pay off in the end.
"Feb 2, 2020",positive,"Good movie, although I deeply disliked  the ending given to the narrative arcs of Rey and Ben Solo. The unpleasant  of this ending, hopeless and incoherent with all the mythological background of Star Wars, made me observe the narrative holes of the  argument, and detract value from the visual beauty and musical spectacularity that the film has. Rey must have  always been an important bridge for Ben Solo to win the battle and successfully conclude the hero's path, regaining his honor and that of his family in front of the  community. Rey should never have been named himself Skywalker. The romantic situation of the ending was correct."
"Feb 2, 2020",positive,"One of my favorite movies, watch all Star Wars before watching this one !!"
"Feb 2, 2020",negative,Not really any story.  A lot of running about in chases.  Had a hard time staying awake.  It got very confusing. Was a recall of old the old characters from the other installments.  Lots of dead folks reviving.  They did work in the Ewoks who didn't seem to do anything. Waste of time.
"Feb 2, 2020",positive,it tied up the Skywalker saga and left you satisfied!!
"Feb 2, 2020",negative,Someone edited this thing to death. Poor writing. Won’t watch it again. I love Star Wars but this movie just made me angry. 
"Feb 2, 2020",positive,A fitting end to original saga.
"Feb 2, 2020",negative,Could it have been better? Yes. Did some parts feel a little slapped together? A lot of 7-9 did. But IX was fun. I enjoyed watching it and what they tried to do with it. My kids enjoyed it a lot too.
"Feb 2, 2020",positive,Great finale to the series. Brought the feels out. Worth the wait. Definitely worth seeing again and again. M
"Feb 2, 2020",positive,I thought overall it was a good movie and appreciated that it had an ending that left you feeling good. I wished that some of the characters  arcs had been widened and given them more meaningful connection but I think it wrapped up nicely while still leaving opening for future movies.
"Feb 2, 2020",positive,"This was the perfect ending to a saga spanning 9 movies.  Non stop action, delicate handling of the characters and it gave me all the feels!  If you are a Star Wars fan or just a fan of movies, go and see Rise of Skywalker today!"
"Feb 2, 2020",positive,"The last two movies had to much drama and very little action, but this one had very little drama and more action.  Seems like Disney can't find a happy medium when it comes to star wars.  Some parts were very predictable and I felt like I 
 was in slow monition waiting for it to happen.  I'm so happy that Kylo Ren wasn't as winy as in the first two movies.  But who could blame him.  He had two mentors that didn't seem to do anything to help him develop.  I really felt Disney could have brought so much more to his character.  The action seen's were so long you almost forgot what they were doing.  They determined who Rey's family stems from but it still didn't make sense to me.  Without giving away details I won't go into it.  So I'm giving this movie a 3.5 because as far as the mythology goes in Star Wars I feel like Disney still didn't hit the mark."
"Feb 2, 2020",neutral,"*Spoilers*

It's a good movie in terms of the acting and VFX, fight scenes, all that jazz. My problem is with the plot, and the pacing. 
You barely get a chance to process some of the information - early on there's a scene where a character may or may not be dead, but within a minute, we know the fate of that character.. 
add to that problems such as Palpatine somehow secretly building a million star destroyers all with mini Death Star lasers on them (piloted by who? According to my searches they typically need 40000 crew), the lack of clarity on what a Diad is, and how all the civilian ships managed to just warp in all at once despite Rey and Kylo being shown to have a tough time going through that red nebula.. (Basically Star Wars does Dunkirk) 

It's ok. As a movie to enjoy for its visual value it's good, but as the conclusion to a 9 part saga, I was hoping for better. 

I personally prefer prequels to this sequel trilogy, purely because there's a coherent direction it's going in. 
Ep IX just throws the emperor back in as a desperate attempt to salvage this trilogy after Snoke snuffed it in TLJ"
"Feb 2, 2020",positive,Movie was good. I think the ghost of Darth should have showed up like Luke’s. Ghost. It was kind of freaky seeing Carrie Fisher. 🤨
"Feb 2, 2020",positive,I Thought it was really as good as all of the the others.
"Feb 2, 2020",positive,The movie was the best I’ve seen so far
"Feb 2, 2020",positive,"Glad it was the last one, not as good as previous ones & it got rather long & boring."
"Feb 2, 2020",positive,Action..story ending.
"Feb 2, 2020",positive,Loved this movie!! It was a beautiful end to a long story.
"Feb 2, 2020",positive,"The cheese quotient was absurdly high, but that’s always been true of Star Wars, so it shouldn’t be a disappointment to a real fan."
"Feb 2, 2020",positive,loved the storyline and how they brought the old and the new together.
"Feb 1, 2020",positive,Nice finish to the final trilogy
"Feb 1, 2020",negative,Lots of unanswered questions and the CG made everything seem so phony and fake. This beloved classic certainly went downhill and even JJ Abrahams couldn't redeem it.
"Feb 1, 2020",positive,"As a Fan you want to see how it all comes to conclusion  , however the movie does not give you closure or a fell that one has when they see s conclusion to a Series... 

Overall watching the move was not a disaster but we could have let go of some cliches of the kiss and sacrifice."
"Feb 1, 2020",positive,Good “ending” for the Starwars franchise.   The plot doesn’t hang well with the earlier movies.  But otherwise it is a good action film with plenty of Easter eggs from the original.
"Feb 1, 2020",neutral,"Positives: Visual Effects and score

Negatives: Acting, script, plot and relies on nostalgia from previous installments"
"Feb 1, 2020",positive,It’s not the same Star Wars I grew up with but even yet the story line was good and the action and cgi where great .
"Feb 1, 2020",positive,It was a good conclusion to the Skywalker story. A definite improvement from the previous film. Hopefully we will see films in the expanded Star Wars Universe
"Feb 1, 2020",positive,thought it was a good easy to end the story. it was a bit cheesy at times
"Feb 1, 2020",positive,"Just fun escapism, nothing complicated.  Good times!"
"Feb 1, 2020",positive,I enjoyed this movie more than the first two. I'm looking forward to seeing what Disney does next.
"Feb 1, 2020",positive,awesome can't wait for next one
"Feb 1, 2020",positive,Super production and super story
"Feb 1, 2020",positive,Loved it even more the second time!
"Feb 1, 2020",positive,"Very busy, better the second time."
"Feb 1, 2020",negative,"The final movie in the franchise was very disappointing, it has a really unsatisfying ending. I don't think that this movies failure is due to Abrams, I believe this movies failure really comes from the last Jedi. The Last Jedi ruined the franchise, there was a clear plan but that was thrown away by Johnsons terrible film. Buy the end of the film, I cried of only disappointment."
"Feb 1, 2020",positive,"'Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker' finishes off the sequel trilogy of the Disney Star Wars franchise, in this finale, Emperor Palpatine returns and the resistance have to take down the Emperor and the final order.

Written by Chris Terrio and J.J Abrams, the plot for this film is nothing short of a shambles. Emperor Palpatine returns with no explanation to how he came back from the dead, a certain moment that is supposed to be a surprise is seen from a mile away, no major risks are taken, or consequences received, on the side of the protagonists, in attempting to take down the biggest ever sith power the galaxy has seen. The characters are overwhelmingly under written, so despite however much the actor tries, the audience just don't care for the characters. Rey seems to have incredible force powers, seeming to be more powerful than some of the most experienced Jedi, like Mace Windu, yet the audience have no idea how this is possible, as she is incredibly under trained. Kylo Ren's arc was terribly set up throughout this trilogy and his decisions are never taken seriously by the audience as he has always been a very wish washy character.

Directed by J.J Abrams, shot by Dan Mindel and edited by Maryann Brandon & Stefan Grube, the uses of shot selection and transitions between different scenes were all executed really well, with there being some really great shots of landscapes that are drawn out, which allows the audience to take in the picture in the frame. Despite this general solid direction, Abrams missed many markers on comedic moments, especially within the first act, which would've brought the act to life more, and have the audience more invested due to the faster pacing.

John Williams is the one constant over the nine episodic films of the Star Wars saga, that has never let the film down. He has an excellent ear as for what instruments should be playing, what they should be playing, use of dynamics and more, to enhance (or in the case of this film, create) the atmospheres within the scenes.

The acting in this film is very mediocre. Given that the characters are underwritten, the actors do very little with the characters they have, to tell the story, of what little there is, their characters have to tell. Adam Driver (Kylo Ren), Daisy Ridley (Rey) and John Boyega (Finn) all do very little with the dialogue they're given to create a dynamic character the audience can connect with, and although he has a smaller role, the same can be said of Oscar Isaac (Poe Dameron). All the veterans within this cast show the main protagonists how to portray an interesting character, Mark Hamill (Luke Skywalker) though having little screen time, does a good job. Ian McDiarmid (Emperor Palpatine) once again does a sublime job at portraying the most evil and sinister person in the galaxy, and Richard E. Grant (General Pryde) also does a great job of creating an antagonist the audience take seriously.

This film had promising elements within it, but a lack of vision over the whole trilogy by the producers, meant that the film was always fighting a losing battle, in trying to cap off the most iconic cinematic franchise of all time."
"Feb 1, 2020",negative,"Doesn't have that star wars feel, just another mass produced crowd pleaser and not really for long term fans"
"Feb 1, 2020",positive,Another amazing Star Wars masterpiece!
"Feb 1, 2020",neutral,I think the last jedi is an truly masterpiece in writing than this unnecesary fan-service bufet of the franchise
"Feb 1, 2020",positive,Classic Star Wars action! Previous actors from earlier moves were good to see again. Star Wars will endure forever!
"Feb 1, 2020",positive,it was good but it felt a little long which usually means it was
"Feb 1, 2020",positive,Great movie. Don't listen to the critics
"Feb 1, 2020",positive,"It was a good movie and it helped bring the saga from the disaster of last Jedi.
Really like the connection of kylo and rey.
It will look good No MATTER what because of the money involved. But the story was .moving and enjoyable. Thought the kiss of kylo and rey wasnt too needed bit it wasn't too bad."
"Feb 1, 2020",positive,You can only stretch out a good thing so far.
"Feb 1, 2020",positive,If you didn’t like this movie your kind of a hater just to be a hater. I don’t know what people expected but they did good with the material it had. 
"Feb 1, 2020",negative,Terrible movie! Worst directed star was yet!
"Feb 1, 2020",negative,Too many contradictions and contrivances.
"Feb 1, 2020",negative,"What a sad mess. Lets throw in anything familiar to try to tug at heart strings. Lets throw in the most star destroyers ever! Fuck it, lets equip all of them with a planet killing weapon! Then lets make then all dependent on 1 tower! The bad guy built them all by himself?  Pure garbage. Good riddance to the worst trilogy ever of the most valuable franchise in the world! People waited decades and this is what Disney gave them? What a joke..."
"Feb 1, 2020",negative,THIS WAS THE WORST OF THE 9 STAR WARS MOVIES! THE SCRIPT AND STORY WERE HORRIBLE! DISNEY AND JJ ABRAMS HAVE TRASHED THE STAR WARS FRANCHISE! BRING BACK GEORGE LUCAS- PLEASE!!!!!
"Feb 1, 2020",positive,"okay, but nothing new"
"Feb 1, 2020",positive,great characters that you want to route for or route against
"Feb 1, 2020",positive,Lovely finish to the Skywalker saga.
"Feb 1, 2020",positive,Like all Star Wars movie it was a cartoon brought to life.  I could have done without the obligatory everybody congratulating everybody scene at the end.  But for a “check your brain at the door” movie it kept me interested .  I liked it.
"Feb 1, 2020",negative,"same plot lines regurgitated from other movies. Rey was terrible again, Fin was only okay, and Ben was the only good actor.  Would not receive rushing to theaters, just wait for dvd."
"Feb 1, 2020",negative,"So bad, so camp, so boring"
"Feb 1, 2020",negative,After watching this trash I wish I could force ghost out of existence
"Feb 1, 2020",negative,"Horrendously edited, weird pacing and random useless plot twists that had zero reason to be placed in. Absolutely no setup made within this movie or throughout the entire trilogy had a proper pay off. The movie was pure fan service to try and distract from the lack of plan Disney had all along. Not to mention - Palpatine's return was the dumbest thing ever done in cinema history. It was not adequately explained within this movie or any points prior to the movie and it robs from the impact of the original trilogy's ending."
"Feb 1, 2020",positive,Way more entertaining than TLJ.  Great special effects as always.  Thank you JJ for a valiant attempt at saving the Star Wars franchise.
"Feb 1, 2020",negative,"A product of two creatives, known for their terrible writing, being put in charge of the final piece of one of the most legendary sagas in all of movie history. A story making almost no sense from start to finish, terrible pacing and editing, worse performances from all of the actors, and a terrible, almost depressing end to what should be a mystical and fun sc-fi fantasy adventure. Mental note, don't ever make a movie trying to please everyone, for you will please no-one."
"Feb 1, 2020",positive,"Of course I have a few criticisms, but as someone who's been a Star Wars fan since the mid 90s, this is one of my favorites."
"Feb 1, 2020",positive,"Nice storyline, awesome scenes and set but could have been a bit more catching in general"
"Feb 1, 2020",positive,"Great action and suspense, not to mention a couple of unexpected outcomes and appearances, making for an interesting conclusion, but...there seems to be a familiar feel to the plot and characters' circumstances.  Many scenes seem somewhat repetitive of those from 4, 5, and 6.  Otherwise, the movie provided 2.5 hours of fun and distraction."
"Feb 1, 2020",negative,"sloppy writing. the story arch was a huge let down. without spoiling anything, was Fin ever going to tell her the thing? I could go on for hours on how the ending was just a huge pile of hot gahbage"
"Feb 1, 2020",positive,Loved it! Star Wars started when I was a kid and I haven’t loved any of its episodes more than the first and now The Rise of Skywalker. What an awesome ending to an amazing story.
"Feb 1, 2020",positive,"Powerfully acted, plenty of action and a satisfying conclusion, if not for some questionable writing at times"
"Feb 1, 2020",positive,"Definitely best of ST, and it’s even my favorite movie of all time! Rey and Kylo are each perfect and their character arcs are deep and there are still audience subversions and surprises"
"Feb 1, 2020",negative,"Didn't feel like a star wars movie.  So many plot holes, so much stupid stuff crammed in for no real reason.  The only good spot was how they handled Leia's final moments.  Rey's growth into a Jedi was barely touched on.  Fin had no character development.  Palpatine back from the dead?  Really? Really?  Jet packs on storm troopers, just to justify one joke?  This is what you get when you don't involve or even consult with the guy that created the entire Star Wars universe.  Wish I could get my 15 bucks and 2 1/2 hours back, directy from JJ Abrams.."
"Feb 1, 2020",positive,"It was a good great movie. Not a great great movie, but a good great movie."
"Feb 1, 2020",positive,The movie was awesome
"Feb 1, 2020",positive,"Rey played an exceptional role, grand daughter of a sith she showed the world that no matter your genes your journey through life dictates your future!"
"Feb 1, 2020",negative,Monumental lack of imagination. Unworthy end for the saga. Just another Disneylike trash.
"Feb 1, 2020",positive,"I'd love to give Rise of Skywalker 5 stars, but can't. As much as I love Star Wars and the continuation of the series (this is episode 9?) I think it's time to move on. I loved everything about this movie, how it followed the canon, the action, twists and turns, and the ending...! Couldn't have been more classic Star Wars. However, the saga in this iteration is showing its age. The never ending theme of good vs. evil, light vs. dark will always be around, so you can't really completely kill the Darkside any more than you can the Lightside. So, I dont know of this was truly the last installment of the series, but they need to do something special for the next one. Come on Disney, flex your creative muscles and give us some Episode X goodness!"
"Feb 1, 2020",positive,"Great, felt like a true Star War saga."
"Feb 1, 2020",positive,loved the story and the action
"Feb 1, 2020",neutral,Full of fanservice like Avengers: Endgame but in the wrong way. It has a mix of things that feel kinda rushed. Somehow it manages to entertain but with a clear loss of the SW spirit.
"Feb 1, 2020",positive,"A tad too much suspension of disbelief for a Star Wars movie.  Also, who was blowing up in those Star Destroyers.  Was it a bunch of green conscripts?  These things only quashed my enjoyment slightly. I have never met a Star Wars movie I didn’t like."
"Feb 1, 2020",positive,Great movie. Had some plot issues but lots of fun fan service that left my jaw dropped multiple times. Not a perfect movie but I'm so happy with it.
"Feb 1, 2020",positive,"It maintained the story line, was very well cast and acted,  and came full cycle, back to the Skywalker home! Great movie, and we saw the first when it opened!"
"Feb 1, 2020",positive,A great end to the Star Wars saga.
"Feb 1, 2020",positive,A non stop action was amazing I like how they brought characters from the original 3 series back including Wedge Antilles and lando calrissian.
"Feb 1, 2020",positive,Great movie and ending to an epic story. 
"Jan 31, 2020",positive,"It's okay, good escapism,  but they could have edited out 20 minutes at least. I could pic and nic at it, but lol I'll let it go and we now move on!"
"Jan 31, 2020",positive,Pretty good even if predictable
"Jan 31, 2020",positive,completely surprised how amazing this movie was after seeing all of the Star Wars movies from my early childhood. True to the anticipation and awe and character development from the older originals. its very difficult to be awed with all of the modern movie tech abilities.
"Jan 31, 2020",positive,I thought it’s was good
"Jan 31, 2020",negative,Abrams screws up again!
"Jan 31, 2020",positive,Glad Ray didnt turn to the dark side!! Shocked by the kiss at end of movie!!
"Jan 31, 2020",positive,I was disappointed by many parts of the movie.
"Jan 31, 2020",negative,"horrible movie, it's just random fan service that completely ignores the previous episode"
"Jan 31, 2020",positive,Over loved it. Good conclusion.  Definitely catered to the fans more than genuine storytelling at times.
"Jan 31, 2020",positive,Pretty good movie in the SE franchise.
"Jan 31, 2020",negative,"As far as star wars goes, it is mediocre.  It doesn't have the charm of the force awakens, and it doesn't have the artistic direction of the Last Jedi.  While I thoroughly dislike the last jedi, this is just worse."
"Jan 31, 2020",negative,"Easily my least favorite movie of the sequel trilogy. The first 45 minutes of the movie consisted of some of the worst editing I've ever seen, while the rest of the movie tried to undo what Rian Johnson did in The Last Jedi."
"Jan 31, 2020",neutral,sometimes it benefits you to let a scene breathe... this movie is so fast paced it left me with a headache and too many questions. action is nice but I wish I waited for video on this one. 
"Jan 31, 2020",positive,"Thought it was a Great ending to the Trilogy... 
Was Great to see All the original characters back one last time... But, sad for the loss of ""Our Princess"".....  R.I.P. Carrie Fisher you are Missed...."
"Jan 31, 2020",positive,Interesting to see how the usual suspects trash a movie that's basically accomplished the impossible: complete the most important and relevant movie saga ever. Both main actors play superbly their roles stressing powerful ness and female independence. Enjoyed it from beginning to end.
"Jan 31, 2020",negative,"It starts at a 9 and stays there. There is very little transition from one hectic plot-point to the next and you're given no time to explore all of the new characters and planets as you're being dragged across the galaxy. 

J.J. tries to pull at your heart strings by playing on emotional ties that the characters are supposed to have, but it's confusing as to what exactly those emotional ties are as throughout the trilogy, we haven't had much time to explore and develop these elements which causes some scenes to feel artificial and confusing.

Ideas are recycled and they've taken very few creative risks with this film, attempting to remake aspects of a film that accomplished it much better.

Overall, it's a frantic story designed to push the viewer along as fast as possible before you have time to think why many of these things don't make any sense within the context of the Star Wars Universe. It attempts to emotionally involve the viewer and then immediately back-pedals with an ""Eyyy! We gotcha!"" moments several times which renders anything that anyone does meaningless. There's nothing at stake, no points of any real contention, and never a moment where you feel that our protagonists won't triumph.

It's an altogether safe and very bland movie attempting to vomit as much as it can at the viewer in hopes of obscuring it's nature."
"Jan 31, 2020",positive,it was  awesome I loved it was not rushed and had a good flow 😁👍🏾👍🏾
"Jan 31, 2020",positive,Funny and action packed!!
"Jan 31, 2020",positive,"J.J. Abrams somewhat ""corrected"" the trajectory of the Star Wars Universe. Undid some choices made in The Last Jedi, but nothing drastic enough to pull you out of the movie. It's unfortunate that the films in this trilogy contradict each other as opposed to working together to tell a cohesive story."
"Jan 31, 2020",negative,"Total disgrace to whole series. It became a cash cow for Disney, such a waste and shame to its own foundation of SW series. Probably it will get even worse till Disney gets back the investment and make enormous profits..."
"Jan 31, 2020",negative,"No flow. No need for Palpatine. Way too chaotic, dull-colored, and fast paced."
"Jan 31, 2020",positive,"It doesnt reinvent the series or the genre, but its a great closing chapter. The emotional content felt real and the performances were worthy of all thats led up to it. Funny in the right places and serious when it needs to be, without getting too over-the-top. For all they needed to close out, Im pretty thrilled with how they managed it. Go into It like a kid seeing Star Wars for the first time, and you may find that you like this movie a lot more than some critics did."
"Jan 31, 2020",positive,Best Star Wars film to date!
"Jan 31, 2020",positive,Good film just disappointed by the end
"Jan 31, 2020",positive,I felt it was a tribute to long time Star Wars fans
"Jan 31, 2020",negative,The biggest poop on sw franchise ever. Thx disney.
"Jan 31, 2020",positive,"For me a really good movie with a great changes until the end, but it's dificult to be with fans and critics at the same time"
"Jan 31, 2020",neutral,this movie was filled with so many plot holes that might make you confused through out the movie
"Jan 31, 2020",positive,"excellent example of big screen professional film making. engaging from first scene to last. i am not a star wars fanboy, so (unfortunately) there were a few scenes that i actually laughed out loud - and not because i was overjoyed. the breakdown for me is something like 25% children's movie, 25% video game, 50% great movie."
"Jan 31, 2020",negative,"A series of montages of characters been chase all around and a series of stupid decisions to move the plot forward, and fan service, cheap one, not even good fan service."
"Jan 31, 2020",positive,"We waited for the rush to die down and then went to see it in a theatre.
we totally enjoyed it....."
"Jan 31, 2020",positive,"I thought it wasn't going to be good because of the negative reviews, but it was so much better than episode VIII and did a good job at tying up loose ends of this trilogy.  It was a great movie and I'm glad I saw it."
"Jan 31, 2020",positive,Cool special effects. Epic lightsaber fights. Fun to watch
"Jan 31, 2020",negative,Terrible script.  Lots of plot convenience to fill in the numerous holes in the storyline.
"Jan 31, 2020",positive,"The movie was fun, but it did move very fast, and I feel that it needed to take its time and expand on some of the story beats."
"Jan 31, 2020",positive,"As a huge fan of the sequel trilogy, I couldnt be happier with this epic conclusion to the new trilogy. In my personal opinion, it also offers a fitting end to this beloved Skywalker Saga. 

The beginning part of the movie may be slow plot wise, but is chalked full of fun banter exciting chases, and character development. Fans of action may be bored, but those like me who have grown to love these new (and old!) characters will have fun throughout. 

The climax is epic and powerful, both stunt wise and emotionally. Its bittersweet, and leaves your heart aching...in a good way. Powerful tributes are paid to beloved characters and past movies that are satisfying in every way. This film is a joyous celebration of Starwars.

This film has only been out a little over a month, and already its quite controversial. Some love it. Others HATE it. 

Id say, if you are a fan of the sequel trilogy movies, (or just ALL of the movies) youll probably love this movie. 
This movie was NOT made for critics to rave over, it was instead made as a love letter to fans...while also trying to be separate for the casual movie goers.

 If you are watching this to pass the time, and you arent really a starwars fan, by all means, give it a try, but there are probably other (shorter) movies youd enjoy—and understand—better.

If you are a fan of the originals and (and/or the prequels) and didnt like The Force Awakens or The Last Jedi because they just arent what you would have written yourself, then Please, skip this one, as you probably wont like this one any better, and the last thing this movie—or all the wonderful cast and crew who worked so hard to please us and pay tribute to our beloved Starwars franchise—needs is more hate from fans who just want to see the Originals again. 

Conclusion? 

This movie is amazing. A joyful celebration of all things Starwars, worth several views. My new favorite movie. Youll love it.
But only if you have the right mindset for it. 

May the Force be with you. Always."
"Jan 31, 2020",positive,One of the best Star Wars
"Jan 31, 2020",positive,The story line was great.
"Jan 31, 2020",positive,"I really don't know how the ""true"" Star Wars fans think this is a good end for the saga. The story is rushed yet the movie feels really slow, is incoherent and even in some points contradict itself. The worst part is that Finn, Poe and the others new characters, even Kylo Ren, were wasted to leave the hole weight of the trilogy to Rey."
"Jan 31, 2020",positive,A great ending to the trilogy and impressive after having to reconstruct and save everything The Last Jedi destroyed. Imagine what the Trilogy could have been if Rian Johnson never got anywhere near it?....
"Jan 31, 2020",positive,"I like everything about it , it was a great movie and so much better then the last movie."
"Jan 31, 2020",neutral,"Better the TLJ
It just couldn't recover the damage done by Rian Johnson"
"Jan 31, 2020",positive,"I liked that it didnt have too many slow moments, but the story was a little convoluted, but since it was trying to fixed the damage the last one did, its understandable. Overall a good movie experience."
"Jan 31, 2020",positive,i think that it didn't work in conjunction with the last jedi
"Jan 31, 2020",positive,"This movie answered a lot of questions really well. There was a lot going on, but if you just enjoy the ride its a great flick. I guess there are a lot of Star Wars fans that cant be satisfied, but this one was."
"Jan 31, 2020",negative,So boring both of us passed out watching it
"Jan 30, 2020",positive,Really good movie..my kids and I really enjoyed it
"Jan 30, 2020",positive,After episode 8; it was as good as it can be.
"Jan 30, 2020",positive,The final chapter was long awaited and provides everything needed to end the triple trilogy. It wasn't the greatest film of the nine but essential to complete the story envisioned by George Lucas.
"Jan 30, 2020",negative,Once again the powers at Disney and Lucas Films has delivered a trifecta on how to destroy a much loved franchise. Just like the two previous movie's we have no imagination on continuing a great story we just get a story full of plot holes bigger enough to hide a death star in. The return of Palpatine WTF!! How lazy can they be?
"Jan 30, 2020",positive,liked the new actors and the returning actors fighting the evil forces.
"Jan 30, 2020",positive,Great movie and a lot of action.
"Jan 30, 2020",negative,"The movie was awful. There really wasn't much of an actual plot, and you can basically forget continuity (cannon). If I were you, I would not go and see it. It will ruin all the enjoyment from previous movies. It had a poor beginning and not much of an ending...more like the lights came on in the theatre. I felt robbed of my money and made a fool of for wasting my time. I thought Surf Nazis was bad...oh, I didn't realize how good I had it. Don't be fooled, it doesnt end the franchise on a high note...I am forced to give the movie a star...it deserves 4 black holes..."
"Jan 30, 2020",neutral,"I enjoyed it, but I didn’t like it at all — does that make sense?"
"Jan 30, 2020",negative,J.J. Abrams an Kathleen Kennedy ruined the Star Wars Universe. The Last Jedi and Rogue One were really good and Solo was underrated. The rest are pretty bad and just a retelling of the original of the original series with different characters. I wish Rian Johnson was in charge of the Star Wars franchise because his was the only good one out of the three that J.J started and finished.
"Jan 30, 2020",positive,"We really enjoyed the movie. We like the actors, the drama and the comedy in parts."
"Jan 30, 2020",negative,"I have seen TROS three times now and I simply cannot understand how some people like it. It is easily my 10th or 11th favorite Star Wars film. I thought Last Jedi was a pretty good movie, but TROS has so many illogical moments and poorly planned payoffs. The death of Ben Solo is unnecessary and rushed, not to mention he has no lines in the entire third act. It makes no sense why Rey would go to Tattoine in the final scene. The Palpatine stuff is a mess. Rey's lineage is a mess. Palpatine wants her dead the first half then suddenly wants her alive in the third act. Ren doesn't know that Rey is on his ship until the Vader mask travels through their force bond although she is holding the dagger from his ship during their entire battle. Finn is criminally underused, Rey and Poe still have little to no weaknesses or character. Rose is underused. Lando is great but also a bit underused. Babu Frik is cool though so that's nice! The last minute reshoots and corporate interference by Disney really hurt this film, but also, it should have been directed by Collin Treverrow not JJ Abrams who also made the below average Force Awakens. It's a shame a great saga had to end this way."
"Jan 30, 2020",negative,Totally sold all the characters arch short and was just super flat. Pretty mediocre and poorly constructed story line. A disappointment of epic proportions.
"Jan 30, 2020",positive,"I am a fan of the Star Wars series, since the first movie,  The characters and storyline were appealing.  It still had an assortment of kookie characters and robots.  I also liked how Han Solo and Lea were included in this movie.  This was a vital connection with the original series storyline.  I guess this is the end but I hope not."
"Jan 30, 2020",positive,Best one in the new trilogy
"Jan 30, 2020",negative,"""Sometimes I'll start a sentence, and I don't even know where it's going. I just hope I find it along the way."" - JJ Abrams, probably

Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is one of the most underwhelming movies I've seen in a while. The plot is strewn together via various coincidences and ""aha"" moments that are in no way earned. The reveal of Rey's grandfather is incredibly anti-climactic and feels thrown into the mix, especially since it's in direct conflict with the progress made by Rian Johnson in the previous film. Say what you will about TLJ, but the idea of the force being accessible to others is a magical development in the Star Wars universe.

In fact this movie retcons so much and delivers so much fan service that it's almost at fan fiction levels of cheesiness. The most ridiculous example of this is THE KISS. I would bump this review up a whole half star if Rey and Kylo Ren had hugged instead. Folks, two people do not spend three movies trying to kill each other and then make out hours after one of them decides to do some good. This is not Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley ending up together after 7 years of bickering, and more importantly, friendship. Not only does this kiss feel completely out of place, but it further complicates the unfinished plot line of Finn pining after Rey (another problematic aspect of the trilogy as a whole).

Before I move on to some positives, I'd also like to say that this film's treatment of Rose Tico is disrespectful at the least. Great job letting crazy fans bully you into submission, Disney!

I'd be amiss if I didn't praise Adam Driver's performance as Kylo Ren. Driver GOES THERE in this movie. I also thoroughly enjoyed the dueling/battle sequences and special effects, although there was nothing groundbreaking there."
"Jan 30, 2020",negative,"Boring 
too many effects 
story was mishmash until the end 
Director didnt do his job"
"Jan 30, 2020",negative,JJ is a good action director but can't write a coherent script and terribly misunderstands what made the original trilogy so enduring. The story moves at such a fast pace you don't have time to figure out that the scene prior doesn't make any sense. His attempt to ret-con the changes Rian Johnson made in The Last Jedi will be studied by film students for decades. These final moves are a disaster.
"Jan 30, 2020",negative,"A travesty. Disney / who ever is responsible should apologize to the artists and the fans for wasting their time and money. Nothing is earned. Way too many rules are broken with no setup. There's about 3 to 4 times too many ideas delivered too fast, making none of them stick with any meaning. Opportunities for some great mysterious reveals were wasted with no build up. Easily the worst Star Wars film to grace the theaters. It has some wonderful visuals but they're just thrown away on this film."
"Jan 30, 2020",positive,It has all the qualities that a good Star Wars movie should have.
"Jan 30, 2020",negative,"The total and complete lack of continuity and creative writing leads to a disappointing ending that does not fit in with the rest of the trilogy and even Star Wars as a series. 
The Rise of Skywalker even hits a similar conclusive beat that seemed to result in diminishing emotional returns which was mainly caused by the lack of dialogue and an unearned kiss. This also due to the butchering, or even dismembering, of Kylo Ren's character arc."
"Jan 30, 2020",negative,"Felt like watching an video game with constant pointless fetch quests, character inserts to sell merch and more. If you think this is good cinema then I think you probably just want a good video game. If you like movies, check out David Driver's other work, it's much better."
"Jan 30, 2020",positive,Special effects in action
"Jan 30, 2020",positive,"I enjoyed the movie very much. It was visually stunning, moved along rapidly, had adorable moments and was emotionally moving. Answered many questions about the saga in usual graphic novel/comic book way.  Its what I expected and what was given and I loved it."
"Jan 30, 2020",positive,It was a fun movie to enjoy with all ages  Lots of action and adventure
"Jan 30, 2020",positive,A satisfying conclusion to the Star Wars story. I loved it!
"Jan 30, 2020",negative,"The Star Wars universe was created a long time ago (in a galaxy far far away) with general rules on how things work in the universe, yet the director throws that all away.  Terrible character development, terrible plot development, just a pathetic effort to try and appease fans"
"Jan 30, 2020",positive,It was good because it was Star Wars
"Jan 30, 2020",negative,Хочу про эту ужасную трилогию забыть. Как в душу насрали.
"Jan 30, 2020",negative,JJ tried to reverse TLJ but in the end the story was to far destroyed to have any of it really make you care.
"Jan 30, 2020",positive,Very good and well supported story of the rise and fall of the enemy.
"Jan 30, 2020",positive,"A decent story to tie up a number of loose ends in the saga.  However, in that, they tried to cover too much ground in one movie."
"Jan 30, 2020",positive,Great action movie...Wonderful on how they did the Leia character...It completes the storylines...A must see more than once to see everything....
"Jan 30, 2020",positive,Great Graphics. Plenty of Action
"Jan 30, 2020",positive,Actually I was bored
"Jan 30, 2020",positive,I like scifi but I'm not a Star Wars fanatic. It was OK.
"Jan 30, 2020",positive,It was entertaining with action
"Jan 30, 2020",positive,"This is a very entertaining movie, but certainly lacks some basic dramatic structure to be a consistent movie. On the other hand, this is truly a Star Wars movie, unlike ""The last Jedi"" which was the teenager's wet dream of director/writer. This is not the clausure I would've liked but this is OK after the huge damage done by the previous movie."
"Jan 30, 2020",positive,This was only my second Star Wars to ever see and smit was great great!
"Jan 30, 2020",positive,It was a great family film.
"Jan 30, 2020",positive,"It was a beautiful movie. I loved the story, visuals and cast."
"Jan 30, 2020",positive,As an individual film I love it. But it has flaws. Great acting from Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley and John Williams' music is flawless. I felt the film ignored many aspects of The Last Jedi that were new to the Saga. But overall a good film.
"Jan 30, 2020",positive,Great movie.  George Lucas films do not disappoint.
"Jan 30, 2020",positive,A great ending for the greatest saga ever
"Jan 30, 2020",negative,"I thought it couldn't get any worst than Episode VIII. It did.
A re-introduction of an old character to make up for inability to create new interesting stars says it all."
"Jan 30, 2020",positive,"This movie paid a lot of tribute to the Star Wars Expanded Universe in various ways that the average Star Wars fan might not understand. As such, it was a sendoff for the true Star Wars geeks out there but in making some of those choices, it may have left those less informed about the lore of the Star Wars universe a little confused.

It's an excellent film, especially for the serious Star Wars fan, and I loved it."
"Jan 30, 2020",positive,It was really good. Much better than I was being lead to believe by friends. The story was really good. The special effects were a little cheaper than I’m used to from disney and Star Wars but it’s a great movie.
"Jan 30, 2020",positive,"Don't care what the detractors are saying.  Its another blockbuster, action packed, and thought provoking for future ""Star Wars' stories, must see chapter in the 3 generational series that will endure for so many years to come.  Thank you George Lucas and everyone who has had anything to do with the making of these wonderful stories."
"Jan 30, 2020",positive,"Enjoyed show and actors were great! 
  A bit long ...  but had plenty of good popcorn to make it through!!"
"Jan 30, 2020",negative,Same old soap opera. Pointless. Long. Surely the last one.
"Jan 30, 2020",positive,"Best of the sequels by far, and out of the 9 Skywalker “Saga” movies it’s 7/9"
"Jan 30, 2020",negative,"This is a film that really didn't know what it wanted to be: it thinks it's a follow-up to the previous two Star Wars Sequel Trilogy films, and it also seems to think that it needs to tie up every single loose thread from the other two trilogies as well. It succeeds at none of these.

Every interesting plot thread from the last two films is thrown out the window in favor of gratuitous fanservice for fans of the Original Trilogy, and the basic plot itself is so crammed together with useless new secondary characters that steal the spotlight away from the main heroes and multiple fetch quests marred by plot detours that are ultimately rendered pointless later in the film. There is no meaningful character development: Rey effectively has her entire character arc reset in this movie and she ends the film worse off than when she started; Finn is entirely superfluous to the story, spending the entire film either being useless or an outright hindrance; Rose went from an important secondary character that played an important role in developing Finn's character as well as the overarching themes of the trilogy to being reduced to a glorified cameo in this film who has a combined two minutes of total screentime in this nearly 2.5-hour film; Poe's development from the last film isn't followed up on at all, and even when the film reaches a point where he should take the center stage in the conflict, he still ends up losing screentime to the aforementioned superfluous Finn.

The villains were easily the worst part of the film, however. Kylo Ren was set up as the final villain during the last film, but instead he spends much of the film playing second fiddle to Emperor Palpatine, the villain of the previous trilogies who inexplicably has returned from the dead. This is not a spoiler: his face is on the poster and his resurrection is established in the first two sentences of the opening crawl. Palpatine has no reason to be in this film: he wasn't set up at all in the previous two movies and his influence on the overall narrative was minimal at best; he's only been shoehorned into this movie as the main villain as a means of ""justifying"" not one but TWO lazily-written, very out-of-character redemption arcs, one of which is effectively dropped as soon as it's brought up, as the character in question dies unceremoniously and is never brought up again.

Overall, this film is a mess. While not necessarily the worst Star Wars film (I maintain that The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones are worse than this), it's still a flaccid conclusion to this trilogy, and an absolutely embarrassing ending to the Skywalker Saga. Anyone who likes this movie is certainly entitled to their opinion, but I left the theater with very few positive impressions that have only soured in the time since I've seen it."
"Jan 30, 2020",positive,"I thought the last chapter of the Star War movie was fantastic. It was what I hoped for regarding the final ending of a long-running, successful, 3 trilogy career consisting of 9 movies - the first 3 in my opinion were the best from 1977 to 83 when I first saw them, the prequel trilogy from 1999 to 2005 wasn't in my opinion very good (due to script writing, digital effects and acting) but the last 3 from 2015 to 2019 I did enjoy regardless what the critics said in the media. GG"
"Jan 30, 2020",positive,one of the best star wars out of  all star wars movies
"Jan 30, 2020",negative,"It had space battles and laser swords and a few good ideas but the plot is a hot mess that ignores or seeks to overrule way too much of the previous film, while throwing in new things out of nowhere with little to no satisfying explanation. The set up of Last of the Jedi was great but is thrown out in favour of left-field connections to the earlier films and new characters who do nothing but take time away from the main cast and existing supporting characters who deserved more time."
"Jan 30, 2020",positive,"The movie was good... but the story wasn't exactly what I expected, in the end.  I don't know if that is what George Lucas intended."
"Jan 30, 2020",positive,I thought it was a very well done movie that closed off the sky walker saga well
"Jan 30, 2020",positive,"Honestly, I am not a Star Wars fan and only went because other family wanted to go.  It was ok."
"Jan 30, 2020",positive,I thought it was a good ending to a great saga.
"Jan 30, 2020",negative,What a disappointing ending to a disappointing trilogy
"Jan 30, 2020",negative,Just saw it to finish the set.
"Jan 30, 2020",positive,The movie had all the characters in it.
"Jan 30, 2020",positive,Loved the ending and all the action!
"Jan 30, 2020",negative,"U niebie, jak čalaviek chodzić? JA razhublieny. Fiĺm - u kosmasie, alie Saviecki Sajuz - spačatku ŭ kosmasie. Historyja sumniŭnaja. Piersanažy ŭsie razmaŭliajuć pa-anhlijsku.

"Jan 30, 2020",positive,"Sure, there are plot holes. But this movie builds on what has gone before it, brings great resolution to the arcs of Rey and Kylo Ren and is a fitting end to the 9 movie saga."
"Jan 29, 2020",negative,It was so stupid and rushed. Overwrote all the great things last jedi have us. I hope this move will be redone.
"Jan 29, 2020",negative,"Not the worst Star Wars movie, but nowhere near the best. The story is badly written with major plot holes and unnecessary side quests, JJ Abrams doesn't use the current cast as well as he should have because he was to busy trying to introduce too many new characters, The ending is probably the best part of the movie, ending the saga in a nice way, however it does feel a bit to similar to the ending of endgame."
"Jan 29, 2020",negative,"Packed with fabulous acting and spectacular visuals, yet so rushed that it felt more like a fast-food drive-through catering to hungry fans. With all the ways they could have concluded the trilogy, it's disappointing that the production team seemed to focus on retconning The Last Jedi."
"Jan 29, 2020",positive,Not bad. Gave me some really nice surprises. Could’ve used better fight choreography and directing though.
"Jan 29, 2020",positive,"It's a good movie. Lots of fan service, but don't listen to most of these Hollywood blowhards who hate this movie, but some how love The Last Jedi. It's not Empire, but it's a solid movie."
"Jan 29, 2020",negative,"These movies just keep getting worse. I'm officially done with Star Wars. Disney has turned the franchise into a steaming pile of fetid trash. How did Disney put out such quality for decades then just in a matter of a few years become one of THEE most loathsome production companies I'm the world? I really am curious. The plot is all off course. There's no character I'm cheering for here. It's insanely injected with political agendas. The jokes didn't make me laugh once. One of my kids fell asleep in the theater he said he was SO bored. The other said he doesn't mind not seeing the next one, and I agree. I've told all of my friends and family to skip this one and the rest."
"Jan 29, 2020",positive,It tied up loose story ends.
"Jan 29, 2020",positive,I love these movies - however the open items are so frustrating when the thought is closure.
"Jan 29, 2020",positive,"As good as any other Star Wars episode. Good action, and effects kept me interested for the entire length of the movie. If you're a Star Wars fan, see it."
"Jan 29, 2020",negative,"An incredibly brazen, unimaginative and above all disrespectful film. It is inconceivable how Disney managed to do that."
"Jan 29, 2020",positive,A lot of action. But I hated the ending. The final battle with great but not ending.
"Jan 29, 2020",positive,"Ties up the story in epic fashion. Makes you wish they had kept JJ Abrams on for the entire trilogy. the storytelling, worldbuilding, and emotional impact are so much better in his capable hands, shame on Disney for allowing Ryan Johnson to smudge what could have been a perfect trilogy."
"Jan 29, 2020",positive,It was a good finish but there were problems like them standing on the ship in space. C'mon really?
"Jan 29, 2020",positive,"Great movie, must see!"
"Jan 29, 2020",positive,I expected alot better. The first half of the film was cramped with extra material that we didn't need. The ending was very disappointing.
"Jan 29, 2020",positive,"The visual effects and overall story line were great. However, the end came quicker than you would like and left you feeling there would be another film that is not going to come."
"Jan 29, 2020",positive,"Not thrilled with the ending. Was hoping for a Jedi marriage, babies, future powers"
"Jan 29, 2020",positive,A good movie that closes this bumpy saga with emotion and nostalgia (a lot).
"Jan 29, 2020",negative,I don't even know what to say. 😂
"Jan 29, 2020",positive,My favorite out of the 3 films 
"Jan 29, 2020",positive,As much of a let down to this legacy as the last series of GoT.
"Jan 29, 2020",negative,"Another Ewoks vs empire failure. What is it with the third installment that the plot just goes south. It’s like the writers are tired of their own story. We’ve seen this all before. Nothing new here and nothing good. Two stars for the great acting but the writing, plot, and cinematography get nothing. "
"Jan 29, 2020",neutral,better than the last jedi but not by much
"Jan 29, 2020",positive,Very nice shot I like it!!!
"Jan 29, 2020",negative,I hate  everything in this movie... thank u Disney...
"Jan 29, 2020",positive,"Great movie, sorry to see the end of this great saga."
"Jan 29, 2020",negative,"Awful.  There can be no course correcting of TLJ, and this attempt failed miserably.  Rewriting the original trilogy by throwing the canon in the garbage, and lighting it on fire is a terrible way to prove how ""woke"" Disney is.  In the end, not only did they neuter the greatest Jedi of all time, but they also flipped the ""chosen one"" script by letting a Palpatine outlast the Skywalkers, then steal their name.  Sidious won after all..."
"Jan 29, 2020",positive,Everything I want from a Star Wars movie.
"Jan 29, 2020",positive,"Its a movie and a good story, not real life. See it like that and you'll enjoy the movie."
"Jan 29, 2020",negative,Seemed disjointed and not well plotted out from the previous entries
"Jan 29, 2020",positive,I enjoyed the movie the acting and writing were entertaining
"Jan 29, 2020",negative,"I think I dont have to add anything couse everything had been said. Thx Jar jar, u did it.

But it is stunning and brave! So it has to be Good"
"Jan 29, 2020",positive,"An underwhelming conclusion to one of the most influencial film series of all time. The disjointed story seen through the trilogy demonstrates Abrams perhaps never had a clear vision of this project, which consequently affects the movie and its ""messy"" narrative. The first two acts are fairly entertaining, following a simple adventure through the galaxy, unfortunately, the third act falls flat and shows a lack of imagination and risk-taking by part of the writers, which ultimately leads to having an anti-climatic final battle and a rather bland closure. Faking the death of the beloved Chewbacca demonstrates they played it as safe as possible."
"Jan 29, 2020",negative,"Un p*tain de mauvais film, c'est nul !"
"Jan 29, 2020",positive,Awesome movie. I don’t know which movie the critics watched because I want to go watch it again! It only took a few decades for everyone to figure out how to shoot and hit their target on the first shot. I love this movie! You
"Jan 29, 2020",positive,"The 9 films as a body of work is a colossal achievement.  By this time though, the themes have become a bit stale, even with the evolved set of characters and the ever improving movie-making technology."
"Jan 29, 2020",negative,"Mild Spoilers involved:  Just not a very good movie in general.  I agree with many of the critics for once, the powers that be seemed to concentrate more on clicking boxes, and making Rey the savior of, well, everything and everyone, rather than tell a good story.  The one good element was that the acting was superb for the most part.  They just did not have much to work with.  It was beyond predictable, and half way through I was just ready for Rey to kill 'you know who' already, so I could be done.  The interesting and exceedingly frustrating miss is that the story screamed for a huge twist that would have really cemented a lasting legacy for the franchise.  In the almost year leading up to the premiere, there were minor hints of a possibility that Rey could fall to the Dark Side at some point.  Though as more trailers revealed this was probably not going to happen, it would have made for a great plot choice, with endless possibilities.  (1) Rey falls, Kylo is redeemed and must stop her.  (2) Rey falls and Finn becomes a Jedi to stop her, perhaps with Kylo.  (3) Even Rey falls, but is ultimately redeemed .  Any of these options and more would have really opened up the story more.  It also would have solved another glaring problem with the trilogy as a whole.  I like most everyone, thought the prequels were pretty bad, but I believe this was more due to poor acting than anyone cares to admit.  But what I loved about ""Attack of the Clones"" and ""Revenge of the Sith"" was the multiple Jedi, and to a certain extent Sith, we were able to witness.  This was something even the original trilogy did not have, though I will admit, those movies were certainly fine cinema at its best on their own.  In any case it would have been great to see more than just Rey and Kylo in every movie.  Luke, Leia, and the Emperor had mere moments of battle, plus they were all known characters, and old by this time.  It would have been great to see Finn explore his abilities, Snook not dispatched so quickly and in action, and perhaps a couple of others.  I was genuinely tired of the Rey/Kylo fight, love, whatever, before the last movie even started.  O.K. my rant is done, maybe we'll get this and more in the next trilogy…"
"Jan 29, 2020",positive,Love it! I think it ended the series on a nice note and finished up the story
"Jan 29, 2020",positive,What an amazing movie to end such an amazing saga. Definitely my favorite of the new 3 Star Wars movies.
"Jan 29, 2020",positive,"Way better than the last SW. Spends a 1/3 of the time explaining the last movie and the other part with fan service. The effects were very good, and had some nice fan service moments. Much darker than the rest of series dipping into dark mysticism and possession. Overall a nice end to a other wise debacle 3 series run by Disney. If you love the originals this one will meet your fan needs. Makes it into my the top 5 SW List. -Saw it twice :) Don't listen to the ""paid critics""!"
"Jan 29, 2020",negative,The story was stupid and way over the top. most of the resistance characters are boring and uninteresting. The actors that play fin and Rey can't act for shit. It would be recommended that they focused on the story rather than the cgi and conforming to the PC culture.
"Jan 29, 2020",positive,Was a great ending to the series.
"Jan 29, 2020",positive,great movie! fantastic to see all the old stars from previous movies.
"Jan 29, 2020",positive,Fantastic movie. Best of the series.
"Jan 29, 2020",positive,"I loved it how it kept you on edge on what’s going to happen next. One of the best films I’ve seen in a while. Sorry End Game, but Skywalker has got you beat."
"Jan 29, 2020",negative,Please god fire Kennedy. Hire anybody else idc but these terrible movies have to stop.  The mando is 10000 times better.  At least it has interesting characters. Granted Abrams didn’t have much to go off of with that last one idk why I thought this would be a decent movie.  Just call George Lucas do us a favor.
"Jan 29, 2020",neutral,"bland film, full of fanservice."
"Jan 29, 2020",positive,Lots of action and well played !!!
"Jan 29, 2020",positive,"A good ending to the sequels, had a great time.  
The originals and prequels I find more compelling story-wise, but can't deny the next level visuals in these."
"Jan 29, 2020",positive,I loved it. I thought it was a very satisfying ending to the series while still leaving open some possible Disney+ or future movie spinoffs. Great special effects as well.
"Jan 29, 2020",positive,"Excellent way to end the Star Wars saga! The movie was as good as the very
first one in 1977. An awesome movie with excellent actors.  Glad we saw it &
may see it again!"
"Jan 29, 2020",positive,"Loved it, had all the things I needed to conclude the chapter. Seeing my story close to eloquently. It couldn’t have been done any better. "
"Jan 29, 2020",positive,Awesome Easter eggs and hidden messages
"Jan 29, 2020",positive,We loved it. Great way to end the saga.
"Jan 29, 2020",negative,It was worst sw movie ever.
"Jan 29, 2020",positive,Wrapped up the series in a logical way. Adam Driver got to do some acting other than fighting.
"Jan 29, 2020",positive,"As a movie this was hot garbage. If you watch it like it was fireworks, completely ignoring and not expecting anything about a plot, it was one hell of a spectacle."
"Jan 29, 2020",positive,Great movie! LOVED the ending. Leaves room for so many possibilities.
"Jan 29, 2020",positive,Very satisfying closure to the Star Wars saga (at least the Skywalker part for now). Checked all of the boxes.
"Jan 29, 2020",positive,"Sad to see the end of this saga, but it was time. It was good for the final chapter."
"Jan 29, 2020",positive,I absolutely loved it! It had so many Easter eggs of all 9 movies. It's fast paced so hang on tight!
"Jan 29, 2020",positive,I just didn’t like that Ben didn’t get his happy ever after.
"Jan 29, 2020",positive,"Some lazy written sub plots could've been left out all together, I'm looking at Chewbacca."
"Jan 29, 2020",positive,"Great graphics and story line, I laughed cried and got madd"
"Jan 29, 2020",positive,What an amazing movie Daisy Ridley did such an amazing job it was even better the second time I watched it five stars for sure
"Jan 29, 2020",negative,"Too Much, Too Much Going On, Too Much Action, Too Much Twisted Plots, Too Much Back references, It was just all too much! You can tell that they are trying to hard. I was hoping for a good story, but instead we got a resurrection of a dead man. Calm down Disney."
"Jan 29, 2020",positive,"So I loved how this film was a beginning to end unifier for the Skywalker story.  I cried theough the majority of the movie and it was beautiful how they concluded it.  Now the person that I was with pointed out that every fight scene was actually a replica of previous fight routines from the earlier movies, which dampened their enjoyment.  But I am nostalgic and love the throwbacks.  I recommend for sure."
"Jan 29, 2020",positive,Best one since The Empire Strikes Back. Did a great job wrapping up the story.
"Jan 29, 2020",positive,It was incredible!  The special effects were spot on!
"Jan 29, 2020",positive,Kept my interest and never slowed for entire 2 plus hours.  Better than previous opinions made me think it was gonna be
"Jan 29, 2020",neutral,"After the promise of the last two films, this one fails on just about every level."
"Jan 29, 2020",positive,Entertaining but is too fast paced. A unique and original script.
"Jan 29, 2020",positive,Much of the special effects were not realistic. Like all the characters hope the adventure continues
"Jan 29, 2020",positive,Beginning set up was a little rushed. Ending had a needless death. Otherwise it was entertaining.
"Jan 29, 2020",positive,It brought me back to my childhood when I saw the very first Star Wars movie with my family as little rugrats. Now more than 40 yrs later it has ended. It was bittersweet.
"Jan 29, 2020",positive,So much hate from star wars fans but this was a great addition to the story!
"Jan 29, 2020",positive,"Star Wars: The Rise of the Skywalker was a fun movie to watch and does well with making the viewers think one thing, and then something else happening. The massive battle scene was impressive to see and has a relative good conclusion."
"Jan 29, 2020",positive,"Was ok, but had some pretty cringe stuff near and at the end"
"Jan 29, 2020",positive,confusing to keep up with
"Jan 29, 2020",positive,"Really enjoyed it. Kylo redeems himself. Rey, Lando, C-3PO,  Finn & Poe were the best heroes any Star Wars fan could ever hope for."
"Jan 28, 2020",positive,Great way to end 40+ years of Star Wars viewing. Even got a little weepy.
"Jan 28, 2020",negative,Similar to the latest Terminator this story does everything it can to completely dismantle the previous story especially the originals. Dumb plot with characters who serve no purpose in the movie.
"Jan 28, 2020",negative,Bring back George Lucas NOW!
"Jan 28, 2020",positive,"Exceptional!  It checked all of the boxes, including providing closure for this series."
"Jan 28, 2020",positive,"It's Star Wars. A good science fiction franchise that ended this chapter well. With fantastic people behind it and in it, you get a good movie. When that movie is trying to fix it's predecessors constantly, it will show. That doesn't take away from anyone's nostalgia blinders or need for it to be perfect. None of the previous movies were perfect. No movie can achieve that. Rise of Skywalker is a good movie and worth the watch. Anyone telling you different is in film school or overly critical. If you aren't either, you'll like it"
"Jan 28, 2020",negative,I just want to erase the sequel trilogy from memory and pretend it never happened. The only good things about it were The Force Awakens score and BB8. But I can no longer listen to the wonderful Rey theme without remembering her origins and going into hysterical laughter. I find the the Disneyfied Lucasfilm's lack of vision and coherence disturbing.
"Jan 28, 2020",positive,We loved it! It was fast paced and the cameos by original characters were a wonderful surprise.
"Jan 28, 2020",neutral,"I get JJ was screwed after the last film, I'm just glad he made Luke catch Anakin's lightsaber and tell Rey and Ryan Johnson that a Jedi's weapon deserves more respect, really redeemed it for me, LOT of plot holes, just wish this movie wasn't rushed when you're ending a saga that most people grew up as kids... Still sucks to see how Luke was treated, but whatever."
"Jan 28, 2020",positive,It wrapped everything up almost too nicely
"Jan 28, 2020",positive,The best of all the newer Star Wars movies by far!
"Jan 28, 2020",positive,"I have seen this movie twice.  For about a month before the release, I put myself on blackout, to avoid spoilers, and especially to avoid reviews. I knew that reviewers would attack the movie, and I predicted everything most of them would say, even before I saw the movie myself.  All I can tell you is that I loved every minute of Rise Of Skywalker, and Im grateful for the return of the chemistry and fun between the main characters that was established in The Force Awakens, but absent in Last Jedi."
"Jan 28, 2020",neutral,"Evidently upset by Rian Johnson's contribution to the series in The Last Jedi, JJ Abrams has returned to the Star Wars universe to set the record straight, often directly contradicting the plot points and character arcs set in motion by the preceding film. That makes for an awkward sort of arm wrestling competition, as Johnson himself often seemed intent upon bucking the conventions established by earlier chapters in the franchise. In other words, ""you undid my work, now I'm going to undo yours.""

The result, in this case, is an overstuffed mammoth of a film that tries to do too much while also, somehow, accomplishing very little. Not the first time a Skywalker film has been messy, but the lack of enthusiasm and excitement is certainly new. Even in the much-maligned prequels, there was something unique and special about seeing a Star Wars movie. This time, despite the enormous budget, eight films' worth of lead-in, tons of new environments and alien races, plus constant callbacks to please the die-hards, the final product is rather bland and pedestrian. And that's probably the most damning thing I could say about it. This isn't the grand conclusion to a generations-long space epic, it's just a nondescript, run-of-the-mill science fiction shelf-filler with a billion-dollar sheen. It's a mass of writer's room concepts, tossed into a tumbler and belched out onto the screen without much connective tissue.

Episode IX does have successful moments. The law of averages says, given enough options, something's bound to stick. Yet, even when they hit upon a winner, Abrams and company's lack of conviction, their reluctance to take a risk and get firmly behind any one direction, lessens the meaning of the whole. How disappointing that it's come to this."
"Jan 28, 2020",negative,Overall the plot moved way too fast and course-correcting from TLJ was on overdrive. The movie had good moments saving it from a one-star but at the end of the day just a mess.
"Jan 28, 2020",positive,It was SO good! A good finish to a great saga!
"Jan 28, 2020",negative,I'd rather watch paint dry than see this shit again
"Jan 28, 2020",negative,"A fitting end to the absolutely horrid sequel trilogy. I have no idea how Disney could fail this hard with such a wonderful franchise. The film is non-stop quests after nonsensical plot devices, culminating in nonsensical world-building that fails to remedy the deficiencies of the previous movies."
"Jan 28, 2020",positive,"Plenty of fanservice, maybe a little heavy on the technobabble in places (I'm convinced that the screenwriters started with the idea of a cavalry charge on a Star Destroyer and then wrote the final battle around that.) This movie didn't have a scene as cool as the suicide-jump-to-lightspeed in the previous film, but overall I think this was a better film, lots of fun, and a nice good-bye for many of the characters."
"Jan 28, 2020",positive,It was just an awesome movie.
"Jan 28, 2020",positive,JJ Abrahams managed to fix up the mistakes of The Last Jedi.
"Jan 28, 2020",positive,RARA UN Poco forzado para terminar la saga
"Jan 28, 2020",negative,Disney RUINED Star Wars. The final trilogy was terrible. As much as I loved the mandolorian is as much as I HATED the last Jedi and rise of skywalker. As fans we should file a class action lawsuit to have creative rights turned back over to George Lucas. All three movies were written as though they were cartoons. Even Palpetine wasnt the same. Lucas had a way of developing characters and telling the story that was uniquely Star Wars. Disney got it way wrong. Please just let this be the end. Dont ruin anymore of my childhood.
"Jan 28, 2020",positive,Great end to the series.
"Jan 28, 2020",positive,Rey is strong and good. The forces that love will win in the end. A great metaphor for our times.
"Jan 28, 2020",positive,"Glad, I got to see it in the theater, a great movie and J.J. Abrams somehow was able to splice together the storyline of his Force Awakens(loved it,) and Rian Johnson's Last Jedi(was alright.)  An excellent Star Wars movie that had a few twists and turns and some great moments to close the series down. (Are they really going to stop making Star Wars movies?  I don't think so. : )  Definitely a thumbs up!"
"Jan 28, 2020",positive,This movie is leagues better than the catastrophe that was Last Jedi. A lot of the plot points you can tell were shoehorned in but when you gotta end a series in 150 minutes that's gonna happen. Overall was good and sent the rocky trilogy off on a good note
"Jan 28, 2020",negative,"They should have built onto the ideas introduced in The Last Jedi, instead of boring us with this abomination.
Trying to please everyone is what gives you crap like this. This is what happens when businessmen, not artists, make the decisions."
"Jan 28, 2020",positive,Very entertaining and action-filled.  Enjoyed it as it continued authentically in the Star Wars vein.
"Jan 28, 2020",positive,"For what we got i'm grateful, but it could've been better. I liked the 1st act, 2nd act was fine, but the whole 3rd act was just horrendous i was quite disappointed with the 3rd act and i didn't quite agree with some of the decisions that were made. Also i was not a fan of Palpatine coming back especially without no explanation on how he survived from being disintegrated and thrown down a shaft. He was just brought back to die by Rey which was such a let down. I did like how they retconed TLJ i was very pleased with the stuff they fixed from that film. Overall it was just an ALRIGHT film 7/10"
"Jan 28, 2020",positive,As a fan who was in the theater in ‘77 as a kid watching Star Wars and who grew up on the franchise this was a satisfying end to the Saga.
"Jan 28, 2020",positive,Better than I expected
"Jan 28, 2020",positive,Excellent finale to the saga (but has to be seen in the context of the series).
"Jan 28, 2020",positive,Was way too fast in exploring relationships.  Left me feeling empty at the conclusion oh the saga.  Guess I'll have to see it again.
"Jan 28, 2020",positive,One of the better Star Wars movies.
"Jan 28, 2020",positive,"This movie does a great job of tying up loose ends and also excels in bringing Star Wars a promising future. However, the plot started getting messy towards the climax and many promising characters were thrown away."
"Jan 28, 2020",positive,"I was really surprised to like this movie as much as I did. Found it to be far superior to the previous installment, with a level of passion from Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver that carried the day. Trotting out old favorites like Billy D Williams and a very overweight Mark Hamill was stale and predictable, but it was good to see Emperor Palpatine again. He's one of the few villains that truly scares me with his evil.   Having  Rey be his granddaughter made sense to me.  I was truly moved to tears by the climax of the movie where Rey and Ben have their moment.   Ben was doomed by his close association with the Dark Side, but his soul was redeemed by his pure sacrifice for Rey.      The other fresh aspect of the movie were the droids.  The ever annoying C3PO actually gained my sympathy with his memory loss.   And the new, cone-faced droid was really adorable.  With the ""never underestimate a droid"" sub-theme, the writers brought out the true humanity in these  ""artificial"" beings.
They continually fight for recognition . (C3PO saying,  ""I'm OK, although you didn't ask."")  and never quite get their due.  But their hearts are as real as ours."
"Jan 28, 2020",positive,I thought this movie was great. It had the feel of the original trilogy and Kylo Ren had an amazing arc.
"Jan 28, 2020",positive,Best movie of the sequel by far.  Very cool to see everything from the whole series finally come together.  In my mind this was the best movie since Episode VI: Return of The Jedi.
"Jan 28, 2020",positive,"Liked-Visually very good-so much to watch (need to see it again to catch all that was in this movie).
Disliked - really think this is my problem - I haven't seen all the movies more than once so it seemed like an alot was assumed I knew or could figure out so I think I missed a lot of what was intended.  Just means I will have to catch up - in the future."
"Jan 28, 2020",negative,Hard to follow plot. Boring scenes. This movie is all over the place. People complain about the obi wan and Anakin trilogy but this film definitely takes the low ground
"Jan 28, 2020",positive,"A little less of the ships fighting, that's all!"
"Jan 28, 2020",positive,Expected the end to be different.
"Jan 28, 2020",positive,"I thought it was a great movie for the finale of the 9 part series. It was never going to be prefect but it definitely was Epic. Many things were tied up, many urges satisfied, and it was moving at a steady pace throughout."
"Jan 28, 2020",negative,"Rather than delivering a final, hopeful conclusion the 42-year-old saga, the movie is trying to retcon what came before and does it in such a terrible way. The movie itself feels like it was catered to the toxic fanbase and it doesn't carry the story anywhere. It makes every single easy, coward and unoriginal choice. Very disappointing.

The cinematography and VFX are also very bad. The whole movie is absurdly blue. Luke's force ghost looks like a Listerine bottle.

The only good thing about this movie is John Williams."
"Jan 28, 2020",negative,No plan for a trilogy of films makes Rise of Skywalker seem like its in a constant fight with The Last Jedi over narrative choices. They tried to cram several movies worth of plot points and all of them are poorly developed and many lead nowhere beyond being mentioned.
"Jan 28, 2020",positive,Tied together some loose ends from earlier episodes... and set up some story lines for future episodes. Pretty exciting!!
"Jan 28, 2020",positive,"Solid movie, definite plot reaches for max on-screen excitement but the story found ways if interconnecting the series in unexpected ways which was nice"
"Jan 28, 2020",positive,Surprisely better overall movie than I thought it would be.  Rey and Ben characters were much more interesting and consisted of stronger acting than in previous movies;  while many of the other actors were so-so as in the previous movies.  Pretty interesting story with a few unexpected twists although much of the movie contained similar and predictable scenes as in the previous Star Wars or other action movies.
"Jan 28, 2020",positive,"Entertaining, I did not sleep through this. It was a little long though. It did not compare well to other Star Wars movies, but this saga is now ended - I think!"
"Jan 28, 2020",negative,"As a long life fan of the franchise this was heartbreaking.

I Love Star wars and forever I will support It, however .... Starting from ""The Force Awakens"" until ""The Last Jedi"" the greatest thing about the new saga was that Rey was a nobody. The decision for making this movie is so reactionary basis.

Then again, it is what it is... i'll keep supporting the next saga as we all should.

Hopefully better next."
"Jan 28, 2020",positive,I really enjoyed this ending to a great saga. Honestly I’ve love Star Wars since I was a little kid and ending the saga with this ending was honestly an honor to see.
"Jan 28, 2020",negative,I did not like it. plan and simple
"Jan 28, 2020",positive,It's a damn good movie with the highest ending of the whole Star Wars Saga!
"Jan 28, 2020",positive,"Wrapped up the series, very well.  I'm a huge Star Wars fan and I loved it."
"Jan 28, 2020",positive,It was really good!! Did not disappoint!!!
"Jan 28, 2020",positive,"I am certainly glad that I saw this movie as I did want to see how everything wrapped up.  It could have been a little tighter as there were parts that tended to drag a bit.  However, all in all it was still a good story."
"Jan 28, 2020",positive,"The franchise returns to what charmed us in the first place, the power of family, the family you find along your way. The bond between Rey, Finn, and Poe, supported by Chewie, Threepio, and the rest of the supporting characters give the movie a ton of heart. Add the epic battles, wonderful humor, and tear-inducing moments, and The Rise of Skywalker stands as a classic entry in the franchise."
"Jan 28, 2020",positive,"With a critical hat on, its easy to find flaws - the breakneck pace robs us of what would have been welcome character and story beats, the plot and some motivations are cosmically iffy. But as a fan, damn, there is so much to enjoy here :)  Enjoyed it with reservations first time around, loved it the second time. Some choices I was initially dubious about, have definitely grown on me."
"Jan 28, 2020",positive,This was an excellent installment to the star wars franchise. Some slow to get there moments but the great performance of the cast kept things moving and enjoyable for the entire film
"Jan 28, 2020",positive,Great ending to a great story arc.
"Jan 28, 2020",positive,Thank you J.J. Abrams for bringing some closure to an old Star Wars fanboy!
"Jan 28, 2020",positive,Wonderful! Life-altering!
"Jan 28, 2020",negative,made Jar Jar look good.
"Jan 28, 2020",positive,Tied the Skywalker saga up nicely. Well worth seeing.
"Jan 28, 2020",positive,Great ending. wrapped it up well
"Jan 28, 2020",positive,Don't listen to the haters. This movie was great. Cleaned up all of Last Jedi's missteps. What an epic finale
"Jan 28, 2020",positive,"Plot was superficial and acting, or the directing of the actors, was mediocre."
"Jan 28, 2020",positive,Sólo para fans. El fin de la historia.
"Jan 28, 2020",negative,The most disappointing thing is that there is absolutely nothing special about this film.  A lackluster conclusion to the Skywalker story.
"Jan 28, 2020",positive,Thank God it’s the end
"Jan 28, 2020",positive,"Strangely enough, I fell asleep 3x during the movie. It like a little rushed. Maybe it's because I'm a casual Star Wars viewer that I needed more of a backstory or of a refresher but I didn't know what was going on at certain moments (and I don't think it's just because of me falling asleep!)."
"Jan 28, 2020",positive,Seeing all the old timers in this movie!! Takes me way back.
"Jan 28, 2020",negative,It was really bad. The camera shots of the film weren’t anything special. The story was really confused. The end was so bad and ruined everything this franchise was going for. A definite skip.
"Jan 28, 2020",positive,A good conclusion to the Star Wars Saga.
"Jan 28, 2020",positive,"It was a good ending to the story although Rey's character is good, I find it hard to find her a lasting character like Leia."
"Jan 28, 2020",positive,Exciting movie with some old some new characters
"Jan 28, 2020",positive,"It's Star Wars, the x-wing vs. rey scene was magical, but that magic was expected throughout the whole movie not just 5 minutes..."
"Jan 28, 2020",positive,Pretty much more of the same.
"Jan 28, 2020",positive,"Loved the whole movie ,, the end wasn’t what i expected it was like BLHA"
"Jan 28, 2020",positive,I really like the love story between Ben and Ray. He really loved her and I’m glad he finally found peace with who he was.
"Jan 28, 2020",positive,JJ did his best to save the Johnson fiasco.   Embodied the spirit of Star Wars.
"Jan 28, 2020",positive,Better than Last Jedi but not has good as Force Awakening
"Jan 28, 2020",positive,Liked some of the tie in with the emperor and previous movies.
"Jan 28, 2020",positive,"The Force was truly with this film. I enjoyed it from beginning to end.. all the great characters, the scenery.. Great Film!"
"Jan 28, 2020",positive,"The story line was very good. I absolutely loved it. Great action and sad too, I cried like the last 10 mins of the movie. My husband was happy with it also. Great date night."
"Jan 28, 2020",positive,Loved it!  Very little I can complain about as a genuine Star Wars fan!
"Jan 28, 2020",positive,I don't understand all the negativity about this movie. it continued the story and brought the series to a conclusion???
"Jan 28, 2020",positive,I hope not last of star wars
"Jan 28, 2020",positive,It's Star Wars...so much has been said about this movie that it is not necessary to repeat it all.  This is a good movie if you just go to see a space opera.  Disney has made it so that if you do not watch the cartoons and Disney pay per view then you don't really know who is doing what or how they got there.  This is an OK ending to the Star Wars original story line as flawed as it is.  The fact that so many different people have taken a shot at telling George Lucas's story leave the whole franchise fractured so you can't blame JJ Abrams for not having enough super glue to put it all together neatly.
"Jan 28, 2020",positive,special effects were good.
"Jan 28, 2020",negative,"horrible piece of writing and filmmaking.
rouge 1 remains the best star wars film, followed by empire strikes back"
"Jan 27, 2020",negative,"This is not peak Star Wars. What it reminds me of is when authors were allowed to go in any direction they pleased during the expanded universe days. This movies doesn't feel like a Star Wars movie it feels like something the MCU would put together. Everything is overpowered, invincible, and Indestructible. Truly a sad and depressing ending to a great saga. Thankfully, Clone Wars season seven is on its way."
"Jan 27, 2020",positive,"Loved how well the balanced the entire film, giving you everything you could want in a movie, bringing the franchise to an end beautifully!"
"Jan 27, 2020",negative,Bad from beginning to end.
"Jan 27, 2020",positive,"I thought the movie was great! I saw it twice. I have heard that a lot of people are not fond of it. I just went in for the entertainment value. Some questions were answered and some I felt we were left hanging. Anyway, I'll probably see it again."
"Jan 27, 2020",positive,I'm a Star Wars fan & I really enjoyed the film. I am looking forward to seeing it again.
"Jan 27, 2020",positive,"By far the biggest movie events of my life. We all waited for this... and from the start you get the feeling all the negatives (although few) from previous star wars outings got the better of the production. It starts off extremely fast paced, if not rushed, only to realise once you get halfway you end up with more questions than answers... by the end you wonder why could this not have been split in part one and two. JJ Abrahams got the job done and bloody well done in the end...  but you can't help but wonder... how brilliant this could have been had it just been kept to the original recipe."
"Jan 27, 2020",negative,"I am so disapointed in both Rian Johnson and JJ Abrams for destroying what could have been. What a horrible ending to the Skywalker saga. Unimaginative, boring, stupid beyond belief and a complete betrayal of Star Wars."
"Jan 27, 2020",positive,Great story and movie overall! 
"Jan 27, 2020",negative,"The Last Jedi was initially a hard sell for me, but at the end of the day it still felt like a Star Wars movie and in hindsight it was refreshing that the movie covered new ground. However, I feel the Rise of Skywalker is not only a bad Star Wars movie but just a poorly made movie in general. The editing/pacing is frantic, the storytelling and character building weak, and the Star Wars canon was blatantly ignored at several points in the movie. Also, there were absolutely no stakes in the movie whatsoever; any danger that was felt was immediately resolved. This film felt like a complete mess and gave me the same nauseous feeling in my stomach after seeing Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. I have been a strong supporter with the direction Disney was taking this franchise up until this point. It is so unfortunate to see this new sequel trilogy fighting with itself when there was so much potential."
"Jan 27, 2020",positive,Everything i wanted. Tremendous fun and a rewarding end to the saga.
"Jan 27, 2020",positive,"I’m always going to rate Star Wars favorably, but definitely a great episode and must see. The inclusion of old locations was well done, the truth of Rey being answered was good, and the character of Ben Solo was well done"
"Jan 27, 2020",positive,"The subtle humor and fast pace kept me engaged. I wish they had done this in two movies, although I loved the nods to the original trilogy it just felt like there were too many wrapped with a Disney bow."
"Jan 27, 2020",positive,great movie wrapping up the Star Wars saga
"Jan 27, 2020",positive,I didnt fall asleep once
"Jan 27, 2020",positive,"I am a lifetime Star Wars fan and thought they tied in old information and characters perfectly, wrapping the saga up with heart and integrity."
"Jan 27, 2020",negative,It's OK plays out more like a treasure hunt or scavenger hunts then really a movie and it also feels forced and a lot of the scene especially the comedy
"Jan 27, 2020",positive,Loved it! Sad to see it end!
"Jan 27, 2020",positive,"I really did enjoy this movie. I read the reviews that said it was all over the place, but I think it worked the way it was. I can't say it was the perfect ending to the series, but when do we ever get a perfect ending to such a beloved series? I would definitely recommend it."
"Jan 27, 2020",positive,"Very good for the hand he was dealt. Was it perfect? No. Could it have been better with just one director piloting the whole trilogy from 7 to 9? Of course. Don’t blame JJ and Star Wars for the bad choices Disney execs made. He made a fun movie and tried his best to tie up 42 years of lots of people having different, and sometimes competing, ideas about what Star Wars means. Saw it six times and loved it more each time."
"Jan 27, 2020",positive,Good action and story.
"Jan 27, 2020",negative,"(SPOILERS)
I think of myself as a huge Star Wars fan, so I support them in ALMOST every decision they make. When I was watching the movie, however, I would be lying if I said I wasn't resting my head on my hand half the time. Rey had such raw strength, and such skill with her staff, that she had become an excellent Jedi (even without the amount of Jedi training she could've gone through), but if you've seen the movie, then you know that she was able to kill the Emperor in the end, with Kylo Ren's help. This troubled me, mostly because it destroys the prophesy that Anakin Skywalker was the Chosen One, the one to bring balance to the force. But if Palpatine survived, does that mean that Rey is the Chosen One?? After seeing lots of the Colin Trevorrow leaks in his ""Duel of the Fates"" script, I feel that the movie could have gone a lot better if taken in a different direction. Of course, this is just my opinion."
"Jan 27, 2020",positive,Loved it. Can't imagine a better way to wrap things up for what has come before and leave the door open for new stories in the Star Wars universe.
"Jan 27, 2020",positive,"Satisfying if not inspiring of repeat viewings, Rise Of Skywalker adequately wraps up the nine film saga."
"Jan 27, 2020",positive,Overwhelmed!  Such an epic adventure. I made a great memory with my son and my brother. You must see it on the big screen!
"Jan 27, 2020",positive,"There were a few plot holes that got brought up but overall enjoyable. Seemed like, emotionally, a mild rerunning of episode VI but without the intense connection to characters in the original trilogy"
"Jan 27, 2020",positive,Very entertaining - lots of very neat resolutions but overall fun!
"Jan 27, 2020",positive,"Most Star Wars fans will like this movie.  For me, I needed a nap part way thru.  The plot line is limited and doesnt benefit from the new idea that one needs to be evaporated, not just annihilated, to be dead and gone.  Too bad.  I am in love with Rey/Ridley, who continues to be awesome in this film."
"Jan 27, 2020",positive,"The movie had me on the edge of my seat at times.  I also feel like this being the last Star Wars Movie, my best friend just died.  I love all the Star Wars movies, It was the first date my Husband and I went on in 1977.  He has since passed away and I felt that same feeling sitting there watching the movie I did 43 years ago when he was with me.  Thank you for the memories!"
"Jan 27, 2020",positive,"An okay at best ending to the Skywalker Saga, a very safe story with Abrams usual panache for generic fan service."
"Jan 27, 2020",positive,Great action. The kiss was well strange.
"Jan 27, 2020",positive,"There were a few things I wish had gone differently, but overall I still loved the movie."
"Jan 27, 2020",positive,"I been a fan of star wars since 8 years old. I hated the last Jedi, but this movie was pretty good. i enjoyed it very much."
"Jan 27, 2020",positive,"Good plot, great picture. Satisfying end to Star Wars."
"Jan 27, 2020",positive,"I enjoyed it

great special effects, sound, etc"
"Jan 27, 2020",positive,"Much like the rest of the new ones, it was okay. Nothing to spend the next 4 decades watching over and over again."
"Jan 27, 2020",positive,"I'm conflicted about this movie. 90% of it is very entertaining, especially the lightsaber battles. You get moments with all of your favorite characters. What I couldn't get past was one major plot point that's introduced in the first five minutes. I thought it took away from the drama at the end of Return of the Jedi. The script is lacking a bit too - some things are thrown out there but not resolved. I thought there was too much forced humor in the first hour. If you are a Star Wars fan like me you'll probably like the movie, but overall I think the last two movies were a bit of a disappointment."
"Jan 27, 2020",positive,Exciting and fast moving. Good video effects.
"Jan 27, 2020",negative,Destroyed lore.  Had no real story to speak of.  Piss poor character development.  The space battles and saber fights were boring at best.  2 hours of my life I can not get back.  Not to mention the money.
"Jan 27, 2020",neutral,Bad guy in black turns good at the end and helps defend the last Jedi against the Emperor. I saw that movie already. It had Vader and Luke Skywalker in it. The whole trilogy was a rehash of a story already told. Terrible
"Jan 27, 2020",positive,Great movie!! My only suggestion is to have an interlude so that we can have a restroom break.
"Jan 27, 2020",positive,My husband loves sci-fi and Star Wars. I watch them with him and they have been entertaining and okay. Was kinda dreading going to the new Star Wars yesterday and absolutely LOVED IT!!! Even clapped!! Super Good!!
"Jan 27, 2020",positive,"I LOVED it. So much so that I wept uncontrollably at the end as it closed out a 40+ year series of movies that started for me a long time ago in a place (and time) far, far away.  Plus, my daughter, who had never seen a Star Wars movie before, loved it, too, so it worked for fans OLD and new."
"Jan 27, 2020",positive,"Fantastic fight scenes throughout! Good start, great ending!!"
"Jan 27, 2020",positive,Awesome movie ... if ur a Star Wars fan go see it if not go see it anyway far from disappointing 👍🏻  t
"Jan 27, 2020",positive,"If you are a true Star Wars fan you will like the movie as it has the same flare as the other ones.  It's not a modern new action movie, which I think is why so many were disappointed.  It liked it, was it the best one no, but it was fun to see and give me my Star Wars kicked."
"Jan 27, 2020",negative,Invented new history and powers at odds with older movies.  Lots of telegraphed scenes.  Very simplistic movie
"Jan 27, 2020",positive,I loved it. It was the third best Star Wars and the best of the New Series
"Jan 27, 2020",positive,It was formulaic and predictable.  While it was nice that it paid homage to the legacy characters it certainly didnt break new ground.
"Jan 27, 2020",negative,"A mind-boggling mess that tries as hard as possible to pretend the previous film never happened, while filling its bloated plot with story threads that belong in the middle film of a trilogy. At least Ian McDiarmid seems to be having a very good time."
"Jan 27, 2020",positive,"Warning: Potential Spoilers Ahead!
Most people can agree, it's not that great, yet not that terrible. But that didn't stop me from enjoying it. Though better than The Last Jedi, The Rise Of Skywalker still has it's major flaws. Such as feeling a bit too fast-paced and Rose Tico being absolutely ignored throughout the whole movie. Aside from the flaws, there are the good things, and one thing that stuck out in The Rise Of Skywalker, was the fan-service, and Chewie finally gets a medal! Also, Leia's final act was absolutely extraordinary. And the scene with Harrison Ford returning out of nowhere, left me trying to hold back all my tears. To wrap this up, The Rise Of Skywalker is a satisfying ending to the Skywalker Saga, yet missed out on so much opportunities.
Tom's Grade:
C+"
"Jan 27, 2020",negative,NEM ASSISTI MAS É UMA MERDA!
"Jan 27, 2020",positive,Action packed and emotional. I'm not sure why it's getting all the hate. We loved it.
"Jan 27, 2020",negative,Movie was rushed. Seemed like scenes were just cut & pasted together. Palpatine didnt fit in the story at all. So disappointed
"Jan 27, 2020",positive,"Awesome movie, kids loved it, fun characters and past character involvement, some nice twists and unexpected humor throughout"
"Jan 27, 2020",positive,Action filled and good story line.
"Jan 27, 2020",positive,"This movie has gotten an undeserved flogging! It was fun, exciting, great effects, good action and nostalgic. Sure it was a bit sugary at times, but it had the spirit of the original Star Wars and is worth seeing it."
"Jan 27, 2020",positive,It was great. A lot of easter eggs for fans of the saga. But also well developed and catching even for people who haven't seen any of the other movies.
"Jan 27, 2020",negative,"The first half of the film is busy-work where the characters are sent on fetch quests, the second half of the film is playing a one-up contest with itself but with no real emotional stakes. About 1/3 of the jokes are okay, the other 2/3s are pretty cringe-worthy. It is okay for there to be fake rules in a fantasy world, but you have to follow your own fake rules that you set up or else you risk being annoying, which this movie is."
"Jan 27, 2020",positive,loved it from beginning to end would definitely wanna see again
"Jan 27, 2020",positive,"It's entertaining, but lacks the true SW feel from the first six. Disney still missing the mark again! Ruining SW... Another one they had to buy!"
"Jan 27, 2020",positive,It was not a disappointment and was surely action packed..
"Jan 27, 2020",positive,"amazing like all star wars movie, you won't be disappointed "
"Jan 27, 2020",positive,"Loved it , very different  ending ."
"Jan 27, 2020",negative,Wow that was awful. You couldn't have possibly made a worse Trilogy if you tried. I can't wait to see you in 20-30 years when Disney reboots this hot garbage.
"Jan 27, 2020",negative,"Besides the great soundtrack and image editing, the ninth movie of the Star Wars franchise was awful. Important characters that gained long screen time in the previous movies were ignored and elements, such as the force, seemed naively used. Disney wasted the enormous potential of this trilogy and made every possible choice wrong."
"Jan 27, 2020",positive,This movie is really good!!!
"Jan 27, 2020",negative,The movie was all over the place. It was throw together so fast. What little plot thier was it was hard to find.
"Jan 27, 2020",positive,"It was a good movie overall, but I didn't like a few parts."
"Jan 27, 2020",negative,weak story line and too violent
"Jan 27, 2020",positive,"A good way to end the franchise...for now. Star Wars Rise of Skywalker does alot right by giving fans of the franchise what they want while still being an entertaining movie on its own, there may be the odd plot hole and the neglection of characters and developement, but on a whole it's a strong entry to the series that at least sees this beloved franchise end on good terms."
"Jan 27, 2020",negative,Messy storyline that doesnt hold up
"Jan 27, 2020",positive,Was very entertaining and lots of twists and turns. Great movie
"Jan 27, 2020",positive,"Loved that some old characters were brought back.  It was nice to see Princess Leia,/Carrie Fisher, very fitting to end the series.  Hated to see it end."
"Jan 27, 2020",positive,"I had read many bad comments about this, but I personally thought that the movie was great.  I think it did a good job at tying all the episodes together."
"Jan 27, 2020",positive,Great way to end the dynasty! Loved it!
"Jan 27, 2020",negative,an absolute cringe fest
"Jan 27, 2020",negative,"Terrible ending to a terrible trilogy. I loved the first 6 films. However, the only good movie since Disney took over was Rogue One."
"Jan 27, 2020",positive,Great movie. Superb cast . Best Star Wars
"Jan 27, 2020",positive,Adventure fantasy. Love it
"Jan 27, 2020",positive,I think JJ Abrams saved the trilogy by fixing and cleaning up Rian Johnson's mess. Thanks JJ. He came back and answered many questions that were opened up in the 1st film. Rian opted not to answer those questions and upset everybody by taking u turns with the story that  nobody wanted to see. I do wish a certain relationship got its clarity or was materialized. It began to catch fire in the 1st film and the second film threw a bucket of water on it. I was hoping to see it rekindled. Oh Well. Good film overall.
"Jan 27, 2020",positive,Hard to close out a tremendously impacted series. This did a great job.
"Jan 27, 2020",positive,A fun time and definitely better than the Last Jedi. The whole trilogy leaned too much on nostalgia was not enough on story.
"Jan 27, 2020",negative,Disney should give SW back to Lucas. Fights are lame as fuckkkkkk.
"Jan 27, 2020",positive,I liked that it was Star Wars. Disliked the storyline and the writing. There were a lot of things that should've been left out and a lot of campy lines imo.
"Jan 27, 2020",negative,"Disney do not carry the torch as George Lucas would have. The story left much to be desired . I was highly disappointed by the final episode... I will never view Star Wars  the same way again... I love Mickey but I hate what you did to the Star Wars franchise, Disney!"
"Jan 27, 2020",positive,"I think this is a good conclusion for the series. The loose ends were tied up. The hope is there for the future. The main characters were able to succeed despite their flaws. It was not perfect, but it was satisfying."
"Jan 27, 2020",positive,"good story, great closure for this saga"
"Jan 27, 2020",negative,Unbelievable crud.  Thank god it's over.
"Jan 27, 2020",positive,Many opportunities were just not explored in this movie
"Jan 27, 2020",positive,IT WAS THE BEST EVER I CANT EVEN DESCRIBE HOW BEAUTIFUL IT WAS
"Jan 27, 2020",negative,It's not the worst Star Wars movie but it was the worst film I saw of 2019. Just because JJ's parents made movies doesn't mean he should
"Jan 27, 2020",neutral,"See it because it's Star Wars and it's not the worst possible night you can have at the movies, but this is derivative and a little goofy at times.  Is it the worst Star Wars ever? Is ok sure. But Great...that's in a Galaxy a long time ago and far far away."
"Jan 27, 2020",positive,I enjoyed the movie in that it answered some questions I had.
"Jan 27, 2020",positive,Fantastic! I have only watched a handful for this franchise and my kids wanted to go even though they have never seen one and we all loved it!
"Jan 27, 2020",positive,A great conclusion to a 9 movie series.
"Jan 27, 2020",positive,"I felt it had a good plot, continuity and kept you engaged, it was trie Star Wars."
"Jan 27, 2020",negative,Story did not make sense based on past movies and it was so boring
"Jan 27, 2020",positive,"Was at first sceptical, because it was the end. It did NOT let me down! A complete joy from begging to end! If you cry easily, beware!"
"Jan 27, 2020",positive,Overall a good story and great way to end the saga. Plenty of action and great effects. Would see it again.
"Jan 27, 2020",positive,Lots of Star Wars Easter eggs.
"Jan 27, 2020",neutral,"Although not a perfect movie and the trilogy as a whole was left in a steaming pile of shit, this movie deserves Respect on its own merits as Abrams tried to show the fans they still care. whether it's to late or not this film is a mediocre end to a rather troubled trilogy."
"Jan 27, 2020",positive,Absolutely loved it!
"Jan 27, 2020",positive,"Clearly unfinished... hops around more than a rabbit in springtime... Meh.

That being said, there's a great underlying story... too bad the producers didn't let it come out.  Save yourself a drive and wait for the directors cut."
"Jan 27, 2020",positive,"6.75/10. J.J. Abrams' determination to rely on the original trilogy as inspiration and direction for his own work is disappointingly apparent, finishing out the series following an incredible middle installment with a comparatively shallow, ho-hum finale. You know how it goes - the galaxy is brought to life by glorious special effects, pulse-pounding action, a great score, and awesome performances from the cast. But alas, Abrams can't rise to the artistic challenge issued by Episode VIII director Rian Johnson to finish the series with daring. Instead, he seeks to placate the rabid devotees of the franchise who can't handle any deviation from their own expectations and casual film goers who may have no expectations at all by bringing back previously dead and ever-popular arch villains and undoing some of the twists that made XIII so great. It feels like a movie that was focused grouped into mild tepidity, offering little more than fan service and nostalgia in an attempt to hurt no ones feelings while getting as many butts in the seats as possible. There are some wonderful character moments, particularly between the Po and Finn, who have found a wavelength that makes there friendship feel like brotherhood, and between Rey and Kylo, who build on their connection from the previous film that ends their characters arcs in a predictable but still pretty satisfying fashion (excepting a final, forced moment between the two that made me throw my hands in disgust). This probably won't be the final Star Wars film, or trilogy. 15 years from now, some young film student who saw these movies in theaters will be the next talent to reintroduce us to a galaxy far, far away. I hope she or he chooses to follow after Johnson's example rather than Abrams."
"Jan 27, 2020",positive,loved the whole thing
"Jan 27, 2020",positive,"I have been a fan my whole life! Love all the movies and thought it was a great and touching ending to the 9 film saga! But I didn’t like how they brought Palpatine back the last one, should revealed him in “The Force Awakens”!"
"Jan 27, 2020",positive,"I wish JJ did the whole trilogy. He worked wonders for Star Trek's recent trilogy but only came up short here due to TLJ before it. Also, Ben didn't have to die. That was a huge unnecessary story error. Should've also been two parts, Episode IX, Part I and Part II giving the saga the ending that it deserved. But what's here isn't terrible, so..."
"Jan 27, 2020",positive,"It maintained the flavor and heart of the Star Wars movies, paying homage to the early films."
"Jan 27, 2020",positive,The movie was a bit long but definitely worth watching in the theater. Complex story line and a surprise ending. Well worth the ticket .
"Jan 27, 2020",positive,"Uma ótima aventura, ainda que com algumas falhas de roteiro."
"Jan 27, 2020",positive,"Great special effects. About 90-minutes of the 2.5 hours was fun. I am not a Star Wars fan and I liked it. My husband who IS a fan said it was good, not great."
"Jan 27, 2020",negative,"Awful movie,Disney and Abrahams should stop making Star Wars movies. Since when did Jedi become all powerful. This movie was more about cameos and cash mostly cash. 11 bucks Ill never get back. You would be better off waiting for this to come to TV and then still dont watch it !"
"Jan 27, 2020",positive,It was a great ending to a long saga!! I have been a fan since it conception!
"Jan 27, 2020",positive,My favorite of the sequel trilogy.
"Jan 27, 2020",positive,Great movie. Action sequences are amazing. Characters become more rounded.
"Jan 27, 2020",negative,Overrated 2 plus hours I won't get back. Suggestion wait until it's on free TV
"Jan 27, 2020",positive,So so so much better than The Last Jedi. This movie understood the force better and understood Star Wars better. Actual fan service that was very enjoyable. It’s amazing what happens when you make movies for the fans instead of your own self interests.
"Jan 27, 2020",positive,"I expected a little more story wise. However, it did bring all of the open questions to a close. However the new trio storyline was not as strong as Luke,Leia and Han"
"Jan 27, 2020",positive,it is very much like all the rest but if you are a Star Wars fan then you are a Star Wars fan and need to see it
"Jan 27, 2020",positive,This movie did not disappoint!
"Jan 26, 2020",positive,"The beginning was very rapid in the story sequence.. the platforms of the other star wars were more slowed to give the audience the emotion and felt sort of robbed of it. The timeline was great, and well told. To complete the saga this way was great, I do miss “The Lucas Touch” to the series though. Overall it was great."
"Jan 26, 2020",negative,"Ripped off  Doctor Who with the ending. 1st half of movie is just an clumsy stumble through ""Star Wars"" locales. Bad work editing in Carrie Fisher was morbid and nonsensical."
"Jan 26, 2020",negative,"You can only enjoy this movie, as my daughter did, if you know or care nothing about Star Wars and the mythos it represents. Where Last Jedi tried to be iconoclastic, basically saying ""jedi and Sith, all failures and outdated concepts, the world is gray and it needs new heroes"", Rise of Skywalker tried to be an anime cartoon. The story was non-sensical, almost as if these sweeping visuals were filmed then someone said,""Okay great, now think of the way to script this in."" And in the most egregious violations of story writing, adding in characters or new hitherto unknown plot devices just to justify a cool scene. So you introduce a new female character just to have horses in space?  And you introduce a new force power to make the final scenes you shot have some sort of cohesion?  If this movie wee not Star Wars, if it was a mid-budget sci-fi channel offering, it would have been cancelled before it aired. One star for ""wow that was like a way cool visual"" and one half star for not killing Chewbacca."
"Jan 26, 2020",positive,"For a conclusion of a 9 film saga, I was not satisfied. 
For a closing to the 'sequel trilogy' I was not satisfied.
For an action film (by itself), it's ok, but not good. 
It lacked character moments, but had a lot of spectacle.
This was that bi-product of a studio making a trilogy w/out a roadmap."
"Jan 26, 2020",positive,"Not bad, not bad at all."
"Jan 26, 2020",positive,Great movie kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time.
"Jan 26, 2020",negative,"Simply exemplary of the kind of frenetic pacing, weak plot, nonexistent character development, and over-reliance on nostalgia that is the hallmark of both JJ Abrams and the Disney Star Wars films in general.  It made no sense in the Star Wars universe nor would it have as a stand alone film.  I found it jarring, irritating, insulting, and genuinely difficult to watch. 

If you care little to nothing about good writing, clever and well developed plots, original concepts, or the classic Star Wars saga in general, and just like fast paced video game style plot jumps and fetch-em quests, then this film might entertain you.  Personally, I found it exemplary of the entire Disney SW sequel trilogy: pathetically conceptualized, very poorly executed, and an insult to the Star Wars legacy and all the writers and craftspeople who helped create it, and to fans of both the Star Wars saga and good movies in general.

Furthermore, this film is so objectively and demonstrably poor, that any critic giving it an overall positive review will have unquestionably lost any credibility or respect in my view.  If you ever meet someone who claims to be a professional film critic, and they tell you that this was a good movie,  you can go ahead and laugh directly in their face. I certainly will."
"Jan 26, 2020",positive,"After the previous film, to critics’ delight, trampled on major characters, tossed a raft of foreshadowed events out the window, and generally played like that guy in a shared story’s attempt to ruin it for everyone, this film manages to get the main story wrapped up, with some fun and excitement along the way."
"Jan 26, 2020",positive,Great end to the saga. A couple of times things worked out way to fast or too conveniently but still an amazing movie.
"Jan 26, 2020",positive,I liked the surprise ending.
"Jan 26, 2020",positive,great ending to a wonderful saga.  don't listen to the critics.  see it anyway
"Jan 26, 2020",positive,"I’m a huge Star Wars fan, and Rise of Skywalker didn’t disappoint after the dud of The Last Jedi. Overall this installment of the saga is an action packed fun movie that ties up a lot of loose ends. Also my favorite era of Star Wars is the Clone Wars, and in one scene in particular pays homage to the Jedi of yesteryear when Rey hear’s the voices of Anakin Skywalker, Mace Windu, Yoda, Obi Wan Kenobi and more, easily my favorite scene in the film. The only thing that would really make this movie for me would be the return of Anakin Skywalker, the true Chosen One, even if he was a Force Ghost Anakin should’ve had a hand in the final destruction of Palpatine. After all George Lucas has even said Star Wars is the story of Anakin, not even Luke, and to not include him in any way  in the final chapter of the SKYWALKER Saga is a totally wrong and a huge missed opportunity, but it didn’t ruin it for me. In conclusion I highly suggest you see this one, I actually think it is the Strongest of the 3 sequel trilogy films and it’s packed with nostalgia for us that grew up with the franchise."
"Jan 26, 2020",positive,"A lovely tribute to a story the spans the hearts of so many generations. Regardless of your views on the cannon, this is a wonderful film - enjoy it."
"Jan 26, 2020",positive,Thought is was a great end to the saga
"Jan 26, 2020",positive,Eff the critics and negative fans
"Jan 26, 2020",positive,"Third time, still loved it!"
"Jan 26, 2020",positive,Fun and engaging but plot wise stupid but good stupid.
"Jan 26, 2020",positive,Not a huge Star Wars follower but my daughter wanted to see this movie. I thought for the movie being 2 1/2 hours long it kept me interested.
"Jan 26, 2020",negative,"0/10 story.
I have seen better scripts written by 12-year-olds.
the script is basically a bad fanfic"
"Jan 26, 2020",positive,"A poignant and powerful conclusion. Not flawless, but strong and masterful. It was what we needed it to be."
"Jan 26, 2020",positive,not what I expected but kept my interest.
"Jan 26, 2020",positive,"Much better than Last Jedi, which a terrible disappointing film."
"Jan 26, 2020",positive,I really enjoyed start wars and im not a start wars person
"Jan 26, 2020",positive,Great model! Action packed and great storyline.
"Jan 26, 2020",negative,"Too neatly wrapped up. At times confusing. For a movie that ran over 2 1/2 hours, your think there's be more memorable scenes.
Not a terrible movie but I expected more."
"Jan 26, 2020",positive,"Loved it I have seen all of the Star Wars movies, I remember seeing the first one on the big screen at a one screen theater."
"Jan 26, 2020",positive,Not perfect but pretty good.  I liked how we seemed to be going full circle.
"Jan 26, 2020",positive,"As a big Star Wars fan, I enjoyed this movie immensely! The things that I look for in a great movie are all there! Great imagery, cinematography and special effects along with an understandable story line all pitchnin to make this one of my favorite Star Wars movies ever. I think it definitely ends the saga with a cohesiveness that will satisfy most all of us Star Wars fans. Definitely going to see it again as soon as possible!!!"
"Jan 26, 2020",positive,Absolutely loved it!
"Jan 26, 2020",positive,The movie was awesome!  The story line sucked!
"Jan 26, 2020",positive,"It is impossible to put 5 starts as Rian Johnson burned the opportunity to see Luke Skywalker finishing the saga, Lando Calrissian really saved the saga, thanks God Rian Johnson did not consider him in previous movie because he would be already dead, the appearance of Harrison Ford was unexpected and extremely nice. Kylo Ren is the only character of this trilogy that I can like, but Finn, Rey, etc are not at the level of Luke and Han, why not all these heroes from childhood together? For me Han could have died but at the end of the first movie, but in some point Lando, Han, Leia and Luke would have to be put together, that was a huge mistake and killing Luke in episode VIII in such a stupid way, because he used all his energy was ridiculous, Leia flying like Superman was another ridicolous mistake in ep. VIII, episode IX had nothing stupid like that. J.J. had to keep some consistency with eiposode VIII so Luke had to appear only as ghost :( and he had to keep this stupid connection that Kylo and Rey had, stupid things that Rian Johnson created and destroyed Star Wars, J.J. had to save the film with Lando and with the remaining Leia's unused footage. People criticize J.J. for the poor plot and lack of imagination, but people forget that he had a great challenge left by the atrocity that Rian Johnson created and movie had to be focused to fix episode VIII so it could not be much better."
"Jan 26, 2020",positive,Great movie. Balance in the force finally.
"Jan 26, 2020",positive,Great ending to the Star Wars saga or was it?????
"Jan 26, 2020",positive,I loved everything about it.
"Jan 26, 2020",positive,JJ Abrams did a nice job of ending the sequel trilogy.  Corrected a number of plot mistakes from The Last Jedi.  Fun and action packed movie.
"Jan 26, 2020",positive,"This movie is a very tough one to review for me. On the one hand, I'm a major Star Wars fan and enjoy almost all the movies and content. However, this movie also feels like kind of a play by the book movie, but done well. So my final decision is that this movie is a good movie. It relies on nostalgia, but if you're a Star Wars fan, this is a must see and probably my favorite of the new trilogy."
"Jan 26, 2020",positive,Similar to return of the jedi. Just differant actors. Still was a good movie.
"Jan 26, 2020",positive,I though it was a good ending to Star Wars I did not see Ben ending that it was good liked to of seen more of how life goes on with Ray
"Jan 26, 2020",positive,"When your lead character literally falls into a pit and accidentally discovers a key piece to their journey, you know the writing is not top notch. There were a lot of things in the movie that were not earned, like Jedis suddenly having new powers. Looking past that, the movie did have some great fight scenes and stunning visuals."
"Jan 26, 2020",negative,"Awful, worst one of the lot..."
"Jan 26, 2020",neutral,Too cute and childish at times. Franchise has lost the charm and wonder of the original trio.
"Jan 26, 2020",positive,loved it. was the best movie yet!
"Jan 26, 2020",positive,I only went to complete the series. I found the movie generally boring.
"Jan 26, 2020",positive,It was great! One of the best!
"Jan 26, 2020",negative,The movie was okay but the end was pathetic.
"Jan 26, 2020",positive,Not the best of the franchise productions.  The story line was a bit predictable.. and I thought fighting scenes in other SW movies were better..  But it was entertaining and I found it cute that some of the older character types were featured...
"Jan 26, 2020",positive,It was a great movie
"Jan 26, 2020",positive,Soooo good loved it!!
"Jan 26, 2020",positive,Movie was basically a love story
"Jan 26, 2020",positive,"Great movie, best seen on the big screen! 

Great seeing some of the original Star Wars actors/actresses too!  

Loved it!"
"Jan 26, 2020",positive,"I like this movie, despite it being very nonsensical. Very unpopular opinion for some reason."
"Jan 26, 2020",negative,Disappointing. Resting reputation on the original.
"Jan 26, 2020",positive,Tied it into the rest of the series very well.  Rey was great.  Revising Leia's character to be more than she was at his late entry was a bit frustrating.  Should have tied in Yoda and Windu...but still very good!
"Jan 26, 2020",positive,loved it! after 42 years of watching this series i was very satisfied with how it ended. very fun and emotional as well.
"Jan 26, 2020",positive,I thought it was a good end to the skywalker story
"Jan 26, 2020",positive,"Great Movie-Sad to know it was the last of the this Star Wars series that I started watching in 1977.  Anyway hopefully any future Star Wars related Series will invest the same effort not to cheapen the Series.  ""May the Force be with you"""
"Jan 26, 2020",positive,Finally an end to the saga..Thought it was pretty darn good.  Slight twist at the end.  Glad they paid homage to all the ships and the past characters throughout the movie.
"Jan 26, 2020",positive,"映像エフェクトは酷くて光に弱い人や、身が悪い方は避けたほうがいい。
一方で40年という長い時間をかけて完成されるスターウォーズシリーズの最後を見るのはとても感慨深い。"
"Jan 26, 2020",positive,"While it's my least favorite of the new Star Wars movies, I also think adding another half-hour would help it. It is missing so important meat that I'm sure was shot... which is too bad considering how good some of it is."
"Jan 26, 2020",negative,"Not even poop smeared on celluloid anymore, it is all digital."
"Jan 26, 2020",negative,"I thought the special effects were horribly done. I live the Star Wars movies, however, this was the worst one, by far."
"Jan 26, 2020",positive,"The movie felt rushed,overall great !"
"Jan 26, 2020",positive,So glad I went to the theater to see. Saw the first at the drive in in the 70s.
"Jan 26, 2020",positive,"I am a Star Wars Fan, so I really enjoyed this movie as well."
"Jan 26, 2020",positive,The acting was great.  The special affects perfect.  Loved it.
"Jan 26, 2020",positive,Very good movie.  Loved the plot and how it leaves an opening for the future of the  Star Wars saga.
"Jan 26, 2020",negative,"This Disney trilogy was a disaster, the movie was a mess with little originality and I'm pretending it was never made."
"Jan 26, 2020",positive,"I like this one waaaayyyyyy better that the last 2 in the series. The storyline made sense and you could follow it without a whole bunch of existential bs muddying the water. It was still there, but not as bad."
"Jan 26, 2020",negative,"This movie was a wild and fun ride, however it is identical to how it starts. The movie starts with Poe gaining important intel and then hyperspace skipping to multiple points in the universe with the goal of reaching their destination. That right there is this movie in a nutshell. The characters jump from place to place without developing the story or the characters themselves, the only goal is to reach the destination and end the series. Don't get me wrong, there are some cool moments in the movie, but as a whole, I think the movie is horrible, on its own and as the ending of the trilogy (I think it ruins the overall sequel trilogy by itself). 

As a viewer, I didn't have a chance to become invested in any of the new locations or characters introduced in this film, it breezed past them too fast. And for the returning characters, they had so many fake-out deaths that it makes the movie kind of meaningless (kills Chewie but wait he was on another ship that wasn't shown and survives). There were so many cool ideas, like how other stormtroopers have deserted the First Order like Finn, but they weren't fleshed out either (just like the characters or destinations). Instead, the movie just keeps trudging forward with all its issues without giving a shit. 

The thing I hate the most is Emperor Palpatine, he didn't need to be in the film. Palpatine served his reason in the original as the reason for Anakin turning back to the light and fulfilling his role as the chosen one. This movie essentially null and voided both the original and prequel trilogies with this one character addition. And what's worse is they didn't even explain why the Emperor returned, they just give a vague and frankly bad opening crawl. Like if there was an explanation for why the Emperor returned and what his plan was I think I could have been more invested. 

Personally, I think this movie is trash. Disney should delete what they have and try to redo the entire movie. Give us a satisfying and proper ending. One last note: for as messy as the Last Jedi was, I can look back and appreciate the movie for what it tried to accomplish and I now believe the Last Jedi to be one of the greatest Star Wars movies of all time. This movie helped me realize how Amazing Rian Johnson and his vision for Star Wars were because this movie is anything but that, The Rise of Skywalker lacks story, character development, and significance. Definitely the worse Star Wars movie of all time (yes it is worse than the Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones because at least they had a purpose and a vision in their trilogy)."
"Jan 26, 2020",negative,"Long and boring in spots, some scenes left me wondering why...Ive seen better acting. Visually wonderful, the writing is awful. Rey has one expression, Fins only line in every scene is: Rey! This isnt cannon."
"Jan 26, 2020",positive,"Grest acting and special visuals. Am amazing, vibrant and touching ending  for the Skywalker Saga."
"Jan 26, 2020",positive,It is a fantastic movie and will entertain for many years to come. I cannot wait to watch them in a marathon. It is offcourse similar to the first 3 movies but that is what makes it so much fun to watch. Hope you enjoy it as much as I have.
"Jan 26, 2020",negative,"Not the worst of the franchise, but a far departure from the original trilogy. This thing was thrown together and it looks like it. Continuity be dammed! We are already using light speed as a weapon, why not bring back emperor Palpatine, the REAL Palpatine, and do the same thing we did in Jedi.... but this time with a girl. 

 Is now completely screwed the pooch with this entire trilogy, but the good news is there's nowhere to go but up. Hopefully grown ups take charge and make better decisions. What a completely wasted opportunity these past three movies have been."
"Jan 26, 2020",positive,Good always Prevails
"Jan 26, 2020",positive,Finally story lines come together. A great ending to the saga.
"Jan 26, 2020",negative,"Special effects of boom whizz pow keep my primal and inferior instincts as a human amuzed.

The intellect behind the story narrativd and what drives (poor)character development  could have been mistakenly written by myself seeming I failed my english major. 

I expected a lot more cohesiveness between the movies and a longer build up to a meaningful end. I should have known better.

Movie goes like this.... bad guysssss oh noo we need to stop them! How? We need this thing it will help... but where to find it.. who knows where it is? I do. Ok cool how do we get it... ok we got it now we need more help.. but who will help?? We will all help! Yay.

End"
"Jan 26, 2020",negative,"What could have been! The film lacked any and all forms of character development or logical plot clarity. The characters visit 47 different planet, have 23 battles, meet 119 new characters and out of all that nothing feels genuine or interesting. Everything is so rushed that nothing worthy of our emotions actually happen. Does anyone in this series actually die for good? Also, what happened to Rey being a ""nobody""?  Is the Force only passed through bloodline now? It seems like, unless Rey has children, the Force will cease to exist. And if she is living her life out on a derelict, old moisture farm, she definitely won't be having any male friends over to stay the night!

The light saber duel on the wreckage of the Death Star was cool and at least Chewy finally got his medal."
"Jan 26, 2020",positive,"They did a wonderful job of honoring the original trilogy of the saga.  As one who saw the first Star Wars In the cinema in 1978 at the age of 8, I absolutely loved the movie.  Beautiful cinematography too."
"Jan 26, 2020",positive,"amazing, every little thing was amazing, i loved it."
"Jan 26, 2020",positive,It wasn't bad. It just wasn't good either.
"Jan 26, 2020",neutral,"It was okay, but the fight scenes were decent."
"Jan 26, 2020",neutral,Wasnt as good as I thought it was going to be. Was expecting a better light saber ending duel.
"Jan 26, 2020",positive,"I don't get the complaints. Gotta be all the comic con fanatics. This story was different but it was refreshing, entertaining and a well done story at that."
"Jan 26, 2020",negative,Absolutely horrible. One of the worst films I've seen in recent years. Destroyed everything that the original movies stood for. It's best to pretend this entire trilogy doesn't exist.
"Jan 26, 2020",positive,The best star wars ever! Kylo Ren and his story and ending are sad but amazing. John Williams did it again. JJ Abrams did it again. Ignore the haters. The only negative is that it ended what should never have been ended and should've brought us more like this
"Jan 26, 2020",negative,Such a disappointment for me.  I grew up and the 70's and have closely followed all the Star Wars movies.  This one is just too wordy for me and I got so bored with the presentation.  This show has to much potential to be amazing beyond words.  The final conflict for the last movie was such a major let down.  This story landed with a giant thud for me.  Give me Jedi's that come out thick as can be fighting the dark side!  And after so many years show me some major technologies in aircraft abilities.
"Jan 26, 2020",positive,best one of the three
"Jan 26, 2020",positive,Nice conclusion to the Star Wars saga.
"Jan 26, 2020",positive,"Of course, the main atoryline went astray. There were too many contemporary issues. Altho, it did keep me on the edge of my seat, 75% of the time. Overall, in line with the last 3 of the saga, it rates third!"
"Jan 26, 2020",positive,"Really good but... reylo was RUINED at last because Ben died??
#bringbensoloandreyloback"
"Jan 26, 2020",positive,I mean come on its star wars. nuff said
"Jan 26, 2020",positive,nice end to the whole series.
"Jan 26, 2020",negative,Horrible. Worst Star Wars movie ever and just a terrible movie in general.
"Jan 26, 2020",positive,I went in with an open mind and really enjoyed the movie
"Jan 26, 2020",negative,This movie does not belong in the Star Wars universe.
"Jan 26, 2020",positive,It was an okay movie. Not enough action compared to the others. At least Ben Solo rose from the foam pit.
"Jan 26, 2020",positive,Saw this movie for the second time and it was better than the first showing. Although I can’t wait for the JJ cut 😉
"Jan 26, 2020",neutral,Not what I expected.
"Jan 26, 2020",positive,"Absolutely fantastic. I've seen every Star Wars movie and spin off and they went all out for this one. And although sadly, it wraps things all up very nicely. I was like a kid sitting there with my bucket of popcorn, and half keg of soda. Too bad there won't be any more of these great movies."
"Jan 26, 2020",positive,"I thought the entire movie, beginning to end was awesome. Great story line, special effects, and some good comedy moments."
"Jan 26, 2020",positive,The EPIC space battle between the Final Order fleet and the Galaxy was insanely cool.
"Jan 26, 2020",negative,killed the originals
"Jan 26, 2020",positive,By far the best film of the series a good closure for the Skywalker saga.
"Jan 26, 2020",positive,"Pretty solid.  Lots of callbacks and reminders of what used to be.  Well acted!  Some plot points felt a little rushed, but pretty good!"
"Jan 26, 2020",positive,"Good but not the best. For 2 and half hours if did keep you interested but were times the story really slowed down to a crawl. It left so much open to other movies and TV shows to follow, so happy with that. End was good but didn't take your breath away. As always Chewie was awesome!!!!"
"Jan 26, 2020",positive,It was a great close to the story. I enjoyed it. Not as funny as some of the original movies. Glad to see Princess Leia.
"Jan 26, 2020",positive,"Not the best ending for the trilogy, but acceptable"
"Jan 26, 2020",positive,Great story line and graphics.
"Jan 26, 2020",positive,It was GREAT. A good end to the saga.
"Jan 26, 2020",positive,Great end to a saga!
"Jan 26, 2020",positive,Excellent movie I always enjoy Star Wars boys enjoy seeing them will be sad if they ever stop making them
"Jan 26, 2020",positive,I really liked it thought maybe it could’ve been more open ended I felt it was a little bit rushed at the end but overall the movie delivers
"Jan 26, 2020",positive,Bittersweet ending to the Skywalker storyline. I’m sure many will find problems with this new updated version of the tales of the Jedi v. Sith but not this viewer. May the force be with you.
"Jan 26, 2020",positive,Xbox theater is awesome.  really enjoyed Star Wars
"Jan 26, 2020",positive,This movie felt like a salvage mission making up for the last one.  like they're trying to undo some of the mistakes made and I think they did pretty decent job with that being said the damage cannot be fully restored and the franchise Canon has suffered for it.  It was a good watch though.
"Jan 26, 2020",neutral,Story line screen writing  disliked
"Jan 26, 2020",positive,Nothing to offer other than nostalgia.
"Jan 26, 2020",positive,Was entertaining but slow at times and was much of the same scene repeated. Maybe was good for fans who know all the details but for a casual watcher of the series could be better.
"Jan 26, 2020",positive,Really good action and was into the story the whole time! It's pretty good!
"Jan 26, 2020",positive,We thoroughly enjoyed the movie.  It was a good ending or beginning depending on how you look at it.   I would love to see it again.
"Jan 26, 2020",positive,Its STAR WARS in a galaxy far far away.How could it not be good
"Jan 26, 2020",positive,"Good, but the storyline is kinda jumbled."
"Jan 26, 2020",positive,very good movie. Definitely the best out of all the new Star War movies.
"Jan 26, 2020",positive,Great special effects. Good plot line
"Jan 26, 2020",negative,Adam Driver was excellent.  Everything else drivel.
"Jan 26, 2020",positive,Wtf is wrong with you people?!? This is the greatest Stat Wars movie! Go see it!
"Jan 26, 2020",positive,"This movie was an excellent conclusion to the Star Wars series, yet still left room for spin-offs which is excellent! This visuals were spectacular and the actors did a stellar job portraying their characters."
"Jan 26, 2020",positive,Amazing!! This was my second time
"Jan 26, 2020",positive,As a Star Wars fan I absolutely loved the movie. JJ Abrams did an excellent job wrapping up the Skywalker saga.
"Jan 26, 2020",negative,Meh...it is what it is...
"Jan 26, 2020",positive,Loved it!  Great ending to another great trilogy
"Jan 26, 2020",negative,"A final conclusion to a long-lasting series, this felt completely rushed and horribly executed. As a person who was a huge fan of the Force Awakens and The Last Jedi this film feels completely out of place character and story-wise. The introduction of the main plot twist alone opened a gateway to many plot holes, while all development established in previous films was thrown out the door for 'cool action scenes'. The pacing of the film itself made the movie feel like it was running a marathon and I couldn't register anything until my second viewing. The one positive I have for the film is the amazing soundtrack, visual effects and chemistry each actor share with each other to execute their scenes together. I would recommend this film to casual viewers of the series or as something to run in the background while doing something else."
"Jan 26, 2020",negative,"This movie really pandered to the fanboys without any regard to the Last Jedi. TLJ contained a lot of meaningful storylines and content that were erased from the final film in the trilogy. What a let-down to end the Skywalker saga this way. I felt confused as to what direction they took characters and storylines the entire film. The plot was rushed, and resolutions were never satisfied, and nothing made sense. Many ideas and characters were thrown in at random as well. After Jurassic World 2 was so terrible, I was worried about Colin Trevorrow as a writer and applauded when he was fired. After hearing his version and how he connected The Last Jedi to the final Skywalker film, I only wish I could turn back time and bring him back. I don't know what they were thinking with this movie.  If I wanted to experience a man with a small ego trying to disregard something artistic, I could have just gone to Buffalo Wild Wings and talked to frat boys. Jenny Nicholson reviewed how terrible this movie is on Youtube. Highly recommend that over wasting your money on this film."
"Jan 26, 2020",negative,"If I had to sum up my mood during this movie in one word, it would be ”bored.”"
"Jan 26, 2020",positive,Hate to see the saga end! All the past Jedis should have appeared including Ben.
"Jan 25, 2020",positive,great end to the saga
"Jan 25, 2020",positive,was not as bad as i thought it would be
"Jan 25, 2020",positive,I went in thinking I would hate it and loved it!
"Jan 25, 2020",positive,I liked how it tied all the other episodes together.
"Jan 25, 2020",positive,might be one of the best
"Jan 25, 2020",positive,Keeps a great flow going right from the start and gets even better as the movie goes in
"Jan 25, 2020",positive,Did not feel like the epic ending to the Star Wars saga.
"Jan 25, 2020",negative,"On its own it was fun, if not confusing. The special effects are nice and Lando Calrissian was nice to see. However, Palpatine came out of nowhere and Abrams was too busy playing catch-up in trying to undo Rian Johnson's mess."
"Jan 25, 2020",positive,Great movie even for our young kids. Connected all of the previous movies so nicely! My son said he can’t wait for the next episode!!
"Jan 25, 2020",positive,"Movie was entertaining. definitely things they could have done better, but overall I enjoyed the story."
"Jan 25, 2020",neutral,It was boring to me.. just more of action of earlier films. I almost fell asleep during the first hour.
"Jan 25, 2020",positive,The best of the latest Skywalker trilogy. -Go
"Jan 25, 2020",positive,Satisfying ending to this story
"Jan 25, 2020",neutral,"An awful, messy ending and payoff to the new trilogy. Lots of elements clearly thrown together quickly to try and piece together a cohesive story. Technically impressive as always, however."
"Jan 25, 2020",positive,The movie was so good 
"Jan 25, 2020",positive,"It keeps the innate themes , and i actually liked the twist."
"Jan 25, 2020",positive,"One of those films you really need to see the precious ones to enjoy it. Else, great special effects, outstanding weekend entertainment."
"Jan 25, 2020",positive,"The Rise of Skywalker brings an end to the saga that fans will enjoy and be satisfied with. The movie was very smooth, but had a little to much Disney in it."
"Jan 25, 2020",positive,"Star Wars: The Rise if Skywalker was the absolute best and most fulfilling conclusion to the Skywalker Saga. I loved it. This visuals, music, and acting were incredible."
"Jan 25, 2020",positive,Do Not Miss!!! JJ Abrams and cast do not disappoint.  FABULOUS FILM
"Jan 25, 2020",positive,They did a great job wrapping everything together!
"Jan 25, 2020",positive,Absolutely perfect. I don't understand all the hate AT ALL!
"Jan 25, 2020",positive,"Epic! It's not perfect but I can't wait to see it again. I would like to see the extended version because it's happen a lot lof things in short time, and some characters know hardly anything about them."
"Jan 25, 2020",positive,"This movie suffers from the fact that it had to answer questions from the first movie that weren't answered in the second movie. It's it far better than The Last Jedi, and a nice adventure between the characters we like."
"Jan 25, 2020",positive,"Solid enough I guess force shouldnt solve everything but I did like the character. This movie deletes the whole point of the last jedi. This has some good characters and it's very fun to see an adventure between Poe,Rey and Finn. A lot of fake out deaths shouldn't stay."
"Jan 25, 2020",neutral,very meh. pure fan service.
"Jan 25, 2020",positive,Good ending to the Skywalker story.
"Jan 25, 2020",negative,"didn't think it was possible to write a worse story plot than the last 2, but gosh darn it, they did it. Boring. Illogical. Glad it's over."
"Jan 25, 2020",positive,"As we all know when we were still kids, we live science fiction movies. This bring back memories."
"Jan 25, 2020",positive,The entire movie was awesome awesome awesome all I can say is just awesome.
"Jan 25, 2020",positive,amazing until the ending
"Jan 25, 2020",positive,Quick cuts in the beginning made me not care towards the end
"Jan 25, 2020",positive,"the best out of the 3 latest installments! nice plot twists, good action and unlike the previous movie - no annoying plot gaps!"
"Jan 25, 2020",negative,Garbage dump of a movie.
"Jan 25, 2020",positive,"Back to the same old, though without the earnestness of the Six Lucas' movies. Clunky as some of the past movies have been, this one is no better, especially with the rushed pacing. Weird vibe that everyone involve on and off and in front of the screen was just going through the motions."
"Jan 25, 2020",neutral,"It is a very messy conclusion to the franchise. There is a lot to dislike in this movie. 
Negatives:
- Palpatine coming back just kinda happens? Not really explained
- The story is very messy, rushed and all over the place
- The lightsaber fights suck
- Luke, Lando,Rose and the Knights of Ren are wasted as characters
- Introducing too many new characters 
- An absolute insult to The Last Jedi and not a proper sequel to it
- The twist sucks

There are a fair amount of good in the film though
+ Leia is handled very well
+ Phenomenal CGI
+ The real practical stuff are amazing
+ Some nice surprises
+ The ending at least feels conclusive
+ Great action near the end
+ Richard E Grant is amazing

It's not great and it does make you wonder what Star Wars Sequel trilogy could've been but at least its over now"
"Jan 25, 2020",positive,"The critics rate this movie very bad, but like a fan of Star Wars, this one is the best of the Sequel Trilogy."
"Jan 25, 2020",negative,"Kathleen Kennedy's trilogy destroyed the legacy of Anakin Sky walker's sacrifice.
Darth Vader remains far superior to a pathetic Kylo Ren.
New characters have no charisma.
Total failure."
"Jan 25, 2020",positive,Was surprisingly much better than I was expecting. But it didn't tap it's full potential of being a really good movie.
"Jan 25, 2020",negative,Poorly written and edited. Retconned the previous movie. Worse than The Phantom Menace.
"Jan 25, 2020",positive,Not the best but good movie to see
"Jan 25, 2020",positive,On the dark side .. too much mysticism; cluttered CGI; confusing family trees. On the bright side .. tons of action; lots of exotic landscapes and creatures; and clearly a crowd pleaser -- the packed house applauded no less than 8 times.
"Jan 25, 2020",negative,Meh.  Not worth the ticket price.
"Jan 25, 2020",positive,"This movie to be honest could have earned a lower score, but they finally gave an end to this saga and I feel for fan service this movie rocks but overall it disappointing lack of focus made it hard and it's pacing so if each scene was a new planet. If you are a long term Star Wars fan it will leave you disappointed in areas but leaping for joy they gave a respected end to the series"
"Jan 25, 2020",positive,"it was great
it didnt even feel like 2 and a half hours
kept me engaged  the whole time"
"Jan 25, 2020",negative,stupid ending to Skywalker..
"Jan 25, 2020",negative,The most overplayed and at least of risk-taking movie of the Star Wars saga filled with the most one-dimensional characters. as a huge Star Wars fan I thoroughly hated this movie
"Jan 25, 2020",positive,Awesome and spectacular episode in Star Wars saga!
"Jan 25, 2020",positive,I think this movie was good. Was not the best but certainly not as bad as critics say. It left me looking forward to what comes ahead in this franchise. (Yes Disney should continue making Star Wars movies for new generations).
"Jan 25, 2020",neutral,"I struggled to stay awake during the first hour. As an original trilogy fan, I liked seeing old characters reappear, but the cameos seemed random. Ive just had a hard time connecting to the protagonists of episodes 1-3 and 7-9. They’ve lacked the charisma of Hamill, Fisher, and Ford. It was a very good cinematically and the second half did pick up, but it just lacked punch in dialogue. What memorable lines from 1-3, 7-9 can you quote in a hurry? I remember moments like Hamill tossing his light saber in 8, but not much else. The ancestral characters were just cynically leveraged to get people like me into the theater but Star Wars now belongs to another generation and not mines anymore.  I loved Lucas’s homages to Kurosawa, Lean, Fellini, etc. I won’t go to theaters to watch going forward. I’ll wait for streaming at home."
"Jan 25, 2020",positive,"Since I had not seen the previous films, it was hard to relate to the story. The last Star Wars movie I saw was when the 1st 3 came out, years ago. I will try to catch up."
"Jan 25, 2020",positive,"Fun and exciting conclusion to the Skywalker saga. Not without flaws but the main story are (i.e., Rey and Ren) is worth every second"
"Jan 25, 2020",negative,What a piece of shit
"Jan 25, 2020",positive,Nice but a bit boring.
"Jan 25, 2020",positive,I liked it.   It was better than I thought it was going to be.
"Jan 25, 2020",positive,"If you believe the critics, this film is worse than The Phantom Menace. Which is insane. They are way overthinking it. I found it fun and entertaining as hell. I left my mind at home and brought my heart"
"Jan 25, 2020",positive,"Fuck the critics, they think this movie sucks and that the last jedi is the good one LMAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO"
"Jan 25, 2020",positive,"Such a great way to end a series (not perfect, but they did a pretty great job of paying tribute to an epic story stated 4 decades ago)!"
"Jan 25, 2020",positive,"It was definitely not my favorite Star Wars movie I've ever seen, but it also wasn't my least favorite either. While it did a nice job tieing the three trilogies together there were several times that it left the most hardcore Star Wars fans confused. It also seemed to be trying too hard to be deep, instead of being the cheesy Star Wars movie it was meant to be. However, there were some positives. The acting and directing both seemed to be pretty good. Also, there were a few cool fight scenes."
"Jan 25, 2020",positive,I enjoyed the movie and the connection between Kylo and Rey.
"Jan 25, 2020",positive,It was a good ending to an epic story.
"Jan 25, 2020",positive,Overall its a good movie. Great effects but the thing I didnt like is the movie really didnt explain how Palpatine is still alive.
"Jan 25, 2020",negative,Helmed by someone who doesn't understand Star Wars as well as he thinks does. At least it tries to undo some of the damage left in the wake of The Last Jedi. I wish we could have seen what Trevorrow would have done...
"Jan 25, 2020",positive,Great visually but a rather convoluted storyline.
"Jan 25, 2020",positive,Finn's character and story arc looked the most promising at the beginning of this trilogy but ended as the least satisfying. Although no-one asked for a love interest in Rose it was even worse to just ignore it in this finale and it soured his likeable persona. The Sith dagger and wayfinder were interesting Star Wars universe objects but the Goonies had more believable treasure hunting skills. The location of the wayfinder and the method of revealing its location was laughable.
"Jan 25, 2020",positive,Fuantastic computer simulations made it very believed and a fantastic fantasy
"Jan 25, 2020",positive,Great finish to a great story.
"Jan 25, 2020",positive,I think it wrapped the movies up nicely. But it was underwhelming compared to previous Star Wars movies. Personally this movie had some of the most boring light saber fights.. It's forgettable in comparison
"Jan 25, 2020",positive,"Despite the flaws, it's still a good way to end the saga !"
"Jan 25, 2020",positive,The ending was horrible.
"Jan 25, 2020",positive,Held true to the Star Wars story.
"Jan 25, 2020",negative,"Super rushed, made more plot holes to cover other plot holes.  That cool build up for the knights of ren in the first movie just for them to be a group of brutes that don't even do anything. The final order fleet makes absolutely no sense. That many ships plus all the crew? Where did these people come from. Not to mention  all the workers to build them.  And if palpatine was controlling smoke how did he not know about the dyad I'm pretty sure he even makes it known hes the reason for their communication/ connection in the 2nd movie. And don't get me started on the transfering objects thru the force and light speed skipping. And poor rose might as well been written out. Rose wasn't a problem it's how she written and then she has like 5secs of screen time after trying to make her out to be a major character. And wth was Finn going to tell Rey. I mean we have a good idea but we really couldn't wrap that up? Really no time? I tried to give this movie a second shot and it was even worse the 2nd time around because you can start picking it apart more."
"Jan 25, 2020",positive,Is it perfect? Definitely not. But overall it's a really fun movie to watch.
"Jan 25, 2020",positive,"Much better than expected. Dark edge, humour nostalgia and a decent conclusion."
"Jan 25, 2020",negative,"This movie just feels like it came about because JJ realised he had to finish the trilogy, and that's it. Cram as much fan-service as you can, don't bother with writing a proper plot or fleshing out characters who've been one of the only aspects to market the movie with and it's good to go. But eh, it's a mediocre end to a mediocre series."
"Jan 25, 2020",negative,"It's cl ear JJ Abrams set out to delete rian Johnson's work, a nobld mission, but in the process sacrificed a movie with great potential for one with a rushed plot and lazy writing and to many plot holes."
"Jan 25, 2020",negative,"Well, the franchise officially died for me.. 
This triology was really bad.

Especially this one was rotten. The plot was so random.. i mean seriously, let us just fall down some quicksand and voila, at the bottom is a cave with all the things they need.. 

Im glad this storyline is finally over. May you rest in peace skywalker."
"Jan 25, 2020",positive,this movie does not deserve a good grade but not derseve a bad drade neither. He is really disapoiting because we can see that he has a big potential in it but actually a really bad exploitation of the ressources he has. The music has no impact and this is a shame for a music like this. The shots are not really good and there is no big WOW in the movie. But this is not a bad movie. Rey is great there is some good moments in it just this is some movie ill rewatch in ten years saying well it exists
"Jan 25, 2020",positive,Excellent movie!!!! I could see this a few times just to catch things I am sure I missed.
"Jan 25, 2020",positive,Just get caught up in the story and feel for these characters! I know I did. Definitely worth seeing!
"Jan 25, 2020",positive,"Don't listen to the critics. They are the same critics who rate Last Jedi higher than Return of the Jedi, so that tells you all you need to know about how accurate they are when it comes to reviews. Is this film perfect? No. But it's not bad either. I enjoyed it far more than the last 2 movies that came out (Last Jedi and Solo) and as a fan of Star Wars I'm happy with the way it all came together."
"Jan 25, 2020",positive,"Nostalgic characters and even though the storyline was a little predictable, I loved the movie!"
"Jan 25, 2020",negative,I guess it was fun. But it was a bad movie and even larger disappointment for the star wars universe.
"Jan 25, 2020",positive,Alot of plot holes but over all good. Almost the whole movie feels to be a repair job for the dumpster fire that was Rian Johnsons crap movie
"Jan 25, 2020",positive,Good movie! With watching!
"Jan 25, 2020",negative,Nothing new. Disappointing. I had high expectations and they were definitely not met...completely dashed.
"Jan 25, 2020",positive,Cant stop..  need new adventures with Rey and Finn.
"Jan 25, 2020",negative,"This movie is over hyped, and can only be compared to the fall of Rome in its final days."
"Jan 25, 2020",positive,"I loved it. It has its flaws, but I was on the edge of my seat for most of the movie. Great end to not only the sequel trilogy but the Skywalker saga."
"Jan 25, 2020",positive,"I liked it. It was kind of cheesy, and story was all over, but it was fun. Critics are so critical, they definitely need to loosen up a bit."
"Jan 25, 2020",negative,"Love the performances of the actors, but otherwise terrible editing and rushed."
"Jan 25, 2020",negative,this movie was dumb as fuck lol. it deserved the 56% Rotten Tomatoes gave it.
"Jan 25, 2020",positive,While not as good as the last two Rise Of Skywalker had great moments but lack something
"Jan 25, 2020",positive,"See it of course, it’s the final Star Wars. Or is it?  My wife stayed awake, and that’s saying a lot.  For me it’s becoming too much like the comic book super hero movies.  A long way away from the originals, when life and the possibility of death seemed more real.  Nowadays, anyone can be resurrected it seems."
"Jan 25, 2020",positive,Wrong leading character for the job.
"Jan 25, 2020",positive,"As a traditional star wars fan, I enjoyed it. Like the new characters, like the old characters, story was rushed, but felt like they tried to fix the missteps in the previous two"
"Jan 25, 2020",positive,"I came into the movie with low expectations following the Last Jedi, and after seeing some leaks. I was pleasantly surprised for the first 3/4ths of the movie, however, with a final fight that makes little sense, wasted characters, and an extremely disappointing end, the sequels once again disappointed me. I enjoyed the force awakens, but with Rian Johnson directing a movie that made star wars fans as aggravated as The Last Jedi, and JJ Abrams trying to undo the entire last movie, the movie is just a mess in the later half. Is it bad? No. But it sure as hell is dissapointing."
"Jan 25, 2020",negative,"Pésima película, sin duda arruinaron la historia. Para mí starwars termina en el episodio numero VI."
"Jan 25, 2020",positive,"The music was familiar and great. The cameo appearances by former characters helped me follow it, but I couldn’t really keep up. Symbolism here and there went right on by, since I haven’t followed the intervening episodes."
"Jan 25, 2020",positive,"The best movie of its trilogy, perhaps if all three were written together it would have not felt like a puzzle that all the pieces had to fit completely perfect.  I wish the ending would have been different to end the saga. I'd still recommend as a good movie for both non and Star Wars fans alike"
"Jan 25, 2020",positive,"I liked that they kept Lea and honored her character in a respectful way. I liked the story line, it seemed the cast truly cared for one another in the movie and potentially true tears at the end scene. I think it was a great way to end the show but wouldnt have let Ben die/ disappear within seconds of becoming good. All in all I thought it was great!"
"Jan 25, 2020",positive,wrapped things up quite nicely
"Jan 25, 2020",positive,Its fine but the main conflict was cartoonish at best with the absurd scale and the revolution was good in the moment but unsatisfying and the movie was poorly paced and Rey's heritage was predictable after she used the force a bit but was obviously unplanned.
"Jan 25, 2020",positive,It was totally awesome!!!
"Jan 25, 2020",positive,"JJ did a great job cleaning up the mess that was The Last Jedi. This one was enjoyable, meaningful, and iconic unlike the rest of the series."
"Jan 25, 2020",positive,"Not quite as great as VII, VIII, better than VI."
"Jan 25, 2020",positive,"Awesome movie loved it, Cant get enough of this Star Wars awesomeness"
"Jan 25, 2020",positive,We loved seeing all the characters from Star Wars.  Brought back so many memories and was a great evening’s entertainment
"Jan 25, 2020",positive,Great movie one of the best.
"Jan 25, 2020",positive,Great movie and a wonderful end to the saga
"Jan 25, 2020",positive,"Well, it wasn't bad but it wasn't that great either, but could had been a bit better too. The story plot just didn't hav3 much connection and it was very predictable."
"Jan 25, 2020",positive,My favorite Star Wars flick of all time!
"Jan 25, 2020",negative,Please just start over this whole saga.
"Jan 25, 2020",positive,AMAZING. Stop what you’re doing and go see this NOW. You don’t even need to have followed all the movies. It was easy for even me to understand. Just go. Do it. You won’t regret it
"Jan 25, 2020",positive,"Pretty decent movie and fun to watch. However, it just felt like they were trying to fit two movies into 2 hours and a half, obviously to try make us forget the last movie. Overall its a very much turn your brain off Star Wars movie."
"Jan 25, 2020",neutral,"After second the viewing, I was less invested and began to see some of the problems and plot holes that I really can't blame JJ for since he was left with a difficult task of finishing a trilogy that Rian Johnson screwed over however, it's not this that bothers me but the lack of bridging all 3 trilogies as a whole. It felt more of a wrap up to the sequel trilogy rather than a saga unlike the Avemgers Endgame."
"Jan 25, 2020",positive,GREAT movie full of action and story line
"Jan 25, 2020",positive,"(this review starts off spoiler free but will warn for spoilers later) Okay so it's not perfect, but are there any perfect movies nowadays?
First off Rian Johnson and the critics of rotten tomatoes you're not SW fans. Secondly, thank you JJ you have brought closure to the mishaps of Disney, with a bit of happiness into the hearts of SW fans. 
SPOILER SECTION____________

So, this movie had to retcon all the retconned bs that Rian the troll had done in TLJ. So, it's a lot to take in. But, this was the first movie that was for the fans... Sure it lacked imagination but had a lot more than the previous two. It's action packed from start to finish and I only wish JJ and Disney had started off with this instead of ripping off a new hope with TFA. 
After coming out of the cinema from TLJ I felt lost it didn't feel like any SW movie before. All the others I had felt like becoming a Jedi like my grandfather before me. However, this movie gave me that same feeling of wanting to be a Jedi! This was great. 
Ofc there are going to be flaws but I was expecting a pile of steaming rubbish.
Action was really good too.
The flaws:
No character development, when you're trying to right the wrongs, the character building that was meant to happen in the 1st two movies really takes a bit on this one because you still don't feel any connection to the new characters. I mean when (big spoiler) 
Kylo died I felt nothing, reylo was almost as forced as finnrose (not nearly as cringe tho). 
Knights of ren...  I still have no clue what the point of them were, pretty much the next bunch of captain phasmas
Big spoiler 2#
Chewie's dead....no he's not ...that was literally the suspense allowed... If you're not going to make the moment count why make the moment at all? 
#3
I never once thought Rey would turn... Like palps saying kill me... Come on... He should have said "" I killed your mother... Like this (blasts her with lightning)"" she gets flash backs gets rage mode on... Is about to deliver the finishing blow and then... (Let your imagination do the rest, but for me:...) Luke whispers to her 'turn around' (Rey looks puzzled... Palps looks horrified) he repeats 'turn around' ...Rey slowly turns.. the camera turns with her then we see all the Jedi looking to her... Anakin, obiwan Yoda, mace qui gonn etc etc finally Luke. Palps face turn from horror to sething rage, his eyes glow a deep sith yellow, he tossed Rey aside with the force like a ragdoll (at this moment kylo enters from the side) and palps unleashes masses of lightning into the Jedi (maybe they could block it but...again for me:...) It does nothing so palps realising they're just ghosts turns his lightning up to the sky, same as the film, to take down the goodies... He shouts "" what can you do against my unlimited power HAHAHA"" anakin says "" your fate will be the same as ours"" palps face of rage turns into a look of confusion... his lightning stops ... The camera moves down to reveal a glare of blue from a light sticking out of palps chest... The camera turns and we see kylo with anakins saber in palps... Kylo's face is not of anger but pity and sadness, he's unaware of how evil the emperor was so he has no anger, but did what had to be done... Palps falls and dies... Kylo stands facing the Jedi... his eyes and Leia's connect.. she smiles... ""mum"" he says as he runs to hug her (guess we have Rian to thank for this ghosts can touch things now...but I think it works here to make a touching moment) tears stream down his face as they hug... ""I'm sorry mum""... ""No I'm sorry I shouldn't have left you"" Leia looks him in the eyes... ""You're so much stronger than we ever were... I'm so proud of you"" ...anakin says ""we all are"" ... Ben says ""it wasn't me it was-"" he turns hastily looking for Rey... She's still unconscious... He rushes to her side... he feels for a pulse but says ' there's nothing"" .. he cradles her head in his lap.. but removes his hand to find blood... turning Rey's head he sees a head wound... from when palps had thrown her... Ben places his hand on her head.. Although Rey healed him he has no clue how to do the same... He cries... Leia says ""You can do this... But you will have to pay a price... Are you sure you want to?"" Ben says Yes. Leia says "" feel her life force through the force my son... She's still there... Reach out..."" Ben says how. Luke says close you eyes Ben... He closes his eyes... Slowly after a bit Rey opens her eyes... They embrace and smile at each other... Kylo falls into Rey's arms... Vanishing... Rey looks up to see Luke Leia and all the Jedi... Tears in her eyes... Luke says to her... I knew you would not turn...smiling... You are the last of us... Then all the Jedi say ""may the force be with you"" each in turn. Rey says ""it will be.. as will all you""... ghosts vanish End scene then rest as the film... But Rey accepts her name to create a new legacy...
Just an idea... But hey JJ gave me and the rest of us the material to be able to have our own ideas on this... Meaning it's a good film just needed some polishing...
I realize this was supposed to be a review... I got lost in the moment there... Anyways watch it if you haven't done so already... Ps ofc there will be other flaws... I feel like there are some big ones but I can't think of them now... Oh yh also thanks for redeeming Luke JJ it was a nice close... But Rian Troll really messed up... Wish we could have had a Luke living battle for old times sake.. JJ did what he could... Last thing the Han bit was nice too, probably shouldn't have made his death so meaningless in the first place tho JJ... ah it's 2am... okay I'm signing off before I rang on anymore!"
"Jan 25, 2020",positive,"It was good, not great!!!!! But good!🤨🤨🤨🤨"
"Jan 25, 2020",positive,"finally, made one for us."
"Jan 25, 2020",positive,"Good action movie , but a little too long."
"Jan 25, 2020",positive,it was good to bring closure to Carrie Fisher's Leia. so sad. was disappointed in the end.
"Jan 25, 2020",positive,"It was a lovely conclusion to all these years of unfolding story. I loved the many subtle and not-so-subtle homage references, from the music, to the dialogue, to the cameos, to the classy but tender treatment of Carrie Fisher's role. 

A bit muddled at times for me (okay, now we're searching for the what again? that you need to be able to find the huh? to then unlock the thingamajig in order to.. save the Universe, right?) but who cares. It was great fun, and such a great place to enjoy it!"
"Jan 25, 2020",negative,seems unfinished cobbled together and with the battle scene between protagonist antagonist visually repellant. like having a strobe light flashed in your face for way too long. some brutal special effects in parts. by far worst of the franchise. bad movie period
"Jan 25, 2020",negative,"A bit better than ""Last Jedi"" but still lacking in the story department. A sad way to end (and bury) the Lucas saga."
"Jan 25, 2020",positive,"I liked it, not perfect, but enjoyed it nonetheless."
"Jan 24, 2020",positive,It was good I liked it. The ending was really bad for the last Star Wars movie.
"Jan 24, 2020",positive,"Amazing movie. Wraps up all the films beautifully, actually gives the fans what they've always wanted.
Critics are wrong. Don't let them trick you. This movie is great."
"Jan 24, 2020",positive,"I loved my experience of watching Episode 9 in the theater; my current total is 3 showings. The movie has a ton of beautiful action, and characters we've grown to know get to interact with one another in new ways. The future of Star Wars looks promising; kudos to JJ and team for their inspired results."
"Jan 24, 2020",positive,"Although it had the classic ending, it was a very well written movie and a very excellent screenplay."
"Jan 24, 2020",positive,"I love all Star War movies. I enjoyed this one too, but it did have a couple places where it dragged on. In fact, my friend next to me went to sleep while watching this one!"
"Jan 24, 2020",positive,Best Star Wars movie since Episode IV.
"Jan 24, 2020",positive,Really enjoyed this movie despite what critics are saying
"Jan 24, 2020",positive,"Fitting end to a big part of cinematic Americana.  Thoroughly enjoyed it!  Also, glad to see that Emperor Palpatine finally got his just deserts."
"Jan 24, 2020",positive,"An impossible task to wrap up this story.  I think they all did a fantastic job trying to tie off lose ends, keep it interesting and surprising all while telling an individual story."
"Jan 24, 2020",positive,"Enjoyed it. Wasn't earth shattering, but thought it brought closure to things that were needed."
"Jan 24, 2020",positive,Great finally for the series
"Jan 24, 2020",positive,About the usual Star Wars fare.
"Jan 24, 2020",positive,It all came full circle. It was a fabulous way to end this story arc
"Jan 24, 2020",positive,"It was good, but left too many plot holes, nonetheless I’m glad I saw it"
"Jan 24, 2020",positive,"Entertaining, well presented, good performances, overall good movie."
"Jan 24, 2020",positive,It was a little less ominous but was still great.
"Jan 24, 2020",positive,It’s does seem a little rushed but I truly loved and enjoyed it!!
"Jan 24, 2020",positive,"As for tying off nine movies full of disparate threads and diverging tangents, catering to new fans and old, increasing inclusivity without succumbing to tokenism or browbeating, and offering modern visual spectacle while retaining the old aesthetic, JJ stuck the landing.

I laughed, I misted up, I sat on the edge of my seat and I ultimately left satisfied. This was the best of the new trilogy."
"Jan 24, 2020",positive,"Movie had my blood pumping! I laughed, I was scared, and I ALMOST cried (no tears came out haha). Great movie"
"Jan 24, 2020",positive,Same old Same old...
"Jan 24, 2020",positive,Great finish to a beloved franchise! Keeping track of multiple storylines were a bit much
"Jan 24, 2020",positive,Same old fight scenes. Heroine has no self confidence over and over again.
"Jan 24, 2020",positive,The Movie was so exciting y funny. Also it have a good ending to all the Star Wars Saga.
"Jan 24, 2020",negative,Retread a lot of old ground. Didn't do anything particularly interesting. Set up more questions than it even tried to answer. It felt tired. Realizing that your favorite film series of all time can go out with a complete whimper was a humbling existential experience.
"Jan 24, 2020",positive,I loved that all the characters appeared in this movie
"Jan 24, 2020",positive,As a Star Wars fan it was awesome to see the future of the next generation !
"Jan 24, 2020",positive,My husband and I loved it!  Special effects were awesome and so was the story line with a great ending!!
"Jan 24, 2020",positive,Lots of action and special effects.
"Jan 24, 2020",negative,Don't bother with it. Hopefully in a decade or so they will just make a re-do sequel series a everyone can forget about the disaster that became of this attempt.
"Jan 24, 2020",negative,"-0.5 stars for rushing the movie and compressing different scenes too close together and for having forced and unnecessary scenes (such as Kylo Ren smashing one of his generals into the ceiling - that was unexpected and senseless)
-0.5 for no character development (except for Rey's heritage, but that's very little)
-0.5 for not going back to Coruscant and not having coming a full circle (Jedi Tower / Temple, etc.) and only showing Luke/Leia as force ghosts at the end as opposed to... a lot more force ghosts
-0.5 for allowing an abomination to live on and take the name of Skywalker over Ben Solo, a true Solo/Skywalker
-0.5 for wrongfully naming the movie ""Rise of Skywalker"" as opposed to ""Rise of Palpatine""
-1 star for not following Treverow's script which seems to be far superior to the release of this one"
"Jan 24, 2020",negative,This trilogy is no longer canon to me anymore. I prefer the Star Wars Legends/EU to be canon. Disney and Kennedy have no clue what the franchise is all about. Good luck ruining Indiana Jones.
"Jan 24, 2020",positive,Disney could have done better. I am a fan so you got my money.
"Jan 24, 2020",positive,It kept you on the edge of your seat.. there were twist and turns throughout the movie that kept you guessing and on the edge the whole movie.  Loved the ending
"Jan 24, 2020",positive,It was awesome that Ben solo came back to the light side and at the end where the resistance rose
"Jan 24, 2020",positive,Great end to the best trilogy
"Jan 24, 2020",positive,One of the best Stars Wars movies yet!
"Jan 24, 2020",positive,It was fine. Felt like there were a lot of holes left. Not something I’ll go see again
"Jan 24, 2020",negative,This movie is crap. Is the perfect finale for a crap trilogy. Thanks Disney for ruining a great story.
"Jan 24, 2020",positive,Loved it! A great ending to the movies
"Jan 24, 2020",negative,"Overall, it's the worst star wars film, because it gets the very basic parts of the story wrong, such as pacing, continuity, engagement, and overall logic. The movie may look great in the trailers, and if you just watch it without thinking about it you might enjoy, but as film, it fails bring all its elements together in a satisfying way."
"Jan 24, 2020",negative,"The critics got it right on this one. All of the ridiculous and horrible rumors were TRUE! What a dumpster fire of a movie The Rise of Sywalker is, perfect for an uninspiring Disney sequel trilogy. As a huge Star Wars fan, I find it a shame this movie is the end cap to what is considered by Disney the ""Skywalker Saga,"" which spans more than 40 years. There is no cohesive story to this movie or the entire sequel trilogy. Disney/Disney Lucasfilm had a chance to course correct the poor decisions made in The Last Jedi that really hurt the franchise but instead they chose to go full throttle. This movie, as the other sequel trilogy movies before it, is not ground breaking and goes out of its way to destroy yet even more Star Wars lore created by George Lucas. Destroying what Star Wars fans had enjoyed for decades. The original Star Wars was actually a cultural phenomenon and became a true classic. Disney is trying to change Star Wars, for some reason, into something it is not. What fan service is offered in The Rise of Skywalker (pulling characters out from the original films 1977-1983 especially the main Villain from Return of the Jedi) has not saved this mess of a movie and it will be forgotten. What a soulless cash grab by Disney."
"Jan 24, 2020",positive,Maybe not the ending that some of us were hoping for but still a good movie.
"Jan 24, 2020",positive,Entertaining. Had all the nuggets you would expect in a Star Wars movie.
"Jan 24, 2020",positive,If you're a big fan of the SW franchise you like the movie.
"Jan 24, 2020",positive,"It's normal film. Fans Star Wars don't know, what they want. Disney made good movie.  When the force awekens went to hire, all people said:""This is a good movie"". When was rouge-one,solo, nobody said, that disney destroy Star Wars. Please think about this.  I think, that people will like sequel's trilogy."
"Jan 24, 2020",negative,Way too contrived. Video was not good. Overall a giant disappointment!
"Jan 24, 2020",positive,Was totally awesome! Unexpected story line but so good without giving away the end.
"Jan 24, 2020",positive,"Mano eu achei top o filme so não gostei do filme como o encerrar da história, eu achei que esta faltando coisas mas o filme é ótimo, é Star wars."
"Jan 24, 2020",positive,Great way to end the epic saga!!!
"Jan 24, 2020",negative,"Star Wars : The Rise of Skywalker attempts to use the formula that The Force Awakens to make a successful Star Wars movie. It takes a Star Wars movie that was already successful, and copies many of its scenes. Unfortunately, a lot of the movie is also dedicated to scenes that say ""Remember what happened in the last movie? Well, it didn't really happen, or it didn't really mean that.""

While note as bad as at least one or two of the prequels, I feel like the end of this saga deserved better. Maybe the next trilogy will get it right."
"Jan 24, 2020",neutral,"the movie was fairly predictable, some major plans holes."
"Jan 24, 2020",positive,Original idea with plenty of great action
"Jan 24, 2020",positive,"I think palpatine was a necessary evil coming back to tie everything together. I think Rey and Snoke being nobody's really does nothing for the 3 new episodes. Creating the 3 episodes really made the ‘chosen one' theory almost pointless anyways so bringing back Palpatine added no harm in my opinion. I'll say it felt a little rushed, I think because JJ tried to repair overall storyline damage from episode 8. People were so excited from the trailer, they were given time to process. BTW the trailer was the greatest of all time. Disney should've been more prepared before starting episode 7 and have a common goal. I think the Mandalorian will have a plan to show Palpatines return, just a guess 🤞"
"Jan 24, 2020",positive,"I haven't really cared much for the recent group of movies, but this one was excellent!  In fact, I think it's the best of all the Star Wars movies."
"Jan 24, 2020",positive,"Great film for the family and fans, tied everything up the best JJ could do! Glad the main characters came back together again, The Last Jedi was such a disappointment."
"Jan 24, 2020",positive,Best one out of the last three Star Wars movies.
"Jan 24, 2020",positive,"The movie has MacGuffin, things when you say ""what the fuck did the writers do here?""; so it's no perfect, but it's a good movie that close 9 movies and 42 years. May the force be with you."
"Jan 24, 2020",positive,"It's... alright. It wasn't that good to be honest, and that's coming from a boy who absolutely loves Star Wars. The story is good, the music is obviously excellent, and the cast is excellent. But unfortunately, every bit of this movie didn't give me the energy I was expecting. I hear everyone never liked the ending, and so did I. Rey is not a Skywalker, and will never be a Skywalker!"
"Jan 24, 2020",negative,"Disney couldn't produce a product that appeals to normal people, so we got this"
"Jan 24, 2020",negative,As the end of the saga this film and two stars is not suitable ((
"Jan 24, 2020",positive,Good movie just so long !
"Jan 24, 2020",negative,"Constant action, but very little wit or soul. Much of story felt like checking off necessary boxes and no sense of surprise or improvisation."
"Jan 24, 2020",positive,Felt rushed but overall felt like an alright movie. Wouldn't call it the worst of the current trilogy but it was lacking.
"Jan 24, 2020",positive,Very satisfying ending given what a disaster Ryan Johnson left them to work with. There were some unanswered plot holes you just had to accept but overall probably my favorite out of the new trilogy.
"Jan 24, 2020",positive,"A lot of fan service, confusing story, cheezy and unbelievable final act"
"Jan 24, 2020",negative,"The worst Star Wars film since the prequels. Spends a majority of its runtime undoing everything from the previous installment and the striving to be the opposite. ""The Last Jedi"" gave us strong female protagonists, deep character development and the prevailing moral that anyone could be the next Luke Skywalker
 Rise of Skywalker takes those female protagonists power and credits it to the men in their lives. Rey is only strong because she was given Palpatine's strength, Leia's power is only their to serve Ben's narrative. Rose... isn't in the film. The characters do not grow and our left exactly where they were at the end of ""The Force Awakens"" I am immediately reminded of my disappointment with the final season of Game of Thrones. Similarly it felt like they ignored everything that came before and just regurgitated a story so that it could end. Beyond disappointing. For me ""The Last Jedi"" will be the last Star Wars film in my headcanon"
"Jan 24, 2020",positive,"I liked the story line, and action. Plus more character development. A lot of questions answered, but despite protestations of ""This is the Last!"", there were just enough doors left ajar for yet another adventure sometime down the road.
I don't want the story to end, but if this really is the last feature movie in the Star Wars line, it was a good one!"
"Jan 24, 2020",positive,Great movie and a fitting end to the greatest saga of all time. Audience score ftw
"Jan 24, 2020",positive,"Just passed the time.  Felt lost in story, even though I’ve seen them all.  Hoping this is definitely the last star wars movie.  No need for more."
"Jan 24, 2020",positive,"Best of the prequels and sequel. I honestly didn't want to see it after the last one, but I was pleasantly surprised. The exact same sentiments of my senior citizen mother."
"Jan 24, 2020",negative,"It's a disappointing ending. I've been nothing but upset lately just thinking about this bad, unrespectful, nonsense story."
"Jan 24, 2020",positive,Un buen final para la saga pero no el mejor. Lleno de nostalgia y contesta las preguntas que nos generó sus antescesoras.
"Jan 24, 2020",negative,"Disjointed plot. Rehashed storylines from previous sagas. Replaces a compelling story with grandiose setpieces and action. Drops interesting ideas from The Last Jedi and replaces them with out-of-nowhere and all-too-convenient tropes.

Lightsaber fights were good."
"Jan 24, 2020",negative,"The story does not make sense. This film will make you feel nothing at the end. Not sad, not happy, just nothing"
"Jan 24, 2020",positive,Greatest movie of all the times and I really enjoyed it a lot.
"Jan 24, 2020",positive,just like before，no innovation
"Jan 24, 2020",positive,Here's to you Rouge Leader 🥂
"Jan 24, 2020",positive,I think it was as about as good as it could be given the trainwreck that was the last jedi
"Jan 24, 2020",positive,Great ending to a story that molded my formative years.
"Jan 24, 2020",positive,A force to be reckoned with. Beautiful.
"Jan 24, 2020",positive,"I enjoyed the film. It had a bit of introspection in the form of Rey and her relationship with her surprise family. I feel that this was more than the usual action film we are used to.  I liked seeing all the old characters from the old days.... good film, go see it.... not a blockbuster but hey what is?"
"Jan 24, 2020",negative,"I don't care that it wasn't 'original', just that it wasn't good. It was not plausible considering the Star Wars precedent the previous (original 6) movies set. The stupid 1000x more powerful than the First Order army Palpatine had makes the whole movie moot. Why doesnt he just take over? 

Then why is his force lightening strong enough to incapacitate 500 ships but can't take on one lightsaber... and is over powered by two? 

This movie made me shake my head almost as much as the previous one, cannon fire from a spaceship that ARCS as if acted upon by gravity!!!!! WHAT IN THE!>??!???!!!? 

Star Wars Legends will always be my Star Wars. F these latest movies."
"Jan 24, 2020",negative,"Highly incoherent. Don't understand the premise ""destroy sagas"" with equality."
"Jan 24, 2020",positive,"The ending was not what I expected but overall I really enjoyed it. Not true Star Wars, but the best of the newer films."
"Jan 24, 2020",negative,"One star for the CGI artists. One star for all the actors. Zero stars for; Story, Understanding of source material, being timeless movie."
"Jan 24, 2020",positive,"Honestly... I thought it had just the right amount of nostalgia and absolutely amazing fight scenes. It was funny where it needed to be and everyone (characters) found resolve in life. I thought it was phenomenal and I'm a BIG Star Wars fan. The Rise of Skywalker was beautifully made and executed... also raised some questions that will hopefully be answered in a later film. Overall, I was more than happy with this movie... I can't believe people called it ""whack."" Although, Ben Solo deserved better 😞"
"Jan 24, 2020",positive,Amazing cinematograpry
"Jan 24, 2020",positive,"This movie was awesome! I loved everything about it. There was humor, awesome fight scenes, and a little romance. Definitely a must see. You finally find out where Rey comes from. I've always loved Rey's character in this new trilogy... something about very soothing... (I'd marry her in real life if I had the chance lol) Anyways this movie is appropriate I think for all ages."
"Jan 24, 2020",positive,"LOVED IT! Characters back on point, plot awesome and was so nastalgic!"
"Jan 24, 2020",positive,Lots of Action of course. Many surprises. Highly recommend
"Jan 24, 2020",positive,Weak last showing of an epic saga. Out with a whimper...... sad
"Jan 24, 2020",positive,It was fantastic. Lost of nostalgia which made it a great movie
"Jan 24, 2020",positive,"I dont understand the hostility to this movie. It is such fun, does an amazing job of bringing a satisfying resolution to most of the conflicts across the trilogy and has fantastic character arcs. Not a perfect movie, but definitely one of the strongest in the SW saga."
"Jan 24, 2020",positive,"Good things and bad things about it. Enjoyed most of it, but it's the only Star Wars movie I've ever fell asleep during."
"Jan 24, 2020",positive,Convoluted but action from beginning to end. I recommend I guess.
"Jan 24, 2020",positive,Very emotional film. Beautifully done!
"Jan 24, 2020",negative,Worst star wars movie ever.
"Jan 24, 2020",positive,"The movie left some stuff that I as a fan would love to see or feel, but it brings so much more than what it doesn't, that I already watch 3 times in the theaters. The movie brings an amazing and awesome closure to the saga!! No, it's not perfect, but there's no such thing as an perfect movie, special when there's so much diversity between the fans and the audience. In my honest opinion, forget what would you like to see, because everyone wants to see something, and unless the movie lasted 5 hours and had more than 50 endings, its impossible to please  everybody, see the movie like he is and you'll realize and see how good and fantastic it is."
"Jan 24, 2020",neutral,"Disjointed, way to much homage to long forgotten actors and or characters from the original trilogy at the expense of neglecting currently developing characters from this trilogy."
"Jan 24, 2020",positive,I loved it! It was inspiring. I pre-ordered it during the movie and then went to see it again to write down a few quotes I liked. It is strange that anyone wouldn't havw liked it.
"Jan 24, 2020",positive,Really liked it except for what happens with Ben Solo!
"Jan 24, 2020",positive,"I have been a huge Star Wars fan since the beginning (yes, I'm that old). While I have loved the characters and actors in the sequels, the story lines just have not moved me. While this movie is a million times better than Last Jedi (which doesn't say much), it was completely underwhelming and unable to undo so much damage that has been done. I actually almost fell asleep on my second viewing. Probably won't go see it a third. I guess it is time for Star Wars to move on to something different."
"Jan 24, 2020",positive,"Intense pacing, satisfying visuals, and a great cast help raise up the conclusion to the  trilogy where the story may fall a bit short."
"Jan 24, 2020",negative,"It's a very entertaining movie with tons of nostalgia and great graphics. Unfortunately that's all there is: more questions were raised and practically none were answered, the plot is silly at best, more main characters were added, the idea of death was thrown out the window multiple times, and none of the characters get their due. 

I love Star Wars and I hope Disney learns their lesson from this beautiful CGI train crash which we can't look away from. PS: Rey Skywalker?! WTF"
"Jan 24, 2020",positive,"I loved it. if you are into that type of movie, don't miss it."
"Jan 24, 2020",positive,"To the people that sit and give a movie part of a series bad reviews. 

It's fictional corny humor that made the franchise what it is today. You are trying to review characters that are completely ridiculous. In a time and space that does not exist. There is no theme or timeline the series needs to follow. Every story is unique to the series because it is new. I can't stand people that try to judge or rate something that was never designed to be judged or rated on any scale. Just go and enjoy the new characters and cheesy acting. We love explosions and blaster fire as well. If you try to get more out of the series than just entertainment then you are the fool.."
"Jan 24, 2020",negative,"Hugely disappointing. While Rise Of Skywalker has great visuals and some awesome set pieces, it was let down by a terrible plot, and an inconsistent script/acting job. In addition, the movie suffers from JJ Abrams' obsession with going ""bigger is better"" and needing to top the scale of the previous movies, which is exactly what happened in The Force Awakens. Sloppy, arrogant, and confusing describes this film through and through."
"Jan 24, 2020",negative,Once again they change the cannon of the universe to suit their needs.
"Jan 24, 2020",negative,The writing is horrible.... It's not worth explaining all
"Jan 24, 2020",negative,Lo peor imaginado que le pudo haber pasado a Star Wars
"Jan 24, 2020",positive,"Loved it, very well done..."
"Jan 24, 2020",negative,"Probably the worst of all nine main films. The big reveals are completely unearned, and in fact undo some of the emotional points of the previous films (Vader's sacrifice to save Luke in VI, Rey's reveal to be a ""nobody"" in VIII, etc.). Too fast and disorganized to have much emotional resonance, it's a sad way to end the Skywalker saga."
"Jan 24, 2020",negative,exhausting to watch. It retconned so many plot points from the original trilogies while the plot also made very little sense. I don't consider it canon.
"Jan 24, 2020",positive,"Thank you J.J. Abrams. Considering the perfect alleyoop (The Force Awakens) you threw to Rian who proceeded to clang the dunk off the back of the rim with The Last Jedi, this is your greatest masterpiece of your career. Somehow you managed to salvage the parts of The Last Jedi that were worth saving while erasing the rest from Star Wars memory. This movie was a beautiful Star Wars film with enough fresh and nostalgic tones to pull at the viewer emotionally. Obviously John Williams tickles the ear drums with new and classic scores giving us a sendoff to remember for the Star Wars franchise. This is the best, most fun Star Wars film since Return of the Jedi and something must be broken with the Rotten Tomatoes critical consensus at a 50% splat. I thought The Last Jedi was going to be awesome because of the RT score and I thought this one was going to suck because of the RT score. Opposite was true both times. There is some sort of echo chamber, groupthink, critic snottyism going on with our movie critics today. I don't get how this RT score is possible given the greatness (not perfectness) of this film and what it achieves given the stinker that preceded it. Bravo Mr. Abrams!"
"Jan 24, 2020",positive,Ok. Nothing special. Plot is running thin.
"Jan 24, 2020",positive,Loved it!  Hope they keep making more Star Wars movies.
"Jan 24, 2020",positive,I liked the connection to previous movies but found some disconnects in the store.
"Jan 24, 2020",positive,I really enjoyed this film. It seemed like they knew the other two were mediocre/bad so they made it in a way to really please the fans and I think they did a great job.
"Jan 24, 2020",positive,"I completely disliked Ep. 8 and felt that the trilogy was ruined beyond reviving. Went to see it with very low expectations.  Surprisingly, I didn't hate it. Like Ep. 7 and especially 7, there were some inconsistencies and plain stupidity, but it was a nice wrap up of the trilogy."
"Jan 24, 2020",positive,"Very disjointed. The cinematography saved it, because the plot was all over the place."
"Jan 24, 2020",positive,Nice ending to this beloved series.
"Jan 24, 2020",positive,loved it great movie
"Jan 24, 2020",positive,I enjoyed the movie. Yes there are story inconsistencies but it's a movie. It's purpose is to entertain which it did.
"Jan 24, 2020",positive,"Despite the criticisms, I enjoyed the movie. It was an interesting story about the Emperor, the Emperor's granddaughter, and the unique love between Ben Solo and Rey. The one thing I was disappointed by was that they did not show an explicit romantic relationship between Finn & Poe Dameron. However, I give it 5 stars. I can't wait for more movies,"
"Jan 24, 2020",positive,"I honestly loved it. It moved me, especially at several points in the last hour that I found emotionally charged, with several character resolutions that made sense to me and were appropriately respectful of the overall message and themes of the entire series. I was entertained and satisfied, but the mass of critical griping from others is puzzling to me, and not a little bit annoying. It was a damned good movie, and I want to feel good about loving it, but all these obsessive whiners have made that nearly impossible. Filter them out, and it becomes a much more uplifting experience."
"Jan 24, 2020",positive,I loved it. IDK why critics hate it.
"Jan 23, 2020",negative,It was inconsistent at best.
"Jan 23, 2020",positive,Personally I wish they would make more movies like Rogue One. I’m a fan of Star Wars but I didn’t enjoy any of the movies in this trilogy.
"Jan 23, 2020",positive,Tried to keep things similar to old star wars and introduce some new freshness did a decent job of it.
"Jan 23, 2020",positive,LOVE LOVE LOVE!!! I want to see it again!!!!
"Jan 23, 2020",positive,It was okay.  Story line could have been better.
"Jan 23, 2020",positive,"This film isn't quite as bad as I expected. I really enjoyed Last Jedi's best material, even if it had flaws. This film tried to accomplish a bit too much for its own good and has only a few strong scenes. While nothing got as terrible as Phantom Menace, nothing was too great either. It's not worth a movie ticket because everybody knows who will win between the good guys and bad guys. However, those who don't know Star Wars too well may really enjoy it."
"Jan 23, 2020",positive,I really liked it..  Rey kicked butt.. it was typical star wars but kept the suspence.
"Jan 23, 2020",negative,I would give it a “zero” rating if this app would allow me to. Disney has ruined this franchise. The main character is not believable. 
"Jan 23, 2020",positive,great way to end the trilogy
"Jan 23, 2020",positive,You do not have to try very hard at all to love it.
"Jan 23, 2020",positive,It was Star Wars. It’s been a part of my life since 1977. Nuff said.
"Jan 23, 2020",negative,"What a train wreck of a trilogy. It's Star Wars. Not Marvel. They're just shoehorning in ridiculous comedy. They're buying everything and throwing it into the same bucket. Up yours, Disney."
"Jan 23, 2020",negative,"This was the most derivative piece of crap ever put to film. They stole from Goonies and Endgame. Star Wars is the series everyone used to copy. Now THEY'RE copying others. They attempted to erase Last Jedi as if to please reddit, when they should have continued the story. This was bad fan fiction that would embarrass 50 Shades of Grey. Thankfully it's the end of the ""Skywalker saga"" and JJ Abrams won't be directing another Star Wars movie. He left mystery boxes in a CONCLUSION of a saga. That's just a hack move. Fortunately there wasn't a cry for ""Martha"" from the former BvS writer there were out of nowhere plot holes. I am rambling but this review is more coherent than the plot of this movie. See it and follow me into madness."
"Jan 23, 2020",positive,"If you didn't like ""The Last Jedi"", you will like this film.  If you did like ""The Last Jedi"" you might like this film.  It's a lot of fan service. As in, it answers questions you have about certain characters, peppers in some old characters, and tries to make an entertaining movie for people that are fans of Stat Wars.  Is it perfect....No. But considering it had to 1- fix a bunch of things from the previous movie, 2- had an actor die that was supposed to have a big role in this movie, and 3-bring a saga that has played out over the last 30 years to a satisfying close, it did a really good job."
"Jan 23, 2020",positive,It all seemed very unnecessary and could easily have been a 2 part movie and not a trilogy
"Jan 23, 2020",positive,It was worth seeing once.  Got bored in some spots of the movie.  Plot was meh.
"Jan 23, 2020",negative,"This is just a great disappointment to the Star Wars Series. It was barely passable to watch and I had a hard time staying interested in the plot. Everything moved way to fast, it had a ton of plot points and there was never a break in between the plots have the time I was still thinking about the last plot point by the time the fifth one came up."
"Jan 23, 2020",negative,Pure trash. It's as if someone handed a 4 year old a recorder right after they saw Star Wars for the first time and asked them to make up a movie based on it. They ran with it.
"Jan 23, 2020",positive,Good movie all things considered.
"Jan 23, 2020",positive,"Absolutely stunning, roller coaster of emotions, and action. Must see"
"Jan 23, 2020",negative,It is a complete mess. That pretty much sums it up.
"Jan 23, 2020",positive,"To write, direct and produce the finale to the greatest popular science fiction story ever brought to screen is no mean feat.  You have to combine a plethora of disciplines and keep it all within the Star Wars genre - because it is its own genre.  Well done all.  I can't imagine anyone being left wanting from this.  It is a true spectacle."
"Jan 23, 2020",neutral,"This movie just throws out a lot of the Star Wars lore that was setup by previous movies.  It jumps very quickly from one scene to the next, giving very little time to think about what is actually happening or if it makes sense. Visually the movie is great and so is the acting, but the plot makes very little sense especially if you stop to think about what just happened. How does that line up with that? How long ago did that occur? Why do they keeping doing that? Why not just do that instead of making it more difficult?"
"Jan 23, 2020",positive,"As a long-time Star Wars fan, I found the return of J.J Abrams as a blessing compared to the failure of Rian Johnson.
Still, as a lover of the original first trilogy, I feel that the overall Disney marketing is still present in the series, unfortunate, as Star Wars didn't need a new identity after its history and legacy.
I managed to enjoy this one, even though I was negative after the disappointment of the Last Jedi."
"Jan 23, 2020",positive,"I loved it!!  I was scared, happy, sad and mad, all in one movie!! I even cried at one point!  Loved Bens transformation!!!! Didnt expect the ending at all!!!!"
"Jan 23, 2020",positive,"I though that the movie was cool but there are major plot holes in it. Like how for some reason (SPOILER) Palpatine is alive. This makes the Return of the Jedi pointless 
which is stupid."
"Jan 23, 2020",positive,"Good action sequences. Story, tied up few lose ends from Force Awakens and some appreciated course correction from where The Last Jedi left off.  A touching and fitting last scene."
"Jan 23, 2020",negative,"I think this movie is subjective, and if you enjoyed it good for you, but I thought this movie was the worst in the sequel trilogy and that it really brings the whole trilogy down, and I knew when I was going in it would be bad, but it really feels like a fanfiction, where they just threw everything at you because of a lack of imagination. If I had to be honest, it wasn't the worst movie, but it's not worth your time."
"Jan 23, 2020",negative,"I have never seen a worse ending to a trilogy than this movie. It feels like they tried to overthrow everything what was established in the first 2 films in this one and just make a whole new trilogy compressed into one movie. Needless to say, it didn't work. I have never in my life walked out of a cinema during a movie (cause we all know who expensive that sh*t is), but my god, the first 15min of this movie almost made me. It's all over the place, not knowing what it's doing, and the worst part is how they massacred the legacy of Carrie Fisher and the character of leia. My god I have never seen something so disrespectful. It would have been perfectly fine to let her character die in the last movie but, nope. They had to create a CGI Zombie and feed it with prerecorded lines."
"Jan 23, 2020",positive,A clear pandering to disgruntled fans of the last movie. The problem is you can tell this was not the story that was originally going to be told .
"Jan 23, 2020",neutral,"Some of the nostalgia in the movie is fun and well done, but the narrative and how it compares to The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi is muddled and lazy. Bringing back a dead character from the original trilogy was a poor plot device."
"Jan 23, 2020",negative,They just remade the originals. No new story. No new ideas.
"Jan 23, 2020",positive,"Despite all the people complaining about the newer characters, I enjoyed it. It’s nice to see the fresh new people. I really liked the original cast, but their time had come. I hope Disney is planning on continuing to expand the story."
"Jan 23, 2020",positive,Movie was entertaining but same old same old.  Hope this is the end after how many years????
"Jan 23, 2020",neutral,"Much better than The Last Jedi, if you can believe it."
"Jan 23, 2020",positive,Loved!  Loved! Loved!
"Jan 23, 2020",negative,Disney definitely buried the Star Wars saga.
"Jan 23, 2020",positive,I thought this was a good conclusion. A little long and some characters should have stayed dead (C-3PO) But other then that a good final conclusion to this sequel trilogy.
"Jan 23, 2020",positive,The Disney Star Wars movies are inferior to the OG trilogy because they seem to have a hard time committing to depth- in a story arc & in a given character. Good acting & beautiful cinematography though. Could’ve been so much more.
"Jan 23, 2020",negative,"A absolutely shambolic film/storyline. This film try's to salvage the trilogy, but the ball was dropped to many times for this movie to save the day. Just glad this mess is over."
"Jan 23, 2020",positive,Continuation of the Star Wars story and the action!
"Jan 23, 2020",positive,"I can agree that it is a fast-paced movie. I do feel that the pace of the movie was a result of making up for the catastrophe left by Rain Johnson and the repercussions of TLJ. I was comfortable following the action that came scene after scene. in my personal opinion this is what I have always wanted to see in a Star Wars movie. It is called Star WARS for a reason. A New Hope was a space opera in which included action, a hint of comedy, awesome aesthetics and love. This movie included all those elements and more. The Lightsaber and Force ""fights"" and action were stunning and stimulating; something that I personally have wanted to see since CGI has become so predominate in the movie industry. I left the theater on opening night in awe and satisfied with what JJ Abrams did with what he was working with. If you haven't seen it please go see it before it leaves theaters."
"Jan 23, 2020",positive,Its the conclusion to Star Wars
"Jan 23, 2020",positive,It had to clean up a lot of issues from The Last Jedi. But it was a very good film.
"Jan 23, 2020",positive,"Though this isn't a perfect Star Wars film, I must say it was a thoroughly enjoyable one. It has all the elements needed; it was fun, exciting, humorous and poignant in places. I think there were some missed opportunities but J.J gave a satisfying conclusion to the Skywalker saga. I could give my views on how I think it could have been better, like so many so called fans tend to do or I could enjoy for what it is; a good old romp, which left me feeling happy. Enjoy."
"Jan 23, 2020",positive,Jj sticks the landing!
"Jan 23, 2020",positive,I loved the original trilogy as a kid but am certainly not a big fan.  This latest had it's share of holes or problems but ultimately the movie was fun and the effects fantastic.  like many people I think it would have benefited a lot from an extra few months of production however the final result we're still in my opinion among the best of the Star wars franchise. Then again I think my favorite movie in the whole franchise with solo...
"Jan 23, 2020",positive,"Imagine running in the desert covered planet called Passana with all of your friends from an insane empire out to kill you. Rise of Skywalker hit theaters on December 20, 2019, and it caused an uproar in the Star Wars community! Many people had many different opinions about the movie and I loved it! The director J. J. Abrams said that he wanted to finish what George Lucas started with a bow on top. 

In the movie, the beloved character Rey faces the final battle against the First Order while also discovering herself. She goes on an adventure with Poe and Finn and is joined by the beloved droids, BB-8 and C3PO! All the while Kylo Ren the supreme leader of the First Order will do everything he can to turn Rey to the dark side! 

The movie lets you get to know all of the characters on a personal level as well as discover more about their character arcs. A large turn of events happen and many twists and turns help you discover a new side to all of the characters and you also meet some new ones along the way! All and all it was an amazing movie and I would rate it an 8 out of 10 just because of some small plot holes and other things like that but I highly recommend it to people who love sci-fi-fantasy."
"Jan 23, 2020",negative,"A Ascensão Skywalker começa correndo e praticamente não diminui o ritmo durante suas quase duas horas e meia de duração. Isso funcionaria para uma produção de ficção científica qualquer, na qual explosões e belos cenários são suficientes para distrair o público, mas não aqui. Não quando se trata de personagens e de uma história que os fãs têm acompanhado há décadas."
"Jan 23, 2020",positive,Thank you for finally trying to make a decent star wars movie instead of a political statement.
"Jan 23, 2020",positive,Can never go wrong with a STAR WARS MOVIE..EPIC!!!
"Jan 23, 2020",positive,this is by far the best star wars movie out of the new generation (7-9)
"Jan 23, 2020",positive,"Love it! Some small parts didn't really fit with the overall universe, but I felt it tide the universe all together."
"Jan 23, 2020",negative,"This movie had an agenda that is evident in each scene. While it still serves up some Star Wars fun, it is rushed from the first scene and wasted time introducing new characters and retconning the previous film. This is a film that wanted very much to be the 2nd part of a trilogy as well as the concluding chapter. This film and the sequel trilogy as a whole suffer for this fact."
"Jan 23, 2020",positive,"Decent recovery from the dross of The Last Jedi. The usual visual effects and excitement levels are strong but for me this entire new trilogy felt much like a repeat of the original. Hidden family connections; characters redeemed from the Dark Side; unexpected romances; Jedis returning from the dead to guide the living. All very predictable really.

What was missing for me personally (and may have been left on the cutting floor) was maybe some gaps which could have been filled. I would have liked to have seen how Palpatine survived the fall into the abyss after Vader saved Luke, that would have been a nice touch. (Obviously he probably survived the same way Luke did by rejecting his father's offer to join him on the Dark Side, jumped and exited via a side tube).

Having said that, the way they used spare footage of Carrie Fisher to become intertwined in this movie was beautiful, and the manner of her passing was very moving. Brilliantly done!

Overall a nice enough distraction from the real world for about two hours, but not a movie I'm in a hurry to watch repeatedly. Hopefully now we can enjoy the new Star Wars movies in the years that follow and explore other parts of a galaxy far, far away.

Now what would be very interesting would be the Star Wars universe overlapping with our own star system. Will never happen of course, but Disney do like their profit margins! (I'll take 1%, Disney!) ;-)"
"Jan 23, 2020",positive,"Fantastic movie! I am a 40 year fan of this franchise. I saw the first movie when I was 11 and was blown away! I do not understand the critics hate filled diatribes at all. It was a fantastic movie. Well written, well acted and visually beautiful. Go see this movie on the big screen!"
"Jan 23, 2020",negative,"The film is a colossal calamity and betrayal of the SW history, not only is useless but also makes the previous film useless. The return of Palpatine was the most hardcore trying pseudo maneuver to try and save the franchise, where in the end it just did the opposite...
#garbage"
"Jan 23, 2020",positive,It was the perfect way to bring the entire Skywalker saga to a close. Anyone who complains about this movie has unresolved issues that have nothing to do with movies.
"Jan 23, 2020",positive,"Rise of Skywalker was a decent movie.
It had some cheesy parts in the beginning, but I thought the second half was good enough."
"Jan 23, 2020",positive,Meh I didn't like it very much
"Jan 23, 2020",positive,"In brief, this film was spectacular.  Given what the filmmakers had to salvage from the debacle that is ""The Last Jedi,"" all that could have been done to honor that story while providing a satisfactory end of the saga was done, and that more expertly than was believed possible.  It gets better each time I watch it.  Five times so far."
"Jan 23, 2020",positive,Great special effects.
"Jan 23, 2020",negative,"illogical film.  Destroys episodes 1-6  It feels  was made by someone who has a narrow idea of what SW is.   
Forced movie, they tried to fix all the holes of episodes 7 and 8 and feels like s***"
"Jan 23, 2020",negative,"A complete mess despite the efforts made by the actors and everybody else involved  in the making of the film. This trilogy is basically a continuity of poor narrative with no plan, a product with good vfx and visuals with the brand Star Wars on it for the money flow."
"Jan 23, 2020",positive,Awesome finish to the Skywalker saga. Enjoyable on so many levels. Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley give amazing performances that wrap you up in their Force Dyad!
"Jan 23, 2020",negative,"Decepcionante, JJ desfez várias pontos estabelecidos no filme anterior, ignorou personagens e tirou outros da cartola. Medíocre e covarde"
"Jan 23, 2020",negative,"Nothing new, very formulaic"
"Jan 23, 2020",negative,This movie is absolute bottom tier trash with its own cringe being its only redeeming quality if you can even bring yourself to laugh at it.
"Jan 23, 2020",positive,"Wow, this is hard.  I really wanted to like this movie,  it's so busy from start to finish, i would need to see it at least three times to get more of the details. Honestly,  it's just not worth the cost in money or time. All the characters I've been invested in were gone after the last disaster of a movie. There's a reason that Disney's going in a different direction with their next SW movie,  hope they figure out SW before they make it."
"Jan 23, 2020",positive,"It is a compact film with pace though between events. There were some exaggerations related to the use of the force (i.e. the passing of the lightsaber from Rey to Ben behind her back through the force).
In general it was a pleasing movie with great cinematography,great shots and landscapes. I enjoyed a lot the character of Babu Frick and C3PO's humour and Rey tapping to the dark side, releasing lightning.
Looking forward to rewaching the movie soon."
"Jan 23, 2020",negative,"Boring plot, could not stay awake while watching it."
"Jan 23, 2020",positive,Best star wars movie ever
"Jan 23, 2020",positive,"I don't know how many times can i give a 5 star rating to this movie by my account..i've watched the Rise of Skywalker and i am more convinced that the last jedi should not even exist in the first place! There should be another movie to change the 2nd story of the new trilogy to suit better with the Rise of Skywalker..Rian might be a good director himself,but this is a mess for the entire story..i love The Force Awakens and Rise of Skywalker, but i completely loath the story of the last Jedi, however beautifully made it is..JJ, please make another star wars story.."
"Jan 23, 2020",positive,Absolutely amazing film! A must see flick!
"Jan 23, 2020",negative,"So this was the last movie in this new star wars trilogy? I think they could have done allot better than this. In my opinion the worst thing in this movie is the pacing and directing. The first half of the movie just flies by and nothing is explained properly at all. The second half is also rushed with a ridiculous amount of plot holes that do not make sense within the lore of star wars.
It is incredibly obvious that this movie does not convincingly flow with the past 2 movies as the developers try to make up for mistakes in the last movie while trying to end this trilogy all at the same time on a satisfying note, in turn they tried to jam all that into 1 movie and it came out looking like a rushed and inconsistent mess.
The plot was absolutely absurd because the main villain is emperor Palpitine who has come back with NO EXPLANATION AT ALL and this was not hinted at in the previous movies, begging the question did they just make this up straight after the second film released? 
In short they have to find 1 mcguffin that leads to the other mcguffin that will lead them to the main villain so they can defeat him... with a bunch of inconsistent filler in between used to cheaply prolong the movie. That is the whole plot.
The main characters had a very unsatisfying ending which fell very short of what we thought they were going to become in The Force Awakens (especially Finn). One of the most idiotic parts in the movie was when Rey had to use the dagger (mcguffin 1) to find the second mcguffin (in the fallen death star) by lining up the pattern on the daggers handle with the exterior of the death star until both of the patterns line up like a puzzle piece and the dagger will point where they need to go... the absolute idiocy in this scene was beyond insane. The death star was sitting there for decades in a rocky ocean environment and Rey just literally lines up the dagger in the exact right place in less than 10 seconds? However, the movie is full of these stupid moments.
This is not how you make a good movie, you have to be consistent with the plot and the laws of the universe that you are actually using, end character arcs in a satisfying or at least an interesting way and if the developers are not going to carry on villians and other important story mechanics in the end of this supposed trilogy then at the very least EXPLAIN the new villians and story mechanics that you introduce in this movie.
Besides the terribly inconsistent and boring plot, lacking of character interest, acts that destroy the canon and lore in Star Wars and straight up stupid scenes the movie had good visuals, cool space battles and the acting was quite good.
I think why some people really liked this movie is because they are not star wars fans and just went to the cinema to see an action filled movie with no expectations of greatness in regards to the other Star Wars films or the Star Wars universe. They don't understand how this movie destroys much of the lore in Star Wars."
"Jan 23, 2020",negative,"As a long time star wars fan, episode IX has a total absence of story and imagination.
The feelings and the passion expressed in the movie are frustratingly fake.
This last trilogy (along with SOLO) makes me feel nostalgic of Jar Jar Binks."
"Jan 23, 2020",neutral,What happens when you have two different directors who have two different takes on a franchise? This movie.
"Jan 23, 2020",positive,A must see if you are a Star Wars fan!
"Jan 23, 2020",negative,"I felt it was quite underwhelming. Such a movie is supposed to be cataclysmic, but instead it felt too narrow, and fizzled out. Several great elements were retconned, and many decisions sadly seemed to be pandering to toxic elements in the fandom (not something we should be doing). It felt very shallow and narrow in its scope. The previous movies had done a great job of opening the mythos up, showing how the force and rebellion spread through regular people. This movie went backwards on all of that, having the world dependent entirely on the bloodline of the same old people, returning to the tired old ""chosen one"" cliche. I also felt it was very rushed, with insufficient time to develop proper story, the reasons and process of characters changing views etc, and no time to develop meaningful characters for those just introduced (deciding new ones with barely any time to develop was better than spending some more time developing those that had just been introduced before). All in all it just felt quite boring, rushed and weak."
"Jan 23, 2020",positive,"Great Movie! If you are a true Star Wars fan and I mean true. You will appreciate every moment of this movie! The drama, the action, the nostalgia and the love is what this franchise is about and it delivered With this final installment."
"Jan 23, 2020",positive,Great movie!! Love Star Wars since I was a kid.
"Jan 23, 2020",negative,"This movie felt rushed and poorly written. The plot was extremely confusing because it went about retconning the previous film without warning. Furthermore, Palpatine comes back with no explanation. There is nothing new to tell in the starwars universe apparently."
"Jan 23, 2020",positive,Great way to end the Star Wars saga of skywalker.
"Jan 23, 2020",positive,I enjoyed the story and the action.
"Jan 23, 2020",positive,I loved it. My third or fourth favorite Star Wars movie after Star Wars and Empire. It had everything I want from a Star Wars film.
"Jan 23, 2020",positive,"Enjoyable, but not up to standard of the original 3 films. Very predictable at times."
"Jan 23, 2020",negative,Sadly they keep ruining what used to be a good franchise.
"Jan 23, 2020",positive,Good film it told me a couple of views for me to get all the references from the past films to the present one. Great to see old friends from the past.
"Jan 23, 2020",negative,"Es una película que solo quiere vender nostalgia (como siempre en estas ultimas 2), pero en esta es mero mercado, con traer a personajes que no necesitaban regresar (Palpatin por ejemplo), que el guion solo trata de ponerte chistes cada que puede y diálogos/frases absurdas, aunque si...los efectos especiales no están nada mal."
"Jan 23, 2020",positive,Best CG of the year. Top 3 light saber battles. Great ending.
"Jan 23, 2020",positive,Very fun to watch...enjoyed the movie a lot!
"Jan 23, 2020",positive,Good ending to Skywalker series
"Jan 23, 2020",neutral,There was fun action sequences and it was enjoyable and entertaining but I didn't like the plot or characters
"Jan 23, 2020",positive,"It was ok and as expected
John"
"Jan 23, 2020",positive,Good movie second time.
"Jan 23, 2020",positive,My wife is a big Star wars geek. But I really loved it too in fact I cried a little bit
"Jan 23, 2020",negative,JJ should be ashamed and putting this movie out as a Skywalker Saga.
"Jan 23, 2020",positive,wasn't what I expected but still a good movie
"Jan 23, 2020",positive,Should have been episode 7
"Jan 23, 2020",positive,Fantastic end to the trilogy...
"Jan 23, 2020",positive,The movie closed out the saga. But it did leave unanswered questions still to be unknown. In the end it was still a treat to see even if it wasn't so sweet
"Jan 23, 2020",positive,"Entertaining, well acted, beautifully shot."
"Jan 23, 2020",positive,"While there are definitely choices to the story that I did not agree with, especially in the first act of the film, in the end I loved it.  I was engrossed, connected with the characters, and above all, it felt like Star Wars to me.  I was always going to love the film, as I will always love all of Star Wars.  It is hard to say goodbye, especially to something we love as much as the Saga is loved.  But I am pleased with where it ended. With friends, with hope, and with fond memories.  
The force will be with us, always."
"Jan 23, 2020",positive,Pretty good but how the hell is Palpatine alive and Kylo Ren and Rey have hated each other the entire series and then they kiss alswhen Rey said she was Rey skywalker at the end was cheeses and wtf was Finn gonna say but besides from those things I thought the movie was pretty Good
"Jan 23, 2020",positive,Great movie it brought the trilogies all together
"Jan 23, 2020",positive,"It's a movie without a purpose to anchor it, so it kind of wanders, and the pacing is rather frustrating, but the incredible acting performances, particularly from Adam Driver, give this movie a catharsis to make it worth watching at least the first time."
"Jan 23, 2020",negative,Adam Driver shines in an otherwise forgettable finale to some of my favorite films.
"Jan 23, 2020",positive,Absolutely wonderful.  My whole family really enjoyed this movie.  It was a great wrap up of a great trilogy and great sage.
"Jan 23, 2020",positive,Dialogue kinda annoyed me and there were some areas that were clunky but overall it was fine
"Jan 23, 2020",positive,I enjoyed this movie but it left a lot of unanswered questions. I'm a Star Wars fan but not extreme. I did see this movie 4 times in the theatre. A lot because I loved the sound and special effects in the Dolby theatre.
"Jan 23, 2020",negative,I spent the entire movie being mad after the opening scene. The first scene completely invalidates the last 2 movies in the post-squeal.
"Jan 23, 2020",positive,great movie watch it like 6 times
"Jan 23, 2020",negative,"Dios mio as they say ;-)  what a mess, i  still think TLJ was the worst one but this film was a rushed mess. Clearly there was no plan to create a cohesive trilogy - what a shame and wasted potential.
I just stopped caring for this after TLJ -  i'm gonna completely ignore this trilogy going forwards"
"Jan 23, 2020",positive,Daisy Ridley is awesome.
"Jan 23, 2020",positive,"This is an awesome movie! Great tie ins to all the previous films in the series! A must see for any Star Wars fan, hard core or just a viewer."
"Jan 23, 2020",positive,"I enjoyed the whole star wars 9 part series very much. I know most people critique the last two really hard, but I thought this one was a great ending to a great story. It's just good entertainment in my opinion."
"Jan 23, 2020",positive,It seemed that towards the end they were grappling with how to end the Skywalker saga. It did not seem to flow organically from its 8 predecessors.😕
"Jan 23, 2020",negative,It was entertaining. Watched it to finish off the trilogy but that's the only reason. There were a lot of concepts that played well to the movie it not enough to redeem the series from episode 8.
"Jan 23, 2020",positive,Loved it. Though the stench of TLJ is still there.
"Jan 23, 2020",positive,The best since the original 3(Ep[isodes 4-6) Ties up a lot of loose ends.
"Jan 23, 2020",positive,Good movie throughly enjoyed it
"Jan 23, 2020",positive,It's great! Because it's way better than Cats 2019!
"Jan 23, 2020",negative,"The rise of Palpatine was a big disappointment. Wish I never saw it. Yes, The Last Jedi killed the trilogy and I hated that. But in retrospect I would also say The Last Jedi is the best movie in the trilogy. It honestly doesn´t deserve to be called a trilogy since that involves a written story and plan before you start the camera...."
"Jan 23, 2020",positive,"Fantastic! As a Star Wars fan, as a movie fan I absolutely loved it. A great way to end a saga a hope for more to come. If you read other reviews that knock it down they do so because they wanted it to be something it was never supposed to be. Fanboys that latch onto the voice of a few are why franchises struggle. Watch it and enjoy it."
"Jan 23, 2020",positive,"I've seen every star wars movie and i just got to say that TROS was a perfect movie to end the saga. I feel that it went full circle and what I mean by that is, we got to see Palpatine come back from the dead. Because we can all agree yes it started with Anakin Skywalker (Darth Vader) but we can also agree it started off with Palpatine because we all see his point of view and how he became the most evil Empiror and how he started everything. Yes possibly we don't see an explanation on how he came back from the dead but it was a great movie either way! And I am happy on how it started and ended! Great job JJ Abrams!"
"Jan 23, 2020",negative,I can see the appeal of the film to fans however I felt this was a lazy ending to a potentially great trilogy. It chose to retcon important parts of the last Jedi instead of working with it.
"Jan 23, 2020",positive,"I loved every minute, almost cried..... several times."
"Jan 23, 2020",positive,"i liked the whole movie i have seem then all really enjoyed it like the old cast
that was in it also"
"Jan 23, 2020",positive,"Brought the end to the Skywalker story, tied up loose ends."
"Jan 23, 2020",negative,"Total garbage.
The whole movie is basically just an retcon of the last jedi for the worse and on its own terms it's stupid and boring"
"Jan 23, 2020",positive,"Includes components of the original trilogy, which made this movie great"
"Jan 23, 2020",positive,It was Star Wars so worth watching though was not the best of the trilogies
"Jan 23, 2020",positive,"This movie is so true to the original that It was a pure joy to  watch!
Please see this film because you will love it for its authenticity to the story."
"Jan 23, 2020",positive,Loved it!. Would be 5 stars if I wasn't sad that the story is over.
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,Loved the full circle from the very first movie to the way this ended
"Jan 22, 2020",negative,Such a horrible ending full of bad acting and a terrible script. Disney messed this saga up big time
"Jan 22, 2020",negative,Wasn't not entertaining. Seemed cheap and simple. Not much effort in story telling and not enough risks in taking the franchise to a new level. Many of the escalations only the fighting and force abilities was way over the top and made no sense in the universe. Wish they would delete it and act like it didn't happen
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,Everything I hoped for and more
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,"It make you feel.  There are two movies series that I will rewatch over and over again. The first is Harry Potter and now the second is Star Wars.  I was hesitant to say this until the end of the third trilogy, but gladly do now."
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,It was a good movie.  Especially for a conclusion. People that want to hate on it on all these blogs are just looking for click bait.
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,"I found myself finally coming to care about this trio of characters that I've been told I should be caring about for the past two films. The acting was solid, and the action sequences were top-notch. The script was a little derivative for my tastes, even by Star Wars standards - but it IS Star Wars, after all. I enjoyed it, and after watching it, I want to rewatch episodes VII and VIII again. I didn't think I'd be saying that."
"Jan 22, 2020",neutral,I just didn’t like the story
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,Great end to Star Wars
"Jan 22, 2020",negative,"Not as bad as The Last Jedi, but that's like saying a car crash isnt as bad as a plane crash.... you still dont want either of them. Are the people on here that are rating it high for real or did Disney make their employees do it?"
"Jan 22, 2020",negative,"A product clearly made checking surveys and trying to please the fans.
No plot, no characters, but anyway somehow it's got rhythm (maybe too much..) and great VFX."
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,A great ending to the saga.
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,It was the best of the new three movies.  Made up for most the mistakes of the first two.
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,I loved it but was disappointed with the ending alluding to Rey being the incestuous child of Luke and Leia.
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,Im a star wars fan till the end. I dont want to give any spoilers about it. Just go see it!
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,You just know that it’s going to be okay. You just don’t know how. Edge of the seat the whole way. Still amazed at how bad shots the white armored storm troopers are. Can’t those guys hit anybody?  Great escapism and in the end (I saw the 1st one when it first came out) it’s a fitting conclusion.
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,Loved it. Me thinks we will be seeing more of some of these new characters.
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,It's a Star Wars movie! They're always fun to watch. I do want to see a director's cut of the film. #Disney would be VERY smart to give JJ's initial cut of the movie to fans.
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,"From the first to the last a great story, action and adventure!! Thank you George Lucas for the story and JJ Abrams for a great and exciting time:)"
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,Awesome ending to a saga
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,"The special effects were vivid and a pleasure to watch.  The characters were well developed the plot intricate, moving and emotive.  All in all a great movie."
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,Great way to end the series!
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,For 42 years we have wondered how the story would end... and the answer is with an obvious path to a completely new series! All your favorites make an appearance either integral to the script or as cameos. It is Star Wars - what's not to love and enjoy?
"Jan 22, 2020",negative,"A big dissapointment. Had the opportunity to connect the dots to previous unexplained prequel films while keeping an intricate story and completley dropped the ball. I was very dissapointed that they didnt bother to pay homage to the Skywalker legacy by explaining the master plan and how we got to this point. Another is for some reason SPOILER Rey and Kylo Ren create a dynamic that gives the emperor power. Who is Snoke exactly still never was explained. Why was Anakin concieved by the force? or who did so? and for what part in Palpatines ultimate plan? answering these questions with small aid from the books would have made for an amazing story that would have left us all satisfied. This never happened although fun at times the story is a mess, the characters have no genuine aid to the story or part to play. The saddest part was the lack of any true link to the Jedi of the past it felt rushed and it felt thrown together. "
"Jan 22, 2020",negative,From the opening crawl onward I experienced despair and disappointment.
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,Perfect ending to a wonderful series.
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,It tied the movies together. It was cool to see young skywalker and Leia.
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,"The Rise of Skywalker is freakin awesome!! I don't understand how it got 52% Rotten Tomatoes. It was my favorite Star Wars movie to date. As soon as it was over, I wanted to see it again. All the light saber battles were incredible. The cast is perfect. All the questions were answered. And the ending was awesome. Everything about it this movie was right on! Can't wait to see it again."
"Jan 22, 2020",negative,Sad.  and bad.  The old characters are the only redeeming factor.
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,It ties it all together
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,"Much better than the terrible Episode 8: The Last Jedi.
But where is HAYDEN CHRISTENSEN?
This Trilogy takes a dump on the first 6 episodes and makes every story arc and achievement of our beloved characters meaningless."
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,The best episode yet. It tied in all the way to the beginning.
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,Great movie! I grew up with the original movies and this brought back a lot of the old ones. Very impressed because i have never given a 5 to any Star Wars after the original movies.
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,"Great way to end the Skywalker legacy,  great pace and action,well done"
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,Great summary of a great series!
"Jan 22, 2020",negative,Bad story and script
"Jan 22, 2020",negative,"I have never laughed so much at a Star Wars movie, and I don't mean that in a good way. The struggles this trilogy faced in terms of writing really showed and peaked in this movie."
"Jan 22, 2020",negative,The worst of them all. I cried and left early bc it was so bad.
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,"Excellent movie. Full of action/drama, extremely entertaining!!!
Nothing to dislike."
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,"Amazing! While there are a few minor things I would have liked better, it wrapped the saga up with a nice bow without making it boring. Definitely one of the best films especially the last 20 minutes"
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,"A good finish to the saga, but lacking in character development or surprises that would have elevated the material."
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,It was awesome. Lucasfilm is my dream place to work at and I have to thank Daisy Ridley for playing Rey.
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,"The movie was great. There were a few times like when Rey was healing the snake and Ben that seemed over the top, even for a fully trained Jedi."
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,"I thought it a fitting end, though not perfect."
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,I was easy to follow and had closure
"Jan 22, 2020",negative,NOT in line with a Star Wars movie. Political ideas thrown in. It  was not good at all
"Jan 22, 2020",negative,Poorly acted with absurd sequences.
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,"3.5 stars for cinematography.  
It was cliche for the most part . The last 40 mins were the best . It would definitely be hard to follow if you never saw any of the previous installments."
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,A great end to the Skywalker saga.
"Jan 22, 2020",negative,Not a star wars fan. Only went to take my daughter.  She loved it!
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,"The movie was engaging throughout, no downtime or slow spot yawns. Some predictable moments but all-in-all a solid movie and a satisfying outing!"
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,"It sure is a messy conclusion. But, it's a good one as well. ""Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker"" wraps up the franchise with beautiful visual effects, and some really strong performers (especially Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver). J.J Abrams had a nearly insurmountable task to complete, so I respect this film, no matter how cluttered in exposition it is. Not as good as it should have been, but a suitable, well-done job.

73/100"
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,I liked the fact that several old characters were brought back and the overwhelming odds were again overcome by the rebel forces. The twists at the end were a nice touch too!
"Jan 22, 2020",negative,"Absolutely nothing in this movie really connected the last two with it, seemed to be a bad clone/remake of Episodes 6. This entire trilogy sucked but this was the worse."
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,This was a great continuation of the Star Wars story that has all the typical elements and familiar characters that you have come to know. There are a few surprises so I won't be a spoiler here. There is plenty of action and violence so I wouldn't recommend this episode for younger children.
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,"If you are first generation Star Wars fan, you'll appreciate all the nods to the original films.  It was a fitting end to the saga, with a few surprises along the way."
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,Not the best but close
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,"i was pleased 2 c that they didnt just follow the exakt same plit line as so many of the other star wars films, but there were some details in the film that lacked continuity, minor as they may have been."
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,Loved the movie.  Was shocked about Rey's family affiliation but in the end she chose the right family.
"Jan 22, 2020",negative,"Weak plot, poor character development and haphazard cast of characters. Cinematography was all over the place.  'Intense Stare' was way overutilized.

They just had to throw in a lesbian scene. No reason to.

It was a mess - not the worst of the series, but certainly not worthy of the last Episode."
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,"The last trilogy from JJ Abrams Starwars. I feel its kinda rush, enjoyable movie but its not really explain all the mess and fuzz about the character. I feel like the real run time it supposed to be around 4 Hours, where is the rest of the scence?!
They probably should make it as 2 seperated movie instead 1 (part1 and part2)
Looks like JJ and Rian have different aproach of idea about this trilogy. 
I hope we are as fans can get all that it as deleted scene in DVD released."
"Jan 22, 2020",neutral,"While visually stunning, this saga ending film leaves more questions than answers. Certain elements targeted to right some past wrongs and does so in underwhelming fashion. However, the franchise remains true to it's galaxy far away inspiration and continues to awe its fanbase with new creatures and comedic relief."
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,The Rise of Skywalker is an amazing end to the ultimate sci-fi saga.
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,Better than the Last Jedi. Action packed fun!
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,"Cant fault the quality of the technical aspects of the movie. The story line is a little too soppy. Felt like a soap opera at times. Nice to be able to run around in space with no spacesuit or oxygen! I enjoyed the movie. Dont look at the details (like Reys white outfit never getting dirty, until the last encounter) just watch the action."
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,"I thought the chemistry/dynamic of Poe-Rey-Finn was better than earlier episodes.  The battle scenes and FX were good. Maybe too much reliance on legacy characters speaking from the dead. Luke, Jedi, yes. Han, not Jedi, not sure why he can talk to Kylo/Ben."
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,It was a great movie at a great theater.
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,Awesome. Watches three time already!
"Jan 22, 2020",negative,What a way to end the saga
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,A good conclusion to the story. Liked it didnt love it
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,The movie was fabulous. Brought all the loose ends together. Cried......
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,Great ending to the Star Wars Skywalker series!
"Jan 22, 2020",negative,"As I was seeing the movie there wasn't allot of time to think about all the stuff that was happening but the way the plot filled out left me very unsatisfied. No Anakin, the fake killing offs of c3po and Chewbacca. And the whole ending with Kylo, Rey and Palpatine was a big letdown. But when I came home and had time to think about it som more, the structure of the movie didn't make any sense either. Things just happen so the movie can move allong, not because they make any sense. The dagger for one. Anyway, a very bad ending that brings down all the movies that came before."
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,I enjoyed the theme in which the team sticks together.
"Jan 22, 2020",negative,"This is the product of Greed.
True Star Wars fans will be disappointed.
Movie is illogical and full of plot holes.
Sub-par Generic acting.

This movie was made for one purpose. To milk more money from a well-known product.

TL;DR, Don't waste your time."
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,A fitting ending to a mediocre trilogy.
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,"I really liked this movie, it had some funny parts and sad but kept me entertained throughout the whole film. Even though people knew certain things were coming in this movie; watching it still surprised me and skill kept me intrigued. The Rise of Skywalker is something that I would see again."
"Jan 22, 2020",negative,If you made this far. *Funeral Music*
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,"while I felt it was better then the last one, I felt that they were creating to many new Jedi powers that I think spoils the mythos. Examples: Kylo Ren being able to interact with Rey through some sort of force projection, ghost Luke being able to interact with real world objects (why wouldn't Jedi's be involved in all battles then just taking out opponents), Emperor Palentine now being able to use his lightning touch to take out a whole fleet, herring the voices of Jedi's Rey never met. It was a better mythos when not every Jedi could do everything and they are falling into the trap many movies have where they think new characters need to be even more powerful.
I also thought it would have been better if Luke's speech to Rey had a little more of an optimistic tone (I hated his character use in episode 8). It got better as it went along, but didn't come across as the wise guiding voice that Obi Wan and Yoda were for Luke, started more as a scolding rather then a questioning to make Rey think.
On the plus I liked Poe, thought he fits the role going forward of the Han Solo type character that was missing in episodes 1-3."
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,Expected more... but am satisfied. I would’ve been happy with just the first trilogy. Special effects are fantastic!
"Jan 22, 2020",neutral,Yawner.. (fell asleep)
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,"Although it still had several characters with nothing to do, due to a lack of will to kill off new characters earlier on in the series  for a more meaningful character arks with Finn, having nothing important to do with Poe and double downing on its risk to kill off Chewbacca. However, it did bring back the kick ass villain who started it all for an exiting end to the saga with great use of Kylo-Ren and Rey and their force-connection which is added on in more unique ways."
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,"Plenty of action, but it feels too rushed.  It's like one action sequence after another, but not enough time invested in the dialogues and slower emotional scenes.  The action sequences are not really well orchestrated as none are actually memorable."
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,"This film was epic, to put it simply. Excellent quality and immersive acting has brought the Star Wars universe into ours once again. The was so much excellent story covered in the film that I was surprised they were able to keep it as short as it is. The general vibe of the film felt very different from any other Star Wars film, but gave the same ""Oh heck, things are getting serious"" feelings as Revenge of The Sith.
My only problem was that the opening scroll glossed over some significant events that would have been good to see in the film, but this was likely done to keep the runtime down and avoid too many unnecessary side plots. 
As a final statement, this is truly a movie for the fans, packed with enough fan service that anyone will be satisfied with Rise of Skywalker as a conclusion. The creative team behind this film likely realised that as the final movie in a 9 episode saga, who were the making the film for, if not for the fans?"
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,Worth watching. A great ending to the series.
"Jan 22, 2020",negative,great movie if episodes 1 through 6 don't exist. can I get neuralyzed so I forget this movie?? Or my money back would work 
"Jan 22, 2020",negative,Final nail in the coffin.  Really ruined the Luke Skywalker character for me and now the rest of the franchise.
"Jan 22, 2020",negative,"Plot holes every 2 seconds, horses in on star destroyers that can be killed by simply tilting the ship, killing major characters off-screen, final order creating the most powerful military the galaxy has ever seen only to have them somehow all be killed by shooting down one ship, ruining Anakin's legacy, making his entire existence unimportant and somehow making the emperor an absolute idiot. You think he would have learned not to zap people with lightsabers after windu but I guess not. Awful movie."
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,Very riveting! Very sad parts too.
"Jan 22, 2020",negative,I am so disappointed!!! This movie is so far from the Star Wars saga movies that I love... too much Disney in it. 
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,I have watched Star Wars since the 70’s the love of them continues! I need to update the first 6 because I don’t have a VHS player anymore!
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,Excellent end to my childhood love!!!
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,first viewing i was hyped. second viewing i was left wanting more. that’s a good a bad thing. i believe they should have made this 10 movie saga. can’t wait to watch a third time. 
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,"A bit long but a great ending to a great series.
It was good to see some of the original cast brought back.
I will see it a again : )"
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,knights of Ren was always shown but didn't really do anything.
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,Wished Ben Solo would have lived at the end
"Jan 22, 2020",neutral,"Fun, lots of action. Suffers from lack of cohesive vision from the sequel trilogy"
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,Was just a good movie
"Jan 22, 2020",negative,"This was deceptive advertising. The subtitle is Rise of Skywalker. The last Star Wars movie Luke Skywalker died or at least vanished. I thought this would be about Luke rising and kicking ass. But he was in it for like 4 minutes and he barely does anything.  It was heartbreaking to see Han Solo die then another blow to see Luke killed off and then market this movie with a deceptive title sucks. The visual effects were amazing and the music was great as usual, but this was really deceptive advertising. This was Rise of Rey or Rise of Kylo Ren. And why wasn’t Yoda and a force ghost of Obi Wan not in the last Star Wars movie? Lame!!!!"
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,Better than I expected some over acting. Storyline was sporadic as there was no clear vision seemed more like a made for tv movie than a big budget film. Could have been better. ut could also have been worse a middle of the road movie. would say see it to finish the trilogy else just watch a review and save the money
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,Cool movie! Go to watch this movie today!
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,"After the disastrous collaboration of Rian  Johnson in The Last Jedi, where characters can now fly in space and other nonsense that the critics loved for some reason, The Rise of Skywalker give us a healthy, althoug rush, conclusion to this trilogy.

Abrahams understud that the characters and the whole myth belong to the fans and at the end he tries his very best to deliver."
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,I liked the lightsabers.
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,The best one yet!!! The fight scenes were awesome!!!
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,little cheese factor but great story lines
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,I think they did amazing job putting Carrie Fisher in the final film. I loved how they surprised us with a few characters from the original films. I think it was a wonderful resolution to the entire saga. I enjoyed every minute.
"Jan 22, 2020",neutral,"Honestly, I don't think it was a good conclusion to the Skywalker Saga.

The only reason I'm giving it 2 1/2 stars is because of the dedication the actors put in it.

I honestly think that Disney should've just made their own, trilogy, not connected to the PT or the OT in anyway.

It ruined Anakin's arc, it ruined Luke. 

I don't feel any connection to the new characters, and also, it's just a big load of fan service."
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,"still, I don't understand why Rey and Kylo did that at the end of the battle.
minus 1 point."
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,Action throughout the 2 1/2 hours.
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,Kept me interested for 2 1/2 hours
"Jan 22, 2020",negative,It could have been so much more.  Lazy writing.
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,Good story and conclusion. Loved how it ended. Great series.
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,Absolutely loved it!❤️
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,"good, but could be great"
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,It was an amazing movie.  I like how the writers tied old movies into this one.
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,"Awesome. Just awesome, and very satisfying! If so called ‘fans’ balk at this, then they’re not true fans!! Go make your own version then! I guarantee it won’t like it, and it will suck!"
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,Fast paced conclusion to the saga. Fun ride.
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,It was fun. It was entertaining.  That's all I ask for.   Keep the content coming.
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,Cinematography made the film feel small. Good story. Great acting from entire cast.
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,Great addition to the Star Wars series!  Enjoyed it very much!
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,I cried!!! It was so good. 
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,A must see for any Star Wars fan. Wonderful way to bring characters old and new together for the grand finale
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,"Amazing movie, kept me engaged the entire time."
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,"It took 3 movies to find out who she was. The last fight was weak. When Kylo died it wasn’t properly done. It wasn’t emotional, it was like oh okay... he died... alright next scene."
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,"An interesting, exciting, funny, shocking, moving work of cinema. Maybe not an ideal ending to the Saga, but a damn solid one. High rewatch value."
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,"This movie tied it all together. Episodes 7 and 8 I didn’t care that much for, but Rise of Skywalker clarified the aspects that didn’t make sense and made me love Rey and Kylo Ren."
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,"Great and exciting movie!  Loved all of the Star War movies.  We now need to sit and watch all 9 - from the beginning!!!!

A movie for the entire family.  A movie even if you are not a Star Wars fan - action and suspense!"
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,"If you have watched the entire Star Wars series than you probably already saw it. For those that haven't, you need to so you can make sense of certain things that happen -however, if you just like movies with action than this is good for you too!"
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,Best in the series since the first 3.
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,so worth seeing! glad it wasn't a preview movie and it was not drawn out. Was completely drawn into the movie the entire time.
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,Loved it. Great bow on top. Star Wars geeks gotta lay-off crapping all over it.
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,It was action packed!!!!!
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,I enjoyed the theme of accepting a name which brought honor to the bearer
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,Action was nonstop.  Loved that they had many of the characters from the other Star Wars movies.
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,Poorly done. Actors were definitely not into this movie. Maybe too many sequels. Seemed like you should have stopped at the last one.
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,Great conclusion to the Skywalker saga
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,All questions where answered.
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,This is the first good Star Wars in quite a while. A good one to end the saga. What a great Sci-Fi franchise this has been!
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,Excellent Movie!  Fitting end to the Star Wars Saga.
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,AMAZING everything was phenomenal
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,"Unfortunately, the movie understandably had to spend a fair amount of it’s time fixing the damage done in The Last Jedi. Shows us glimpses of what the trilogy could have been if Rian Johnson hadn’t been involved."
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,"A full Five Stars! A MUST SEE for any serious Star Wars fan!
This movie nicely wraps up the 9-Episode series envisioned by Lucas, and begun with the release in 1977 of Episode IV. After some of the fumbles in the last 2 Episodes, I was a bit skeptical. But, this one well exceeded my expectations."
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,Great movie!! So fun. This will be one of my all time favorite Star Wars movie
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,"I loved the interaction between Poe and Finn - a really good bromance. The scenes with Leia were well done and seamless.  Could have done without the Ewok scene (not needed) and the way the celebration on the ground seemed to drag a bit once the aircraft had returned and the reunions happened.  All in all, I loved all the action and the tieing up of all the storylines."
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,it was a good conclusion to the star wars movies.
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,I thought the movie was to long and in places seemed to ramble.
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,As a fan of all the Star Wars movies the movie was good. My issue is I felt as though I try to hard to be epic. The producers/directors shouldve just let it evolve.
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,I loved this movie and cant understand why the reviews have been less than desirable??? I have seen all the a Star Wars movies in the Skywalker series and feel this was a perfect ending and a excellent gateway into the next generation.  Go see it it before it is no longer in the theaters!
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,The scene when c3po yelled they fly now
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,"I disliked the predictable, cheese Disney parts. This was more of a movie for 10 year olds than a movie for the whole family or adults."
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,the movie suprised me the whole way through. did not expect any of it
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,Visuals were good. Acting was good. Storyline was just so so.
"Jan 22, 2020",negative,terrible plot contrivances.
"Jan 22, 2020",positive,"better than expected, but check it out yourself"
"Jan 22, 2020",negative,"I loved it, fun to watch and a fitting finale to the Star Wars saga.   Predictable??  Sure it was.  How did you think it would end?  But fun to watch, none the less.   Get past the drama of having to over-analyze.  Just sit back and enjoy.  And try to remember, it really is just a fictitious story."
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,I feel like I was slapped in the face.
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,Good action. Movie seemed to hurried. Left many unanswered questions. To many long stare downs. Dialog could have been better. Would not have minded 3hr movie.
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,Rea is such a good person and nothing sways her to the darkside.
"Jan 21, 2020",negative,Super predictable and cliche. Lacking deep dialogue and cinematography of original trilogy.
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,Loved it.  Great finish to an epic series.
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,Enjoyable movie! Must see if you enjoy anything Star Wars.
"Jan 21, 2020",negative,By the end I couldn’t remember if I was watching a Disney princess movie or Star Wars.
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,An epic end to a 40 year saga. Had a great sum up and opened the the doors to many opportunities to many more Star Wars movies/TV Show
"Jan 21, 2020",neutral,"I'm someone who really liked The Last Jedi, so to see such a jarring course correction in this movie is a bit disappointing. I acknowledge that The Last Jedi has some flaws, but I was genuinely excited to see the plot points that were explored in this movie. To my chagrin, they decided that the 42% fan backlash was enough to try to completely deviate from Rian Johnson's previous direction. This movie just feels so angry at something. It's so reactive in its message. The biggest problems of this movie are undoubtedly the pacing and the writing. The movie's breakneck pace makes it difficult to resonate with some of the movies more dramatic moments. And the writing: OH THE WRITING!!! yeah... it's pretty bad. The actors and actresses do their best with what they're given, but charisma alone can't save this movie. Daisy Ridley, Adam Driver, Oscar Issac, and John Boyega (even though they treat his character like shit) carry this movie. 

All in all, I feel that by giving into the minority of fan's hatred, Disney has shown it's cowardice by giving into the backlash and not sticking to their original vision. The result is a messy, convoluted, rushed, and predictable reactionary piece that you can never really love and never really hate. Makes me sad."
"Jan 21, 2020",negative,"Very repetitive.   Nonsensical story, bad dialogue."
"Jan 21, 2020",negative,It wasn't that great. But also not terrible.
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,"Loved the movie, story line changed but if it keeps the franchise going it got my vote. Thoroughly enjoyed and will purchase when released on blu Ray"
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,"Felt like it was a movie that had to be made, not one that anybody wanted to make. Almost as disappointing as the last episodes of Game of Thrones"
"Jan 21, 2020",neutral,"Meh....not horrible, but not great by any means. This movie is trying to fix a mess and it is very clear that they had a hard time trying to keep it all cohesive from all the reshoots. The first half is bad, the second half is actually pretty good. The acting is bad in many spots with just predictable lines/editing. Yet there are some surprisingly wonderful moments. But for every one those same scenes there is a counter moviemaking decision that just feels off. This movie is all over the place, but I give them credit. It’s just a shame that these characters where not more developed and given more care. I feel like I finally cared at end about Rey and kilo, but it doesn’t matter. The trilogy has ended. "
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,"Great? No. 
Entertaining? Yes.
Better than Prequel Trilogy and the turd that was The Last Jedi? Absolutely. 
The hate this movie has received is shocking. It's by no means perfect and has been accused of too much fan-service. Frankly, that's fine with me since Last Jedi was a major FU to fans and changed things simply for the sake of changing things. This movie is fine. And now the series is over and the internet can get ready to complain about the next Star Wars adventure."
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,Awesome enjoyed the whole movie my son and I.
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,"Rey is probably the best character we've seen yet in the Star Wars universe, and this movie really brings her journey to the forefront."
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,I enjoyed the story - just not as impactful as earlier parts of the saga
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,It was alright could of been better
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,Not as good as expected
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,"It looks like it should be the first movie of the new trilogy. Overall rating is good. I liked it, but not wow wtf happened here, blow my mind... it is just ok."
"Jan 21, 2020",negative,It was very predictable and there is no new story. It is just them doing the same thing over and over again
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,"The movie wasn't bad and it wasn't great. Besides all the plot holes and having to stuff two movies into one at least we get an ending,maybe not the one some wanted but an ending to a saga we thought was done after the prequel trilogy. Perhaps if this movie was split into two movies then maybe we could have seen the answers that were missing. All in all, only worth a one time watch."
"Jan 21, 2020",negative,Total trash. I was enraged throughout the film.
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,so much fun heart racing tear jerking movie
"Jan 21, 2020",neutral,"Meh..... For someone who enjoyed The Force Awakens and loathed The Last Jedi, I really had very low expectations for The Rise of Skywalker.  Those expectations were not ""subverted"".   The movie had to spend too much time trying to repair the damage done by The Last Jedi to skillfully tell a coherent story.   However, it is still Star Wars and I still have some lingering allegiance to the franchise.   I'm relieved that we are done with the needlessly divisive final trilogy of the Skywalker saga.  If projects like The Mandalorian are any sign of things to come, then I have high hopes that Star Wars will have mass appeal again."
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,"Após o 8 que ficou um pouco a quem, este trouxe um final satisfatório."
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,It good but could of ended better
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,Amazing. Slow start but the finale is worth it.
"Jan 21, 2020",negative,"The only thing I can say is that it was mildly better than The Last Jedi but that is not saying much.  Wow has Disney and the new leadership at Lucasfilm really screwed up Star Wars.... did not think it was possible, but they actually made me HATE Star Wars."
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,A great movie and a fitting and emotional ending to the Skywalker Saga.
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,Excellent balance of action and drama. Characters were developed and expanded on from previous episodes. Storyline wrapped up beautifully
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,Rise of the Skywalker was a film that tries to wrap up the initial storyline.  There are loads of Easter eggs for the “more than average Star Wars fan.”
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,"Pleasant surprise compared to other movies in the franchise. It had substance and meaning and was a pleasure to watch. One scene did not fit, but everything else was good."
"Jan 21, 2020",negative,The story was terrible
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,"I think my expectations were high for this being the last installment. I feel like the show The Mandolorian is better thought out in regards to story lines. It was a good movie, but nowhere near what I thought itd be for the last one."
"Jan 21, 2020",neutral,"A fun experience for sure, but its attempts to course correct instead of continue a story. The plot is muddle and unsatisfying moving at breakneck pace that rarely allows the story beats to breathe or characters to develop naturally instead opting for an over abundance of fan service with little narrative pay off and a plot that feels more like a check list than a meaningful story."
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,Great CGI MOVIE. but ZERO plot... Like watching Pacific Rim 2
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,Been a fan since the beginning.  I loved it will see it again
"Jan 21, 2020",negative,"First hour was pretty good. The rest was pretty terrible.
Plot twists that dont make sense and the ending is pretty bad as well. This is the first SW movie that I wont be seeing again. For me it all ended on Return of the Jedi."
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,Typical story. Seemed rushed to end the saga.
"Jan 21, 2020",negative,"Really predictable, rey skywalker really ?, i feel like they have ruined a perfect franchise ugh give up disney"
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,It's funny how different the critics see this movie from the general audience.  I can tell you that the audience's rating is more on par!
"Jan 21, 2020",negative,"Not to say that the effects weren't beautiful, but a movie shouldn't be about just aesthetics. The plot was quite weak to be honest on this last trilogy and this episode was the worst of it. It's hard to say anything without spoilers, but lets just say that they crossed a couple of lines just to get some ""shock value"". At least it felt unauthentic to me. There were many more better stories to process from the comics. I hope they'll experiment with the world and find it's real essence again."
"Jan 21, 2020",negative,The Star Wars Theory subreddit come to life.
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,The movie was good with some surprising twists. But some of the scenes were just a rehash from previous movies.
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,"The best ending to the trilogy we loved it! We cried, we laugh it was amazing how they included princess Leia and how they said goodbye to her!"
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,"Love the new cast of the last three movies, but its the same old hackneyed formula that was slightly thrilling as a kid in the '70s but rather underwhelming as an adult in the '20s."
"Jan 21, 2020",negative,"[SPOILERS] Rise of Skywalker was unwatchable. From the open sequence where Darth Sidious lifts a thousand Star Destroyers out of the dirt to the ""light speed skipping"" (which felt Rick & Morty portal gun montage), this movie is the final nail in Disney Star Wars' coffin. Fan service galore; story, zilch. If all Star Wars is to you is X-wings going ""pew pew"" and lightsabers going ""fwoom fwoom,"" then maybe this movie is for you. But if you care one iota about story and continuity, stay away! It LOOKS like a Star Wars movie; it SOUNDS like a Star Wars movie; but it is NOT a Star Wars movie."
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,"A fitting end to the Skywalker saga Don't listen to the critics—the film is overall well done and will please most Star Wars fans. There is a lot of fan service referencing characters and events from the classic trilogy with many surprise moments and cameos. The mis-characterization of Luke Skywalker in The Last Jedi is somewhat redeemed here, and leaves things open for the new expanded universe to fill in the holes. The ending, while not perfect, fits the trilogy. If you are a true Star Wars fan, don't listen to a few critics tell you their grumpy opinions— look at the audience ratings, these are the people that matter. Enjoy it and let's all move on!"
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,Excellent ending (even if it’s not really the end)
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,At least it wrap up some unfinished leads in previous films.
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,All you critics are crazy. This was an excellent movie. Rated lower than all the prequels? What a joke. Ep 1 & 2 are completely unwatchable. Ep 3 barely so. Ep 9 was great. Expectations are way too unrealistic. Of course it's not going to fix all the wholes and answer every question built up over the previous 8 movies. What it did was fun and a very entertaining.
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,Roller coaster of emotions in a good way
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,"Great movie. Exciting and entertaining despite Mark Hamill's horrible acting skills. Thank God he's not in the movie much. He looks and sounds like a drunk homeless man when talking to Rey.  ""What are you doing!"" Sent me and my sister into hysterics and I'm pretty sure that was supposed to be a serious part. Daisy Ridley is a great actress and pretty much carries the current series.  I've always felt Adam Driver was miscast but at least he's a good actor.  Never liked Finn but Po is great. Overall a great action packed movie."
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,The best so far is this series
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,I was expecting so much more from the story.  A bit too predictable on too many occasions.
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,The best of the final trilogy! It had more of the feel of the original and brought closure in a satisfactory ending. Loved it!
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,It was very good. Will definitely watch it again!!
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,"This was a great way to end the saga. Its not a perfect movie but it is a lot of fun and as a lifelong Star Wars fan, I was not disappointed."
"Jan 21, 2020",negative,Worst Star Wars movie yet. Too disjointed and jerky. Lack of a real plot or character development.
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,Characters felt real. The battle scenes seemed much more realistic.
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,"This is one of my favorites of the full Star Wars series. Adam Driver was phenomenal in this film! I was not a fan of him as Kylo Ren before, but he was the best actor in the screen in Rise of Skywalker. I would definitely recommend."
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,I loved the story line.  I love the special effects.  I love all the tie ins to previous star wars movies.  I felt like this was the perfect way to end the story.
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,"The movie seemed a little rushed, but all in all it was a worthy wrap up of the original story."
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,Loved the old characters! Very enjoyable....
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,Loved the movie! Didnt love the ending.
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,Best Star Wars EVER!!!!
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,"What did you expect from this film? As a life long fan and a reader of the books, I came into this film understanding that there was no way to be satisfied. I walked out feeling that I had seen an ending that I could live with and am excited to read the book in March. That being said, the film is solid, well paced and ties up what needs to be tied up. The expectation that this movie would tie up every fanboys dreams was.... ridiculous. The expectation that this massive saga would please the casual fan was ridiculous. This was a film that went face to face with nostalgia and was still standing at the end."
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,Great finish to the sky walker series
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,"A little too Disney for me, too much of a happy ending is what I mean but not a bad movie overall"
"Jan 21, 2020",negative,"I didn't like the movie, I was bored in the middle of the movie with those ridiculous scenes and those strange choreographies, I understand that ""the last jedi"" delivered everything, but they instead of just making a good script slowly, they did it running , my note for this film is two stars, the film is so frustrating..."
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,Fun with lots of references to past movies
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,Awesome!! Loved the plot twists and the tie in of all the characters! Action thriller!!! Will this really be the last one?!?!?
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,I loved that Rey had to fight with her visions to become all Jedi.
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,Great wrap-up to the series!
"Jan 21, 2020",negative,"Boring and predictable. The writers seem to have to imagination and ZERO scientific vision. Lots of action, but just lame. The only thing that made it better than Ep 1 was the lack of Jarjar.
Please at least try to create an actual story next time.
1,000 deathstars secretly created and enough of a crew for each of them? Where did the crews come from? Terrible movie."
"Jan 21, 2020",negative,shiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit
"Jan 21, 2020",negative,"Poor writing, no conclusion, was fan service and a lot of retcon of TLJ. I mean there was no where to go. Then Rey steals the name of Skywalker and she's a Palpatine! Wow, this was very dumb film. Palpatine died in ROTJ! This film was awful!"
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,Another excellent Star Wars installment!
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,"This movie was made for the old-school fans of the original trilogy, not the fans who actually like the prequels, which I do not count as films, let along Star Wars films. Yes, these new movies were not perfect, but they felt like Star Wars films. They were enjoyable and paid homage to the films we watched a million times that our VHS tapes were worn out. Just watch the film and enjoy it for what it is."
"Jan 21, 2020",negative,"Bad, it broke all the concepts of the saga. Deplorable and disrespectful to the fans and the characters of the story."
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,"I think the basics of this movie are awesome! It tied the knots on a lot of plot points, but just felt so rushed to cram it all into one film. I'm still a massive Star Wars fan, and I left satisfied with the way the Skywalker Saga ended."
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,Too loud not enough dialogue just a lot of noise
"Jan 21, 2020",negative,"When my 7 year old Nephew tells a story, he will change and adjust the plot along the way, without making any sense because he's making it up and he doesen't have a manuscript. Just like the Rise of Skywalker - Ass licking fan service and awfull humor and forced, stolen plot! it's Disgusting!!! I will do anything i can, not to support Disney with as much as a single dollar as a punishment for destroying Star Wars! Goodbye Disney!"
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,"Not sure why everyone is hating on this movie so much.  It felt more like a Star Wars movie than any of the other prequels/sequels except maybe Rogue One.  Fully enjoyable, for anyone that grew-up on the original 3 SW flicks it ties a lot of stuff up nicely.  Frankly I really disliked Eps 1, 2, 3, 7, & 8, & Han Solo for a multitude of reasons."
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,"The movie had plenty of fight scenes, but many of them were lacking in excitement. It was a good movie, but certainly not as exciting as previous movies."
"Jan 21, 2020",negative,"The only good thing I can say about this movie is that it was better than the Last Jedi. I can see how they were trying to fix a lot of rubbish from the previous movie but they did it sloppy and boring. The movie was rushed and the whole emperor return was stupid, terribly stupid. Giant force lightening stopping all the ships - what was that? and what's with all these Jedi just dying for no reason, geez. If Ghost Luke can grab light sabers and lift X-wings, why doesn't he just go kill the Emperor? Plant killing guns on Star destroyers, wtf??? That's a lot of ships and tech to pull out of one dead rulers arse. I couldn't sit still through the end, I had enough when Rey was pretending to be dead. Let this trilogy be dead and forgotten. Just please don't let anyone that had anything to do with these 3 movies ever touch a Star Wars movie again."
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,Great job at ending the saga.
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,"True to the Star Wars series, the latest Star Wars movie did not disappoint! Good plot, great characters, both old and new and unforeseen plot twists led to a movie that everyone can enjoy!"
"Jan 21, 2020",negative,An absurd and leaky story.
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,"The plot felt thin. There were a lot of plot holes that were just filled with the force. Good special effects, good action. The big ending felt lime it should have been emotional, but there was nothing there. 5/7"
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,"The start of the story felt choppy until about the midpoint and that it overall relied too heavily upon nostalgia with former characters. Overall, an ok movie."
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,"The movie was great! It wrapped up the last 3 movies as well as brought the whole story to a close. If a movie makes me cry, like this one did, it was worth seeing. I love Star Wars!"
"Jan 21, 2020",negative,Liked nothing about it.   Disliked everything about it.
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,"Saw it alone today as I held off after seeing a poor response. I'm a fan of it... But.. it's a full fan service pizza with the lot. I'm bummed it didn't link with the Rian Johnson film and undid/ignored many threads. However I'd rather pass my time in this universe than at work, or with my family it appears too. Recommend."
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,Excellent close to the whole story line.
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,Connection to other Sages possible but this film landing kinda hard. Wish Lucas ex Wife original editor of Episode 4 had a hand in this Film.
"Jan 21, 2020",negative,"Duel of the Fates should have been the best Star Wars movie, but Disney turns Star Wars to garbage"
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,It was an amazing culmination to a great series!
"Jan 21, 2020",negative,"Just like every other movie in this new trilogy, everything is moved with coincidences that cause you to not care about anything anymore. If everything moves in a super contrived way that has to move in a way because it is convenient for the plot, I get bored. There were some revelations that drastically changed the dynamic of the characters but they were not properly acknowledged and then forgotten about. Overall, a terrible way to finish a new trilogy."
"Jan 21, 2020",neutral,"It made little-to-no sense, it felt rushed, under prepared and confused. But I'd be lying if I said I wasn't entertained."
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,"Uncharismatic actors, below average plot line and intrigue, the magic (and the Force) have left Star Wars.  This is what happens when you’re only interested in the hyper-commercialisation of even the most magical, even mythical, sci-fi cinematic story of all time.  How sad."
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,It tied up many questions I had.
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,"A great action story in the Star Wars genre'. Purists may balk, but it was a good movie to just sit and watch and be entertained. Isn't that what it is all about?"
"Jan 21, 2020",negative,Really really bad. Last jedi is the cause of this movie fail
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,"An enjoyable movie that doesn't get enough praise. The goal of a movie is to make in enjoyable, does it really matter how we reach that goal? Whether it be through fan service or plot this movie was a very good film that deserves more praise. Makes up for The Last Jedi."
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,"Definitely can be at the edge of your seat. Shocking, sympathetic experiences that only last a movie long. I loved it."
"Jan 21, 2020",negative,"Colin Trevorrow's original script for Episode IX is THE TRUE ONE! Read it! Everything how it supposed to happen, may be some little tweaks here and there only. Kathleen Kennedy RUINED Skywalker's Saga( ( I'm so mad and my heart is so broken that instead we got this!(("
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,"Do not listen to the Internet. It was a perfectly fine movie and fits into the Star Wars genre. Could it have been more, yes but  then that would make it Star Trek."
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,It was a great plot.
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,The movie was great!! The cinematics were great and audio was breathtaking! But if you dont know anything about the episode/series before it its hard to follow as to whats going on. But overall a great movie!
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,"I saw it with my grandchildren , and we like it so much."
"Jan 21, 2020",negative,"JJ did what he could to recover from RJ's terrible direction.. but ultimately episode 9 just can't fix a broken trilogy.. Nothing in this movie makes sense.. Kylo turns good out of nowhere because he had a Martha moment like in Batman vs Superman, then we have Emperor Palpatine alive after being thrown down a shaft and the deathstar exploding with no explanations. He has force lightning powerful enough to take out thousands of war ships but then is defeated by Rey simple walking towards him with her lightsabers crossed like a crucifix. To top it all off they have a herd of space horses lead an attack on the surface of a star destroyer that could've just tipped to the side and shook them off. And then at the end Rey and Kylo kiss, because we had to force some kind of romance even though nothing from the first 2 sequel movies built towards it nor did the final movie itself. This whole trilogy is incoherent trash."
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,"Fun culmination  of all the Star Wars chapters. I have been watching these since college, over 40 years ago. Glad I was around long enough to see the Skywalkers to the end."
"Jan 21, 2020",negative,"this is shit, i like 1-3rd episode better then this"
"Jan 21, 2020",negative,Worst movie I have ever seen. Absolutely ruined Star Wars. How in the world does the emperor survive. Oh wait they don't tell us. FRJ
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,Loved the movie! It brought parts from the other movie to a full circle!
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,"Loved it! Solid ending to the new trilogy. Disappointed with the fate of a certain character, but overall really happy with how everything ended up. I admit to crying as well. This film definitely had the emotional impact of sending all the characters we've grown to love off."
"Jan 21, 2020",negative,I was not expecting anything and still disappointed
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,It’s a beautiful love letter to all the fans.
"Jan 21, 2020",negative,"What a disappointing end to a promising trilogy. Too bad, because I love the new characters and the talented actors that portray them, and wanted a better sendoff for our heroes Rey, Finn, Poe, and Rose, as well as the villainous Kylo.

Great Star Wars movies aren't just an aesthetic. They are a form of mythic storytelling. Yet JJ Abrams has managed to stitch together something like a flesh golem, a zombie of a star wars movie that tries to win us over with cobbled together bits of nostalgia but is ultimately soulless and empty. His unoriginality is stunning. Seemingly incapable of new ideas, he hastily resurrects the Emperor with almost no justification, and introduces an arbitrary scale to his power. Remember the moon sized Death Star? Well, he conjures up a fleet of mini ""death stars"" which appear infinite, yet are summarily defeated when they need to be, not as a payoff to a dramatic setup, but because ""there are more of us.""

So much of this movie isn't working. Rather than build on the great character work done by Rian Johnson in TLJ, they seem intent on retconning everything from Kylo repairing his helmet (reversing an important character beat in TLJ) to Rey's parentage. The movie is rushed, relying on fetch quests and Goonies-esque macguffins to propel the plot forward at a relentlessly frenetic pace, as if mere acceleration was an acceptable substitute for character driven storytelling. Rose's character is unfairly sidelined. Apparently the appropriate narrative partner for Finn is just a female version of himself. And many of the decisions make the previous movies less coherent, such as the way they explain Snoke's origin (which didn't really need an explanation in the films if you ask me).

The best parts of the movie are the scenes between Kylo & Rey, but even these lack the emotional resonance of TLJ because TRoS never gives a scene room to breathe. It's too bad that they didn't have the courage to build on the great character and theme work done by Johnson in TLJ. A more imaginative and bolder final act cold have been great. A real missed opportunity."
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,"First viewing I see no issues with the movie. I liked The Last Jedi more, thats why 4.5 stars."
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,"An unlikely big bad is introduced, followed by a highly unlikely fetch quest, forcing an unlikely alliance, culminating in a boss fight.

The popcorn was OK."
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,l loved it! Great storyline and ending. If you're a Star Wars fan you're gonna love it. 
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,It was entertaining and was a good ending for the srarwars series
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,"I found it a satisfying conclusion to this trilogy and it leaves the door open to many more sequels. Okay, it jumped around a bit, but that didn't bother me, and I loved the way it came full circle at the end. Lots of new characters and possible story arcs. Leia has been given her due and laid to rest, and I thought they did a reasonably good job with her appearances. I'm looking forward to the next trilogy."
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,"I for one loved this movie. It made me grin like when I was 7 watching the speeder chase on Endor. Do you need to suspend belief and be open to what the writers put before you? Yes, but is that any different than when the weird movie ""The Star Wars"" debuted in 1977?"
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,"Terrific action! Very affecting and sweet in places and did a great job honoring Carrie Fischer.   Lots of fun, too. Total satisfaction in completing all threads, too. Will miss series, but this was perfect end."
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,"I liked the blend of old story telling style mixed with the new CGI effects everyone is accustomed to now. The only thing I did not like was, Finn never told Rey what he was going to tell her. Not sure why. The only thing I could think of was, and Im not surprised, there is another movie coming to answer that question."
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,"A fitting end to a trilogy that started back in 1977... Quite a feat to conclude a story that spans 42 years.
I've enjoyed the ride, and look forward to what Lucasfilm and Disney will do with the franchise next."
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,Best movie I’ve ever seen
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,"Safe. But after the disappointments from the previous films, they really didn't have much room for controversy or braveness. What you get is what Star Wars fans deserve after constantly complaining when every new film is held against the original trilogy. A conclusion and nothing else. I kinda love the simplicity of the story but mostly it just felt right."
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,I think this is my favorite of the the new ones it has unexpected turns in the story and then it wraps everything up really well in the end.
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,"Fast moving. Easy parallels to star wars 4, 5, 6"
"Jan 21, 2020",negative,"In an unexpected turn of events... The Rise of Skywalker takes a shift in course from the events set in motion from it's predecessor, The Last Jedi. But it's new course isn't sure what it's trying to do... Too much fan service, even for this fan. I wish they had tried to tell an overall story with the three new films, and with ROS, it is apparent that the team at Lucasfilm was winging it as they went along. 

Rather than add fuel to fire the raging fanbase (righteous indignation if you ask me). I'll just say, I think the direction the franchise took with TLJ was a mistake, but could have been seen through to a satisfying conclusion. However, I think the creative team for ROS didn't have any contextual ideas with where to take the story after TLJ.
 
Pros:
-Pretty special effects
-Nice soundtrack, thanks John Williams
-Cool actors

Cons:
-Nothing to enrich the Star Wars universe
-Unearned (horrible) ""DBZ esque"" finale with Rey and Palpatine
-Pooped a hard one on the original and prequel trilogies
-Made an enormous mess of pre-established lore
-Not enough character development, same problem as the last two films
-Too long
-Another fetch the item plot? C'mon JJ, you did that in the last one... and no other Star Wars movies relied so heavily on silly MacGuffins."
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,Awesome movie loved every minute of it. My son especially loved Babu Frik.
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,It was a circle of history. closing the book in the best way possible.
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,"I know that this movie was aimed at Star Wars fans who know all the back stories, but it was like watching the movie in fast forward. Scenes were quickly put together, then jump to the next. No character building or even marveling at the scenery."
"Jan 21, 2020",negative,I hope this is the LAST one.
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,Absolutely loved it! Answered all of my questions. Tied up loose ends. Related everything back to the original trilogy and almost made me cry.
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,"Frankly, I liked it. It may have loopholes but overall it was a satisfying end. I'm glad it has wrapped up so we can move on to see the other stories/characters in the Star Wars world."
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,Terrific finish to a great series
"Jan 21, 2020",negative,The Skywalkers are dead. The Palpatines live. Derp.
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,Pretty good. The only issue is they just ignored the connection between Finn & Rose. They had a quick lame mention of it like it was on the backbone. they could have shown in the end them hugging or something. They really missed the mark on that one. The ending with Ben & Rey was fitting. I definitely recommend if you have seen the other two in this series just as a finale.
"Jan 21, 2020",negative,the ending was not my favorite.
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,"I LOVED this movie. A satisfying, well-crafted finale to the Skywalker Saga! After the stink bomb that was The Last Jedi, this movie is a breath of fresh air. Bringing back Palpatine was a great idea and a lot of fun. Some well-needed retconning, lots of fan service, lots of cameos, lots of tie-ins from previous episodes, yeah, it's pretty great."
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,Weird plot twist at the end had me confused
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,Entertaining. Good but not one of the best Star Wars movies 
"Jan 21, 2020",negative,"On every level this movie failed. I tried to find independently, something to like.  For example...was it a good story...no.  Was there good new musical scores....no. How about a real epic space battle - no. Great light sabre fighting scene.... again no. How about a bunch of cool new weapons and ships... again ...no. Just pay to win type power creep in the jedi force powers. The worst by far of all nine movies."
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,Just a long cameo appearance by all the old favorites....why not just make a movie with the old favorites.
"Jan 21, 2020",negative,Rise of Skywalker was just a rehash of the other movies. It was all very predictable.
"Jan 21, 2020",neutral,the story is almost similar to how the first jedai started
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,"Loved it, but I have been a Star Wars fan from the beginning, saw the original 17 times in the theater. Prices were alot cheaper then.lol."
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,We thought it was a great movie!!
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,"A nice job of wrapping up the saga, masterfully done by JJ Abrams"
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,Great way to end the saga
"Jan 21, 2020",negative,After spending my entire life watching these movies it seemed anti-climatic for being the end.
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,Typical of the jj Abrams vehicle. Weak story. Lots of action.
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,Definitely better than the last installment.  Gotta love a happy ending.
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,Absolutely loved it!
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,"If you enjoyed most of the Star wars movies, this is an excellent way to finish the Skywalker saga."
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,Great end to the story arc.
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,Outstanding movie. Great ending.
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,This movie answered several questions for me. It was very touching at least 3 times. Plenty of happy moments as well. I enjoyed the movie and am glad I got to see it on the big screen.
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,Epic ending (?) to the story.
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,it was great seeing characters from the earlier Star War Films. Totally enjoyed The Rise of Sky Walker from beginning to end.
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,"It was an excellent conclusion to the saga, while adding interesting new pieces."
"Jan 21, 2020",negative,"</3 I think we are just happy it's over and we can move on to new star wars arcs.
 To bad they didn't use George Lucas's movie.

Help us Jon Favreau & Dave Filoni. You are our only hope."
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,"I was just happy to be sitting in a theater watching a Star wars movie, however my wife thought it was the worst of the nine. she thought it was predictable and lazy and not well acted. not necessarily saying that I disagree but like I said before, I'm easily amused and I was just happy to be in a theater watching a Star wars movie."
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,"It was sad to see the original cast leave, But a new generation knew they were  ready, when they were called. The new cast done a great job. i enjoyed it."
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,A rehash of a new hope
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,"It was more of a traditional star wars movie, nod to things of the past, good fight scenes, and campy parts.  Some parts dragged on to long but for the most part a good movie."
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,Finally a post-Lucas Star Wars movie did fell for the disneyfication of the previous episodes. It is well made. It is an end of an era. Clearly they're closing it off. I am curious what is going to happen next!
"Jan 21, 2020",negative,"Oof it was so bad so generic key phrases repeated over and over again, bad comedy and a mess of an edit, this was an awful ending to the ""saga"""
"Jan 21, 2020",neutral,Ghost Luke was just laughable. This franchise is past the try-hard stage.
"Jan 21, 2020",negative,The worst bit of garbage I have seen in quite some time.
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,Great end to the Skywalker Saga. Lots of action and laughs super happy with the choices of Abrams.
"Jan 21, 2020",negative,worst star wars movie ever.
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,"great! it brings together all the pieces.it does it while at the same time putting together this last bit it makes it all..sensational.it's the icing on the cake.Rated a""spinal-tap""11!"
"Jan 21, 2020",negative,"Star Wars has been my favorite franchise, since I was a little kid. I have seen and owned every movie, and many of the books. I love everything about the lore and story. But I have to say, this movie was the worst piece of garbage I have seen, in a reeeeally long time. 

The movie was all over the place. Nothing was actually set up, in a way that made sense. Everything that happened was just given to you, rather than it being earned by any of the characters. The Kylo/Rey thing at the end was absolutely pointless. The last 10 minutes of the movie was utterly incomprehensible. If it were not for the great acting, I would say this movie was worse than Captain Marvel. 

The only saving grace for this movie, honestly, were the scenes with Palpatine. They were cool and felt weighty, like OH CRAP. But even that wonderful bit was RUINED by how quickly he was defeated. He was defeated quicker than Snoke. And that ""I am ALL Jedi"" line was such lame dialogue. What little time it took Kylo to change his motivations, was laughable. Also, Rey saying what her last name was, at the end. Made NO sense.

As many problems as people had with Lucas directing, I would MUCH rather HE had been the one to finish his story. Because it was so incredibly disappointing. Not even just from a Star Wars perspective, but more from a writing perspective. It just was not good and I hate to say it. What is even more unfortunate is that many people will say it was good, because we don't know what to look for in good film anymore. We look for whether or not it checks boxes for explosions, flashy effects, and specific Hollywood messaging, but can no longer objectively see or say that something was not actually written well, if it is a ""blockbuster"" film. I defended the 1st 2 movies of this trilogy and really hoped this one would fix what those 2 lacked. It didn't, imho.

I love Star Wars and I love movies. Usually if a movie has problems, I simply watch it for pure entertainment value, but in this case, there was very little value in it at all. I just left the theater completely and utterly disappointed, and I just do not know what to do with that."
"Jan 21, 2020",neutral,A desperate attempt that trie to do a lot and ends up doing so little
"Jan 21, 2020",positive,By far the best of the new trilogy. The power level of Rey explained. Klyo is a tough dude (yes I like Reylo).  I would totally show up to the theaters for a Finn/Poe buddy movie of them hunting down bad guy throughout the universe.
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,cinematography was just amazing and loved how the stories all came together. incredible film!!!
"Jan 20, 2020",negative,Garbage! Total trash. Terribly hard to watch the forced scenes with Carrie Fisher. Cringe worthy to say the least!
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,"It was a pretty good flick and a closing of a story that was in need. But the story felt, empty. Was not the best of all the Star Wars movies. Still good to see the story come full circle to an ending."
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,Solid movie - nothing hokey like what happened in The Last Jedi but nothing inspiring either.
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,Loved how all the stories and characters came all together!
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,"No denying it was entertaining, but not engrossing.  It seemed like the writers & director were going down a checklist of Star Wars fave scenes because those are what long time fans love and want to see, without much effort to bring something fresh to the story.  Like a 50th reunion tour of an old rock band that plays only their original, ancient hits."
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,Great!! Awesome finish
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,Made me laugh and cry.  Good movie.
"Jan 20, 2020",negative,I just don't understand how Disney can consistently knock it out of the park with Marvel but then allow Star Wars to play out like THIS.
"Jan 20, 2020",negative,"Incoherent, nothing makes sense."
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,This was an exciting little romp through the Star Wars and a nice end to this trilogy. There was some nice surprises as well and enough material to lead to other stories.
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,"It’s hard to wrap up a movie franchise like this, which spanned so many different peoples childhoods. The movie was good, but I personally wish they would have done some things differently."
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,"This movie was for the fans. It was the ""Indiana Jones: Last crusade"" to this trilogy.
It did a lot at a break neck pace, but it had to.  JJ Abrams finally showed that he could conclude a story well."
"Jan 20, 2020",neutral,"I thought the basic plot line was a rehash of old Star Wars, and at some point, got too syrupy sweet at end.   It was a decent Saturday night viewing and fun in that sense but it is time to call an end to these.  I think the end was bit unbelievable.  My wife left happy, and I was basically disappointed at the lack or originality.   The awe and wonder of the original series are gone, and with all the main characters gone, I'm just not as fully invested. The heroine does a nice job, and I was pleased with her character development.   Wren, not so much."
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,Most Star Wars series are great except a few with disappointing endings. This one was great
"Jan 20, 2020",negative,"I had so much expectation for the outcome of the series and this just took all that down,not to say the movie was terrible, but not one I'd watch again"
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,movie was a great ride. appealed to all my senses.
"Jan 20, 2020",negative,"Formulaic and written for a 4th grade audience. Checking the boxes and cashing in on the franchise. The special effects that used to be engaging are now prosaic.  No hint of originality, unless you count as yet unseen, sidebar aliens. The Force Is No Longer With Us."
"Jan 20, 2020",negative,"Well, the scoring and visual effects are amazing as usual for a movie with that kind of budget. It still can't a movie built on one contrivance after another ( the return of the emperor the prime example)"
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,Loved it! But would have been cool if Kaylo Ren lived🙏🏼
"Jan 20, 2020",negative,A lackluster wrap-up to a story destroyed by the current creative regime. Sad that the last 3 movies are canon now.
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,Movie ended was okay
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,"Great movie, can't wait to watch it again!"
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,I like how they wrapped up all major character's story lines.
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,"I gave it a 3 over a 2 just because It looked great, the acting was good and JJ did fix the helmet. However there were no new jedi or siths and it just had no fire in it or imagination. We wanted new, but JJ Abram sent us back. Not good movie o er all. Not enough. We just wanted more imagination and conflict."
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,"Great continuation from the last Jedi and concluded the Skywalker Saga in an amazing way. Truly nothing like Star Wars in the world. This film brings the emotion and action, and I could not be more pleased!"
"Jan 20, 2020",negative,"When you create problems unresolved in the first two films by being as careless with a freshly bought franchise as Star Wars -it's easy to get drunk on how much money there is to be made -like a teen aged boy left home alone with his dad's sports car who's first gut feeling is to tear up the town with it only to realize -It's too late to roll the miles back, or hide the fact you totaled it ...Wait THOSE were plots to GOOD FILMS, Unfortunately in real life there is nothing amusing about what Abrams, Kennedy with Disney have done -which is cheapened the product, Relied on selling nostalgia, and pitching  less character development and more ""action"". The result is in the Third movie, They need to ANSWER for the mess. Who the hell is Snoke? What's the premise for the final confrontation? What's up with Rey? Why is she SO OVERPOWERED? What to do with weak and annoying characters? So the result is to just tick off the boxes haphazardly as if they gave a crap in the first place, -Go ALL IN with DOING ANYTHING IT TAKES to close up plot holes and create a finale with far reaching ridiculous ideas that are so over the top you have to just suspend disbelief. SO if you can't tell the difference between a good paint job and one done for $99.99 or instant coffee from fresh brewed, a knock off Chinese made rip off from the real thing then I suppose you are not to blame for thinking it's as good as it gets."
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,"Very Good movie, not great but very good"
"Jan 20, 2020",neutral,It was a bad victory lap of sorts for this saga.  Sad.
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,"Flawed, but enjoyable."
"Jan 20, 2020",negative,"I really wish Disney would just hit the hard reset button and do these trilogies over. This movie was awful, it created plot holes in the entire saga, bringing back sidious just for Rey to win was even more stupid. The wacky abusive relationship between Kylo and Rey was dumb. This was such a stupid movie, I'm so sad about what they did to Star Wars."
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,awesome movie lots of action
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,"very disappointed, I could've wrote something better, I wish I was lying"
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,Fantastic end to the series.
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,"While not as good at The Force Awakens it's not nearly as bad as people make it out to be. It is a convoluted mess, but at least its a fun mess."
"Jan 20, 2020",negative,Honestly as a space movie it's ok but as a Star Wars movie it's trash
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,Excellent conclusion
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,What movie *would* meet fans' expectations? It's fine and Adam Driver as Kylo Ren/Ben Solo is a thirst trap.
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,Much better second time around. Picked up on items that explained the movie better.
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,I was interesting how they revised Carrie Fisher's role.  The special effects where good.  The plot was a little thin a points.
"Jan 20, 2020",neutral,I Just don't care for how Disney has come in and made the force to be a religion.
"Jan 20, 2020",negative,"Bad. There was so much that this movie could have been. Director Rian Johnson put so many cards on the table especially interesting themes like how the force lives inside all of us. And if the force exists inside of all of us, then Rey didn't need to belong to a special family. But for this movie to unravel all the work The Last Jedi did, I just couldn't sit along for the ride."
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,"This movie was entertaining from beginning to end. It had the action necessary for a Star Wars movie and though the challenge was great to wrap up the 9-movie arch, this was a fun movie to watch!"
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,Action all the way no slow parts
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,My 10 year old Star Wars fan and I thought it was awesome!  I put significantly more weight on what my kiddo and the audience thinks vs. a critic review:-)
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,Perfect end to this sprawling Star Wars storyline...loved it!
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,Did a great job of tying up the story was an extremely enjoyable and fun movie.
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,Legal... mas a briga de roteiros é perceptivel no filme
"Jan 20, 2020",negative,Nonsensical storytelling punctuated by an overdose of fan service.
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,"Yes - 'meh, it passed the time' about sums it up. Would have hoped for a stronger story. It had all of the visuals and CGI that you would expect. Some characters grew and developed, but others went backwards. With all of the conflict that Rey went through to get where she did, the completion of the journey and execution felt weak. 
It was okay. I'm glad I saw it in the theatre. I was not one of those who were hard  on about how The Last Jedi was not true to the story, because it had a pretty good story and you saw how the characters were growing. Not so much this time I thought. 
When will the next Star Wars story come out...............?"
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,Wrapped up the movie series. Rey gets closure.
"Jan 20, 2020",negative,Worst of SW saga... I am very dissspointed and frustrated.
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,"Considering the situation JJ Abrams was in (limited time to tell a story, Carrie fishers passing, questions from previous two movies, tying up the whole saga, etc) he did a good job. Leaves more to be desired and it’s a lot of movie with no time to breath. Overall it’s satisfying."
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,a little slow in a couple of areas
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,"I think some of the negative reviews are due to the bar being set unrealistically high for these films- that being said it was a really enjoyable movie.  Perhaps some of it seemed forced or trying too hard to please the crowd, but overall I thought it was an excellent film."
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,They saved the best for last.
"Jan 20, 2020",neutral,"Visually splendid, but the story arc was vanilla and just bloated and unwieldy. I liked seeing some of the characters from days of old, but the fan service and forced wrapping up of character story lines, or the lack thereof with some, was often painful to be a part of. I just didn't feel that any of the gravitas was earned, including the ending that was a very forced way to connect all the dots."
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,A great ending to a marvelous reboot in a beloved series!
"Jan 20, 2020",negative,"How do the characters fight in the vaccum of space, without any space suit? Illogical! 
The movie was all over the place and does not make sense."
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,Awesome!  Wonderful!  And even better than expected!
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,Loved the fact that they brought back all the characters from the past movies.
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,"I thought the movie was tremendously entertaining and a valid end to the series.  I've watched all of the Star Wars movies and this one is definitely in the top 3.  I don't understand why the critics are tearing it apart.  It feels very much like the original 3, which I love.  And didn't have some weird, wacky ending to make it ""better"".  I feel like it delivered perfectly for those true Star Wars fans that have supported the franchise from the beginning.  Definitely go see it on the big screen."
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,Anyone else get that “On your left..” Avengers: Endgame Deja Vu?
"Jan 20, 2020",negative,Despite some strange moments in the film that seemed out of place and or awkward i really feel it could have saved itself and this trilogy if the ending was different.
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,One of the best Stars Wars I have seen and I grew up with the originals!
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,Great end to the series! As well done as any in the saga. Fun and true to the history.
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,"I really liked this closing chapter of the nine movies! It was ""similar"" to the Star Wars franchise that we all grew to love, but ""new"" with some twists and turns which kept me on my toes. Thank you to ALL the Star Wars story-tellers who captured our hearts for all these decades!"
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,So good. I hate that Kylo Ren dies. I’m a sucker for happy endings and that would have awesome if they ended together instead of one dying.
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,A good ending to the saga 
"Jan 20, 2020",negative,I'll be glad when making another Star Wars movie is no longer seen as a potentially profitable endeavor. This has to end before it becomes impossible to even laugh at.
"Jan 20, 2020",negative,"Crammed with a lot of fast paced sequences that distract you from the writing. If you try and analyze the plot there are too many things that don't make sense. Half the movie involves them chasing after an object that makes gives me the feeling it only exists to fill time because the writers didn't know what to make the movie about. In many scenes of dialogue the characters don't even matter because their only purpose is to explain what is happening. It relies heavily on cheap nostalgia that doesn't make any sense from the perspective of the characters. I enjoyed some parts in the ending, but it didn't make up for the rest of the movie. This movie is okay on its own, but as an end to the entire Skywalker Saga it really falls flat. Instead of trying to build off the themes or ideas from any of the other movies it just pushes everything aside for a very shallow and flashy plot. It doesn't feel like it's wrapping up a 9 movie story but instead feels like a remake of the plot from Return of the Jedi but with even less depth. If you're a critic of JJ Abram's style then you are going to hate this movie."
"Jan 20, 2020",negative,"Enjoyable effects and a great end of a saga for fans of Star Wars, but the script is lost during the development of  its narratives and history."
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,I don't know why people are panning this movie. I think they're just upset that the series is over (as am I). I thought it was a great closeout of a great saga...and something that really needs to be seen  in a theater.
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,Loved it!  Great movie experiece
"Jan 20, 2020",negative,Not entertaining AT ALL
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,"it was a good movie, nothing to complain about."
"Jan 20, 2020",negative,"The movie feels like they were more concerned with pandering to the worst impulses of the fanbase than delivering a coherent story or building on anything established in the last two movies.  While there are an abundance of well executed moments that'll no doubt please long time fans, less fervent viewers will likely find it very hard to forgive the abundance of technical flaws in the script."
"Jan 20, 2020",negative,"The most illogical of the franchise. Instead of focusing on telling a good story they tried too hard to pander to everyone and didn't even succeed at that.
Cool visuals but no substance. The most unsatisfying of set ups and payoff.  
This pains me to say this because I'm a hard core starwars fan but this gives attack of the clones a run for its money as the worst in the franchise."
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,"The movie was kind of slow at first, but picked up. It was an emotional movie especially with Carrie Fisher in ot knowing she passed away. I feel they honored her in the way Leia died in the movie and was shocked when Kylo/Ben died. But over all I liked the movie and as others want to know is how did Palpatine survive the fall from Return of the Jedi?"
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,"Spoilers ahead! I loved this movie because it brought in healing, added more redemption, and the stated idea of leading together. It's main flaws were that it wasn't long enough to wrap everything up, and there wasn't enough of Rose, or of Finn and Rey who's dynamic I love. I thought it flowed well from The Last Jedi. I liked that Rey and Ben found a way to work together to make the Emperor kill himself, a lovely metaphor for people overthrowing oppressors."
"Jan 20, 2020",negative,"Possibly one of the worst movies I have seen.  It was long, boring, and confusing.  No thought was given to reality in any way, shape, or form.  It was lame, predictable, and had way too many cheesy attempts at drama/nostalgia. The whole movie could have been condensed into 1 hour...and that still would have been too long.  I remember how great the first 3 episodes were when they came out; each subsequent one was worse than the previous.  Maybe this was just geared towards millennials."
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,I liked it good movie
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,A satisfying end to the Skywalker saga given that JJ Abrams had to rescue the plot from the terrible film that was 'the last Jedi'. This resulted in poor story telling in places with a lack of explanation of key plot points. Good actions sequences and Kylo Ren's story was excellent. A must watch.
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,I thought it was unpredictable and the special affects were great.
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,Unbelievable culmination of the series!!!  couldn't have asked for more.  So many unspoken references to earlier movies in the series.  CRAZY GOOD!
"Jan 20, 2020",negative,amazing way to end a saga
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,LOVED EVERY MOMENT!!!
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,"Absolutely a great wrap-up of a saga that started when i was only 15 yrs old.  The connecting links of the story line were nicely done and pulled together.  JJ Abrams did a great job finishing the story that George Lucas started, so long ago!!"
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,The movie plays with some interesting ideas that don't fall flat. They have an interesting character arch for Kylo Ren and Rey. The ending is great and there is a lot of interesting twists in the movie. The movie is a great watch if you're a Star Wars fan.
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,I had no clue what was happening
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,"An epic finale to the Star Wars Saga. One of the best Star War films, JJ Abrams once again does a great job creating a beautiful story with phenomenal character development. Rise of Skywalker is a must see!"
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,It tied the originals with the final...loved that!’
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,It was very entertaining and exciting to watch. I really enjoyed this movie a lot.
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,Must see for SW fans.
"Jan 20, 2020",negative,"It not good. I am very disappointed. It does try to redo what happend in The Last Jedi. Which i think could work. But it was done extremely poorly.
They could have try to accept what came before it and build on it. Instead of redoing what happend in The Last Jedi.
If i need to rank this movie in the Skywalker saga then it comes at last. Its my least favorite in the franchise to.

But I want the J.J.Abrams and George Lucas cut  that exist. Release it Disney!!. That WILL redeem the movie. And remove THIS bad version from Canon..."
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,It was a good movie.
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,"The continuous action and special effects were outstanding.  However, some of the story line could have used a bit more work.  Looking forward to the ""Director's Cut"" of the movie"
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,"Loved it. It's not perfect by any means, but the third in a trilogy is always the hardest to get right. The Last Jedi was cinematic and storytelling perfection, and while this one doesn't live up to the same standard set with TLJ in the story, writing, and mainly the pacing department, it's still an incredible movie with some incredible set pieces, and beautiful, heartbreaking, and breathtaking moments. No one is ever going to agree with all the story decisions or characters' choices, but overall it was done very well and I'm perfectly satisfied with the entire sequel trilogy as a whole. It's great!"
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,"Good overall movie, some obvious tie up moments and some moments you just have to go with it but overall a very good movie and definitely worth seeing"
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,"If you are a fan of the original trilogy (4, 5, 6) you will love this one!"
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,"The sequel trilogy has problems sure but I must admit I had a very good time with this movie. Especially after being disappointed with The Last Jedi.  Star Wars is meant to be an escape and though the fan base is so divided there is plenty of fantasy for everyone to enjoy. I clapped along with the audience as the opening crawl started and I cheered with them as Rey proclaimed herself a Skywalker. This was a good time. I'm as old as the original trilogy which holds a very special place in my heart. I appreciated the way the story was tied up especially Carrie Fisher's Princess ""General"" Leia."
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,"The last trilogy did a nice job of tying up the mega saga. There were a few WTF moments, but loved the sense of humor throughout. Also, you have to be ok with the star wars curtain call throughout the movie. I was and loved the adventure."
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,I liked the story but the transitions from scene to scene felt off.
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,It was much better than i expected.
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,Typical Star War's movie.
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,"GREAT ACTION, GREAT PLOT!"
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,I liked the characters and how they acted it made the movie great.
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,So good from the very start. Absolutely loved it!
"Jan 20, 2020",negative,This movie just a lame copy of the original triology.
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,All the action and spectacle you could hope for.
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,Speechless.  Bring hankies!
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,The movie was unnecessarily long in some places.  Still a great movie
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,Liked the pacing and action Princess Leis was weak
"Jan 20, 2020",negative,Same story for the 9th time.  Evil Empire with planet-destroying weapons with little rebellion support.  How will the rebellion succeed?!  Predictable outcomes.  Every time.  Meh
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,"Good Movie, some plot lines not developed as much as you would want and conclusion makes you wonder if this is the end. But my nephew loved it and thats what matters."
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,"Very similar to Episode 7 in the way the movie felt, however because it had to fix to many issues with episode 8 it was very erratic and extremely contradistinction to episode 8. 

While it was entertaining to watch, to an actual star wars fan it had its own 
 horrendous blunders not to mention it's fast pace. 

I am thankful they ""fixed"" the many issues in episode 8, however it felt like the entire movie was to overwrite and redo all the issues and plot holes. It would have been better to just re-do episode 8."
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,A good story about a battle against Good and Evil. Who will win..?
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,"I really liked this movie. It wraps up the story of Luke, Leia and Han which is really sad for me. But, it's by no means a conclusion to the Star Wars universe."
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,I thought it was a fun movie.
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,Great ending to the saga.
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,A great ending to star war
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,"Plot and effects were good. Definitely Disney-fied. Could have been shorter, too many extra little shots that definitely came from the Disney influence"
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,I fell asleep just more of the same love story.
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,Although I have seen all of the films the first time around and the second time around with my grandsons this film is the most understandable of the who's who and relationships in my opinion.
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,"Action adventure that you expect from Star Wars. I wish the plot was less predictable, but a few twist made it fun nonetheless.  I do wish they had explained some things, like how the emperor survived Vader throwing him into the reactor."
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,It was an excellent finish to the sky walker saga
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,"The think the cinematography, acting and action were all great!"
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,"While there were some continuity issues (e.g. Luke always knew who Rey's grandfather was, yet somehow was shocked by how powerful she was in the second movie), this was still a fun and exciting conclusion to the series. Yes, it was completely predictable. Yes, no major characters died except the couple I expected to die. This did not match up to the scope of the villain. But I can't help but to have liked it. It was fun."
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,"Solid conclusion to the Skywalker story. A little long, but overall it was an entertaining film."
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,Excellent movie.  Well worth the ticket price.
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,I thought it was great especially for fans. Nice story really care about the characters. The pace is fast but still understandable.
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,The movie never got boring... had some awesome twist of events 😜
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,The movie has characters you care about. A lot of great action scenes.  It’s entertaining. You don’t feel the long length.
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,"Engaging story, great quirky acting which the Star Wars brand is known for. The Lead actress playing Ray nails her scenes, and makes a very believable story line, shes becoming comfortable in her Star Wars skin. Highly recommended movie."
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,"A little far fetched (force abilities) for new users of the force. However, my wife and I enjoyed the movie. It was fast paced and sometimes dizzying trying to keep up but we enjoyed all the fan service jj did."
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,Sad to see e d. Big part of my childhood
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,"Loved it.
At heart , a younger female epic force user & a similar earlier fallen male ex jedi one, mythic Princess Leia presence character & some Luke magic, contending with darkest shade of Sith Emperor Palpatine on the brink. all mixed in with great moments with the force throughout the film. Call backs also to PT & other eu SW lore if into it, while kept entertaining & dramatically tense enough through-out - all with a busy pace. Additional viewings still rewarding. Top big screen Star Wars."
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,"Much better than The Last Jedi, and it partly tries to undo some of TLJ's worst aspects. Good aspects include that Finn comes back as a much stronger character, bad aspects include that they didn't do the same with Rose Tico."
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,Best movie of the year
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,it was awesome and a great way to end the series.
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,A CELEBRATION OF THE ENTIRE SKYWALKER SAGA !!!!!!!
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,"This is not a film for the cynical or the jaded. This film is about friendship, loss, and healing. This a sweeping epic that raises more questions as is races to answer others. That is the point. As in the original trilogy, the camera quickly pans past creatures and characters who could be the centerpiece of another film. Hopefully this film appeals to your sense of wonder."
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,"It's one of my favourite star wars movie. I love every part. The character are so dynamic and unique. The love story,la the best"
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,"Good end to a franchise...I hope.  If there are flaws, it's worth overlooking and simply go with the story."
"Jan 20, 2020",negative,"Roteiro medíocre e cheio de facilitações, reviravoltas sem sentido que não acrescentam em nada, personagens COMPLETAMENTE INÚTEIS, ESQUECIVEIS e nem um pouco carismáticos, na batalha final não vence quem é mais poderoso, ou quem tem conhecimento sobre a força, 
Vence quem grita mais alto."
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,Story felt rushed and some characters felt insignificant. pacing was trash. but the video/audio was absolutely amazing that alone in a star qars universe mames it pretty ok.
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,It is good movies and amazing
"Jan 20, 2020",negative,"very weak plot, bu far the worst star wars movie, not a good way to end the trilogy."
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,meh. More like a violent children's story than a good movie. glad we went to a matinee.
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,Well made. Nice to see strong female characters as the lead.
"Jan 20, 2020",negative,Really bad pacing. Would rather watch Phantom Menace 10 more times than this.
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,I thought it was a good time not very surprising but entertaining.
"Jan 20, 2020",negative,"The half star belongs to JJ for doing the best he could with what he had to work with, and still managing to disappoint."
"Jan 20, 2020",negative,"Finales are difficult to pull off especially when the previous movie had done everything in its power to subvert a narrative plot, Rise of Skywalker just goes through the motions of what you would expect from a final trilogy movie. 
2 hours and 22 minuets of box checking, rehashed ideas and poorly contrived fan service make this movie a chore to watch if you spend anytime trying to think about what is happening in front of you, if you do you are likely to miss a good deal of the movie scenes happen that fast.
Watch if you just want a day out at the cinema and nothing else is on, miss completely if you are a fan of the Last Jedi or Star Wars in general, it's not worth the headache."
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,"If you are a StarWars fan, must watch."
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,It was pretty decent.  The exact opposite of the terrible fanfic that was Last Jedi.
"Jan 20, 2020",negative,"Hate that the purchase of my and my wife's tickets contributed to the success of this miserable movie. TLJ left me angry, but at least I respected the artistry and competent direction even if I didn't care for the narrative.  This movie was sooo Fast and Furious. Which is ok for that franchise. Everything seemed made up on the spot as if two five year olds were playing and they made a $200 million dollar movie from this play session. Just nonsensical and soulless. I felt nothing whether there was death, sacrifice or impossible victory. It was just numb running around from one place to another, never taking the time to take things in and feel. This movie is a waste."
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,"This was my 2nd favorite Star Wars movie behind ""Empire Strikes Back"" and I felt it wrapped up the series perfectly."
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,"Outstanding movie.  They have a lot of story to tell, but JJ Abrams focuses on the parts that are most important:  Jedi vs Sith being brought to a conclusive end, relationship between Rey, Finn and Poe... and Rey's relationship with Kylo Ren.  Kylo Ren is finally a ""bad ass"", and Rey's power is understandable."
"Jan 20, 2020",neutral,"Kylo Ren's ""cracked"" helmet bothered me more than any other element in a Star Wars movie. Overall ended a great series in a pretty average way."
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,That was the best Star Wars battle ever! RIP Leia and Kylo Ren!
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,Great special effects and some answers to long standing questions.
"Jan 20, 2020",neutral,"Too fumbled balls to name. As a stand alone film, there action than actual explained story.  As the finale of finales, TROS doesn’t suck the landing."
"Jan 20, 2020",negative,Shoehorned in plot points. All relationships felt forced. Disappointing ending to a disappointing reboot.
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,"Too much time spent on tying up all of the loose ends and making a happy a Jedi ending. Sorry, doesnt end like that way."
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,It was a good movie.
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,Totally awesome...excellent finale to a successful series of epic films!
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,I am a fan and have been for 30 years.
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,That ending though :/
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,More action then any other...
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,"Star Wars never dissapoints. A great next chapter of the story of Rey, Finn, Kylo Ren, Leia, Chewbacca, and Poe. Nice surprise bringing back Lando and an awesome story to the end. Definitely going to buy!"
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,"Not as bad as people say it was, I enjoyed it"
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,The best one out of all the movies. Too many cool things to mention that might be spoilers.
"Jan 20, 2020",negative,So much wrong with it. There were only a few scenes that were any good and that is only because of the actors. This film was like a bad fan fiction on a Hollywood budget. I sat in a daze. I never fall asleep at movies and I almost did several times. They really ran over everyone and their character in this movie.
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,It was very good story line
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,I love it Star Wars movies thanks good time
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,I thought they did a great job of wrapping things up. Very exciting.
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,"There was nothing to dislike in my opinion. I think Disney did a great job, I think they did Lucas proud."
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,"Graphics were incredible, and it was a fitting and appropriate end to an Awesome Epic Arc!"
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,"Awesome story and characters. I love the way they allowed developed Rey in this film and opened an entire new line of films to be possible! We love Star Wars and have named our cats after Yoda, Darth Vader and Chewy! I can’t wait to see what happens next with the series! I went with my daughter and this was her first Star Wars film! She is ecstatic about the series! We will be watching the other films over the next couple of weeks!"
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,Great movie.  Thoroughly enjoyed it.
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,"Who cares what the critics say, it was another kick-ass Star Wars Film. My son and I loved it!"
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,"It was good, a lot of nostalgia, definitely had room for improvement though."
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,"Unfortunately, the last installment has been one of the easiest to guess what is going to happen next.  Special effects are extraordinary, as usual, but the script left something to desire.  JJ Abrams kept this to close to the old formula, as a refresh and new perspective may have done well.  Decent end, but not what I thought would have happened given the lineage of this franchise."
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,A fun time with friends but held little to no substance and threw a lot of unforeseen curve balls that had absolutely no foreshadowing at all.
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,Fantastic conclusion to the series.  The movie masterfully connected the entire series bringing it to the final ending it deserves.  Wonderful acting and brilliant storytelling.
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,"Didn't need to be so long.  Feels like at least two movies smashed together into one. Overall, though, it's not bad."
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,"The movie kept my attention throughout. Even though I havent seen all of the Star Wars movies up until this one, knowing enough of the back story you could easily follow along. It was very well done and I would definitely see it again."
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,Wonderful conclusion to the final trilogy!
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,"This Star Wars movie was probably the best hours movie I have ever seen, all of the references from all of the sauers movies may being really happy, the end of the movie felt so complete and nothing felt rushed to me. I don't know what the critics were thinking about giving this movie bad reviews and stuff. If you go and see this movie I am telling you that you till love it because I loved this movie so much. I highly reccomend it"
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,One of the best Star Wars in a long time. Great effects. And I care about these characters.
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,It was a great movie a few surprises. Told everything about people over the years. If people are a Star Wars fan they should go sect.
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,I LOVED IT! Everything was amazing except that I wish we got more time to experience the culture of the aki aki during the once every 42 year festival of the ancestors.
"Jan 20, 2020",negative,"A complete mess of a movie. It was so much like Endgame it wasn't funny. With no clear direction for the sequel trilogy and the complete dump Rian Johnson created with The Last Jedi, this had too much to do. While derivative at times, The Force Awakens showed some promise for the sequels, but the wheels fell off with Episode VIII and crashed and burned with IX. Shame. I used to love Star Wars."
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,Excellent movie. Well put! Definitely recommend seeing
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,"Star Wars is meant to be action and cool special effects, and it did that. But I mean, the plot was a little goofy."
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,Wasn’t as good as I taught it would be
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,My family and I loved this movie.  We all enjoyed it very much.  It was very exciting and heartfelt.
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,not the best of the series but pretty good.
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,An amazing spectacle to watch - even if I disagree with story arc (which I do).
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,The ending of this storied franchise seemed disconnected and rushed.
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,"Loved it. Critics were wrong about this one. As a 50 year old fan, it made me very happy."
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,Enjoyed it start to finish. Just sit back be entertained and over think it .
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,I think they did a wonderful job bringing the saga to a close from the original story/characters.
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,"Good plot, great cinematography, action packed..."
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,"very good ending to the series, tied in alot of back story."
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,"Did not like the way things were wrapped up,"
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,"Full of questionable plot decisions, but very entertaining nonetheless"
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,I really liked this movie.  I thought it was a good end to the Skywalker legacy.  A few surprises in the storyline.  I highly recommend.
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,I didn't hate the movie. If anything it made me hate episode 8 for being so completely useless. Had this movie been two parts it would have been a lot more enjoyable. Disney messed up by letting JJ Abrams leave after episode 7.
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,"It was good. I enjoyed it. The way the story played out was mildly predictable and was generally without suspense. However, it was enjoyable."
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,A shame to end a iconic series with such mediocrity. 
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,Not sure why there's so many people complaining. I thought it was a very adequate way to wrap up the Skywalker story!
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,Its a fun time. Just don’t think too much.
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,Great ending to a story saga.
"Jan 20, 2020",negative,I feel they squashed 3 movies in 1.
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,Solid ending to the series but not spectacular
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,Probably the best Star Wars movie of all time! Absolute must see again!
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,Enjoyed it! Thought the language was modern talk rather then Star Wars language
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,Great special effects and sound marred by a weak story and horrible writing.
"Jan 20, 2020",negative,"Cheaply earned thrills that quickly pass.  The film is basically a cynical corporate generated schlock script made with impeccable craft and a $250+ budget.  Forced, this is why it fails."
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,It is a great action movie but still just a throw back to the original 3 movies. The plot progresses with to much to fast. Try to watch it without the member berries if you can.
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,"I liked how all had Han, Princes Lea, and Luke all in the move."
"Jan 20, 2020",negative,"As a young child I was blown away by the original Star Wars movie in cinemas.  The 2 that followed were next level.  Later the prequels upped the special effects & told an overall good story.  Episode 7 was was visually good but the story a rerun of the original.  After that it was all down hill.  The Rise of Skywalker was anything but.  A magical saga ruined by mismanagement on Disney's part & a disjointed direction team with Ryan Johnson going out of his way to his own story & not follow a trilogy path.  Ultimately leaving JJ to pick up the pieces & make a silk purse from a pigs ear.  An absolute train wreck of a movie, bringing Palpatine with no explanation, & where did the resistance find a massive fleet?  Rubbish, yet it's made loads of money so Disney will serve up more of the same.  There's only one positive, Hyperspace skipping.  Just wished I'd thought of that & hyperspace skipped right out of the cinema!  Piss poor.  Thanks for ruining Star Wars, George Lucas must be spinning in his grave."
"Jan 20, 2020",negative,I was very disappointed. They try to appeal to everyone and every age. It's extremely predictable and not believable. I miss the mystique and wonder.
"Jan 20, 2020",negative,"Bad disjointed stupid script, sad ending to the long Saga"
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,This Star Wars movie was awesome. It had great action scenes and the special effects were amazing. The entire cast did an excellent job and the story was well written. It's great that everyone that worked on this film appreciates the Star Wars franchise and continues to make it better and better. I would recommend that people should see this Star Wars film but if you haven't seen the previous Star Wars films you should watch them before you see this one.
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,I likes how they brought everyone from the past movies
"Jan 20, 2020",negative,"The only thing J.J. Abrams should be allowed to write is his shopping list. This two and a half hour long trailer is an unholy mess that relies on the audience not having time to digest what just happened before moving on to the next scene. If nothing else, The Rise of Skywalker is a masterclass on how to neglect character arcs, undo previous story developments, and contrive nonsensical plot devices."
"Jan 20, 2020",negative,"Good acting. Good special effects. Good fanservice moments. But bad writing (lazy) that seems to just want to please fans  without being deep, contradicts the previous episodes of this trilogy (including 7) a mess with little imagination. A sad and even cruel end to such a beloved franchise"
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,well rounded movie that brought the entire series together to an amazing ending
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,Absolutely love how they concluded such an epic story.
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,"the writing wasn't very good, the acting could have been. the director did the actors dirty."
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,"This movie is just plain fun. A little rushed at times but definitely a worthwhile end to the greatest saga in film history. Don't rely on the bias of the critics, judge it for yourself."
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,"It was great to see Luke, Leia, Han, and Lando again, but I will never see how Adam Driver was cast as Han and Leia’s son.  Total miscast.  That being said, this final trilogy was better than Episodes 1,2 and 3, but they cannot compare to the middle (original) trilogy."
"Jan 20, 2020",negative,Walked out 75% through...... was really really boring.
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,"This movie captured the three-hero vibe of the original trilogy more than any of the others since. The Kylo Ren character arc was satisfying, as was the respectful treatment of Carrie Fisher's General Leia."
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,It was awesome!  ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,JJ did it again! Absolutely loved this!
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,"It was a nice wrap-up to the saga, while leaving some room for future films. Much better pacing than, better action than Last Jedi."
"Jan 20, 2020",negative,Boring.....Really Boring. you have seen all this before. I used a gift card....DO NOT PAY FULL PRICE FOR THIS TRAIN WRECK. matinee only or wait for streaming. Not Recommended.
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,"I enjoyed it, old star wars fans might not so much tho."
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,Really well put together actions sequences . Visual effects were amazing. I enjoyed the movie over all.
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,Lots of action. Good triumphs over evil
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,"It was certainly corny in places, but very satisfying to this baby boomer who has been a Star Wars fan from day 1!"
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,"A satisfying end to this epic Saga.  Good pacing, solid story, good humor, and great action and special effects."
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,"Kind of boring, same ole theme. Main characters are weak."
"Jan 20, 2020",negative,"For 8 movies, we’ve been lead to believe that ‘balance’ was coming to The Force. It could be argued that without any evil/Sith left as boogeymen hiding in the shadows, The Force is more unbalanced then ever. I wouldn’t say this was a bad movie, it was certainly entertaining, but asking more questions about how we got here has certainly not done Star Wars any real favors. I’d watch it again, but I wouldn’t pay to watch it again."
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,So freaking good I loved it!
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,"I loved how they chose to wrap up the Skywalker saga. They fit a lot into the movie, but it left so much for them to build on in the future outside of the Skywalker story."
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,I loved it for bringing back some of my favorite characters with an exciting story.
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,"I liked how there were throwbacks to all the episodes. It felt like closure to the current storylinea. It had a nice mix of humor and seriousness. I liked how it all played out. I would say more, but don't want to spoil it"
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,"Overall, a great ending. But I'm not sure why I was a little confused. I don't mind watching it again. That should tell you something."
"Jan 20, 2020",negative,"If all you want is an action movie, then you'll enjoy it. if you are looking for a continuation of some semblance of a story, then you'll notice an abundance of plot holes and will walk away with many of the same questions that you walk in with remaining unanswered."
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,Cheesy nostalgia but still entertaining.
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,Action packed with a great cast and characters. Exciting from start to finish. We want to see it again.
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,Tied up all the loose ends
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,amaizing amaizing amaizizing
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,Amazing story and special effects!
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,The movie was everything we expected
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,It takes a lot for my husband to go to the movies and this movie did not disappoint! Cannot wait to add this movie to my library! Enjoyed it very much and will admit I cried more than once
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,How can you not like this epic movie?? Shame on the bad reviews!!
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,Great wrap up to the series.  Like sit a lot.  Touching family stuff
"Jan 20, 2020",positive,I am not a fan of the new series and this movie did nothing to change my mind....nothing really new.... Rogue one was awesome with a compelling and unique plot.
"Jan 20, 2020",negative,A breakneck pace and a story that seems way too jumbled with many plot conveniences. Its reveals and the direction it takes does not feal earned whatsoever. Ultimately this movie's detriment is the overall lack of a unified vision in the sequel trilogy as a whole and its attempt to change the past and throw fan service in the faces of viewers.
"Jan 19, 2020",negative,"This film has so much wrong with it that there is literally dozens and dozens of youtube vidoes which go into indepth explanations about all the things wrong with this film, including that George Lucas doesn't like it, Mark Hamill doesn't like it, most of the fandom doesn't like it and that it could well spell the end of Kathleen Kennedy's run as president of Disney.

But enough about why other people don't like it, here is what I think.

I think that all a film needs to be any good is good acting, good directing, good pacing, good musical score and a plot that is both internally consistent with its previous linked films and makes sense. Well rehashing John Williams every five minutes was a mistake, as clearly the musical director was absent for the cinema cut of the film and his undrestudy just applied a random clip everytime the movie shifted to a near scene, even if the choice of music made no sense.

The acting was in the most past appaling, but I blame much of this on the terrible script, the nonsensical plot that was more patchwork than a quilt and back room editing that seemed to want to just thrust familiar faces at us at every turn.

So much of this film was unwatchable that, were it not for the fact that I had already invested close to twenty hours in the overall storyline of Skywalker from inception to its completion, that I would have walked out before the film even reached half way.

There were so many duff lines that I gave up trying not to wince when I heard one, the stormtroopers had become so ineffective that I doubt they could hit a barn wall from the inside, and Rey was so overpowered after next to no training and just glancing at a few old jedi books, that for her everything was just a series of small inconveniences to casually step over.

The film has no heart, no soul, no love interest, no moments that deftly plucked at my heart strings and if I never see it again it will be too soon."
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,This is the way you end a saga! They pulled from each storyline. I was discouraged by the Last Jedi but this movie was good.
"Jan 19, 2020",negative,"Yet again. The new concepts and ideas from Disney introduced in these new Star Wars films have ruined the entire story telling of the Star Wars Universe.

I hope they hire different writers and backtrack on some of the ridiculous implementations they put into the legacy that was built."
"Jan 19, 2020",negative,"Sad, very sad movie :("
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,Według mnie film jest godnym zakończeniem sagi skywalker bo okropnym the last jedi
"Jan 19, 2020",negative,"OMG What was that?  This felt like 6 movies compressed into one.  Within a few minutes  you deep into a rapid series of events, don't go to the bathroom as you might miss about 5 story elements. Rey is still overpowered, I never felt that she could fail nor that she needed anybody's help. The force is no longer used for combat but for healing and long distance communications (and teleporting objects, I guess).  The stormtroopers fly now (but only in one scene then never again).  Leia is there but not really aware of her surroundings (think Weekend at Bernie's).  Sorry I'm rambling but this not good at all.  86% audience approval? That seems fishy to me."
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,"It’s hard to top all that’s gone before this last of the original 9 episodes, but it held it’s own and still had a few surprises."
"Jan 19, 2020",negative,The acting was good but I think what they were given wasn't as par. If you like Star Wars you should see it to get closure but don't go in expecting A lot. They tried to thrown in as much as possible (SPOILER) when they Brought back palpitine that undercuts Vader's sacrifice in episode 6 by showing he didn't kill palpitine so when someone dies it isn't as impactful becuase hey Han Solo might live he might some how come back because palpitine did. All in all it isn't to good
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,Guess you have to be a Star Wars fan.  Descent action.  Thought the movie was too long for story line.
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,"What can I say, I just plain like the series. Wondering if this is The End or will there be a Star Wars X"
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,Sad to see this era of movies end. 😞
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,"It was ok, not great to be sure."
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,all I can say is wow. Definitely a must see.
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,"Longtime fan going back to 1977, I thought they did a good job ending the saga and filled some gaps that The Last Jedi painfully refused to fill while also alienating a lot of longtime fans with erratic political statements and a drawn-out forgettable plot. Lesson learned I hope by Disney that fans will not be happy with just anything with a Star Wars logo on it. At any rate it was a good ending and worth seeing."
"Jan 19, 2020",negative,"$275, 000,000 to make this piece of crap! What is the world coming to :("
"Jan 19, 2020",negative,garbage! it broke all law and rule of Jedi and sith ! 
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,It was everything I would expect and didn’t expect in one. Great way to end the saga.
"Jan 19, 2020",negative,"I was petrified. I have been a fan of Star Wars since I was born, and I felt just empty after the end of the movie and the trilogy. A complete collection of garbage without rhyme or reason. I wonder if they actually spent any time at all thinking about a plot or how to link it back to the previous episodes."
"Jan 19, 2020",negative,Pacing was bad. Seemed to try and fit an entire trilogy in one film. The planning for these 3 films was atrocious. They do not connect well to the skywalker saga.
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,"Meh, captures the usual Star Wars glamour but the slightly messy story makes this feel like an unsatisfying end to the Skywalker Saga. Step down from JJ's The Force Awakens, partly due to The Last Jedi"
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,Ignore the haters.  A great wrap up to the trilogy and worth seeing.
"Jan 19, 2020",negative,The end of the story is terrible and I’ll be honest I hope they will stop making Star Wars movies. Disney ruins everything with there hidden agenda stuff.
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,"Tied up loose ends, very busy, a good movie."
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,"I Enjoyed The Finished Project. Far Better Than “The Last Jedi.” If More Time Was Spent, I Am Certain J.J. Could Have Iron-Out Any Discrepancies. Under The Circumstances [Pressure Behind The Scenes, Course Correction From The Previous Films, Plus Embittered Fans] J.J. Performed Supremely Well."
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,"Great conclusion to the series. Abrams had to deal with many different constituencies and did a good balancing all of them. I do think there was enough material to split the finale into two movies, but I can understand the rationale for finishing In the manner that was chosen."
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,"Star Wars was worth the long wait. My son, daughter, and myself enjoyed every bit of the movie."
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,one of the best Star Wars of the new storyline. 
"Jan 19, 2020",negative,Was definitely a big build up to a great disappointment
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,Very entertaining.  That is why I go to the movies.  The  critics want some kind of art statement.  Go see the movie and you will be entertained.
"Jan 19, 2020",negative,when you find the pay off in this movie give me a call
"Jan 19, 2020",negative,"Stay tuned for the next star wars, where somehow the Sith will manage to make planet killing guns for each Stormtrooper, but somehow still lose. Whoever is writing the script at this point has completely given up trying."
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,A completely solid ending to the new franchise. So minor details for the more hardcore audience were left in the balance but the casual fan will definitely enjoy.
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,critics off the mark yet again....
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,"It's always great to watch a Star Wars movie, there are little adjustments that could be made, however, overall I think the movie was awesome."
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,"Best of the latest three. Largest negative is that the final 30 minutes seemed rushed, as the film attempted and succeeded in wrapping up the storyline."
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,"I've been watching the ""Skywaker Saga"" since May, 1977 when my dad took me to see the original for my 12th birthday.   Been an avid Star Wars fan ever since and I felt The Rise of Skywalker was a good ""wrap up"" to that story that left me with a positive feeling.   Looking forward to see what Disney and Lucasfilm have for us next."
"Jan 19, 2020",negative,the last jedi left such a mess it would be impossible for this thing to have been good.
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,A great ending to movies I have been watching since 1977.
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,Good ending to the Skywalker saga. Good tie in to Rise of the Resistance ride.
"Jan 19, 2020",negative,"This movie was dumb and goofy in a mostly enjoyable way. Given that the first two movies did nothing to set up a conclusion, this one had very low expectations going in. Like Force Awakens this movie was 90% nostalgia but for what that is worth it was passable. I could never really recommend this movie or trilogy for that matter to anyone unfamiliar with the original trilogy and that in and of itself is a fundamental failure. Let this be a lesson for anyone going into a PLANNED trilogy with absolutely no Plan."
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,"As a fan, I am truly grateful for this film. With a balance of nostalgia and action, I felt relieved that JJ Abraham had fixed the mistakes of The last Jedi. However I feel it failed as a stand alone film for people who are not fans of Star Wars. But this film was made for the fans- not for the critics or the people who know nothing about the deep lore. Although there are some minor errors with the film such as the pace, I believe it did justice to the saga....
May the Force Be With You Fellow Fans"
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,I enjoyed this one more than the other ones. I was very pleased that Adam Driver's character wasn't as emasculated in this film. He is an incredible actor and deserved better than the the previous scripts. It summed up thing well.
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,"The movie was overall an enjoyable experience, but if you expect anything more from it than any other action movie, prepare to be mildly disappointed. It's still the best entry in the sequel trilogy, and I would recommend it seeing it once if you're a Star Wars fan, but it's not great—just good."
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,loved that they brought all the main charters back.
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,It was fine. It’s not good it’s not bad it’s extremely forgettable but a fun two hours.
"Jan 19, 2020",negative,"Bored to death, worse Star Wars movie ever! Han Solo which is a flop in the box office is a much better movie."
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,"As a movie, great.  As the close of the saga, too many weird plot points."
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,Another Star Wars movie.....
"Jan 19, 2020",negative,"feels like a step back for the franchise. instead of following the darker path that Rian Johnson and Colin T had created and wrote, JJ tried to patch it with a Disney branded Band-aid. Very poor writing, numerous plotholes, and bland character building (Finn is nothing in this film), this is easily one of the worst Star Wars films to date. Giving it 1 1/2 due to the visual effects and John William's cool, albeit lazy, soundtrack."
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,The saga to end all sagas!!! This movie was epic!
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,"I found Star Wars: The Rise Of Skywalker to be an enjoyable final installment of the trilogy. While I agree that some elements could have been better, overall it was well worth the wait. The trilogy as a whole was a great addition to the series of movies, and I can only hope they have more in store for us in the future."
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,"This was the best of all the new generation Star Wars! It was action packed, exciting, had lots of special effects.  It was nice to see some of the original cast also! All in all excellent movie!"
"Jan 19, 2020",negative,To be honest all three were okay. I am a big Star Wars fan and I have to be frank about them...they seemed to be nothing more than a retelling of the Original Trilogy with different characters. The only one that I would give a five star is Rogue One.
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,I am convinced John Williams is master of the Jedi mind trick and has programed pavlovian responses in every Star Wars fan.
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,Loved the storyline closure involving Rey and Kylo Ren (Ben Skywalker). Did not like the kissing scene between the two.
"Jan 19, 2020",negative,"I mean, I still enjoyed it because its a star wars movie, but so many plot holes and details confuse the hell out of me."
"Jan 19, 2020",negative,"As a lifelong fan of all Star Wars content and an avid supporter of the sequel trilogy against its haters, I was very disappointed to find that I, for the first time ever, disliked a Star Wars movie. Though the directors who worked to make this movie avidly claim that they were not attempting to retcon established plot points and character arcs from this movie's predecessor, The Last Jedi, this movie wasted over half the movie doing just that. While The Last Jedi may have been divisive and controversial, attempting to correct the so-called ""damage"" it did is simply not good writing and makes for an abysmal lack of cohesiveness in a supposed trilogy. The particular point they made about the protagonist's character is also a decision I am still disappointed about as a woman who very much enjoyed The Last Jedi's point that not everyone had to have a powerful lineage to be powerful. It made me feel very much that this decision was catered to loud-voiced men who called Rey a ""Mary Sue,"" which is an inherently sexist term to use. Not to mention the sidelining of an important female character from the previous movie by giving her just over one minute of screentime--this, I can only attribute to an attempt to appease the men who expressed such hate for her character that they bullied the actress off social media no matter how much Chris Terrio blames it on the fact that Carrie Fisher died. The ending of the movie lacks proper closure for a saga and left me with more questions than answers as well as a profound sadness for what they chose to do to the Skywalker legacy. The Skywalkers' endings are overwhelmingly tragic, and have caused me to feel sorrow for their inevitable ruin even with a happy ending such as The Return of the Jedi. The choice to have Rey end on Tatooine--a planet which has only caused pain and suffering for the Skywalker family if the directors had ever bothered to watch a Star Wars movie despite their claim that it is a ""beautiful and peaceful"" planet--lacked imagination and a general understanding of any single character within these movies. This movie was not character-driven; it was driven by fan-service, cheap nostalgia, and shock value that the creators chose to move characters into like chess pieces regardless of their individual goals or motives. The only reason I give this movie more than one star is the outstanding performances by the cast--Adam Driver in particular, though even he could not make the diabolical line, ""You don't just have power. You have his power,"" sound natural--and the fact that I still love the Star Wars characters and world and the music of John Williams."
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,Answered a lot of questions. Tied up loose ends. Glad they ended Star Wars
"Jan 19, 2020",negative,Dissapointed! Disney should respect the original story
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,It was a movie... not bad but not great hope the next ones are better.
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,"The movie tied up all lose ends and gave the characters I grew loving a good end. The two houses went very quick, very entertaining!"
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,"Lives up to the hype! If you’re a Star Wars fan, you won’t be disappointed."
"Jan 19, 2020",negative,"Force awakens was like a glitter pill, no substance but pretty easy to digest. The last Jedi was a giant steaming turd... Rise of Skywalker is the glitter in that turd, sorta pretty and the best you can expect from a pile of $h1t"
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,"Much, much better than the last Jedi.  I enjoyed the movie and I thought it was the best out of this new trilogy.  That being said, I still think all of the previous six were better than any of these new three.  I still recommend seeing this movie in the theater as opposed to waiting for video."
"Jan 19, 2020",neutral,"Another collection of re-done star wars scenes, or perhaps a loose re-make of Return of the Jedi. But what else did we expect? Each movie was essentially a loose remake of the original trilogy. At the same time there some good scenes and hilarious lines, particularly the 3CPO stuff. I'm struggling to be positive so I will say that Daisy Ridley was very good! Even if I didn't care for her character. And she finally talked. All in all, I'm glad this mess is over."
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,"Lots of ""Nods & Winks"" and I thought a fun way to end a Trilogy of Movies that were uneven to say the least."
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,"Entertaining, but too fast-paced and convenient story-moments bring it down..."
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,"Not the best of the franchise, but certainly entertaining."
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,I love the Star Wars series!!!!!
"Jan 19, 2020",negative,"Absolutely nothing new was introduced in this movie. It was just an other JJ Abram's generic action movie. Don't get me wrong,  it wasn't awful, but it was terribly disappointing."
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,Awesome! Awesome movie! It’s phenomenal.
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,Felt rushed.  Barely closed the story arcs.  Title makes no sense with the conclusion.  Took characters with good arcs and made them terrible (Fin) or removed them (Rose).
"Jan 19, 2020",negative,This is one of the worst movies of all time. It was phoned-in. I wanted to leave in the first five minutes.
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,"It was a good movie, but I wish I would have waited to rent it rather than pay to see it in the theaters. I found myself trying to fight falling asleep towards the middle and end of the movie. I stood awake though thankfully so it wasnt a waste of my money. Overall I'd suggest waiting and watching it at home."
"Jan 19, 2020",negative,"Absolutely terrible! The writing is horrible with so many plot holes and unanswered questions. Bringing back Palpatine was creative laziness and took a huge dump on the original trilogy with his return. This movie also completely ignored the established ""rules"" about the force and its abilities. The only positive I can say is it's visually beautiful but that's it. So much potential squandered and the WORST possible way to end the Skywalker saga."
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,What an end to a 9 episode saga.  Fantastic and was well better than episode 8 of any of the first 3 episodes.   4-6 still are the best.
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,Ending was great. At times it dragged on in spots. Butt all in all a great movie.
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,"The Rise of Skywalker was the best way to conclude the new trilogy, completely salvaging the wreck that was The Last Jedi. For all the complaints about Palpatine and the ending and whatnot, it’s Star Wars. It’s based on an imaginary galaxy. If you’re ok with lightsabers and hyperspace and stuff, nitpicking about this movie is nothing more than whiny nonsense."
"Jan 19, 2020",negative,I honestly thought is was a mess! So many plotholes and terrible writing!
"Jan 19, 2020",negative,"Sorprendente como los ""fans"" se tragan todo la basura que les manden"
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,"The movie is made well.  The story moves slow but the endings action, although disappointing story line, makes the movie worth watching.  Palpatine was a bad choice for villain and I missed Rose, she didn’t get enough of a storyline."
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,Too many people can't handle the fact this movie was amazing for what obstacles were created from the last jedi.  I believe the heroes all got the ending they deserve. It was an emotional roller coaster for old school star wars fans and just a solid movie overall.
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,Amazing movie that was a fitting end to the series.
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,"I absolutely LOVED this epic conclusion to the Skywalker Saga, amazing acting, set pieces and story. 
This film is getting a lot of negativity for all the wrong reasons and it's quite sad to see and read but hey.... it's Star Wars.... the conclusion was always going to divide people. But, a resounding 10/10 for me. 👍👍"
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,Loved the interaction between the characters and story line. Loved the themes and a good wrap up for the 9 movies.
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,IT'S STAR WARS AT IS'T BEST!!!!
"Jan 19, 2020",negative,This movie was not good
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,Liked it.  It is the best of the new movies.  Comes closer to the quality of the Empire Strikes Back.
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,All story threads from episodes 1 to 8 were tied up. Story was consistent with previous movies. Daisy Ridley is fantastic as Rey. I liked the way lines from previous movies were worked smoothly into IX. Po finally became the force he was destined to become. I am SO READY for the fourth trilogy!
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,Long but tied a bunch of family tree stories too for me.
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,"I thought it was a good Star Wars movie. Not the best one, but far from the worst."
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,The fact that Kylo Ren died.
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,"I've never been a huge Star Wars fan- always greatly preferred Star Trek. However, I've watched all the Star Wars movies, even the particularly bad ones, and I've enjoyed most of them. 
I find this movie an enjoyable enough way to pass the time-
My only real complaint was the ending- would've been nice to watch that character gradually redeem themselves. But, oh well."
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,Much better than the last one
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,"Disappointed more then anything. So much potential for characters development that didn't really happen. Introduced new characters but movie moved so fast it seemed like they were only added to seek merchandise. Did not answer a lot of questions, caused more. However visually awesome the movie felt incomplete on story."
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,"With no expectations and emotional investment only in droids, this was a more enjoyable film than either of the first two entries in the sequel trilogy. Much of it is sloppy writing and backtracking, but nothing that offended me since I didn't like Force Awakens or Last Jedi. I laughed, I cried. It's the only movie I had fun watching."
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,Loved it great end to the sky walker saga!
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,"By the sound of reviews from “professional” critics, it was supposed to be the worst in the series. I went expecting complete disappointment.  My fears went unrealised when I went to see it. A totally entertaining and fulfilling end to a series that has had me captivated (mostly) since 1977. Another example of how critics are paid way too much for what they do...and in this case what they failed to do."
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,"This last addition of the Skywalker Trilogy was an enjoyable movie. It was a little safely written in its attempt to tie together 40+ years of Star Wars history but JJ Abrams did an admirable job in terms of character development and quality of filmmaking, and now it's time to look forward towards individual movies based on the Star Wars characters. I remember seeing the original Star Wars movie at the Ziegfeld theater in New York and it's hard to believe that over 40 years have passed in the Star Wars trilogies. A truly cultural and social phenomenon that is meant to be enjoyed by all."
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,Good action sequences.  Some of the scenes did not make a lot of sense and cameos were thrown in without purpose.
"Jan 19, 2020",negative,"A pathetic excuse of a movie. Even worse as Star Wars. 
This movie, the last (thank god) Skywalker story, was the final nail in the coffin of this disgusting trilogy.
First movie had no aim
Second one was a generally enjoyable popcorn movie that should have never been a Star Wars film
And this... It tried to be everything. This movie wanted to be a jack of all trades, and it become a joke of all aspects.
I can't understand how could the audicence here give this movie anything above 10%.
Half of the movie tried to give some depths to the story and the characters, only to take all of it away 2 scenes later.
The movie itself made no sense, to understand it, Disney published a picture book that tried to fill in the canyon like holes the story had. A BOOK. THE SAME DAY THE MOVIE AIRED. WHY?!
Everything could have been told in 10 minutes, and we all know that this movie could have used 10 minutes of peace, becose the full-time action-adventure was becoming very old real early.
After watching it, I have spent 3 hours of my life in the pub, giving a 2.5 hour long lecture on the many aspects this movie was terrible. The other 30 minutes were used to order refreshments and to use the restroom.
Nothing extra, pretty much the same that you can find on youtube, the rants on why the movie was awful. In case you care about this saga, if it was part of you childhood etc. If you don't care about stories being destroyed and it had no meaning in your life, then you migh even enjoy this show.

Will not give spoilers.
Movie is shit.
Male actors try their best.
Female actors are mediocre, not like they had any chance with the character they had to portrey.
If you like Star Wars, don watch it. If you want brainded popcron adventure, look no further, you found the perfect match for yourself.
Perfect movie for a Netflix&Chill marathon."
"Jan 19, 2020",negative,"First viewing I was relieved that it corrected The crappy Last Jedi. It’s enjoyable and more respectful of the Star Wars legacy. Having seen it a second time, however, you see it with the other two films in the trilogy. What a wasted opportunity, what a hodgepodge of arbitrary ideas. Why did Palpatine come back in this one, just silly. I think the main actors did a really good job with frankly poor material. If I was George Lucas, I would be regretting my decision to sell to Disney as they’ve done a terrible job. In terms of Luke Skywalker, they pretty much chewed the character up and spat him out! "
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,I loved it! I thought that it was an excellent movie. A very good end to the greatest saga ever.
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,Too much time spent paying homage to the original. Story hard to follow because of that.
"Jan 19, 2020",negative,"Good performances and visual effects as well as some great cameos, but the script sucked so f*cking much it is still a bad movie. The worst one in the whole saga. Disappointing."
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,wish I could see it again. can't wait for the dvd
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,A great way to wrap up the saga for the fans!!!
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,Tied everything together seeing it’s the last one. A lot of bad reviews from a few bad scenes but we still enjoyed it.
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,Not only was the movie amazing but 4D made it that much more spectacular! Every theater should have a 4D theater.
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,Took back the most interesting parts about The Last Jedi. The plot was overstuffed. No time for the major plot points the really sink in. Just too bloated. Enjoyable if you turn off your brain.
"Jan 19, 2020",negative,"A Franchise killer... 
.....Mismanaged story... 
........Mismanaged characters 
......................Mismanaged Mess."
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,Very good ending to this franchise
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,Amaizing movie ties up all or most lose ends from all the other movies and so emotional connected with true fans and new comers as well my wife whi has only seen the last two movies loved it! That tells you overall is a very well balanced movie. Great special effects and the emotions again run high in my opinion.  I wish this wasn't the last one tho.
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,"I loved it. Best film in the saga. How this has a lower rating than episodes I-III is a mystery. It's worth rewatching them all in chronological order (starting at episode I) and you'll see how great this one really is. Plus, yes, I love the kiss."
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,Just right closing story.
"Jan 19, 2020",negative,"Maybe it's just too many star wars before!  I found this one struggling to keep the story flowing, up & down, all over the place and I don't mean complicated. It seemed dragged out and lacking in spot.  If you like cinematography and special effects then go see this one, it is not lacking in that area.  After I beat this movie up and then told you of its strong points, the bottom line is that it is a strong two stars but just couldn't make it to a 2 1/2 stars!"
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,Was better than the last
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,"Its Star Wars. Im always entertained by Star Wars.  If youve seen all the rest of the movies, this one is a must see."
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,Great finish to an unforgetable series!
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,Great action packed movie
"Jan 19, 2020",negative,"Insult to logic, abomination of the very idea of Star Wars. Tries to pace itself faster than you can think, but fails even there. Babu Frik was cool, though."
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,"Good for the SW fans JJ Abrams delivered with the footage he had, to provide an enjoyable ride!"
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,Thanks be to JJ for wiping out most of Rian Johnson's crap show. I only wish he'd totally retconned a death that was completely unnecessary. But oh well....
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,"Pudo haber sido mejor si ciertas cosas de la trama hubieran sido explicadas y no sacadas de la manga, aún así el lagado de Star Wars no es manchada por está película"
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,Forgot the naysayers. It’s a great add to the Star Wars saga.
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,Excellent visual. Story line repetitive.
"Jan 19, 2020",neutral,"Ok it's a fun movie BUT... this film is a total violation of Star Wars. Apparently there are no longer any limits to what the force can do. They've turned Jedis into a mash up of the X-Men, Harry Potter, Batman, the Highlander, and freakin Sam Wheat from GHOST! Need out of a jam? Just make up some other stupid thing force users can do! Exactly when and how do they train to rapidly heal fatal wounds or send physical objects through the fabric of space and time? Maybe they discovered all that when Leia was apparently trained to be a Jedi ninja, which is about as stupid as making Jar Jar a political figure. No boundaries, you fools. The entire movie was on full throttle. Red alert from the second it starts. Oh no! We're in a horrible life or death crisis! I know! Let's use the force! Done! What now? Uh-oh, another mission critical crisis! Light speed skipping! Done! Shucks! If only we knew how to figure out this meaningless dilemma that is also life or death mission critical! I know, let's decode a stupid knife and immediately solve every single riddle as though Batman's super computer brain was right there with us! But it doesn't matter because our poor directorial decisions ultimately make that entire sub-plot meaningless! You know, they could have learned a lot from re-watching the original trilogy. And I do mean the ORIGINALS not the remakes. They were balanced, like the force they let grow wildly out of control as though they wanted Rey to become Galactus. There is just plain TOO MUCH in these new ones, and especially this last one which I do hope is indeed the last. There's no comedy left. Remember Han's witty charm? Not a drop of that made it this far. But they did manage to straight up steal the big reveal from Empire Strikes Back, which only compounded the idiocy more. They even zapped Return of the Jedi for that whole saving you through compassion thing. All the while removing all relief, be it comedy or just down time to show these characters actually live like normal people from time to time. It's a tragic joke what they have reduced Star Wars to. And you know it wasn't for anything as noble as the story. Nope, this was just to cash in before the original cast dies off. But in many ways, it might have been better off if the original cast didn't live long enough to see what became of their work in one of the greatest legends told, in all its simplicity and complexity, now reduced to a bad take on abracadabra and the general notion that bigger is better. Now... it should by all rights get absolutely zero stars, but it gets 2.5 stars entirely for this reason, so mild spoiler alert. There is one line in the movie that resonates, even though I doubt anyone got it. The fleet at the end is not a military. It is just people. Not too far off the ideas behind Rogue One, this was a good decision, and damn near the only one in the film. That line is respectable even though they did nothing with it. The other thing they get props for is the movie ends in the same exact way the original Star Wars begins (before it was idiotically re-titled episode 4). Full circle. Life is a cycle. This was a cycle... hopefully never to be re-cycled, but let's not go back into that. So there. Yeah it's not much to boost from none to half, but remember that even through all my bickering it's not like the movie isn't fun. It's well done, well acted, looks great. Just the story is so unbelievably stupid and the decisions they made on just how far the force can reach are preposterous and insulting to all who lived in an era where we got to see the originals on the big screen. Whatever circus this thing is, it is not what Star Wars was to all of us back in the day. We all tried to concentrate and lift rocks after seeing Empire, right? Back then, that was the force. Spirituality and minorly moving objects around. Now, the only thing we should be trying to do is use the force to move back in time and stop this nightmare from ever being made because apparently all we need to do to fix any problem is use the force in some new and totally made up way. Cool, done, right? Unfortunately, probably not."
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,"It was time to put an end to this series. Story had a bunch of holes, cliches, and felt a bit rushed."
"Jan 19, 2020",negative,"I didnt like it at all. It could have been good, but it's not :("
"Jan 19, 2020",negative,Everything was rushed. Story overall made no sense. I don't care that this tried to clean up previous issues. Was a missed opportunity for a movie.
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,I wanted to like it more than I did. I kept wanting to feel emotionally impacted by what was happening but I never did. I did not care for The Last Jedi when I first watched it but now I absolutely love it. I’m hoping I will feel the same about this one.
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,"Honestly, I have no idea how Rise of Skywalker has gotten such poor reviews. Unlike the second movie in this trilogy it did not feel like I was dragging on. Every bit of this movie, every scene, help importance to the plot. It was absolutely beautifully done, the battle scenes were amazing to watch. I was surprised for such a long movie it was over seemingly so quickly. It has been a week since I have watched it and I am still thinking about how enjoyable it was."
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,Great story line and special effects.
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,"It was very good! I always kept an eye on the movie, the new character is a dream, see the incredible special effects so they always stand out, very well done. In short, I loved the whole movie super fan of the Star Wars saga."
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,"great message, excellent end."
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,First parts of the movie were a little slow and confusing. Last half picked up and definitely tied the whole story together. Overall an entertaining movie though.
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,This is the only good Star Wars movie
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,It was just okay the story was predictable
"Jan 19, 2020",negative,That was the worst of any Star Wars movie I have seen. Don't waste your money and find somewhere to watch it for free.
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,no fue la mejor pelicula demasiada cosas que no se veian bien
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,Very entertaining the movie was well done it used a lot of plays on the original scenes.
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,it wasn't the best in the star wars franchise but it was a solid ending
"Jan 19, 2020",negative,The story line was weak and it seemed to drag.  The attempts at comedy missed the mark unlike in the previous movies.  This movie was a disappointment overall.
"Jan 19, 2020",negative,"This episode defies everything that made Star Wars great. 
It simply made the whole saga that precedes it pointless."
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,It was better story line than The Last jedi
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,"The story line was underwhelming. Too many characters weren’t developed further. It was entertaining but somewhat of a disappointment. Still, an enjoyable way to spend a rainy afternoon."
"Jan 19, 2020",negative,The special effects are the only thing that kept me from walking out of the theatre to do something more entertaining. Don't waste your money.
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,"Very good, lots of activity and surprises!!!"
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,The move was one of the best out of the last two. I have recommended this already to many of my friends.
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,Easily the best Star Wars movie ever made. You need to watch this now! There was no point in the film where I was bored; unlike every other Star Wars movie.
"Jan 19, 2020",negative,"Completely undermines the developments previous Star Wars films made, especially the sacrifices Darth Vader makes to end Palpatine. Blatantly violates rules made clear in the lore, complete lack of screenwriting proficiency, poor humor to an extent that I personally did not hear one single laugh from the entire audience.

Failed fanservice, broken writing, poor pacing overshadowing the well-made, expertly crafted effects/CGI to a point that the film should be redacted from canon."
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,"Action scenes were good.  Plot line was pedantic with too many undeveloped subplots,  The Rey/Ben love theme was not believable, like a tiger changing his stripes. Tried to tie up all loose ends and put a bow on it.  Not a bad movie/story, but not the depth and magnitude of the early films."
"Jan 19, 2020",neutral,It comes and goes it dosent have a vibe attached to it it is unfortunately mediocre and un extravagant however the acting is great and of course its a beautiful looking movie.
"Jan 19, 2020",neutral,"Very strange movie, i've only seen it once but that should be enough. It had a good start but became boring and quite ridiculous for a while. Way to much fan service to the force awakens fans, Palpatine alive is one stupid story idea, the end was unsatisfactory, Rey had no real loss again..Ben dying was meh, if he's good now why not keep him alive? Ruined the franchise again in many ways. Only thing good about it was fixing stuff from TLJ but even that was too much for a 2 hour movie lol. Should of planned the trilogy before TFA with GL as the story boarder you pinheads. Good one."
"Jan 19, 2020",negative,"Well it's over, finally! On behalf of the man babies, thanks Ryan for bringing us to this point. What a mess for JJ to inherit - essentially, he had to restart the story in order to finish it. There was no passing of the baton because as soon as Ryan got it, he ran from the stadium. The movie is fast paced - to the point of silliness at some points - as JJ has a lot to do in a very short time. 
But just as The Force Awakens was a reboot, so too is The Rise of Skywalker ... such a disappointment in this regard. Then there was the return of 'Palpy' and the quest to find him Indiana Jones style, but at breakneck speed. With entirely forgettable characters, doing their bit for galactic equality with the smooch at the end. I found the whole hidden (underwater) fleet of Star Destroyers sporting an over-sized planet killing dingus slung beneath entirely unbelievable ... but to respect your inner child, endure it you must. There's one final consolation in all of this; Bad Lip Reading will eventually make it memorable & watchable ... in another form far, far away. I'm just overwhelmed with a feeling of pointlessness."
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,"After hearing about the negative reviews of the movie, I thought for sure I wouldn't like it. But after seeing the movie, I was blown away and I was extremely emotional and now I think it's one of the BEST Star Wars movies of ALL! It's one of the best next to The Mandalorian TV series."
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,Best one of the recent trilogy and a great sendoff for the episodes as a whole!
"Jan 19, 2020",negative,"After watching this movie, I felt like an idiot for having liked Star Wars i the first place."
"Jan 19, 2020",negative,"It is a complete mess,  it sucks"
"Jan 19, 2020",negative,I'll say this it was the best piece of crap out of all of them.
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,"There is something for everyone in this. I almost want to give this a four or four and half stars but it also merits five. 
You will experience desperation, hope, unrequited love, loss, love, excitement, distress, mourning, grief, bereavement, climax and joy."
"Jan 19, 2020",negative,40-50 plot holes. just a pastiche  of epic visuals thrown together.  The ‘story' makes no sense. No sense of gravitas and the character's were utterly bland as per usual. I wish I could erase it from my memory.
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,"Spolier alert... I will give up several things in the movie... read on at yoru own discretion. This movie was the type of movie I really needed to see twice (so I saw it four times to be sure). After the first viewing, I left a little disappointed, no miffed is a btter word, and that was more a result of my expectations. What I thought I should be seeing. I saw it 2 days later and was a complete turnaround. I had to ignore 3 areas of the film that I was disappointed in (ok, really just 2 major issues I have). Spoiler alert... stop reading if you do not want to know. So light speed skipping? Impossible. Light speed isn't like dusting crops boy. Then the ship in the middle of the desert? Has not been scavenged, stolen or anything... doesn't add up. Lastly, docking and only a few stormtroopers in the bay to get past. Did not seem very realistic to me... but I suppose it is possible. In A New Hope,  they all were able to get off the Falcon and I never really put that under a microscope. So I can let everything else slide in the promotion of an open mind. I found the movie was great after they reached Kijimi. So maybe a slow start, but really awesome afterwards. I do feel they packed too much into one movie... some background in other areas would have been cool (Knights of Ren, Emporer's path, the Dyad I didn't even notice was mentioned until the 3rd screening, etc etc). Should have been a tetrology if you ask me... break the rules LucasFilms!! I subtract half a star for lack of focus on the entire picture to the audience. I needed to find out more and then view again to really get it. So seeing a few times really improved my enjoyment. But all in all, I loved it... it's a movie, and it was entertaining all the way through, even if I found some of the early scenes that I did not like as much."
"Jan 19, 2020",negative,Honestly a 2 year old could write a better plot with these characters.
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,I enjoyed it. JJ did a lot to repair Rian's massively flawed movie and gave us back most of our Star Wars again. It was very fun and I left with a smile.
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,Very suspenseful with a bittersweet and shocking ending.
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,"A wonderful conclusion to this Star Wars trilogy and nice recovery from the hiccup that the second film was. RotS had plenty of action, beautiful sets, and tied the stories of most of favorite characters to a satisfying closure. I truly appreciated this film as a lifelong Star Wars fan!"
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,was entertaining and had alot of action.  I was personally upset how the ending was.
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,Thr movie was perfect in everyway possible
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,"I feel like this movie was a solid ending to this saga. At pointe a bit of over dramatization, but I came away likening it. I feel like it kept the same flow from the first 2. Enjoyed the battle scenes and plot. Would love to see again in the theaters"
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,Rise of the sky Walker is a good overall movie but I feel like the main villain was killed too easily and it could’ve been better
"Jan 19, 2020",neutral,Crammed too much together. I know there’s no way to please everyone but seems like Disney tried too hard.
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,"While TROS is better than TLJ and did find it enjoyable I am afraid that the whole trilogy was one massive missed opportunity.One movie cannot fix a entire trilogy and while TROS is better than TLJ and does try to fix the problems from the previous film it does fall flat in some areas. There were scenes I wished would happen
in this movie and they didn't happen and also due to the fractured trilogy TROS had to fix the mess in such a short amount of time that in reality it should of continued into another movie. Besides the criticisms I have I also did enjoy it and there was one scene in particular that gives the middle finger to a certain widely disliked part of TLJ, but overall TROS is the better movie out of a bad trilogy and even though it's not the best Star Wars movie it is enjoyable to watch."
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,"it aight. incosistent and the overall arching narrative was all over the place. but whatever, the fight scenes were cool. adam driver carried this movie."
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,"Great movie. You want Star Wars, they give it to you. Fun ride with great visuals and great cast. But once again, the audience LOVES a movie with a woman lead that, and gee, the mostly male critics hate it. Wonder how that happened? Lame. I give the movie 5 stars and the critics one star."
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,"Was a good movie, especially compared the last few newer ones that JJ produced. Hard to believe it’s over though, kind of sad too. But it was a good ending to an amazing series of movies and shows."
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,"Despite some sketchy plot points and a rather heavy-handed series of apparitions of the dearly departed, I found it a very satisfying final film for the franchise. I really enjoyed it and was repeatedly moved. Also thought visually it was quite beautiful. Lots of great character development and I liked the depth to the emotional story telling and basic arcs of the primary characters. Emotionally, I think the deepest of all the films. Also loved the inclusion of a more diverse set of characters; it's about time."
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,This the best Star Wars movies since the original star wars movies if you like the original star Wars movies then you like this movie the movie was so good i think that they really nailed the story and it was worth the money. 
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,"Loved the action scenes, but I didn't care for the story line. Too many unanswered questions."
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,I liked the constant action.  I liked that a main evil character changed.  I liked that several of the original characters appeared & gave the saga finality hence the RISE of SKYWALKER.
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,a little rush but still very good
"Jan 19, 2020",negative,"It was an entertaining movie, but the Star Wars feel is completely gone"
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,"the end has come. I enjoyed it, some things though left me wondering"
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,it was a good movie they left alot things unanswered tho from the previous film and the new one like how did palpatine survive?
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,I have been with this series from the beginning. It’s about Hope and doing something extraordinary Witt your life. It’s about friends and family. I loved this movie! To the people out there who hate it....you have forgotten what Star Wars is about.
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,I cried a few times! 🤣
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,Fir the last series in the Star Wars saga it was OK.  Brought in a lot of things that you did not know before.  The ending was kind of OK.  A little disappointed.
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,I love Star Wars and this one did not disappoint
"Jan 19, 2020",negative,The whole 789 saga is a joke.
"Jan 19, 2020",negative,"It was as good as it could be considering the aftermath of The Last Jedi. Which also sucked. Rian Johnson singlehandedly ruined the entire sequel trilogy, & even Star Wars itself. & the biggest reason for it was killing Snoke. Who's going to be a threat to the heroes then? Rey's beat Kylo Ren every time. ""Well, I guess we can bring Palpetine back from the dead."" ""BRILLIANT!! But wait, how would that work? I mean he fell an incredibly far drop & then exploded. Then the space station exploded. How could he be alive."" ""Well we can say, ""The Dark Side of the Force is the pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural."" "" ""Great, but what does that mean?"" ""It means get all the way off my back about it & never bring it up again.""

BTW, Rotten Tomatoes has frozen the Audience score. It's been frozen steady at 86% since the first week it opened. Cheap shit to keep people interested in the movie. It won't work."
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,Much better than I thought it would be. 100 % better than The Last Jedi (which I hate).
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,Definitely wrapped things up. If you loved the whole star wars saga you'll love this.
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,Awesome Ending to the trilogy!
"Jan 19, 2020",negative,"Disney clearly does not understand Star Wars. It's not a terrible movie, as a single movie, but it's a crime against nature as a Star Wars movie."
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,The only thing I wish could be different is how many stories got tied up in a nice bow. I really enjoyed the movie.
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,I loved when Rey stood up to Emperor Palpatine.
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,Story line was great! Nothing bad to say about it. Great story!  Emporer was creepy with no eyes.
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,The movie wraps everything you know and love about Star Wars into one final masterpiece.
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,Great finish to an amazing trilogy!
"Jan 19, 2020",negative,"Not infuriating like the last movie, but still misses the mark. Too many new Force tricks, some of which don't make sense."
"Jan 19, 2020",negative,It was absolutely especially seeing the cut stuff and the whole shoe horn redemption talk about a bland movie trying to be serious honestly the space battle well little bits of it and the fight on top of the star destroyer was cool
"Jan 19, 2020",negative,"episodio 9 não se esforça em ter historia, apenas imitar tudo que os outros filmes fizeram (ou tirar o significado de tudo que foi feito antes), ao inves de evoluir como o episodio 8. porém seus efeitos especiais conseguem chamar atenção, mesmo não tendo significado. nota 4/10"
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,It was a good conclusion to the Skywalker saga.
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,"Critics be d***ed, this movie is fun and heartfelt."
"Jan 19, 2020",negative,"i love Star wars has a kid but the last 3 movies i hate them. 
i have no idea what they where think with the 3 movies."
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,Ive been a fan since 1977 and I hope the franchise stays alive forever.
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,"I felt like this movie encompasses more of what the star wars universe is about. Truly enjoyed. Hated the strobe effect, but it was still cool looking."
"Jan 19, 2020",negative,"other than the fact that Finn didn't have to mourn Poe or Rey, that was an utter crapfest"
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,"As a Star Wars fan over many, many, many years and a reader of E.U. and new cannon books/comics, I absolutely loved this film. It suffers from the same weaknesses as any of the other films in the franchise, but it is Star Wars through and through."
"Jan 19, 2020",negative,Terrible end to the Skywalker saga. Disney's new characters are one dimensional and boring. The best part of the movie was that everyone in the theater was rooting for Palpatine to win. Very funny actually.
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,Great wrap up for the franchise!
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,It was epic! Was happy to see everyone again😱
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,Awesome movie! Best ending .
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,I thought it was a very good ending to the movies. Was lots of action which was to be expected and I just felt it was a great way to end the legacy.
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,"I felt as though it could have been better, but it's still great!"
"Jan 19, 2020",negative,"Should have been edited to be *much* tighter. It was very 'Disneyfied' - the 'droid smith was way too cutesy, any edges to the film were ground down smooth. We all knew the formula and how it would all turn out, so any and all slop should have been removed for a more satisfying experience."
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,"May have been the last Star Wars, but it is far far from over in that galaxy long ago and far far away.        Well done."
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,a perfect conclution to my childhood!! Skywalker's for life.
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,Loved it as a Star Wars fan my entire life. It was excellent and a great way to end the original saga.
"Jan 19, 2020",negative,"It was just as bad as I heard it was going to be. To be fair there were a few scenes that were nostalgic and reminded me it was a Star Wars movie. However, WAY too little too late. So let's hope this End Disney Star Wars mess. We can all hope that maybe we might get some REAL Star Wars in the future if it ever gets out of Disney's hands."
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,A solid ending to the Skywalker saga. Lots of action. Lots of surprises. Well worth it!
"Jan 19, 2020",negative,"This movie made the previous two retroactively worse, which is an impressively bad accomplishment. At least there's the Mandalorian."
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,Loved the story line. It was reminiscent of Return of the Jedi in some parts. A wonderful ending to the story
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,Great ending to great Saga
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,"Excellent movie like it, my son enjoy it a lot"
"Jan 19, 2020",negative,"I'm sorry that I have to give this movie a 2 star but the only thing that satisfied me the most is the CGI and the amount of editing and that is probably it. The directors could've worked better on the movie by adding more character development and not rushing the movie as the scenes keep switching which is making no sense. I would probably like it if you took more time in making the movie and wait longer for it than watch this rushed, unsatisfying star wars movie. The fact that this movie has more bad reviews than the Phantom Menace should back up my answer. Most of the people when I was at the cinema, hated the ending the most. I could hear how at least 3/4 Of the people said that they didn't like how Rey called herself a Skywalker and how Ben Solo wasn't added at the end scene. I understand that it is Rey's decision to choose who she really wants to be, but the fact that she doesn't link to them is really bugging the audience that I've been with at the cinema. I personally didn't like the ending too as I felt lost and confused by what was going on and why did they have to end it here, like that, with such bad quality of work. Even the art concept looked better than the actual movie as it seemed there would've been more character development, seeing one of the art concepts with Rey in a dark cloak standing next to Kylo ten who is sitting on his throne. It also seemed more action based and more drama than the original movie.

I don't want to keep this comment too long so I'll end it here with other people explaining the further or missed details that I may have not said. My original answer is that they could've and they had a chance to make it better. I wouldn't waste my time watching this movie especially looking for it in the theatre's as around 1,200 theatres were closed due to bad reviews.
Have a good day."
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,Liked the story and of course cinematography along with the original music score! Great acting! Impressive!
"Jan 19, 2020",negative,Thank you Disney and JJ Abrams for ruining my childhood heroes. You turned this franchise into a joke. Stick to Star Trek JJ and maybe Poe could star in a Dune sequel running spice!
"Jan 19, 2020",negative,The people making these movies know nothing about Star Wars. Idiots!!!!!
"Jan 19, 2020",negative,"Disappointing ending to the Star Wars series. Filled with plot holes and undeveloped ideas, very cheesy and cringe worthy at many points in the film, too much action without a break, etc. Watch if your a Star Wars fan but do not expect anything great from this film."
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,"Ok. I liked this movie. That does not mean I thought it was perfect. I did. mainly because I liked the way the Rey and Kylo/Ben story was done. i became intrueged with Kylo...his intensity and duality, his sadness and anger in lonely isolation except when in the force dyad. I saw the road of destruction caused by a misleading a powerful youth. I liked Rey's development through it all, her growth in strength, defiance and power when trying to navigate a confusing mental dance with her friends as well as a menacing enemy with whom she has an irresistible and intense connection, vasalating between fear and disdain, attraction and hate. I liked the nods to nostalgia, seeing Leah and Luke and Han again, the references to previous characters and places were oh so satisfying as fan homage. Growing up with star wars as a child and looking at the prequels and sequels has been a fun ride we knew would end. I left the theater sad for the loss of major characters but also the end of an era. That said, there were lots of plot holes and unanswered questions and unnecessary side stories. Too many minor characters without time to develop, they tried to shove too much into this film. The very ending was a contrivance for me. I wanted more Reylo, more explanations and more backstory, but that is a hard ask in a movie already bursting with exposition. And palpatine out of nowhere? We needed two more movies but they did not want to buck the trend of a trilogy of trilogies. either that or suck it up and make the movie longer."
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,It was what it was supposed to be
"Jan 19, 2020",negative,"Other than one or two moments, the rest is a rehash of the old Star Wars."
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,Great movie!!  The critics are haters!!  I love Rey and Finn and think it ended exactly like it should have.
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,"if you love Star Wars, you must see."
"Jan 19, 2020",negative,"Hoo boy that sucked. The writers had every opportunity to redeem the trilogy and tossed each one to the wind! I get it. Rey is omnipotent. Couldn't they just have conveyed that in a single movie? I'd say thanks for the fan service, but obviously it's just for Disney to gloat and say ""look what I'm ruining"""
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,Love the movie. Had a lot of heart.  People need to get over their obsession with their fan fiction and just enjoy a movie.
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,"Loved it, also great to see Carrie Fisher😭"
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,Even though this movie wasn't perfect (by a long shot) it was still enjoyable to watch and a must see in my book. Adam driver's performance was legendary.
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,"The movie was great. I liked the story line and it brought it all together,  but I thought Ren and Noah were going to survive through it all. But the sacrifice one has to make for the good of the whole."
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,I love the relationships between characters. great movie.
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,People may complain about parts of the movie but all in all it was a fantastic movie experience and definitely made up for the sour taste The Last Jedi left. I was happy and content with how the movie turned out and rather enjoyed the ending although i heard some people didnt. If you're a fan of star wars I'll bet you'll atleast enjoy the experience this movie offers.
"Jan 19, 2020",negative,"Terrible. Not just the worst Star Wars film, but a down-right horrible film experience. From the script to the editing, to the inconsequential plot lines that were just made up and stuck together.
It was like a nightmare. It was a chore to watch.
My first thought once it was over was ""Thank God I didn't buy popcorn"""
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,palpatine? really? this is like having the bigger death star in ep7
"Jan 19, 2020",negative,did not like the reboot...
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,It was a fun roller coaster ride of a movie that left me buzzing at the end.
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,"Not to bad, hopefully they will leave it alone."
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,Good end to the story.
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,"Star Wars will forever be a complicated series, this just adds to it. I love all of the movies. "
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,Great like Star Wars movies always are!
"Jan 19, 2020",positive,"Did not see the big reveal coming, totally blown away.. Action packed"
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,Die hard Star Wars fan who doesn't get joy from bagging new movies or Disney. Get over it people.
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,"TROS is a good movie, but it has a ton of problems behind it, But 100 times more memorable then The Last Jedi"
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,Disappointing ending.
"Jan 18, 2020",neutral,Too muddied and lacked vision. Just felt like the mediocre ending to a mediocre trilogy based on the three most important movies in my life growing up. It had a few moments of promise overshadowed by hours of brutal averageness. Most of all it squandered the potential of great characters doing heroic final acts for contrived and forcedly rehashed tropes and motivations of newly introduced characters.
"Jan 18, 2020",negative,"This movie is so bad I don't even know what to start! Actually I do, WHAT WAS THAT KISS?"
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,Hey - I loved it!!! Star Wars is ALWAYS awesome!!! 
"Jan 18, 2020",negative,A mess of a movie to end a mess of a trilogy. It's a damn shame.
"Jan 18, 2020",negative,I'm just glad it's over. Hopefully everyone will just forget about this embarrassment of a trilogy
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,Star Wars delivers again ... any real Star Wars fan will like the movie.
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,"If you’re a Star Wars follower since the 70’s you’ll want to see the wrap up, again, that ties it “all” together. Sort of but mostly. Not a great movie but very enjoyable."
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,nice setup for the continuation of the story. good but could have been great
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,Must see for Star Wars.
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,Seems like GOT season 8 and Avengers: Endgame writers traded notes with TROS writers
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,"Loved it , great action too bad it’s the last one I could keep going with all the movies . Great tribute on the way there ended Princess Leigh"
"Jan 18, 2020",negative,"I guess I’m not a fan, I was bored.  Chase fight chase fight chase yawn"
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,JJ did the franchise justing Driver and Ridley pit on a great performance compared to the last two episodes.  Ending could could of been a bit more exciting but all in all i believe it was a success.
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,The ending was as it should be.
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,a little bit cheesey at times... some things I don't really like in terms of Papaltine stuff but it is what it is.  I wish they would have gone in some different directions. that being said it was better than the last Jedi
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,"Great story telling. Finally a good Star Wars movie! D-O said it best, “Happy.”"
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,"Is it a fun movie? Yes
Does it destroy the lore to an irredeemable state. Yes
If you ignore that Disney has killed the Star Wars canon this is a fun movie. Just pretend Dinsey Wars is a different timeline and destroyed the OT and the Prequels."
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,Awesome! It was a perfect way to end this trilogy. Full of suspense and action from start to finish. Connects all the movies together.
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,"The movie was entertaining and the CGI was on point. However,  the story was lacking in many ways and felt unnecessarily convoluted."
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,Spectacular!!! Loved every minute!!!🤩🤩🤩
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,Entertaining but nothing new here!
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,I loved it! It was very entertaining!
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,Visuals were good. Story can always be better but that’s what the books are for.
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,Great film for the family
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,"While it's not as good as the originals, i enjoyed it more than the last jedi."
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,Best movie in the series
"Jan 18, 2020",negative,They were so worried about walking back everything wrong with the last movie that they still didn't work out a compelling story with characters that I have any reason to care about.
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,My personal favorite!
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,great ending to a great saga!
"Jan 18, 2020",negative,"Terrible pacing, nonsensical plot, zero emotional depth, and the most disappointing and anticlimactic end to a movie I have ever seen.  Nothing is ever actually explained and everything moves so quickly the characters (much less the audience) have no time to even react.  The action is nonstop yet nothing ever actually feels like it matters.  Once it was over, all I could think was, ""what was the point?""  The legacy of the Skywalker family is destroyed and ends in tragedy.  Every character (and actor) deserved better.  The only good part of this movie (and the best part of the whole trilogy) was Adam Driver's portrayal of Kylo Ren/Ben Solo, and his dynamic with Rey.  Daisy Ridley also did a good job with what she was given, but Rey was never allowed to have any real flaws which made her less interesting as a character.  This movie had so much potential and they squandered it."
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,Don’t know why people don’t like this movie. It was seriously so fun and happy and exciting! I loved it.
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,Love everything about this movie.
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,"Considering the disaster the movie before this was, they did a great job wrapping it up. Is it predictable? Yeah a bit. But for a third part in a series it did a great job of tying it together. There were no annoying useless plots like in the Last Jedi."
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,"Great movie, a good ending"
"Jan 18, 2020",negative,Very disappointing ending to a franchise that meant so much.
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,Excellent is all that can be said about this version.
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,Felt lazily written.
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,they tied the story ends together nicely but left room for sequels
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,Not perfect but brought back Palpatine which was amazing!
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,"I loved it. Star Wars fans are the absolute worst. The single most toxic fanbase there is. I really enjoyed the Rise, and the entire sequel trilogy for that matter."
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,"Action packed, surprise ending"
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,I thought it was better than the last Jedi. I don't know if Disney is going to be able to come back from that. I don't think Star Wars will never be the same for me.
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,Loved it. Although I got a migraine afterwards. Would see it agin
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,"It was good not great! The vision that Lucas brought to the original trilogy is absent, and I think the biggest problem is that Disney rushed these episodes out instead of taking their time and following Lucas's model of waiting three years between each episode. This would have given writers more time and helped build the anticipation of fans."
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,Great end to Star Wars
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,"Storyline was great, I was able to follow along. You don’t have to be a Star Wars junkie to understand what was going on."
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,Good movie but it feels like a remake of The Last Jedi. Good turns evil to the good side. The ending was fantastic putting them to rest. It ties all 9 movies together. 
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,"Absolutely loved it!!!  If you enjoy fun cinema, all things Star Wars, and don't feel the need to nit pick everything in life, then this is a fantastic film!"
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,"JJ tried really hard to overcome the last movie,  but The Last Jedi really messed things up.  All in all, not a bad movie but to close out the Skywalker saga, it could have been better"
"Jan 18, 2020",negative,"Just when you thought it couldn't get worse, it did."
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,Solid movie.  Nice appearances by the original cast members.
"Jan 18, 2020",neutral,Meh. Fell asleep. 1-3 were the best Star Wars films IMHO. Nothing new to enjoy in this movie. Didn't like 7-9. Missing Natalie Portman and Sam Jack to anchor the cast.
"Jan 18, 2020",negative,That is a great way to ruin a series.
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,Es una película fresca que no da un gran cierre a la fanquicia pero muy útil. Simplemente maravillosa.
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,"Typical, just to past time."
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,Loved every part of the final SW film!
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,"Could have been amazing. Everytime we hit a plot point of interest the story changed. So many lose threads I felt like it was a pilot for 5 different Disney+ tv shows. 
Adam Driver was amazing but needed more screen time. As the main plot seemed rushed and sprinkled throughout the movie."
"Jan 18, 2020",negative,Makes the best out of the bad set up from the previous two films.. but its still an awful movie. Good action but characters are unlikable and apart from Kylo I didnt care what happened to any of them.
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,Overall fantastic. Second favorite in the franchise (nothing can beats episode 3). Palpatine is the greatest villain of all time.
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,"Simply awesome and best of the new trilogy, especially in 3D"
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,Good movie! A solid ending.
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,They played it so safe in all the frustrating Disney ways. And literal space fighting defies any logic. That said it has all the elements that make Star Wars uniquely nostalgic and fun. And that the hero this time around is a girl feels like awesome progress. 
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,Loved it ending in a positive way. Much better than episode 8!
"Jan 18, 2020",negative,"absolute horrible piece of trash, not worth spending the money on. wait for it to be streamed."
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,Loved every minute of it. Rey did another amazing job as did all the other characters. Amazing how they worked old footage of Carrie Fischer into the movie. Sorry to see the end of these characters in the Saga.
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,Excellent end to the series 
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,"I can't believe ANYONE would give this less than 5 stars!!! If they did, then they didn't like the original Star Wars movie, and anyone who didn't like that...well. I've been waiting, through all of the sequels and prequels, for a movie that lived up to the original Star Wars movie, which I saw live in the theater when it first came out. People stood up and cheered at the end of the movie, it was that good. I had never seen an audience do that before. This movie captured all of the spirit of the first one, and was almost, almost, as good - I loved every minute of it and it gave me hope that the future movies would come back to this high level of quality and leave you feeling like you wanted to jump up and cheer. It also had all of the quintessential SW moments and quips, one liners, etc. that you expect and have come to love in SW films. The audience in this new movie cheered and hollered and I was one of them. It was fantastic! The critics who didn't like it - my guess is they only like dark films with depressing sad endings, as many critics do. If you're looking for a great film with edge-of-your-seat action, honor, heroes, and hope (and who couldn't use some of that now), this is your movie! Absolutely loved it, bravo."
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,Constant edge of your seat thrilling action.
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,Great experience 👍🏼
"Jan 18, 2020",negative,What a mess! Jedi can all of a sudden bring people back to life? Wtf!
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,"Best we can hope for with the dumpster fire that was Last Jedi, and the complete remake that was Force Awakens. JJ only had one movie to answer the questions he set up since Rian Johnson decided he wanted to make a solo movie and he did the best he could. The moments with Leia were rough to watch due to the CGI and the no explanation of ol'Palps was hard to swallow. Overall entertaining."
"Jan 18, 2020",negative,A silly spectacle full plot holes with excellent visuals. Great for people who don't know or care about Star Wars and an absolute disgrace for serious fans of Star Wars.
"Jan 18, 2020",negative,Dumb end to a dumb trilogy
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,Great story. Lots of action. Nostalgic moments reminiscent of first movie.
"Jan 18, 2020",negative,"Felt more like a Star Wars movie than the last, but they tried SO HARD to go in an unexpected direction that they ignored the nature flow that should have been the last two movies."
"Jan 18, 2020",negative,"It's better than TLJ, but that's not saying much. The first act of this movie struggles with plot exposition, as it force fills hole in the plot created by the previous movie. The return of [spoiler] felt like a cheap cash grab. It's clear this Disney is using nostalgia to sell tickets.

With the George Lucas version of the ending, this was salvagable. However, the ending we go was unsatisfying for everyone - fans of all of the trilogies will mostly agree. It manages to end the Skywalker bloodline, take away any meaning to Anakin's story arc, and provide an unsatisfying end to the new trilogy."
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,I liked the movie.  Much better than the prequels...  Probably middle of the pack in the skywalker saga.
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,Nice close to the trilogy
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,"Best movie in the sequel trilogy. Checks every box for me. Though, the main box for me was having Anakin play an important part in the movie since the saga films are supposed to be his story, and they halfassedly check that box by only having him (SPOILER ALERT) ""appear"" as a disembodied voice. They technically checked that box, but there is an emphasis on ""technically"". Other than that, great movie."
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,"I’m a Star Wars fan& I liked this movie so much I saw it twice! Great story & looks great on the big screen. Not to mention the music, which is also great!"
"Jan 18, 2020",negative,Very Below average.... IMHO I am a Star Wars fan 
"Jan 18, 2020",negative,Such a waste of such a great opportunity.
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,Awesome! Love it! The ending is unexpected!
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,Best episode of the new trilogy
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,Far better than expected.
"Jan 18, 2020",negative,"These three movies had potential for being good. Somewhere under the terrible writing and non engaging screenplay, there was gold that could have happened... but it didn't, and this movie sucked. It did have one or two funny jokes in it I guess."
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,What an ending. And yet they still left me wanting g another story.
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,"Better than what I expected, better than the previous one. I laughed, I was not thinking too hard abut the story, and I have enjoyed it."
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,"liked the first one better,  but was ok ."
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,It was very good for what it was up against
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,finished on a strong note !
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,"Im a fanatic and I LOVED this ending. The whole thing. Start to the Rise of Skywalker! Saw it twice, once IMAX 3D and once plain 3D, which is of the best quality Ive ever seen.

The movie is thrilling, complete, easy to follow, and ties all nine episodes up beautifully. It leaves plenty of room for rogue future movies without leaving you feeling things were left out in the three trilogies. 

The acting was terrific, best of all 9. General Organa / Princess Leia / Carrie Fisher masterfully lives, adding what probably wouldnt have been less storyline than originally planned. There were maybe just a couple of odd artificial forced scenes that were dupes from earlier episodes - too short to detract. And Im pretty sure the catch in her comrades voices when they addressed her were real, for obvious reasons. 

Maybe best of all for me, whose friends and family are not SW buffs, this is fully enjoyable as a stand-alone star force adventure, without having seen any other episode or knowing much about the plot arc. Though it helps to know a LITTLE. 

It has all kinds of Easter eggs and homages, maybe more than usual. Look for references to Dune, Twilight Zone, Battlestar Galctica, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, TriffidTrump, Star Trek, and all the other SW episodes, among others. 

GO! Before the Post-Final Order arrives and bans this from the big screen!"
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,"Satisfying end for this trilogy. The movie revisits all actors and brings a fulfilling end. Even though, Carrie Fisher's scenes seem unnatural and out of context, the movie deserves some credit."
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,"Fantastic comeback from the abomination that was ep. VIII.  It's a solid stand alone film and utilizes the entire timeline.  what the film needed was more story development.  Ep. XI was not rushed persay, but it felt like too much time was spent explaining everything that was going on.  It would have benefited from a ep. VIII that built up to XI."
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,"I don't know much about movies film making wise, but I do know a little about acting, scene direction and overall screenplay. This movie was indeed an extremely improved storyline over the previous episode. There was no obvious evidence of political agenda in this movie and to an extent the outcome the characters come to doesn't make them foolish beyond measure. What I did not like was the theme used about choosing your family with the specific character chosen for that message. It's just a pet peeve, but a character should not look like a clone of another character and barely resemble the parents.  I recognize with the loss of Carrie there was some script tweaks for her character as well but it was amazing to see how far we've come with special effects and such. It was also nice to see some of the original star wars cast return not just for a cameo, but for a significant part of the plot line."
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,"Absolutely loved it. Watched it in 3D. That slow moving ocean though!! Sad to see Ben go, as I loved his character. Rey is fantastic to look at in action. Will watch again."
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,I'm among the few that has somewhat enjoyed the last two previous films but this overall was a bit disappointing. Has some great scenes and moments in it but just felt a bit rushed and Disney didn't have a clear path on this new trilogy as a whole.
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,It was an amazing end to one of the all time best movie series!!
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,Wonderful story ending the Star Wars series. Great cinematography and music interplays with great acting and it was great to see old characters interspersed in it.
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,Plot wise- a bit loose and weak. However the story played heavy emotionally and that's where it all came together. All in all I would give it a 7/8 out of 10.
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,loved everything about it
"Jan 18, 2020",negative,"Let me start by saying I didn't just see the movie and come here to bash it. I sat with it and thought long and hard about this. To not have an emotional reaction and attack people. So here I am weeks after I seen it with my thoughts so let's begin this mile. They tried to use nostalgia fan service and a fast pace to hide and speed by the incoherent plot that was unbearable at times. Not having George Lucas actually collaborating and overseeing these movies has hurt a great deal. Imagine in Return of the Jedi if key plot points were retconning Empire Strike back and not just retconning. Retconning in the way it comes off as an apology to the audience. Or just completely ignoring the previous movie. You can't let fans dictate the Art we aren't filmmakers so what we want isn't necessarily going to be good. This felt like the biggest budgeted fan made film ever and not a good one. What they decided to do with characters I didn't enjoy or they would start to do something I was intrigued and hype and ruin the landing for me. Firstly let's start with Leia shouldn't have been in this movie. I didn't like the end of her character and trying to create scenes around scenes previously shot for other movies is stupid and not a good filmmaking decision. Palpatine made zero sense and I was excited going in but once I got him it felt hollow and like Anakins sacrifice were disregarded. I began to walk out of the film at the end quietly not to interrupt others movie watching experience but the audience I was in also wasn't too happy and stood at the exit to see the end. A lackluster disappointing end that defacates on the Star Wars saga, each trilogies fans, and the new fans of this trilogy all in one. I don't know if a JJ cut would fix his decisions in what we did or just extend this Shawshank Redemption like escape from the saga walking through feces just to get to The Mandalorian. Im not going to protest or attack people for enjoying a movie. I'm not going to sign a petition to get the trilogy remade with George's vision. The ship has sailed and this is our boat we sail into the future of Star Wars with. It's like if the Titanic hit two icebergs and the Captain is telling us the boats fine as you see the water pouring in. At times I think it's time to take that lifeboat and leave Star Wars behind. Disney has taken my life long love with Star Wars and in the process of trying to wring our every dollar from me have also squeezed my love out for it as well. Maybe because I stay because I'm stubborn or hopeful seeing how the Marvel Universe is run or even Dave Filoni and Jon Favreau making something that feels like Star Wars but also new and refreshing. That pays homage and moves forward. I guess they are my only hope since I can't count on the head of Lucasfilm to understand and be able to steer this ship. I'll hang out by the band and enjoy these songs as the ship sinks."
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,Loved it! Saw it in 3-D!
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,My Son and I ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT!
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,It was a very fun movie.  No great storytelling but if you enjoy the characters and like a fun popcorn movie this is for you.
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,Good story continue on from the past movies lots of action and great feel good moments.
"Jan 18, 2020",negative,"It was a weak entry for the trilogy. I wish they didn't try to do what they did. Trying to one up what happened in the last film and trying to please every star wars fan was a bad idea. I wish they had gone in a different direction, but this is what we got and it's an okay movie as is, but one has to wonder, what if?"
"Jan 18, 2020",negative,Somewhere in there was a 3 star movie if it had been an hour or so.  2 hours and 20 minutes was too long for all the dead people to resurrected and then go away without a plot.
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,Wow awesome loved it
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,Wow!! What an ending!! Had to see it go but damn!!
"Jan 18, 2020",negative,off track. Not enough action
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,I’d watch this at least 100x’s - so great!!!!
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,"Honestly, it is disappointing but exciting at the same time.  although it is a shame that the skywalker saga ends in such a lazy way."
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,I saw it in 3d and that just gave an extra dimension and depth to the movie.
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,It was a great movie sad to see it end.
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,A big lack of imagination and creativity but still a solid movie and a proper ending to this trilogy.
"Jan 18, 2020",negative,The first half of the movie was just ok and the second half was just awful.
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,Best one in a long long time
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,"It was fine. I had more fun watching it than The Last Jedi. Overall, this trilogy was disappointing. "
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,Lots of action. A few surprises.
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,"Very fun in its own right, but has to throw at least two movies worth of plot and exposition in order to wrap things up.  Why they didn't plot/script the whole trilogy from the start is mind boggling."
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,"It was about as good as you could expect while trying to wrap up a series as large as star wars. I think there were too many loose ends going into this last film to really expect it to be exceptional, but it was well made and had some good moments."
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,"This is an amazing movie! Don't let so-called ""Movie Critics"" tell you otherwise. Great closing to the saga."
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,Me and my son liked it. All he did was ask question about the old start wars movies so I'm buying all the star wars movies and me and him are going to watch so he can see how much these people have aged and see what there role played for these movies.
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,I'm huge Star Wars fan.  This is good 🍿 🎥
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,"As a movie it is good, however, as a saga, it is awful."
"Jan 18, 2020",negative,"A desecration of the previous trilogies. Numerous plotholes 
throughout the movie. Tragic ending.
No hope, no happiness, nothing at all."
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,"best star wars wrap up.
Are we finally done now???"
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,"I liked it more than I disliked it but I totally get why some people will hate this movie with a seething passion. So many conveniences taken, so many inconsistencies, so many Deus ex machina coming to save the day. It wants to think it's clever but it's not - it's dull and ham-handed and coasting on the good graces of our love of a franchise that deserved better than this. THAT SAID, beautiful to look at, moving at points, sometimes radiant with possibility, and not anywhere near as bad as what some people are saying."
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,"Great movie, a little bit slow in story line at times."
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,It was great! Loved it!
"Jan 18, 2020",negative,"Terrible movie.  Half of it was a complete mess where I couldn't tell what was going on, the characters ran after MacGuffin after MacGuffin, stumbled into insane coincidences, and in general made no sense.  The other half was more coherent but made just as little sense.  The movie does not just break Star Wars history, it contradicts itself.  Characters forget their own abilities in the middle of the movie, ""suddenly"" and conveniently discover brand new ones never seen before.  Entire sub-plots are lost altogether.

Do yourself a favor, and wait for it to come out on streaming service (or probably Disney+).  If you must know what happens, read the spoilers on the internet - you will be far more satisfied and it's free."
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,Loved it!!! Loved the homage to Carrie Fisher and to the first movie (Episode4)
"Jan 18, 2020",negative,"Worst Star Wars movie EVER! I dare say this was worse than The Last Jedi. Many of you may disagree so let me make my case. At least the Ep. 8 was a well made movie, but terribly made STARWARS movie. It ignored everything from the past, or the starwars world that George Lucas created. If you can ignore that it was a starwars movie, it was a well-made movie. However, THIS IS A HORRIBLY MADE MOVIE. All it does is to clean up the mess from Ep. 8 and shove people with nostalgic moment. And the way they go about it feels so artificial and doesn't flow naturally. It feels like a Fan-Fiction. On top of all that, this movie is trying to close this Saga of Starwars and tries to give each character its moment. In doing so, they put too much information in one movie. Of my entire life, this was the first close-to-3 hour flim that I watched that felt too rushed and short! There are many more flaw that I or other can add to this flim, but these are some of the main reasons why I HATED THIS FLIM. Director should've remembered that this is a movie first and Starwars second! I can barely call it a flim The only people I would recommend this flim, are the ones who enjoy large scale blockbuster sci-fi action with zero-care about plots. Oh actually Adam Driver's acting was fantastic. Disney just failed to use that in this flim."
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,love star wars and kylo ren. not crazy about the ending. could have been better.
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,"A satisfying ending, but glad it's all finally over. Unless you're a diehard fan, save it for Netflix."
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,"Honestly this is a 3 star movie, however it gets an extra star for trying to fix what an atrocity episode 8 was and another star for making me not hate Star Wars anymore.  Being a long time Star Wars fan, I was hugely disappointed by how the last movie almost destroyed 40 years of Star Wars canon.  This movie which essentially has almost two movies worth of content crammed into one did an admirable job in both trying to finish the main story arc, answer key questions built up from back in episode 7 and fix most of the damages done in episode 8.  Sure some of the new story elements really came out of left field, but considering what a mess the last movie made it was a miracle this movie was able to accomplish and was able to mostly salvage the trilogy.  I can unabashedly say that most of this movie was a fan service.  And as a fan, I thank the film makers for caring and listening to the voices and feed backs of true Star War fans."
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,Even though it was the last movie in the series. They definitely left it open for more prequels and spin offs
"Jan 18, 2020",negative,"Either you like it or you don't there's no middle ground on this one. I didn't like it. The only saving grace was the battle scenes. That's why it gets two stars from  me, if it was on TV I wouldn't have a problem getting up and getting something to eat or drink while it was on and not waiting for a commercial. Maybe it's a generation thing due to the fact I was fortunate enough to see a young Luke Skywalker start this all off, the wonder of it all the excitement, it seems to be lost in this latest episode my wife literally read the entire movie as we watched  as if she directed it herself. No surprises in this one, no WOW no that was amazing. Go in expecting nothing and you'll be happy, go in expecting something and sadly you'll be let down. Just my humble opinion."
"Jan 18, 2020",negative,"Too much flawed science logic. Suspension of disbelief can only go so far. I was on board for the first half of the movie, but once they got to the Endor moon, it went off the rails with ridiculousness"
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,"I've never been a big fan of the Star Wars films, my main gripe being a lack of depth and an over-romanticising narrative. I felt Rogue One cured that and thoroughly enjoyed its dark ending. Rise of Skywalker sort of uses an old villain as a deus  ex machina to add a much needed sense of purpose and revelation. Visually amazing and great homages to the original trilogy (one of which, being the destruction of a planet - I totally stan), but all in all, lacking on its own direction of point and use of prestige characters that seemed, in retrospect, on death row."
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,My favorite of the last three movies! Action packed and good story line!
"Jan 18, 2020",neutral,"This is definitely this trilogy's Return of the Jedi, for better or worse (mostly worse). It's as much a Disney theme park ride as a movie, as we are whisked from one action set piece to another. There's a little character development for Rey, but others such as Lando are just putting in an appearance. Still it's enjoyable enough if you don't think about it too much, as is generally the case with anything Star Wars."
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,"A good movie! A lot of storylines were wrapped up, questions answered, and a great end to the saga. As long as they keep JJ Abrams on it, Star Wars will do just fine"
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,"Not sure what everyone disliked about this one. I found it to be a great closing. High stakes action sequences, lots of drama... I had a blast."
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,Its star wars. You know what the restaurant is. It has good food. Stop disagreeing the food and compliang that there is to much garlic and to litte arugala.
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,Like: sewed a lot of things together. And positive messages. Dislike: loud and flashing lights. A little over the top. Little too creepy.
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,"Great movie! Definitely, in my opinion, a great end to an era. Hopefully it's not the last Star Wars film ever because I still want to see more. Star Wars Forever!"
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,Lots of good action . Good storyline.
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,"Lots of action,but hard to follow."
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,"Cinematography is superb. Characters are engaging, colorful, and believable. Musical score elaborates the whole film.The film as a whole is well worth th time and price of admission"
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,"I loved how all the story lines throughout the Galaxy Far, Far Away were wrapped up so satisfactorily! This was the perfect finish to an epic series!"
"Jan 18, 2020",negative,Take this movie to interrogation room 6. This movie is a joke...
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,The storyline and the adaption of the deleted scenes with Carrie Fisher is exceptional.  They were able to tie in so many previous locations and characters was great.  The perfect way to end the Skywalker story and I don't know if it could have been done better! Truly the end of an era.
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,It was a little better than the other two but not by much.
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,"Good movie, too much fluff-extra stuff, too long, wanted a little something more."
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,Glad I went to the theater for this one.
"Jan 18, 2020",negative,Ugh! Trash! Do NOT recommend. Give me Wall-E
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,"Not nearly as good as 4-6, but good."
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,Everything i hoped a star wars movie would be and more!
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,Loved how the film came full circle and closed the Skywalker loop.
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,"Better than episode 8, no doubt. This is probably my favorite of the sequel movies. It's good, but I felt that most of the movie was taken up with fixing the many mistakes of the last film."
"Jan 18, 2020",neutral,There was nothing new in this movie. They used the same old storyline.
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,Great conclusion to the Saga!
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,"Finally, a REAL STAR WARS movie.  Rise of Skywalker provides an acceptable end to the trilogy, which is no small task.  It also effectively negates Rian Johnson's abomination."
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,Amazing ending to an amazing saga!
"Jan 18, 2020",neutral,Meh is about the best I can say about it. Probably the best we could hope for after the last movie.
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,"The callbacks were nice and I personally liked the ending, but everything felt too convenient. I’m sad to see such a pivotal franchise in my life go out with a whimper rather than a bang."
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,"I liked this movie, plenty of action and storey line"
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,"Solid. Felt a bit rushed, even in 2.5 hours. Interesting plot twists, but safely-played in order to try pleasing everyone."
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,Absolutely Amazing 😊
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,Exceptional story the followed the book very well. Definitely a must see!
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,Solid finale to the series.
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,"Visually stunning, well-acted, and heartwarming but not a satisfying ending to the iconic saga"
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,"I wouldn’t rank it as a top Star Wars but it’s better than some, was entertaining but felt rushed to tie up loose ends"
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,Best movie on the trilogy by FAR
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,Love it. Excited to see if there will be more!
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,"Could have been amazing movie. Instead it was a fast paced mess, that gave the viewer 0 time to feel anything."
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,"I love this movie, to me it was the best one."
"Jan 18, 2020",neutral,I’m not one to say that the new Star Wars films ruined the originals but they have made it not fun to talk about Star Wars. This film is ok. It’s got good things and bad things. I really can’t say more because there’s nothing else to say.
"Jan 18, 2020",negative,Ridiculous. Ruined Return of the Jedi.
"Jan 18, 2020",negative,"Unimaginative and lazy, a sad ending to a 9 movie franchise"
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,An Amazing way to end the Skywalker Saga.
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,"loved it, another hit in the Star Wars Saga"
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,I loved this movie it was a purely awesome closing
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,"I enjoyed this movie. I saw it in the 4DX version with the 3d glasses. It was so much fun and be prepared to be pulled around, hit with mist and tapped on the shoulder with every move and action scene in the movie. The manager was great @ this theatre which contributed to my overall experience also and I am going again for another action packed show!! You should too!!"
"Jan 18, 2020",negative,At least it was better then the Last Jedi.
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,Really good action throughout. Storyline was easy to follow. Not a dry moment.
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,"Better than the abysmal Last Jedi, but story was too convoluted and convenient."
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,Like the story and good to see the Skywalker legacy end as a beginning.
"Jan 18, 2020",negative,As garbage as the last two.
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,Loved the subtle humor but not the deaths at the end... why???
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,I thought the story was amazing!! It was a great ending to the story.
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,The movie was really good!
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,Very interesting. Could actually make another to continue the saga
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,"This was a good send off to a really great franchise it does and doesn't retcon the things from the last Jedi, the nostalgia callbacks are great and the effects look really great; this will be a fun time for Star Wars fans"
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,Awesome ending and leading up to the end! finished the story really well!
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,Completes the process
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,"Ignore all the haters it has very great moments, amazing fights, and that ship battle at the end was amazing. Still not as good as the empire strikes back."
"Jan 18, 2020",positive,Not a movie for those who have not seen the other movies in the series.   Even if they have been seen I would recommend going through the last few to pick up the threads. Could and should have been better
"Jan 18, 2020",negative,Tries to be too many things.
"Jan 17, 2020",positive,Loved every minute!!! Intense and all the good feels
"Jan 17, 2020",positive,"You could tell there were some issues with CF passing away to where she was gonna be used more.  Just go in open minded you will enjoy it. I loved this movie, definitely had to spend too much of it patching issues from 8 but I loved it.  As an 80s kid it gave me the feeling I had when I saw the first trilogy.   I’m not saying it’s perfect but I was a person that didn’t hate 8 but I also didn’t enjoy near as much.  Great story told IMO and if people are complaining about this should think back to Episode 1 when that came out.  I think a directors cut of this will help some of the reasons people disliked it. To make this right it could of been split into 2 movies. Go see it, sit back, it deserves a big screen."
"Jan 17, 2020",negative,Come on. really? that bad with so much money is a failure of humanity
"Jan 17, 2020",positive,Didn't like the story line - felt sloppy.  Meh
"Jan 17, 2020",negative,"Complete mess, of all the stories you could tell in the SW universe... And THIS is the best they could come up with!!!?"
"Jan 17, 2020",positive,"It was amazing!! A little bit rushed, I would like to see a director's cut! I'm a huge Star Wars fan"
"Jan 17, 2020",positive,The movie was absolutely amazing
"Jan 17, 2020",positive,"Amazing experience, well worth the wait!!!"
"Jan 17, 2020",negative,"So many unanswered questions, Ben Solo and Luke deserved better. It was all over the place not organized. I’ll pretend it never happened."
"Jan 17, 2020",negative,Rather sh*t in my hand and clap than watch this again..... not the worst of the trilogy though.
"Jan 17, 2020",positive,"Loved it. A true Star Wars movie. If you’re a fan, it’s a must see."
"Jan 17, 2020",negative,maybe dont kiss Ben at the end and I'd hate it less.
"Jan 17, 2020",positive,A bit corny and honestly I’m glad that series is over. 5 sequels too many.
"Jan 17, 2020",positive,It has been a long journey and it ended well. I love the character of rey a smart twist to the story.
"Jan 17, 2020",positive,It was really great!!
"Jan 17, 2020",negative,"So boring!  Rinse and repeat story line.   Transparently injected PC nonsense into the film.  How many times do Rey and Ben ""connect""?   Ridiculous.   Completely threww away Star Wars Cannon.  Bitter disappointment.  Worse than the previous film.  I'd rather watch Attack of the Clones than either of these last two Star Wars films.  Still not as bad as ""The Force Awakens"" though."
"Jan 17, 2020",positive,"Incredible, Amazing!!!!"
"Jan 17, 2020",positive,"I have watched each one in the theater, and I liked this movie."
"Jan 17, 2020",negative,Clinically brain-dead storytelling.
"Jan 17, 2020",positive,"I truly enjoyed this movie!  I thought it did a great job wrapping up the Star Wars series!  The only issue that I had with it is how much they covered. 
There was definitely 2 movies worth of material in this one movie. I look forward to seeing the director's cut. I really don't understand what ""critics"" expected to see?  I've heard some say they were ""pandering to the fans"" . . .well yeah *rolling eyes* IT'S STAR WARS!"
"Jan 17, 2020",negative,"Wholeheartedly disappointing, this film works dubiously hard to assert that the sequel trilogy has no plan, purpose, or message for the series as a whole."
"Jan 17, 2020",negative,"Everyone knew Kylo would be redeemed, but I always thought it would be because he learned something, not because he got his ass kicked enough. I thought these movies were building a new world, but this one completely rebuilds the empire again, with no explanation. It's like the sudden introduction of a massive clone army, but with none of the explanation from episode 2. But also in addition to the army, it's the entire infrastructure of the army as well, and massive technological leap forward with no build up. It's all of the worst things about the prequels with the shitty banter of the new trilogy. Worst of both worlds. And I liked 7 & 8. I just thought they would eventually build to something other than the good guys killing a massive absolutely evil army."
"Jan 17, 2020",positive,Loved it. Amazing ending the an EPIC story.
"Jan 17, 2020",positive,"Just ok, not how I expected the franchise to end. Long time fans of the film might be disappointed "
"Jan 17, 2020",positive,"Good movie, sound was bad at times."
"Jan 17, 2020",negative,"Bad conclusion. Palpatine is worthless, action Is Bad and boring."
"Jan 17, 2020",positive,Really enjoyed the movie in Real3D.  I will definitely try another movie in Real3D.  Also looking forward to trying an Imax movie again.  It's been too long
"Jan 17, 2020",negative,Left after 30 minutes. A noisy mess. No fun.
"Jan 17, 2020",positive,Great movie even my 7 year old loved it
"Jan 17, 2020",positive,Best one out of the last 3 for sure.
"Jan 17, 2020",positive,"It explained a lot and didn't explain some. Personally I loved it. Kidosnto the tech and graphics team. The story line stayed within the saga. All around great show. I'm looking forward to seeing it again. It also was a plus to see the movie, then go to Disney Hollywood Studios and visit Galaxy's Edge - Awesome!!"
"Jan 17, 2020",neutral,"The movie had some great parts, but they were all mixed into a mess.  Too much going on, and not enough real, believable drama developed."
"Jan 17, 2020",negative,Felt like the movie tried both to erase the Last Jedi but failed to conclude a story they never began
"Jan 17, 2020",positive,"A fun, albeit messy, ride. "
"Jan 17, 2020",positive,"Entertaining and visually stunning. Flawed in some respects, but it does not fail to keep me entertained throughout."
"Jan 17, 2020",positive,"Critics, smucks the lot of them, listen to the audience. It's the film we wanted and an awesomely fitting conclusion to the saga storyline begun in the original trilogy. Loved it, thank you JJ and the cast.💖💯"
"Jan 17, 2020",positive,Loved it!! Great ending to the trilogy!
"Jan 17, 2020",positive,Loved it!  Visual effects deserve an Oscar!
"Jan 17, 2020",positive,"Best of the series.  Well done, great story line."
"Jan 17, 2020",negative,"The plot undid all of Rian Johnsons SW movie, which granted was not the best, but at least continue the story FFS JJ Binks you ruined SW, i want to delete this movie from the world."
"Jan 17, 2020",neutral,"It had some good scenery’s, but it was skip jumping mess all over the place, rushed to fill the void."
"Jan 17, 2020",positive,More of the same. I still enjoyed though.
"Jan 17, 2020",positive,absolutely incredible!
"Jan 17, 2020",positive,It was a great movie. It was a great way to end the series. I think 🤔 the actors did a great job and Carrie Fisher was amazing.
"Jan 17, 2020",negative,"I'm sending Disney my ophthalmologist bill for the reconstructive surgery I'll need on my eyes after the most eye rolling I've ever performed in a movie. When a giant snake is the saving grace to redeem one of the biggest plot holes in the history of movies, you know you need to hit the writing room again."
"Jan 17, 2020",positive,I thought it was a good experience. Special effects were amazing as always. It was hard to follow these new characters being introduced with no back story to make me care about them. Scenes moved so quickly that I didn't have enough time to comprehend and think about what happened.
"Jan 17, 2020",neutral,This was my least favorite of all the star wars sequel trilogy. It is worth seeing just because it is such a big part of culture but wouldn't rewatch and didn't feel like it added anything to the series.
"Jan 17, 2020",negative,"I almost fell asleep. It was boring and the parts with Leia felt weird. Also, I felt like Kylo Ren deserved a better ending"
"Jan 17, 2020",neutral,it was ight. kinda cheesy. definitely not anything like the originals :/
"Jan 17, 2020",negative,I love Star Wars but this movie was an overall big let down.
"Jan 17, 2020",positive,"I think the critics are crazy.  This was a great finale to the trilogy.  I know it wasn't perfect, but I really liked the parentage twist, the continued Rey/Kylo story, and the way it all came together in the end.  Nicely done! I went twice already and plan to go again.  If there was a disappointing episode in this trilogy, it was Last Jedi."
"Jan 17, 2020",positive,"Fan-nostalgia driven film that can be at times quite predictable, but genuinely an amazing culmination to a blast of a saga."
"Jan 17, 2020",positive,Slow at first but picked up towards the end.
"Jan 17, 2020",positive,It was an amazing movie!!
"Jan 17, 2020",neutral,It felt rushed and not thought through. Like they had a deadline to get it out and they didnt really know what to do with the story. Didnt feel like the flow fit in with the other movies in the series.
"Jan 17, 2020",positive,"Easily the best out of the sequels. While that's not saying a whole lot, it does offer much more interesting character development and original star wars throwbacks. While the story feels extremely processed and exactly like a worse version of Return of the Jedi, it still has very decent action sequences. Best sequel."
"Jan 17, 2020",positive,It felt kind of rushed in the beginning but it had the Star Wars feeling I wanted to see. It was a pretty decent conclusion to the sequel trilogy
"Jan 17, 2020",positive,"I love predicting the next scene in a movie but my predictions, when watching The Rise of Skywalker, were way off base which is exhilarating.  So Fresh! Definitely a must see!"
"Jan 17, 2020",positive,Absolutely fantastic! Especially considering how much story had to be told due to the middle films lack of story telling.
"Jan 17, 2020",positive,It was a good movie. It kinda felt rushed in some scenes. They could have did better. Over all i liked it.
"Jan 17, 2020",positive,A fitting finale to the Skywalker saga. Plenty of action between the force and the dark side. Returns of favorites of original trilogy.
"Jan 17, 2020",positive,"A little corney in spots, but still very good."
"Jan 17, 2020",positive,Great movie. Emotion from beginning to end.
"Jan 17, 2020",positive,I thought this was the best of the new trilogy. And I loved how they took a jab at Last Jedi (what a mess).  I loved it when Luke says you need to treat a Jedis weapon with more respect.  Overall lots of fun and it was Star Wars!!
"Jan 17, 2020",positive,"Great movie, but I felt like it just had some unrealistic scenes which kind of took away the 5/5 for me"
"Jan 17, 2020",positive,"Following up the narrative disaster of TLJ that was infested with bad humor and lazy/convenient story telling I think TROS was a good rebound for the franchise. Rather than try to run with the scraps that were left from TLJ of protagonists we don't care about, a cause we can't really get behind and antagonists we don't respect this movie scrapped TLJ, which I think was the right direction. TLJ felt useless as I watched it... and indeed it was.

Moving to this movie in a vacuum, I thought it was good, but not great. There were still some cringe moments, but some of those just needed to correct TLJ such as Luke's reappearance and his lightsaber retort. Bringing Palpatine back undermines the direction of the first two movies as well, but I get they needed some conflict because Snoke fell to peak-a-boo foolishness and Kylo Ren was made out into some laughable emo kid. 

It's hard to review this moving in a vacuum, actually, because it was burdened by needing to start over and start fresh while also wrapping up a trilogy. On its own, it's just a silly popcorn movie jumping from one action scene to the next. There are some great set pieces and a ton of fan service to help set this apart from other popcorn flicks. No deep thinking here and nothing adding to the mythology of Star Wars beyond maybe the Sith auditorium (that wasn't really fleshed out). 

It was a pretty fun, low stakes movie that felt like a masterpiece given its recently soiled source material."
"Jan 17, 2020",negative,Predictable cheese fest with no coherent plot.
"Jan 17, 2020",negative,"The movie isn't worth watching. It's choppy, relies heavily on fan service, and tries too hard to please everyone."
"Jan 17, 2020",positive,En solid Star Wars film der forsøger at rede havd reddes kan efter den talentøse forgænger !
"Jan 17, 2020",neutral,"Convoluted and rushed, and adds to nearly none of the plot lines set up by the previous film, but it has some good Star Wars fun."
"Jan 17, 2020",positive,"quintessential star wars. same story line, different players. Good vs. evil, good wins over devils surrogate, ultimate evil is defeated by good, good rides off into the sunset. That said, the cinematography is grand, the action mesmerizing and the acting awesome. One of the better Star Wars bit not my absolute favorite. Worth the evening out for sure!"
"Jan 17, 2020",negative,Stupid story again so can't recommend it but you already know if you're gonna watch it
"Jan 17, 2020",negative,Not good. No direction and unsatisfying.
"Jan 17, 2020",positive,"Ending was bad, but the rest of the movie was great.  Ben should have been the last living Skywalker. Now that would have brought all 9 movies full circle with the perfect ending!"
"Jan 17, 2020",positive,love the franchise love the characters and cast great way to end the skywalker Saga huge Star Wars Fans even collected Star Wars Rise Of Skywalker funko pops
"Jan 17, 2020",positive,Good ending to this Trilogy.
"Jan 17, 2020",positive,I think this was a great ending (?) to the Star Wars legend. Lots of surprises.
"Jan 17, 2020",positive,fun popcorn flick. doesn't feel like it belongs as a skywalker film.
"Jan 17, 2020",positive,"Could have been better and felt rushed but all in all, I enjoyed the movie. I never got into the characters so that has lacked since they came out with these movies. Still worth watching when you've seen all the others."
"Jan 17, 2020",neutral,Great visual movie but way too long and slow paced.
"Jan 17, 2020",neutral,"Too many extra characters with very little main character development. It was predictable and boring at times. Kylo’s character was nearly useless to the story especially since Rey is completely overpowered! Overall I give this a (meh), mostly because of Luke and Kylo scene."
"Jan 17, 2020",positive,Great story. I wish it would have been longer to fill in more gaps. There was a lot to fix from The Last Jedi.
"Jan 17, 2020",positive,"The film brings the saga to a great ending, while being authentic to it's beginnings and to all of the characters we have come to love.  The tribute to the late Carrie Fisher, in the remembrance in the death of Princess  Leia Organa was very touching."
"Jan 17, 2020",positive,"Avid  SW fan that I am, was a bit disappointed. Plenty of action, but it seems like too much was put in to tie it all together.  But still it was entertaining and I'll still see it again to see what I missed in previous viewing."
"Jan 17, 2020",positive,"The Skywalker Saga ended and the end is good.
In my opinion it is a good conclusion to a 40 year old story.
Some of the best Star Wars moments were picked up again.
A must see for a Star Wars fan. This is what Star Wars become, but I am fine with it.
Excited to see more of it"
"Jan 17, 2020",negative,"Disney has done what appeared impossible...destroyed the Star Wars brand. This movie was a compilation of bad sword fights, insipid dialogue and weak character development."
"Jan 17, 2020",positive,"Jj did a great job with the movie, it kinda fix the problem from the last jedi, really happy with the film"
"Jan 17, 2020",positive,"Kinda wish it would lead to another Trilogy. Great trilogy and ending in its own right but nothing compares to the 2nd Trilogy. Spoiler, love the part when Luke used the force and lifted his X-Wing fighter out of the sea so Ray can use it. I got chills cause it reminded me of the Return of the Jedi and Yoda. Another passing of the Baton..."
"Jan 17, 2020",positive,Confusing at first. Ending just didnt feel right
"Jan 17, 2020",positive,Awesome ending to an amazing saga!
"Jan 17, 2020",negative,"Why did you destory the legacy of Anakin and Luke for the sake of Making Ray, who could have been one of the best female leads in modern history, a mary sue and bland as heck. 

Daisy Ridley is a talented actress and you used her on this?

i only hope Star wars can cut this latest trilogy off and call it non cannon. i certainly dont consider Disneys films as SW cannon."
"Jan 17, 2020",negative,"I think it's better to change the subtitle of the movie, as a example, RISE OF PALPATINE like something."
"Jan 17, 2020",negative,it made the original 3 movies pointless.
"Jan 17, 2020",positive,"While the film falls prey to lazy writing tropes, it is still very enjoyable. The visuals are stunningly gorgeous. The sith are darker and more frightening than ever before."
"Jan 17, 2020",positive,Awesome!  Wraps up nicely and left me wanting more.
"Jan 17, 2020",positive,"Fun to watch, good closure to the saga."
"Jan 17, 2020",negative,Hated it. Has nothing of what I loved about star wars.
"Jan 17, 2020",positive,"It was so amazing, it had me on my toes. I would watch again!!"
"Jan 17, 2020",negative,There wasn’t much character development.
"Jan 17, 2020",positive,"Overall, I think I enjoyed it.  Even though, Rey's character could've been more developed, because of how impactful her being Palpatine's grand-daughter was.  Big character in the series, who himself still carries a heavy aura of mystique."
"Jan 17, 2020",positive,I feel like everyone is extremely overly critical of pretty much every Star Wars movie. The entire series of movies are steeped in predictable sci/fi fantasy tropes. They've NEVER been amazingly profound aside from the Darth Vader revelation in Empire. Sit back and enjoy it for what it is. Or don't and waste your time complaining about a space drama. No skin off the backs of all of us that have fun with all Star Wars content.
"Jan 17, 2020",positive,"It’s a good movie. Feels very rushed,  I’m disappointed with the ending but all and all a decent movie worth seeing"
"Jan 17, 2020",negative,"Was terrible, as the entire new trilogy!"
"Jan 17, 2020",negative,"Abject garbage,
The only good thing about this movie is that Disney is finally done shitting on the Star Wars Saga."
"Jan 17, 2020",positive,"I loved the special effects, the completion of so many story arcs and the characters. I was super sad the first time I saw the end, and I cant say why because it is a spoiler. I loved the surprises but that may be because I dont watch the adds. I like to be surprised and to go on the journey of a fine storyteller. So I go back to enjoy all the details and bits I am sure I missed the first time I saw it. I think I will go again and take my friend who read all these bad reviews, I told her it is great. I was in college when I saw the first Star Wars IV in the movie theater when it first came out. I loved Star Trek and when I saw Star Wars I was so immersed I cant remember who my date was, it was a game changer in the Sci-fi world. Thank you Lucas. Over the years I introduced these movies to my children who passed it on to my grandchildren who are big time Star Wars enthusiasts. Thanks to all the actors, designers, writers, computer whizzes and so many more who made all these movies possible."
"Jan 17, 2020",positive,I absolutely loved it. It's Star Wars. Not Citizen Kane.
"Jan 17, 2020",negative,"Space horses, space ghosts and finger sky lightning. Screw Disney"
"Jan 17, 2020",positive,"The movie felt rushed. the Kylo and Rey storyline was the only believable part. Ending was great, but the script could have been better."
"Jan 17, 2020",positive,"Like most Star Wars properties this final installment of the Skywalker saga did alot of things wrong. However, like its predecessors, they did a lot of things right as well. sprinkled in between the down right cringy moments, mostly involving Fin, there were moments that remind you why this franchise means so much to so many people. The story was predictable but in all the right ways, the acting was passable, and the action was digestible and not overwhelming. All in all, I would say its turned it place in the hallowed halls of the Star Wars Empire."
"Jan 17, 2020",positive,This is my favorite Star Wars movie out this far. Not compared to the older ones.
"Jan 17, 2020",positive,Mostly tying up plot lines from the previous 8 movies and leaving a message of hope for the future (and likely Disney spinoffs).  But I did enjoy seeing the ole principals make a cameo (or more).  There are still a number of unanswered issues to keep everyone talking and guessing and waiting for the next movie.
"Jan 17, 2020",positive,Ok I will admit it needed some work but I'm not gonna go crazy like certain people who are too toxic some parts I say were good
"Jan 17, 2020",positive,Best Star Wars movie so far !
"Jan 17, 2020",negative,"Although a complete mess, I will give JJ credit for cleaning up after Johnson's epic fail of ""The Last Jedi"".  

YAWN......"
"Jan 17, 2020",positive,Not even a die hard Star Wars fan and I loved this movie!!!
"Jan 17, 2020",positive,"A lot to digest but beautiful visuals, great lightsaber fights, and some epic plot twists. I thought it was a beautiful film with just enough action, and heart."
"Jan 17, 2020",negative,"Well, for one, my review is not fake so there’s that. I hope Disney doesn’t delete this rating👀. This film is just bad lol like there’s no other way to say it. They have stolen everyone’s money and time with this barely put together monstrosity. This movie should be called: Star Wars: slapped at the last minute. The CGI is really good though."
"Jan 17, 2020",positive,"I went into this with no expectations and walked away having really enjoyed it.  There were some pacing and plot issues, but that was to be expected, since Abrams was cleaning up the mess that was Last Jedi."
"Jan 17, 2020",negative,Pacing was awful. If you are bored it can kill some time
"Jan 17, 2020",positive,"Brilliant ending to the series, definitely going to see it again."
"Jan 17, 2020",positive,Thought it was pretty good for what they had to work with. Execution probably could have been a bit better but no movie is perfect.
"Jan 17, 2020",positive,Admirable job of trying to recover from the disaster that was The Last Jedi but there wasn’t enough time to explore all of the new characters and themes introduced.
"Jan 17, 2020",positive,Critics said this movie is more of an apology for the mistake of the last movie.... apology accepted
"Jan 17, 2020",positive,what a turd being a kid when the original 3 came out really sucks how bad the newer star wars movies have been Disney is partly to blame.
"Jan 17, 2020",positive,Much better than the last installment which almost killed the series for me.  It tries to make up for story missteps in the last two films and almost succeeds.
"Jan 17, 2020",positive,Back to basics: The Rise of Skywalker gives the fans a highly entertaining film
"Jan 17, 2020",negative,Sad ending to a potentially amazing history. Should have ended this at episode 6. Now I have a bad taste in my mouth every time I think of this last sad trilogy.
"Jan 17, 2020",positive,"It was just alright. Being a child of the 70's and a life-long SW fan, since 1977, I've never bought into the last trilogy. It was too disconnected from Lucas' storyline."
"Jan 17, 2020",positive,the storyline was an absolute mess and it didn’t really make sense
"Jan 17, 2020",positive,I found issue with the pacing and poor acting at some points.
"Jan 17, 2020",neutral,"It was entertaining and fun, a lot of fan service. The plot went in a different direction than I'd hoped, and really doesn't make sense at parts."
"Jan 17, 2020",positive,"I attended the premiere of the movie with my girlfriend and we enjoyed it. Despite all the hate the movie gets, I loved it. Palpatine's return made me wanna rewatch this movie 3 times."
"Jan 17, 2020",negative,All three of these movies sucked. This one sucked a little less. The cinematography was great in all three but the story was just absolute trash. If the prequels had this type of filming and at least a half way decent dialogue it would have been amazing. Way to screw the pooch Disney. Make a KOTOR movie. Sad when a video game has a better plot/story
"Jan 17, 2020",positive,"There is no such thing as a perfect ending, but this hit so many perfect notes. I cant wait to see it again, and so sad that the original story has come to an end."
"Jan 17, 2020",positive,Great Movie from Walt Disney
"Jan 17, 2020",positive,Great movie don’t let anyone tell you different.
"Jan 17, 2020",positive,The end had it all for a fan. Don’t over think it. Just enjoy it.
"Jan 17, 2020",negative,"First let's get this out of the way this is far and away the worst film in the whole Saga and is certainly not the actors fault Daisy Ridley, Mark Hammil, Adam Driver, Carrie Fisher's edited posthumous material all give their all despite having no material to work with (like The Force Awakens and pretty much every Abrams film; this film has no script and no director either). Nor any actors fault; the VFX are as good as it gets, so certainly neither their fault. Is JJ Abrams and Chris Terrio's fault.

Before doing Star Wars, J.J. Abrams directed Star Trek Into Darkness a remake of the classic Star Trek 2: Wrath of Khan. Then when Abrams jumped franchise he did Star Wars 7; The Force Awakens a remake of you guess Star Wars 4: A New Hope. His next film is this and you guess were I am going, J.J. Abrams has not a single piece of imagination or creativity in his mind; this film is a remake of Return of the Jedi.

But like all previous JJ Abrams' remake films; this movie missunderstands the film it is remaking, is an anti-Star Wars in that it betrays the themes of all Star Wars films by George Lucas. You see the conclusion of 6 is Luke throwing away his lighstaber (like he did in the best and only original film in the whole sequel trilogy The Last Jedi by Rian Johnson). Luke threw his saber away to prevent himself from killing his father Anakin (in 6) and later in 8 to prevent himself from killing his nephew Ben Solo. In the Lucas/Rian Jhonson films; by the time of Luke'# older life, for Luke holding this saber is like Frodo holding the Ring of Sauron from Lord of the Rings.

Abrams makes Luke hold the saber again, but you see, the conclusion of the original trilogy was Luke throwing that saber. You see, the point I'm trying to make is that by allowing Luke to hold the saber in the way he did, by saying a""a Jedi's weapon deserves more respect"". Abrams retconed away more than The Last Jedi; Abrams' retconed away the conclusion of Return of the Jedi and the conclusion of George Lucas life work.

Lucas went as far as having Obi-wan Kenobi in II: Attack of the Clones, tell young Anakin this weapon is your life (the saber), because he wanted all the prequels to retroactively set up Luke throwing that saber. What does Abrams do he makes Luke advice to Jedi succesor Rey use that saber and actually gives her his sisters. Rey in the absence of a corpse for Luke buries the saber Luke hated so much and Luke is fine with it being a representation of his life completely betraying all Luke's life. I felt that by asking Rey to kill her grampa-Palpatine; was Yoda and Obi-wan, morally wrongly, asking Luke to kill his father Darth Vader all over again. Sure, Luke didn't knew Palpatine survived until IX, but he still sorta asked her to kill him in cold blood without offering her further training or anything (because for JJ Abrams The Force is all about bloodlines).

Abrams tries to retcon the hell of that previous  film; the problem is that to retcon something away you have to understand it and Abrams clearly doesn't understand 8, nor 7, nor 6, nor 5, nor 4, nor Rogue One, nor Solo, nor 3, nor 2, and certainly not 1. And Abrams clearly didn't bother to watch Dave Filoni and Lucas cartoons that pretty much gave us what Lucas sorta didn't managed in hia prequels.

Then don't even get in every single character fake dying and resurecting. How are we supposed ultimate evil Palpatine is defeated after so many fake deaths? Seriously? Is also a shame that Rose Tico's character was removed, by not carrying the babage of a remake storyline by JJ Abrams and being of a working lower social class; that like the apolitical hacker DJ; I could argue both are more original than any of the JJ Abrams character were he placed amazing actors in derivative remake plotlines.

This film is so poorly done, I'm not even sure if it will be considered canon or go the way of the Terminator sequels where every sequel is an attempt at a Terminator 3. Is a shame because the actors and VFX are really good. And deserved better. I'm sure that The Last Jedi will age well; and that any attempt at an Episode X or yes at an ""Episode IX: retry"" has nowhere to go but the themes of ""VIII: The Last Jedi"".

Everyone including me, wanted to love this film, is Star Wars (I even got so excited about Star Wars returning in 7; that Daisy Ridley replied a comment of mine and basically begged my crush to go see the movie with me an instagram comment which didn't work out). But you can see this Saga means a lot to me.

Don't hire J.J. Abrams all he does is lazy remakes that bring nothing new, and Abrams clearly misunderstands the franchises he touches. Abrams is killing Cinema one franchise at a time (this is a rollercoaster)."
"Jan 17, 2020",negative,"Reaches Michael Bay levels of nonstop bombasticity with additional incoherence for good measure. Yes, it is possible. If Rian Johnson took JJ Abrams positive but repetitive start in TFA and ignored it completely with his lore-breaking plothole-ish crapfest, then Abrams takes everything Johnson tried to build in TLJ and ignores it with an even ridiculous-er crappier crapfest. I never thought I'd prefer the Lucas directed sequels to anything Abrams directed but I will say this: at least George had a vision before he made a single movie instead of arrogantly throwing whatever garbage came to mind in his first draft and expecting everyone to eat it up just because the beginning crawl said ""STAR WARS."" Best lines: ""Kill the girl. I need her alive"" and [spoiler] ""I brought you back to life"" [kiss. disappear.]. At least Daisy Ridley is the cutest thing since the Ewoks and the mains all hug at the end."
"Jan 17, 2020",positive,The Rise of Skywalker is an absolute masterpiece! A complete turnaround from the mistakes of The Last Jedi and an emotionally satisfying end to the Skywalker saga.
"Jan 17, 2020",negative,"My guess is that Disney was still overhyped on how much money Avengers: Endgame made them, so they wanted to do that again with this film. Because this movie is packed with fan service. With Lando making several apperiences, Emperor Palpatine coming back from the dead (which also makes Darth Vader's sacrifice in Return of the Jedi meaningless,) and overall nonsencical plot elements used for the sake of pleasing the audience. Which, looking at the audience score, it sort of did. But not me. Star Wars seems to have lost any kind of purpose in itself now. Even though the prequels aren't all that good, at least you could tell they had a story that someone acually wanted to tell, and it wasn't all for the money. I'm not saying any spoilers, but you know they're going to make a new trilogy soon after this. If I'm right, they might be even worse."
"Jan 17, 2020",positive,A fun movie by itself. Lot's of scenes happening very rapidly back to back. Who am I kidding. Is this movie review necessary? Everybody has seen it by now. It's a terrible conclusion with a terrible storyline. I'm disappointed by how the movie concluded.
"Jan 17, 2020",positive,I loved the way they incorporated elements of all episodes into the finale.
"Jan 17, 2020",positive,"It was a bit busy but it had a lot of ground to cover. I liked how that resolved all of the characters and kept the focus on the ""new"" three."
"Jan 17, 2020",negative,"Where do I begin? The Rise of Skywalker is visually epic. Unfortunately that's the best thing I can say about it. The dialogue is weak. The fan service is obvious and clumsy at times. The space horses were....original in a cringey way. Frankly, the Skywalker Saga deserved a better ending than the mediocre one it got. In the end it was a J.J. Abrams film...and I didn't really expect much to begin with."
"Jan 17, 2020",positive,Love all Star Wars movies!
"Jan 17, 2020",positive,Great Star Wars movie from start to finish.
"Jan 17, 2020",neutral,"Structurally, to many big moments with no build up. Leaves you bored"
"Jan 17, 2020",positive,Everyone is hating on it. It is very good. A must see for true Star Wars fans
"Jan 17, 2020",positive,the picture was good but I'm not a starwars fan 😁
"Jan 17, 2020",positive,It had everything! Perfect ending to the saga.
"Jan 17, 2020",positive,"A bit rushed in the beginning, but tied the story up as needed."
"Jan 17, 2020",positive,Muddled plot okay action sequences.
"Jan 17, 2020",positive,Same theme as previous Star Wars
"Jan 17, 2020",negative,"Absolutely terrible. The first two movies in this trilogy were amazing, and they threw out all that hard work to pander to the masses, as well as recycle themes of the original Star Wars franchise. Tragic that we will likely never see the directors cut, which I would like to hope was better than what was released."
"Jan 17, 2020",positive,I think that this movie was not as good as it could be jj abrams was given one of the greatest movie franchises of all time and took a massive shit on George lucases work and really i am all the sith and i am all the jedi thats just a cheap rip off of avengers endgames i am inevidable and i am iron man. Also this movie focused more on having emotional music and stuff to make fans think its good more than how much the movie accually made sense. They saw endgames success and tried doing the same think but the only reason endgame is loved is because it has the emotional music that draws fans to it and it has a overall good story and good characters and good acting and the characters accually have a reason to be sad half of the friggin universe died. in this movie thay just say the characters are sad but they dont say why wich makes know one care about the charactors. like how many people went crazy when iron man died well when kylo ren died know one even cared and it made no sense you have to give a reason why to care about the characters and the rise of skywalker does not do that but with end game people grew up with these characters people love these charaters so overall i give the rise of skywalker a 55 percent rating because it was not nessisarly a bad movie but it was not a good star wars movie.
"Jan 17, 2020",positive,My wife and I loved the movie.
"Jan 17, 2020",positive,"Film Review:
Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker.

I was eighteen years old in the early summer of 1977 when Star Wars dropped like a cannonball into our laps. Both of my parents were still alive, and my brother's mental illness had not yet shattered our family and sent my father to his early grave. As a group, we'd watched the last episode of Gunsmoke just two years prior, my Dad's favorite show hands-down for most of its run, only falling off during those jaded Watergate years and our final disillusion with the Vietnam War. Then, suddenly, Star Wars arrived unannounced with its clear water morality—love not hate, courage over fear, loyalty to friends and common cause, and an appeal for simple faith in the universal connected-ness of all things. It felt childlike beside that era's gritty, American cinema verité films like Chinatown (1974), Dog Day Afternoon (1975) and Report to the Commissioner (1975). 

But, oh, how strong that simple appeal! In Star Wars, we found classic characters bound in common struggle against evil at high odds. The Kid, the rogue with the heart-a-gold, the princess—and we reveled in their unlikely success as they did, reassured that faith, courage, loyalty, and a little luck will stand against evil even at terrible odds. Still, Star Wars felt like a simple, rousing tale, but for The Empire Strikes Back (1980), which grounded the Force in family. All at once, my father's disappointment came clear, as did my resentment and confusion over my new role as the family's savior in the aftermath of my brother's affliction, a brother whose every step I followed like a trail blazed through adolescence. The tears I saw flowing on my father's face bewildered, and the things I shouted over my shoulder, and he at me, stung, as I stormed out unaware that I would never see him again.

With The Rise of Skywalker, director J.J. Abrams understands one thing, clearly: forty years have passed since an American generation of young people marveled at those early Star Wars films. He knows that those young people have grown into middle age and that many have confronted life's hard equations: that you cannot go back, that some opportunities never recur, and that you cannot unspeak harsh words you have said to those who have died. The Rise of Skywalker's plot may feel derivative, its conventions rehashed, and its refusal to realize the story lines set out in The Last Jedi (2017) frustrating, but such things are small beer. They barely register next to Princess Leia's final connection to, and Han Solo's recovery of, their lost son; Ben's reawakening to the love within him, and Rey's final thrust to set things right while all the Jedi speak within her. 

For those of us who cannot stand beside the ‘force ghosts' of our dead mothers and fathers and brothers, in conversation, and speak the loving truths we wish we could, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker rings our bell. J.J. Abrams knows well the film he has made for us, bless his heart.

"Jan 17, 2020",positive,I didn’t like that she ended up being a sky walker
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,"For all the Star Wars fans from the seventies and eighties, this is MUST see episode of this adventure. It very gracefully moves us forward to the next generation. Go see the movie"
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,I still think Rey and Ren should have banged one out
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,"Star Wars The Rise of Skywalker is a very good movie, but it has some details that lower its quality, I liked it and I recommend it."
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,"Pleasantly surprised, enjoyed it."
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,"Granted everything that happened in The Last Jedi, I don’t think JJ could’ve done a better job. Still a fun movie to watch, just too much going on. Really feels like 2 movies in one and not in a good way. It causes the story to become really congested and the way events unfold to just be really convenient. However, nailed the ending for the saga as a whole. First watch is too much to process, gonna have to give it at least one or two more views to grasp it."
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,Exciting from beginning to end!  A must-see if you are a Star Wars fan!!!!
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,Great ending to the saga!
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,Good ending to a saga that needed to end.
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,"It was to much like the first Star Wars, so it was to predictable."
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,"I am a fan of Star Wars. All of it. I can look at each movie, see their weaknesses and strengths, take them for what they are, appreciate their worth and move on. I've seen IX 3 times and loved it the most the third time. There are a couple of things that could have been better explained, and there are a couple of abrupt scene changes. It also takes seeing it a few times to follow everything as it's happening. But I think the retcon complaints are ridiculous, and overall, it is a lot of fun and emotionally satisfying. I love it more every time I see it."
"Jan 16, 2020",negative,Too many holes in the story. Story line too fragmented.
"Jan 16, 2020",negative,"These 3 movies need to be forgotten and remade by someone who actually gives a crap about the story and not just money. I will refuse to pay for a Disney product until something that is truly satisfying is done, but I doubt that will even happen. 
STAR WARS IS NOT MARVEL YOU CLOWNS."
"Jan 16, 2020",negative,Not a fan of the new ‘Stars Wars’....👎🏻
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,3.5 I like some characters in this movie but some are annoying af.
"Jan 16, 2020",negative,"Really really terrible, think a lot of the reason is the car crash that was the previous movie. So much meaningless needless plot an awful end to the Star Wars franchise."
"Jan 16, 2020",negative,"Worst Star Wars movie ever. Poor acting actually no acting just a lot of special effects. I hope this is the last of the sequels, couldnt take another one."
"Jan 16, 2020",negative,"Not a fan of this movie, it felt rushed and sloppy! The acting was amazing and potential of this movie was endless. A real missed opportunity that could have been fantastic!"
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,It was really powerful and had a lot riding on it which I think it withheld
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,This is a fitting end to the Skywalker saga. Having the Granddaughter of the Emperor call herself Skywalker was finally the end of the Empire.
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,"It was a worthy ending to the series. It made enough sense, it tied up loose ends best they could, and it was about as good as Return of the Jedi or Revenge of the Sith overall. Star Wars has always been a messy creation (behind the camera and sometimes onscreen as well) and still is, so when they're able to make something where it looks cool, it isn't burdened by pandering to children, you can follow the story, and there's not fifty thousand things all happening simultaneously that jerk your attention around too hard, I'm happy. It's kind of a relief having the main story over. I honestly didn't think that would even happen in my lifetime because before selling to Disney, George claimed he was going to legally 'lock up' the story so nobody could ever touch it, forever and ever, so the new films are really just kind of 'bonus features' to me and when they're good, hey, I lucked out."
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,The experience made the Movie come to life in a whole new way. The sound was perfect and the movie was a brilliant end to the Skywalker Saga. looking forward to the New movies to come.
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,The force is with Us!!
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,"I don't want to give anything away, so all I'll say is...we were not disappointed!!!"
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,I have no idea why the critics bashed this film. It ties in the original storyline nicely. And manages to wrap up all loose ends. Will definitely see again.
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,"The movie was solid, but felt as though it was looking to fix a tonnage of mistakes from the past. It would have been a superb film had the previous two not been such an epic disaster. Also, be prepared for gimmicks tons of them peppered throughout the film. To quote the Liar in Chief, “Sad. Very sad.”"
"Jan 16, 2020",negative,That was painful to watch.
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,"This movie, has it's great moments with what feels like a 4-5 hour movie condensed down into a 2 and a half hour flick. The film starts off with a very quick pace and doesn't entirely drop it throughout the whole movie. There are a few story choices that you will either be indifferent, glad, or angry about. For the most part, I was indifferent to them. There is a fake-out on a character death that made me mad for the what-if death that it could have been. The fake-out is revealed a little too early for the twist to have any feels or relevance. That being said, there are some really good shots and some jaw dropping, crowd pleasing scenes. The arc for Kylo Ren was easily the best part of this movie and the sequel series as a whole. All in all, minus a few decisions and tone issues, the film is incredibly enjoyable as a fun family movie. Would recommend seeing this to see how the Skywalker Saga ends."
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,"I think it wrapped up the series very well.  it could possibly have another movie but some key characters would be missing.   would love to see how the Rey, Poe and Finn stories continue.  very good movie!!"
"Jan 16, 2020",negative,"Well Phantom menace was bad but at least it was an attempt at a Star wars movie. This one is much worse. This is just bad, a bad movie with 0 plot and a specially a bad star wars movie. 
The moment when the massive random people's fleet showed up is horrible. Why did they decide to show up now and not the last time. What changed? Lando? 
Like he is more popular and well known around the galaxy then Lea. And the ghost of Han, he is not even force sensitive. How can he show up. And many more reasons why this is the worst one so far."
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,"It wasn't a great conclusion to an incredible franchise. But it was very entertaining. If you go as a super fan looking for closer, you'll be disappointed. If you're a casual fan and dont nitpick youll be very satisfied. It was by far the best of the last 3 movies."
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,"This was a fine movie. Not terrible, not great either. I definitely don’t agree that this franchise is “dead,” which is a pretty meaningless statement in general. It just needs a better story and to take its time more."
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,"My husband & I loved the movie.  We enjoyed the camaraderie between Rey, Finn, Poe, Chewie & the rest of the game.  The fight scenes are amazing.  We'll be watching it again!"
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,Nicely wrapped a few loose ends. Good ending
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,Stars Wars was an awesome movie. I highly recommend it.
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,Love it all the way through
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,Totally fan service. Confusing to follow and some embarrassingly corny moments. The action was cool but the story was so random and made no sense. 
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,Some things could have been better but overall I enjoyed it and would watch again without complaint.
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,They had the potential to tell a new story & it fell short. I like the Kylo Ren/Ben Solo storyline. The flashback about Rey’s parents was forced and didn’t help the story. Lots of action - little character development
"Jan 16, 2020",negative,"Terrible ending to amazing saga that built a franchise. Star Wars was literally about Anikin Skywalker. Who was an emaculate child created by the force, and his offspring. Disney ended the saga by killing off all of the Skywalker bloodline unnecessarily. Yet, keeping alive the descendant of an enemy and cheaply calling herself Skywalker."
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,I liked it a lot more the second viewing. It’s overwhelming with very fast plot lines so it almost needs a second time to fully absorb it.
"Jan 16, 2020",neutral,Better then Last Jedi but that's not saying much...
"Jan 16, 2020",negative,"It made phantom menace look like Citizen Kane. Had absolutely no meat to it at all, a lazy attempt to make money off the corpse off a long dead franchise."
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,"I thought it was incredible. It’s hard work tying up the sequel trilogy, especially since you had to go off what was done in the last movie, limits your abilities. Lots of action, great emotion, highly enjoyable film. "
"Jan 16, 2020",neutral,Ben Solo having no lines in the second half of the movie and being killed off was a mistake. People can be redeemed without dying. Kylo/Ben was the best character in the trilogy and it is sad he did not get a happy ending and Rey is alone again.
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,"Much better than last Jedi but still left a lot to be desired. If Abrams has done the whole trilogy I think it would’ve make the movie a lot better. Great audio and visuals and a couple great moments, but a lot of plot holes. Far from the best Star Wars movie but light years ahead of the previous movie."
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,"Overall, this movie feels like it's suffering from lack of planning. The story is all over the place, and a lot of the movie's twists and turns don't come across the screen as thought-out plot devices. The movie also suffers from a complete lack of character development, something which I had been hoping to see after the The Last Jedi. The only reason I am giving this movie so high a rating is that I enjoyed the soundtrack, big music nerd here, and it was a fitting farewell for the wonderful Carrie Fisher. This movie felt like it tried to stuff an entire saga into one single movie."
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,Loved it! I love the relationship between Rey and Kylo! Epic battle scenes! Awesome movie!
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,Too Disney ish! Lots of Overacting but overall entertaining.
"Jan 16, 2020",neutral,the movie's pacing is pretty awful. Beginning is way too fast and then the rest of the movie is slow. Only good thing out of this was the action which really kept my attention. but this movie had so much potential especially being the last one but just didn't do it.
"Jan 16, 2020",negative,it ruins the plot of star wars
"Jan 16, 2020",negative,"It was choppy. Script blah. Reverted to old creatures, ships, etc - nothing new. Type face for intro to story wrong font. Music tinny without the Williams "" over the top"" orchestration."
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,"Wont make some hardcore Star Wars fans happy. But, it wasnt hard to watch. For me, it misses some of the joy that the original trilogy had offered."
"Jan 16, 2020",negative,"""It did not suck as bad as I thought it would be."""
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,I didn't dislike anything it was just a bit long but worth it
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,"Loved just about everything about this movie... My only complaint is the ending ""redemption trope"" was a bit too obvious and disappointing..."
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,"I saw so much in relation to the first trilogy (4, 5, 6) that I thought this movie was a rehash. It was ok but nothing to holler home about. I am still confused about her parents. But overall B."
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,Pretty good story line.  Not real crazy about the cast.
"Jan 16, 2020",negative,Looking like an isolated franchise movie is a good movie.  But its existence in addition to incoherent annuls all the first six films.
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,"Action-packed adventure, but incredibly well-paced. Perfect Star Wars movie made for Star Wars fans. If you didn't like it, you aren't a Star Wars fan or you have a dump in your pants. JJ did a great job cleaning up the mess that was the Last Jedi and explaining the story in a way that made sense with the finite amount of time he had. Plus, Babu Frik!"
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,After my usual star wars hype and nostalgia the movie became more kf and eye roll on my second viewing with good moments but many problems
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,Best star wars ever!
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,Best Star Wars episode after Empire Strikes Back and New Hope!  Great way they tied it all together and the throwback at the end.
"Jan 16, 2020",neutral,"Nossa...o que foi isso? Que pastiche de Star Wars, detonaram o que fizeram no anterior...e fizeram uma lambança nesse."
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,We have seen all the Star Wars movies and this proved to be just as good as the others
"Jan 16, 2020",negative,Nope. Just nope. Star Wars is dead.
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,Love it. Big shocker.
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,It was a fun ride. The best of the new star wars trilogy.
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,Good overall movie to conclude the saga.
"Jan 16, 2020",neutral,A poorly written story that was only saved by performance from the actors.  JJ Abrams was less worried about making a solid story that expands the Star Wars Saga and leans more toward rewriting the original trilogy with a different set of characters.
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,"It's a similar formula, good versus evil. There are a few nice twists in the movie. the special effects are great. If you like Star Wars recent movies, you'll like this version."
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,"Good story, great acting."
"Jan 16, 2020",negative,"This was horrible. It had no depth to it and only part that pulled you in at all was the end. However, the end sucked. Palpatine managed to take over the galaxy, survive death, build an entire star fleet (which apparently can't fight), control the galaxy through Snoke and so on. But he is defeated by someone who can't even use a lightsaber properly? Noway. 

Look at the prequels lightsaber battles and look at this series. You can see she did no training for these shots. I was actually mad when I left. I will never go to see Star Wars at the theater again. Long time fan but hanging this up for good."
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,"In and of itself, its a very entertaining Star Wars movie, visually beautiful. However, as part of the trilogy and 9 part Skywalker saga, I was a bit disappointed.  Nothing new, same old Star Wars reveals and battles. Cant wait for what they do next now that they do not have to connect so many dots from previous movies/shows/books etc."
"Jan 16, 2020",negative,"Hated the entire movie. Ruined the franchise. Disney's corporate greed tried to remake the original trilogy and failed miserably. If they had focused on making a good movie, instead of making more money, it might've been actually okay."
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,"This movie brought all the loose ends together as a spectacular American Epic Space-Opera, that will never be forgotten."
"Jan 16, 2020",negative,"Very much a Disney good-feels movie. Essentially there was a hand-wavy conclusion and most of the screen time was wasted on nostalgia or flashy action and force powers, rather than actually building a good story. Also, this move has possibly the worst last line of any movie I've ever seen, given the context of the story."
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,It was AWESOME!  A great way to end the series!
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,Anakin Skywalker never showed up
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,"As an individual movie I found this to be an enjoyable outing in the world of Star Wars. As the final episode in a 9 movie saga I found it a little disjointed. The Force Awakens reignited everyone's love for the franchise, The Last Jedi seemed to go out of it's way to break away from the tone set in TFA and now TROS seems to battle against the stories set up in The Last Jedi which is why many people have very mixed feelings about this movie.

TROS had some intelligent and eye catching action sequences and pulled on the heart strings of nostalgia. Filled with references to the original movies TROS I found struggled to create it's own identity. Unfortunately much of the humour did not land for me and most jokes fell flat on the audience. 

It gave us an ending to the skywalker saga but quite a predictable and unsatisfying one. Poe and Finn were made side characters when they should have been pushed more towards the front."
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,"Really good action sequences. A nice conclusion to the latest arc, and a good showing of someone who may not deserve it but still gets a chance at redemption. It's an interesting take on how human emotions van affect so many lives."
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,Everything was perfect lots of action
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,"Absolutely everything I'd hope for out of a Star Wars movie- fun, exciting, funny, inspiring a great ride from the opening moments, and an incredibly satisfying finale!"
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,"It started a bit choppy and disjointed, but quickly became a satisfying story, finally wrapping up a series I began watching as a 13-year-old when the original premiered.  Highly entertaining."
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,The story tied together loose ends from previous Star Wars stories.
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,if you are a star wars fan you will enjoy it
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,It was a good ending to the initial story line that started in a theater far away.  It brought together all of the different story lines and had several plot twists that I was not expecting.
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,Loved seeing the old cast members and drew a lot of things together
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,"Not the best film of the franchise, or even from the latest trilogy, but I was still entertained. My expectations were pretty low going into it though, as I knew there would be problems with wrapping up the enormous story- and there definitely were a few- but at the end of the day it is a movie, so you have to suspend some disbelief. 

The biggest problem I have with everyone bashing the film is that so much fan energy has been poured into trying to make this a logical world where every small detail clicks into place, it ruins the overall effect and ignores the reality that life is messy, and not all loose ends are always tied up at the end of the day. Without getting into spoiler territory, if you think certain major characters either got too much or not enough attention... well yes, that is what happens in the real life annals of history."
"Jan 16, 2020",negative,What a piece of junk!
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,well done and great movie
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,Just simply amazing maybe im biased but i love every star wars film. From the story to the special effects just go see it.
"Jan 16, 2020",negative,"It's sadly enough a bad movie, but, if you're the type of person that enjoys the spectacle and not at all the storyline, there's a good chance you can definitely, completely enjoy this movie.

Because from a visual side of things, like the previous movies, it's actually really good, it's a joy to look at, it's just not a joy to follow.

Characters are underutilized, powers are finnicky, being used one moment because it's awesome and looks cool, but then in a next moment where that power would be IDEAL, it isn't even considered, to artificially up the tension and stakes.

A good example of this is seeing Ray have difficulty climbing things when previously she was seen just floating around or jumping really far and high with ease.

And there's a lot of moments like that, that simply don't fit, but have been done to either look cool or add tension where there is none.

It was super disappointing, the bad guys and their plan is ridiculous, the good guys and their plans are stupid.

But at least we still have the visuals, hooray."
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,"I thought that it started out a little slow and clunky. There were a lot of moments when I felt that the lines were forced. Once it got rolling it is hard not to get swept up in the drama of the story, but it took a while to get there."
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,It was great and I love it!! I want more and more!!!
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,The length was long. Good mix of action and back stories.
"Jan 16, 2020",negative,There is so much to unpack. Really didnt like the way they just zipped through to an ending. Felt like it should have been 2 movies.
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,New wrap up to the saga.
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,A very entertaining popcorn movie. The visuals are amazing! The story suffers from A lot of disconnected plot points and it could have spent more time focusing on the character development and their individual stories.
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,Very satisfying ending to the saga.
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker concludes the Skywalker Saga with a film that is full of fan service whilst also offering a fast-paced plot that will keep you on the edge of your seat and answers some of the biggest questions that we were left with at the end of The Last Jedi.
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,Good movie...a little disappointed in the ending
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,Some minor plot point holes but overall a good movie
"Jan 16, 2020",negative,It is literally the worst Star Wars movie I have seen. Even the phantom menace had a scenario
"Jan 16, 2020",negative,just kept jumping around all the time. didn't have time to develop the characters or left a lot unanswered and so so many plot holes.
"Jan 16, 2020",negative,"This is a complete failure for me, not only are there many plotholes, but former interesting characters like Finn are almost completely wasted and are just a shell of what they could have been. I also find the return of Palpatine very half-assed and seemingly out of nowhere. and on top of it all, Rey is still the biggest Mary Sue I have ever witnessed in my life."
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,it's not half bad. what I love the most though is the music by John Williams
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,I love it. The best movie I have ever seen.
"Jan 16, 2020",negative,Jon Favreau needs to save Star Wars!
"Jan 16, 2020",negative,"All spectacle, no story."
"Jan 16, 2020",negative,"I really love this movie series, but it's worst film of all the series, worst ending, no ideas, characters are shallow. Star Wars universe has fallen victim to Disney politics, money is everything ..."
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,great movie hope they dont let star wars finish here
"Jan 16, 2020",negative,"It felt like two movies crammed into one, didnt care about the characters except kylo ren, story was all over the place- this movie was a mess."
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,visually a great looking movie.. too rushed though.. not enough character development and to many things that didn't need to happen.. happened. throw that in with some PC culture and you have to.
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,not bad not great but good
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,This moving was amazing!
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,acting was exceptional
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,Absolutely amazing and pleasantly surprised based upon poor critic reviews. I grew up watching the original trilogy in the theaters and have shared my love of Star Wars with my now teenaged son. He’s been watching since he was 3. They blended this final movie with the 8 previous films wonderfully and tied up many loose ends. I teared up multiple times and so did my 50 year old husband! I would like to see it again on a different type of screen. An absolute must see ❤️
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,Culminated the series well. Picked up the slack from the last movie.
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,Critics are wrong once again.
"Jan 16, 2020",negative,"""Somehow the Emperor returned""... Seriously? This movie made me sad to be a Star Wars fan."
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,Amazing final movie. The sheer epic ness of it all is mind boggling. 40 years of memories. Thank you mr. Lucas.
"Jan 16, 2020",negative,"If you want good Star Wars, watch The Mandalorian. 

Felt like the plot for this movie was slapped together in a day so that JJ could focus on using too many special effects. The amount of ""fake-out"" deaths in this movie is just disgusting and disrespectful to anyone with a Brain Stem."
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,"Tied together all the episodes, felt good to get closure"
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,5 stars for Star Wars 
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,Very good finale movie for the Star Wars series.
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,"Loved it, one of the best new star war movies"
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,It was a good story to finally wrap everything up after 42 years!
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,Kept interest from beginning to end.
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,"After hearing about the fans disappointments, I was pleasantly surprised with the final Star Wars film. Some parts of the story were far fletched and not even close to being realistic, however...this is Star Wars...where nothing realistic can be expected."
"Jan 16, 2020",negative,"Poor screen writing. Besides the good CG, probably the worst high budget movie I have ever seen."
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,loved it a wonderful ending to the epic saga
"Jan 16, 2020",negative,The movie was incoherent.
"Jan 16, 2020",negative,"Worst Star Wars film ever. For a movie that had total support and (relatively) unlimited funds, (relatively) unlimited resources (except of course for the tragic death of Carrie Fisher)--- there was no excuse for such a mess. There are some neat ideas in it, but if there is a saving grace, it's that the final chapter of Disney's Avengers: Endgame was fantastic as an example as to how to close out a franchise. On the flip side, compared to root canal, this film was better than root canal. Hence, better to schedule watching this film after a dental appointment."
"Jan 16, 2020",negative,I'm a Star Trek fan now.
"Jan 16, 2020",negative,Absolute waste of money damn that was really something
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,not as good as the first ones like return of the Jedi.
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,"Critics are imbeciles, I have watched this movie three times in theaters and loved it!!!! Lots of nostalgia and great lightsaber scenes! 9/10"
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,The Star War series continues to provide high quality movies with good casting and great stories.  I hope there will be more episodes.
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,A great way to end the saga.  Tried to tie everything up and for the most part didi.
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,Great movie to add to the series !!! Lots of action !!
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,Very good ending to the saga.
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,"Better than expected!  After the last film I did not have high expectations, but I was pleasantly surprised by how well JJ Abrams tied the series together."
"Jan 16, 2020",negative,Man this was not very good at all.
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,This is the final installment of the classic Star Wars series. It ended the best possible way you could of done it.
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,Best of the latest trilogy but it still could have been so much more.
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,The plot felt rushed at first but everything turned into a masterful beautiful ending worthy of the Skywalker Saga
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,Thoroughly enjoyed the movie!
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,The chairs are tooooooo comfy
"Jan 16, 2020",negative,If the point of the movie was to make absolutely no sense then it was a good movie.
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,A great ending to a whole new beginning. I really loved it
"Jan 16, 2020",neutral,Story jumps around a lot and tries to please fans way past an acceptable extent. The only thing saving this movie is the fantastic visuals.
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,"Clever, funny and exciting. A worthy conclusion to a story that no one wanted to end. Rather moving moments, familiar faces, (and voices). "
"Jan 16, 2020",neutral,"The lack of originality seems to be the director's resented mark, this particular movie seems to be a jumble of stuff drawn from previous films in this saga. The adventure is good, but the narrative is shallow."
"Jan 16, 2020",negative,This movie is not Star Wars it more like female Rey is the greatest EVER!!!! No plot just running around doing nothing.
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,This movie closed a lot of open story lines in the Star Wars movies but keeps open option for further films... fingers crossed.
"Jan 16, 2020",negative,Couldn’t wait for it to end.
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,glad I saw it on the big screen.
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,"This might as well have been a Star Wars™️ Satire, as the plot feels random and laughable. I had fun wondering how choices were made in the making of this movie. "
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,"I'm not picky when I comes to Star Wars, and I thought this was a powerful and moving film where the heroine becomes more established in her Jedi identity, and we suspect that others (Fin?) may also be discovering theirs."
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,Awesome!!!! Great ending to the franchise
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,Never disappoints!!!
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,It was great to see all the original characters on the same screen or at least hear their voices.
"Jan 16, 2020",negative,So far the worse Star Wars movie . Very disappointed
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,"I it was ok, and I am a Star War fan."
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,So good I saw it twice and STILL cried. Amazing movie
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,Great movie!!! I can’t believe how dope this was from start to end!
"Jan 16, 2020",negative,the worst star wars movie ever
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,I really liked it. Seen them all and I cried because of it came full circle. You have to see it for sure if you are a Star Wars fan!
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,Exactly what I expected it to be ... GREAT!
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,Relatable characters.
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,My favorite in the the Star Wars sequel trilogy!!! Loved
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,"Loved it.  It comes back full circle...well more like a indirect roundabout scribble that ends storyline where it began & I liked that.  Definitely could have gone in many diff directions.  I weeped at how & why Leia dies, nice touch, simple but powerful.  I was surprised because I didn't know anything about it ( I didn't watch trailer or read anything).  Can't please everyone...or even most people."
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,Well it was kinda predictable but still was amazing movie far as dislikes I got none!!
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,"Liked it. Great wrap up to the series, don’t agree with the haters. It was fun. Visually stunning."
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,Great plot!  Fantastic cast.  Sad that most of the characters from will not return.  Hope they will make more movies.
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,"This movie excels at almost everything 'The Last Jedi' did not. I will say that the movie was a bit too fast paced and got too deep into the action too fast. But, the movie ended the Star Wars saga on a wonderful note.
I especially loved the ending and how the yellow colored lightsaber into Star Wars Canon. The ending was probably my favorite part in the entire saga. My least favorite part of the movie is definitely how it just throws so much at you at a single time. Like how the movie just gets right into the action with Kylo Ren finding Palpatine right at the beginning."
"Jan 16, 2020",negative,"Should have been titled Rise of Garbage.  Horrible in all facets... rushed beginning, weird force powers, weird lineages to give the movie a meaning a purpose.   It's sad when 7, 8 & 9 make 1, 2 & 3 better movies."
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,"Generally good. Lots of action. Left many open questions. Not a smooth transition from prior movies. Scenes seem chopped up, no smooth transition between scenes."
"Jan 16, 2020",negative,"It is impressive that the new trilogy of films managed to be worse than the prequels. This third and final piece of the trilogy is a mess. It has redundant characters, bizarre scenes that hold no relevance to the plot, terrible inconsistencies with the rest of the franchise, and the pacing of someone speaking really quickly as they confess to messing up in the hopes that people wont notice. 

Pros: 
- The Actors are all professionals and have clearly put in a solid effort into their roles, giving good performances despite the plot putting them in odd positions and with poor motivations. 
- The cinematography is good, as you can tell time, budget and effort were spent making things look good. 
- Sometimes there's a nice sound effect.

Cons: 
- Almost everything else. Literally from the very moment the film begins, with scrolling text, the plot makes leaps on bounds over logic to arrive at whatever destination it wants. This continues throughout the entire movie. The characters don't drive the plot in this movie, nor does reason. 
- I laughed out loud a lot during this movie, but it was never at any of the many jokes that all fell flat. It was at the hilarious twists and turns this movie makes, characteristic of a poorly thought out fan film rather than a serious production."
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,good movie for anyone who has seen the films episode 1-4 but wouldn't suggest to anyone new to the franchise
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,"it was a good action movie, but for star wars fans it left a lot to be desired.  and the plot holes you could fly a death star through."
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,"Too long, too many battles"
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,This is a great action movie. I loved it.
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,Loved the story line and action
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,"The critics to the movie really turned me off, so I just saw it today. 
It was a very good surprise, not the best of the saga but i think it is underrated, it saves the mess left from the previous one!"
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,Nicely done with some new and great old characters.
"Jan 16, 2020",negative,Disjointed...hard to follow
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,"Movie was great, a lot of action and emotion.  Wish the movie was a bit longer as there were times that a lot was going on at one time."
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,"Star Wars, The Rise of Skywalker is messy in places, has some questionable story-telling choices, and takes a slightly odd pace, but for a loyal Star Wars fan, the film excels in providing a satisfying, emotional, and overall utterly enjoyable conclusion to an iconic saga."
"Jan 16, 2020",negative,"Jesus Christ... I don't know where to begin, so I won't."
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,"after hearing a lot about how some people liked or dislike the movie, sometimes I believe you need to see the movie for yourself. I felt that the movie was well put together and as always you can not compare the movie when other people not the original author is not in full control. besides if the original person has anything to say then they may not be able to air it if he disapprove it other than that I thought this was well done"
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,Superb. Absolutely loved it
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,Enjoyed it! So glad I saw it on the big screen.
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,"This movie jumps right into the action and doesn't slow down. Loved the visuals, the dialogue, and the story-line. The film had a lot of neat surprises I didn't see coming and some interesting cliffhangers. I'm satisfied with the ending of this trilogy. Out of the final 3 films (7,8, and 9) - I felt the best leaving the theater after ""The Force Awakens""."
"Jan 16, 2020",positive,"This movie is so unbelievably bad that it actually goes all the way back around and becomes ironically good.
All of it is dumb and makes no sense whatsoever, but at this point I don't even care. I'm just glad this trilogy is over."
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,"Being a lifelong fan of Star Wars, i was well pleased with the last of the nine. I was also happy that they found a way to keep Carrie Fisher as Leia. It wouldnt be the same without her."
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,"It was Martin Scorsese who said for MCU movies, that they're not really movies but theme parks. The same can be said for The Rise of Skywalker. When The Force Awakens appeared I really liked it. I thought JJ did a solid job, although it still felt like a reboot - there comes a time when there are just one too many planet destroyers in a ""galaxy far far away"". When Rian Johnson took over, I understand he tried to take a new direction, but it felt like he carefully scrutinized every fan theory available online and gave the fans the middle finger. Don't get me wrong, as a standalone movie, The Last Jedi would have been awesome, but this was part of a trilogy. I expected at least some synergy between JJ and Rian. I'm certain these guys were at each other's throats and the fans were paying the price.  In the end, this was expected. JJ did try to please the fans and ""fix"" what Rian has done. It did neither... The movie is a mess. In many instances, it felt pathetic. The sequel trilogy should remain a lesson on how not to deal with a major franchise. I gave the movie three stars, as it is watchable, just don't expect too much. It didn't fail to the point that the franchise is beyond salvation (thank GOD for that and Mandalorian too), but it's walking on very thin line at the moment."
"Jan 15, 2020",negative,"Es mala, admitamoslo, pero mucho mejor que la anterior que destruyó la Saga,"
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,Loved the reprise of the original musical themes the humor the diversity themes & the friendships forged in adversity.
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,"This was a great film. By far the best out of this recent trilogy and it goes without saying that its surpassed Lucass Episodes I, II & III. 
There was plenty of action this time around, with wonderful special effects, and a nice amount of nostalgic throwbacks. Overall it was a great film and a wonderful way to cap off the Star Wars main story."
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,It’s been like two weeks and I still don’t know how I feel about this movie.
"Jan 15, 2020",negative,The movie was garbage. It bounced around like a ping pong ball on crack. Left more unanswered questions than it answered. It failed on many levels. The movie sickens me.
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,I think it was one of the best ways to end the Skywalker saga
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,"Pretty good. Finally gives a story to Poe and Finn after ignoring them both in the second film. Nicely wraps up Rey and Ben. Flawed simply because Carrie Fisher died, but other than that, a solid movie."
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,"JJ ABRAMS did the Star Wars Saga great justice in this movie.... laughed, cried and cheered throughout the film. excellent movie!!"
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,"Great movie, great effects!"
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,It’s the best Star Wars movie but I rather see the mandalorion
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,"A fantastic film alone, a great conclusion to the Sequel Trilogy and a satisfying ending to the Skywalker Saga."
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,Liked the whole movie. Sorry it ended but it did leave it open I guess we will see.
"Jan 15, 2020",neutral,Just very bland. There were a few bits I really enjoyed but ultimately I felt nothing and occasionally quite bored.
"Jan 15, 2020",negative,"Can't believe this film has the audience score it has, it all seemed so messy to me, I just wanted it to stop so I could get out of the cinema, way too much pointless action I felt almost claustrophobic watching, a sensation I've never had watching a film."
"Jan 15, 2020",negative,Too rushed and too many potholes.
"Jan 15, 2020",negative,"So much about this movie was simply underwhelming.  It really did seem like they were trying to fit 2 films into one.  Not to mention this movie is nothing more than a lot of fetch quests that are magically fullfilled.

We need a ship!  A ship appears.
We need a map!  A map appears.
We need a key!  A key appears."
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,"Adam Driver is amazing as always. However, the movie was poorly written. It was cheesy and they completely cheaped out on the ending. They could've done so much more. It seemed as if the writers were scared to mess up, which they completely did. sad."
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,Awesome movie. Loved it.
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,First film I saw in 4DX and it might be the last.  Getting water splashed on your face and gust of winds do not seem like something extra to pay for when you watch a film.  Over all the film was what I would have expected not being a huge Star Wars fan.  I however enjoyed seeing Carrie Fisher brought back to life for one last film. For the big Star War fans I am sure they will love the final of this trilogy.
"Jan 15, 2020",negative,WEAK AND FRUSTRATING - this actually with the other 2 prior poor movies destroy the original Star Wars movies - THIS SHOULD NOT BE CANON !! Personally I won't expect it !
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,"I enjoyed the movie tremendously, it keep me involved and excited. wish the last segment would have had all the Skywalker family show themselves to Ray."
"Jan 15, 2020",negative,"So much has already been said about this movie. Ultimately, it's better than Last Jedi because at least it tries to be a Star Wars movie, but it's not even really a movie. It's really just a bunch of cut scenes from what feels like a good videogame. This whole last trilogy has been such an abyssmal dissapointment."
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,It’s a SciFi/Fantasy movie and it delivered on all counts for me. I don’t go to see an action movie to watch Academy Award level acting.
"Jan 15, 2020",negative,"This is not Star Wars, they’ve taken a diamond and turned it into talc."
"Jan 15, 2020",negative,"Took my 12 year old son to this last night.  He enjoyed it - I did not.  He did spot the many, many gaping plotholes in it, but said the explosions and action made up for it.  Sorry, that's not enough for me - the story made no sense and was just the characters going from one McGuffin to the next, often stumbling across the next plot point by chance, and with not a moment for any story to breath.  
It was a huge, shambling mess of a film in typical J J Abrams style.  If you like that, you like that - if you expect to connect emotionally with characters beyond their nostalgic value, and care about events, there is very little here for you.  If you expect your villans to have plans that make any sense whatsoever, forget about it.  If you like witty amusing dialogue, again, very little in that respect here.
I'd say on the whole it was slightly better than The Last Jedi - at least I didn't feel like I wanted my time and money back when I left the theatre - but what a disappointing wasted opportunity this whole trilogy has been."
"Jan 15, 2020",negative,liked the strong female heroine. not a star wars fan. movie was too long jumped from place to place with no explanation how they got out of previous . 9 yer old enjoyed it
"Jan 15, 2020",negative,"Definitely not a good movie, but it did keep me engaged. I don't like the implications this has on the greater Skywalker story, and I think it was given a bad hand with what The Last Jedi left. Overall, wait till it comes out on Disney+ and watch it on your friend's account."
"Jan 15, 2020",negative,"It ran fearfully from any opportunity to be philosophical or artistic in the way the original trilogy was. It decided instead just to be a cheap knock-off action flick that used all the names and faces from Star Wars, but brought none of the heart. Every obstacle was easily overcome. The major character turns were sub plots instead of main plots. The good guys didn't need to do anything special, learn anything special or confront anything deep within themselves to succeed. They just had to show up, and the plot delivered them the power to snap their fingers and solve every problem. 

It was lame, boring and sad."
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,I thought it did a great job with wrapping up the movies
"Jan 15, 2020",negative,Complete waste of time
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,brought a certain amount of closure to long standing conflicts.
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,Probably the best one from this last trilogy! Can't wait to see it again. 😃
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,"It was better than the Last Jedi, but that's not much of a compliment as I really disliked that movie.  Too much is left unexplained with the intention that we have to go out and buy a book to figure out why Palpatine is back.  If you heard complaints that this felt like a video game fetch quest, those complaints are true.  Even the First Order's motives for doing anything just don't make much sense.  Why go around blowing up planets all the time?  It's not like you'll have anything to rule over if you keep doing it.  Granted, I can't put all of the blame on JJ as I feel like he was left with a pile of garbage and told to make something good out of it.  In the end, this is the weakest of the Star Wars trilogies.  It was only propped up by nostalgia and even that was dumped on more often than not."
"Jan 15, 2020",negative,"made no sense , as a popcorn movie and if you just dont care about the Lucas movies then you may like it but if you like Luke Skywalker your going to hate this movie with a passion, i found this movie very boring and made no sense."
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,"The action was epic and felt meaningful. The story was great and had a real, relatable message about how the enemy tries to make to feel like you're all alone when you're not. Hit deep. Great to see there was way less political agendas. The story of hope, love, friendship and redemption with a plot twist. Favourite star wars movie so far."
"Jan 15, 2020",negative,It was a great comedy
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,"Second viewing.  Loved it as a part three.  It continues the story well, leaves hope for a new set of films. Our family is very appreciative of the sci fi fantasy world the whole genre created and continues to create."
"Jan 15, 2020",negative,"garbage, bland as hell mess"
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,I liked it! excellent film to put a close to the Star Wars Saga
"Jan 15, 2020",negative,The RISE of Skywalker?? The 2 last remaining Skywalkers DIE!! There is NO Skywalker left. And that's just the problem with the title....
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,Don't listen to the haters. This is the best Star Wars movie to come from the sequel trilogy. I have absolutely love it.
"Jan 15, 2020",negative,"What I wanted and expected from this movie was a reasonably meaningful conclusion to the sequel trilogy. My expectation was… not met! The meaning in The Last Jedi was ignored and thus TROS feels disjointed from the other films and delivers an ending that doesn't follow through on the emotional arcs that were driven so far. Rey's defining struggle was to find purpose and identity despite not knowing her family. Her being a no one who didn't inherit her powers was fresh and deeply resonant, but all that was replaced with a resused reveal (your'e related to the villain!) that removes meaning from the character and brings nothing new. The movie is also so crowded with plot that most characters don't get any actual payoff for their respective journeys. It looks good though, and the performances were great!"
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,I need more!!! This was awesome
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,Great movie. And I love they were able to include Carrie Fisher!!!!
"Jan 15, 2020",negative,"Another creative drought of a film with the sole purpose to annoy as few people as possible and make as much money as possible. No character arcs, poor pacing, bad writing and blatant retcons which cheapen the victories of the previous films."
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,I particularly liked the way the loose ends were tied up.
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,Absolutely amazing all the haters gonna hate but at the end of the day disney wins guys 😘
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,Good wrap up of the third trilogy. Some good plot twists and great action scenes.
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,Very Good way better than the last Jedi.
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,"I admit that the first time I saw this, I walked out of the theater disappointed. But after watching it again, I really got to enjoy it. Its action-packed, full of emotion and a really fun movie. A satisfied ending to this legendary saga!"
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,Brought some closure to some areas of Star Wars.  Loved and hated the ending.
"Jan 15, 2020",negative,"Final nail in the coffin. Worst of the three movies not because it was cheap or stupid. But because they just backed down, dumbed everything down and created a new definition for mediocrity. While Last Jedi had its faults, it tried something else, it tried changing the formula but as expected Mr. Abrams along with Diseny execs used their power to destroy decent story."
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,"While the movie was entertaining, it didn’t meet My expectation for a Star Wars movie. For me it was the best of movies 7-9, but not near as good as the first 6."
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,"Was nice they tried up some loose ends, but the villains for this one seemed to come out of no where. Makes it seem like the second movie wasnt in the same story line."
"Jan 15, 2020",negative,"Lacked any sort of imagination... more of everything (running, fighting, flying, shooting, ships, planets) doesn’t necessarily translate into a more compelling narrative.  In the end, I felt it necessary to see how the Skywalker saga finished. The finale was about as satisfying as a small bag of cold popcorn drizzled with “butter flavored” topping."
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,I liked the movie very much. I liked the scene where Rey  and Kylo Ren are fighting on the remnants of the death star with the rolling waves in the backround.
"Jan 15, 2020",negative,absolutely worthless excuse for a movie
"Jan 15, 2020",negative,"That happened.
SW is ruined. I grew up with it, and now I never want to see it again. Thanks, Disney."
"Jan 15, 2020",negative,What a  piece of garbage. Every trop from prior one's was somehow wedged into the so called story line. Even the Ewoks. We even have dead people appearing.  Awful way to end the acr but maybe fitting as after this no one will ever want to see another.
"Jan 15, 2020",negative,"So out of this galaxy, missing too much to be a good movie."
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,Best Star Wars Movie EVER!
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,"Excellent movie, old school Star Wars"
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,Very entertaining but a little long.
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,Haters are gonna hate. This was wonderful with a great plot. Some dialogue was a little weak in a few spots but overall a terrific movie. Adam Driver gets better and better every time I see him.
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,The force is strong in this one.
"Jan 15, 2020",negative,This movie is an insult to almost anyone's intelligence.
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,Very enjoyable romp.  Great special effects.  Sad to know its the end of a saga :(
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,"Good movie, action and sfx. Go see for yourself."
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,Wonderful close to this series
"Jan 15, 2020",negative,"rushed, forced, and unimaginative ending to the skywalker saga."
"Jan 15, 2020",negative,I love me some Star Wars  but this left me confused at the End. Wondering what just happened.
"Jan 15, 2020",negative,"Junk, complete waste of time"
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,"Ending, left us wondering the future!"
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,"This definitely makes up for the abysmal ""Last Jedi"".  But it's still just an okay movie with so many plot holes, that I don't even want to try and go through them because I will probably end up hating this movie.  It does leave the Star Wars fan with some satisfying closure to this 9 movie saga.   Ultimately, the only films that are really good are the original 3 (Episodes IV, V & VI)"
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,"Really enjoyable!  Couple of changes in the story I didn’t expect, but overall it was an awesome movie."
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,The story line progressed and ended well.  There was quite a bit of action. The ending was left such that there could be additional sequels.
"Jan 15, 2020",neutral,"Proved once again that absolutely nothing original will ever occur in the Star Wars Universe under Disney.  But, the music was great, it had its moments, and the actors were good, especially since all they had was table scraps of material from the pre-Disney era to work with."
"Jan 15, 2020",neutral,Storyline absolutely‘s blew. One want to believe the story but the characters did not convinced me. 
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,Great cap to the sequel trilogy. The main characters Story arcs are completed with promise for a hopeful future. I hope to see this cast again soon.
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,"The movie was far much better than The Last Jedi but Rey is still the bs main character who pulls new force powers out of nowhere, ruining the death of Anakin's mother."
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,"I was pleased with how Rey’s storyline was wrapped up, but there were too many unexplained issues still.  Also, there was one scene towards the end that was completely ridiculous.  For casual Star Wars fans like myself, it was worth seeing in the theater."
"Jan 15, 2020",negative,"Beautifully shot claptrap.  A mess of quick scenes for the first 45 minutes.  It's like two movies had a collision and this is the result - a tangled mess of scenes and ideas.  Having said that, Daisy Ridley and Adam driver carry this movie really well.   It's not the actors fault.  The script is so overstuffed that it must have cost 10x more than what it needed to.  Has JJ Abrams never heard of script editing?  The plot is hopelessly wonky, a tired retread of Return of the Jedi, but then Abrams is not a creative person.  He's knows where to put a camera but has zero creativity in terms of storytelling so his stuff is nicely shot gibberish.  Totally unfulfilling as a movie.  It's a McFilm."
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,"We all really enjoyed it, huge fans of anything Star Wars, definitely the best of the 3. So much going on that it didn't seem almost 2 1/2 hours at all."
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,"It was a bit too ""Disney"""
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,"Puts a bow on the Skywalker Saga nicely. It's beautiful and well shot. Lots of action (first half is a smidge slow, but it makes up for it).  It has moving, emotional moments, light saber battles, and star ship dog fights. What more could you want from a Star Wars movie. Go watch it and enjoy yourself!"
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,"I think we've learned that all Star Wars movies are fun to watch regardless of quality, including this one. The fan service here is top notch. However, as part of a trilogy this movie is very confusing. It abandons almost everything the Last Jedi brought to the trilogy, likely because that film received luke-warm audience reactions. This makes this feel like a standalone film rather than part of a trilogy. The plot of this film could be split up into a trilogy on its own since it pulls almost nothing from the previous two, and that creates a lot of confusion throughout the movie. Palpatine's return is interesting, if not cliche, but the film doesn't have time to stop and explain the parts of this story that are really going to eat at you once you've left the theater. The Emperor, the main antagonist of the entire main series, having a son is revealed in such an ""oh by the way"" manner that you could almost miss it. This isn't explained in any more detail and should be a much bigger deal than it is made to be. Just throwing it in as a minor detail makes it feel unimportant and also makes it clear that this is just trying to quickly cut what Rey was told in The Last Jedi and paste the ""you're actually related to this powerful bad guy"" trope from the original trilogy. His return is explained in the same ""oh by the way"" manner and this keeps these things from feeling real. You have to be able to suspend disbelief in these kinds of movies, but when things are thrown into the plot in this fashion it's clear that it's scuffed writing that's responsible for this and that takes you out of the experience completely. I understand much this was an attempt to undo what was done in The Last Jedi, but deviating from the core plot of the film that this one is supposed to conclude creates a broken story. This could have continued to expand upon those plot lines and made them more satisfying rather than trying to delete them, potentially leaving both films in a much better light. That film was the only one in the trilogy to try something new, and not trying to work with what it did makes this one feel like it doesn't belong."
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,"lots of action, great story, fast pasted and entertaining."
"Jan 15, 2020",negative,rushed nonsense. they took everything that made starwars great and ran it into the ground
"Jan 15, 2020",negative,Sad ending for our beloved saga
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,A satisfying conclusion to the Skywalker saga.
"Jan 15, 2020",negative,"The first 25 minutes of this movie will leave your head spinning as it attempts to do what the second movie in the trilogy completely failed at: Setting up a final and epic conclusion to arguably the worlds most recognizable and beloved franchise. 

Between quickly re-introducing a villain that was used in both the prequels and original films, suddenly re-opening the issue of Ray's parentage, and beginning the final arc of Kylo Ren's story your left a bit overwhelmed 30 minutes into the film.

When the film does finally settle into a rhythm, it feels as though the rules are completely thrown out the window. Suddenly, the force has no limits, Kylo & Ren are more powerful than any of their predecessors and everyone else is just along for the ride with no real stakes that they can influence. 

Ultimately, all the reveals in this movie feel hackneyed. The movie resembles a Star Wars film for the middle hour and then in the final climatic scene goes completely off the rails.

The powers of life, death, and the ability of a single individual to destroy an entire army are thrown in with minutes counting down in the movie. Kylo Ren's Arc is the only story that felt complete and satisfying. No one else gets a real conclusion after nearly 9 hours of run time. 

Overall,  this will be a spot in the timeline in Disney's generation spanning franchise that has only just begun. Because remember, this was all a long time ago in a galaxy far far away.....Disney has plenty of years to fill until we're in a galaxy far away today."
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,The ending was not good.
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,All I can say is that it was better than the last Jedi.
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,"Good recovery from a less then stellar Episode 8. This was a good movie, overall."
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,"Went to see in 4dx which really added to the on screen action, liked the darker tone"
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,"The plot line wasn’t as focused as I would have liked, and the absence of Carrie Fisher was painfully felt in that regard. The cinematography and performances of the cast were well played. I guess I’m in the minority but I liked the ending. Apart from some plot inconsistencies, it was a great movie and conclusion to a story that’s been a part of my entire adult life since high school. Farewell old friends."
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,"The movie was some and good close to a new entry into the saga. Yes could have been better, but it returned to what mad Star Wars, Star Wars. The best part was how with the version of Rey looked badass, but I am biased as I at nothing but within SWTOR."
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,"I thought it was the best one of this trilogy, hands down.  The storyline was fantastic.  Superb ending to the Skywalker Saga.  Don’t listen to the haters.  Go see it."
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,"The critics can fuck off. As a lifelong Star Wars fan, I loved this movie."
"Jan 15, 2020",negative,A shameful disgrace.
"Jan 15, 2020",negative,"Disney, I hate you for doing this movie so dirty the predictability, the terrible attempts at making the audience laugh, I would like a refund for your exploitation of an original where you bought the story to resell it back to us. Disappointed"
"Jan 15, 2020",negative,Not the best worst of this triology
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,I liked it a lot. Thought it had a pretty good conclusion to the trilogy.
"Jan 15, 2020",negative,"This movie (along with the rest of the trilogy) is a disgrace. I have long been a Star Wars apologist, supporting them through the ups and downs. But Disney messed this up real good. It is clear that the movies were separate stories without knowledge of what happens next. All made up on the spot. I've seen better improv shows. 

The revival of Palpatine was a massive slap in the face to what the original trilogy stood for. Everything they did was put to absolute waste.

Thanks, Disney. And thanks to the Directors that made a story like a bunch of kids playing pretend and not agreeing with anything."
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,You can tell Disney attempted to fix it  Unfortunately they still failed to do so.
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,"First off, I enjoyed it. I think it was a clunky love letter to fans. As a movie, not so good. However, there were so many individual scenes that made my Star Wars fan heart happy. They showed Leia's force training, made reference to KOTOR, explained a lot of things from the original trilogy by deepening the lore, and followed through on a lot promises they've been subtly making throughout the sequel trilogy. Something the new trilogy has consistently delivered on is the relationship with Rey and Kylo. Kylo's transformation being particularly well done. I enjoyed watching it once, and will likely buy it someday."
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,Not a perfect movie by any means but closes one of the greatest sagas in a fitting way. A definite watch if you have enjoyed the Skywalker saga.
"Jan 15, 2020",neutral,"Meh, another C movie from a C director. Abrams has no originality, he just delivers fan service from previously successful franchises. This is exactly the movie you'd expect from someone that spends all of his time making up ideas, but then doesn't think about how the realistically develop any of them, so he slaps something passable together at the last minute."
"Jan 15, 2020",negative,"So many plot holes you could fly a death star through.  Bringing the Emperor back invalidates everything Anakin sacrificed.  Horrible end to a screwed up, jumbled, mess of a trilogy."
"Jan 15, 2020",negative,"The actors in this film gave it their all and I want to say that right off the bat. I feel the cast and crew did everything they could with what they had. This film, however, was awful. With a series like this there was so much to pull from and It's clear that studio interference destroyed this franchise like the death star taking out planets. This is the point where we part ways starwars. I hope one day you see the light and escape the shadow of the mouse."
"Jan 15, 2020",negative,"Not a very good movie. We've seen similar digitally enhanced special effects in previous Star Wars films. They've become tedious. Actors frequently mumble their lines and I more than once asked my wife sitting beside me, ""What did he/she say?"" None of the plot themes were original or surprising. For example, Rey's being a granddaughter of Palpatine was just a reworked version of Luke Skywalker's being the son of Darth Vader. The Last Jedi was a better film with some actual depth and I regard The Last Jedi as being the true final movie in the Star Wars series."
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,"I thought it was better than the previous episodes.  I DID like Rogue One a lot. I really liked how they wove the Rey's and Kylo Ren's paths/stories not quite disconnected from the ""big"" story."
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,"A lackluster and over-packed but adequate finish to an operatic and concocted saga. While the storyline is nothing to speak of, many satisfying moments were contained nonetheless."
"Jan 15, 2020",negative,"Made an account specifically to give this movie the lowest score possible. It's the most back peddling, predictable, and disappointing Star Wars movie I've ever seen. I think the only reason people seem to like this movie, is how much they had to rely on nostalgia."
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,"As a Standalone movie, it would be 4, even 5 stars.  As it is, glaring plot holes that don't mesh with the rest of their established reality."
"Jan 15, 2020",negative,"this movie is not very good. while it has its moments that I really enjoyed, the entire story falls flat in a lot of places for me, especially with the handling of Rey's backstory. My main gripe with the film though, is its continuous devaluing of TLJ, taking everything about that movie and grinding it away into the most fan service film of the year. What about Broom Kid? That sentence completely sums up my feelings on TROS, because everything that TLJ stood for is stripped away into a little of the road experience, instead of creating interesting tension with new ideas, we get tired rehashes of better movies in the saga."
"Jan 15, 2020",negative,The Sequel trilogy has become so disjointed that it's become pretty tough to go back and watch. This film does not help the tonal continuity. I don't see it as a continuation of the series but rather a fixing of the last film which ruins both films. Utterly disappointed at what Disney has done with what was seemingly the most important part of Star Wars for this generation.
"Jan 15, 2020",negative,"If you like any ounce of this movie, you are obviously not a Star Wars fan. Everyone I have encountered who've liked or loved this, actually have never seen the older films. New fans are posers. If you haven't figured it out, Disney only cares about money."
"Jan 15, 2020",negative,JJ Abrams doesn't have a creative bone in his body. He just leans on the original trilogy for every idea.
"Jan 15, 2020",neutral,eh. what a mess. only because i like the overall shtick could i care about this random toss of references and characters. the story logic is deeply flawed. but heh. 
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,"Though nothing new is brought to this final installment in the sequel trilogy and bringing in more holes, it's hard to admit the entertainment value of this installment brings old and new fans a fun time with action and special effects. Though The Rise Of Skywalker is heavily flawed with these problems, it is a somewhat decent way to end the series or perhaps bring on a new one in the far future~"
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,"I was able to overlook the film's problems through the emotions that were drawn out of me. Even though I enjoyed Ep8, some course correction was applied and the Emperor as villain was as good as any other."
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,"Decent as anyone would expect not a perfect ending to a 4 decade saga but an average movie on its own, fans would be delighted for what they have got but as a moviegoer it would not seem pretty astonishing"
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,"Absolutely loved this movie. Obviously trying to encompass a whole saga has its difficulties, and everyone is going to have their critiques, but I think the movie got the job done. It’s a story about good versus evil and how hope prevails against fear. The effects were second to none. The acting, writing, and screen play was great. There was some scenes with Carrie Fisher that seemed forced (no pun intended), but they did a nice job with implementing her role creatively. I’m glad she was in this film. Many reviews I read complained about how this was a Nostalgia flick, well hello, it’s the last movie, what else would you expect? I highly recommend this film, and I’m a good movie watcher."
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,Went with a friend who wanted to see it. I liked it
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,A few questions left unanswered but I still enjoyed the movie.
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,"If you delve too deeply into Star Wars canon and try to overthink all the plot intricacies and character arcs, this movie will be ruined for you. If you just relax, suspend your disbelief a little and enjoy the ride you will have fun watching this. It's visually stunning, quite dark and scary at moments and moves at a breakneck speed (something I believe benefits a Star Wars movie, contrary to popular belief). I'm just glad I lived to see the the conclusion of such an epic series that spanned 42 years, something that will probably not happen again in our lifetimes. Was it perfect? No. Was it worth seeing? Definitely. And IMO it was a perfectly acceptable conclusion."
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,Great movie ! Amazing effects !!!
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,I did not like that they killed off kylo. was hoping to see more of him and the changes he decided to make.
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,"Great movie. To all the critics that are rating this bad, you can't satisfy them. The Star Wars franchise has older fans and then die hard fans who envision the movie a certain way. Those who have an envision for it are the ones down voting. This movie has everything, action, great story line,  breaking gender roles, and a good ending. If you love star wars, go see this."
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,The main characters in the cast are not strong enough to support the movie like the originals did .
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,"This Star Wars movie was way better than the last two. I enjoyed every second of this one. Perfect ending, extended fight scenes. Muah!"
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,"Satisfying ending to the sky walker saga, surprisingly dark!"
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,great movie enjoyed every bit of it 🙂
"Jan 15, 2020",negative,"Disney messed up the sequel trilogy by rushing to production with no overarching story arc and treating the movies like batons to be passed from one director to the next. This movie makes it perfectly clear that there was no plan whatsoever going in to this trilogy. Disney treated it like some high-budget action serial like Fast and the Furious. Rian Johnson wrote them into a corner and JJ Abrams did an admirable job considering the state of what he was handed. The missed opportunities were legion. Disney could have made something incredible, but they squandered it in a rush to make a quick buck. I've been a fan since 1977, but I no longer feel connected to this franchise. Disney has shown that they don't care about the franchise, and now neither do I."
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,I loved everything about it. Great ending to a great movie series.
"Jan 15, 2020",negative,Not original did not wow me
"Jan 15, 2020",negative,"bad for people who ask ""why?"" or who don't want exposition front loaded into your face in a tell don't show."
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,"Was kind of predictable, no surprises. Didnt expect Kilo Ren to turn his back on the dark side. 
Quality film. Fun to watch."
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,loved it. action packed from start to finish.
"Jan 15, 2020",negative,"Absolute garbage, but watchable once."
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,It was best of latest trilogy. Was a little far fetched but also unique about the Emperor. Definitely better than last. The last trilogy just seemed all together a little rushed. Like they made it up as they went along.
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,The movie was awesome
"Jan 15, 2020",negative,"I have to go with the critics on this one. Pacing at important moments was so fast I couldn't properly respond to them before the movie had moved on without me. There's fast-paced action and then there's face-paced narrative. This narrative moves so quickly at times you almost don't notice just how sloppy the writing is.

Honestly it feels like Abrams tried to remake Last Jedi and then make Rise of Skywalker in one film. It was too much content - and any progress you thought the films had made in terms of showing mixed race couples - forget about it. 

Expect sloppy, tropic writing pulled from other Star Wars films pasted together without enough time invested to make it work.

#spoilers
Rose and Finn don't really get roles in this film. In fact, let's give Finn a same-race love interest. >.> Really? Okay. I guess. I feel like we just spent a whole movie getting to know these characters. I had to agree with the critics on Last Jedi as well - structurally and functionally it was a good film even if you hated what it did to the fandom."
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,"I think it was a great movie, probably not what you expected if you are a big Star Wars fan, it was long, but I really enjoyed every single moment of it."
"Jan 15, 2020",negative,"Honestly it was incredibly predictable and boring. It walked back and dismissed every interesting and original story point from the previous movie, and it's slavish devotion to fan-service sucked the life out of much of the rest of the film. Strong performances from several of the leads were it's only redeeming quality. I went to see it using a free ticket, and I still felt like I overpaid. Truly a waste of 2 hours."
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,The family really enjoyed this episode
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,It was satisfying but I wanted more
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,Fantastic. a fitting end to a great saga. Bravo
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,brings closure to the series. like most of the previous installments it rehashes a lost of the original trilogies ideas. not in a bad way but has that been there done that vibe. worth seeing in the end regardless
"Jan 15, 2020",negative,First Star Wars movie that less than an hour into the movie I was checking g my watch.
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,it was good very Disney I will say.
"Jan 15, 2020",negative,Horrible storyline.  This movie brought together a horrible storyline.
"Jan 15, 2020",negative,"Well that was a waste of time and $. Even my 8 year old daughter who I brought up on star wars left the theater disappointed and confused. the originals, prequels, clone wars, rebels, rouge 1, solo (it lost money) and the force awakens are all enjoyed by the two of us. This production stinks of corporate meddling by Disney and a feeble attempt to ret-con  the dumpster fire that Ryan Johnson gave us. Over the top fan service and a plot that felt like it was missing at least 45 min or an hour (release the JJ cut) left the story feeling flat and mashed together. If you are looking for amazing Star Wars this is not it go binge watch the Mandalorian on Disney + and cancel your trial when you are done."
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,"Cinematography was so on point and it was an amazing close to the series! Just see it for yourself, ignore what anyone else says about it. Make the decision for yourself."
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,"The way Benjamin transformed for love, even though he knew he was dying"
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,Great conclusion that made sense.
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,I quite thoroughly enjoyed the movie
"Jan 15, 2020",neutral,"Visually, stunning. Acting, no let down. Script..., horrible. As one who saw Episode IV on opening night (42 years ago), to see where this ended is supremely disappointing. Fifteen minutes less of action filled by story building or extending the movie time by fifteen minutes to tell the story would have helped. In the end, Disney executives messed up."
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,"I thought it could of been done a lot better, but it was at least better than the last installment Im also hoping we get back to making movies not agendas."
"Jan 15, 2020",neutral,"First of all, I loved the animations and the sound effects. However, I think the movie was to predictable. The only things that made me go woah where the effects. I’m not saying that absolutely everything has to surprise me, but the movie could have been better."
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,A fitting ending to the story that has been rocky but it does fix the issues in the Last Jedi
"Jan 15, 2020",negative,Two stars deserve two words...Plot convenience...
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,"Superb Movie if you're going to see it as a once off, storyline wise thought the trilogy still so many questions. So is she a Skywalker or a Palpatine ?"
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,Fun conclusion to the Star Wars saga.
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,A great end to an awesome legacy!
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,Family is all of us! Very powerful and moving!
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,"As a serious fan of the series, I found it pretty good. However, much like other modern Star Wars films, it was geared more toward serious fans and less toward casual fans."
"Jan 15, 2020",negative,"Is the worst movie of star Wars franchise, SKywalker? Darth Vader Legacy? Forget this, dont start again."
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,I believe you either love this movie or hate this movie. The people who have problems with it are nit-picky white dudes who take Star Wars to their own level and it fails them.
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,"Star Wars is not Shakespeare.  It is big, loud, fun escapism and the film delivered in spades.  Leia's arc was tied up nicely and the ending was very fitting.  My only gripe is that I wish they had decided to make the runtime a bit longer.  Being that this film is intended to wrap up a 9 film saga, they should have released a 3 hour film.  Some of the plot threads and newer characters and needed a little more room to breathe.  Overall I'm extremely pleased with it and look forward to seeing it again."
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,"By far my favorite recent Star Wars. The grand visual effects, the marvelous acting, the heartfelt storyline— this movie tugged on every heartstring and made me cry and cheer and had me on the edge of my seat hungry ford East my eyes upon the excellent journey the film took me on. Simply an amazing final chapter to the trilogy. Thank you."
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,very long  and  no  real  surprises.
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,"I liked all of it. It might've rhymed a bit too much with the original trilogy but whatever. If there's one thing these movies have taught me is that you can't please everyone (nor should you try). 
Great movie and what an end to the Skywalker saga."
"Jan 15, 2020",neutral,"My analogy of Episodes 7-9: - Episode 7 - JJ Abrams bought all the groceries but had to step out and leave the dinner prep to Riann. - Episode 8 - Riann completely missed on the entire meal prep. - Episode 9 - JJ came back to the ruins of Riann’s failed dinner and whipped up a passable casserole with the leftovers, Chopped-style. Nothing to put on the menu as a feature entree, but sufficient for a Thursday night on a hard week when the family has to eat something. "
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,Loved the bookend to Star Wars 1977
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,Was decent . Could have been written little more better.  But entertaining.
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,"I know they had to finish this nine movie series, but they left as many things open as they left closed. A bit abrupt for the true diehard fan."
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,"For me, it rounded up the whole story of Star Wars 
I have been a fan since 1977"
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,"A lot of action, but not a lot of heart. OK end to the series, but nothing worth writing home about."
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,"Most of this film faults come from the fact that J.J Abrams was racing against time trying to undo some of the previous installment deviations. Nevertheless, it's a fan focused film that does justice to the Star Wars awe. As a cinema enthusiast, you'd be disapointed. As a fan, you'd be most likely satisfied."
"Jan 15, 2020",negative,"Terrible premise.  Scattered, jagged story telling.  All complication and no plot.  Compelling, previously important characters reduced to scenery.  A very disappointing ending to an epic."
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,Excellent overall.  Closed a lot of plot lines going back to the beginning of the series.
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,"If you like Star Wars, you will like this film. You can tell how much though went into filling those plot holes from the previous film disaster. In my opinion the best Star Wars since the original trilogy."
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,"Nicely finished, satisfying finish to 42 years of Force filled excitement! Great visuals with sensible story.  I glad I didnt miss it in the theater."
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,Really intense and suspenseful!
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,10 times better than the last jedi.
"Jan 15, 2020",neutral,Rey is Palpatine’s granddaughter? What a TERRIBLE idea.
"Jan 15, 2020",negative,"If TLJ is Michael Scott persistently pulling out a g*n in improv class, this movie is the other actors failing to adequately compensate for the colossal derailment of their scene. Except those actors are a theme park ride. Its blinding stupid. Gut wrenchingly inane. There are now officially twice as many terrible Star Wars movie than good ones. But whenever I get frustrated I just tell myself ""that's Star Wars, baby"". I'm done."
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,"Maybe it's a good time to end up any sagas until some script writers come with new ideas not involving Death Stars (aka Starkiller Base), bring back people from the dead or the main character being the unknowingly descendant of a Sith Lord. Not to mention ewoks, Jar Jar Binks or porgs. Please."
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,"Not bad, tied up some loose ends.
It could have been a lot worse considering it's a Disney Movie."
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,"Great movie! Had me in suspense and a little tear jerker, great way to end the Saga"
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,A fitting end to the Star Wars saga
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,Loved the movie! Brought tears and happiness.
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,All you could have wished for IF you are a star wars fan. Lots to unpack!!!
"Jan 15, 2020",negative,"Lots of exciting action and gorgeous visual effects that didn't tell a cohesive story. I spent the first hour of the movie wondering what the heck was going on and why I should care. Not only did the story undo most of The Last Jedi, it also contradicted parts of The Force Awakens and even itself. Glaring plot holes undermined what little plot there was. The characters were handled so badly that they were often unrecognizable. Even Rey's character was portrayed in a way that actually made me dislike her in this film. She comes across as vicious and cold. The most bizarre decision was what was done to Kylo Ren/Ben Solo, the last Skywalker and heir to all the legacy characters. It makes no sense for the final film of the Skywalker saga. I walked out of the theater angry and disgusted that the filmmakers and producers thought this was a fitting end to a 40+ year saga."
"Jan 15, 2020",positive,"Incredible,i loved the story and the emotions that the movie made me feel as a true star wars fan since my 6 years old.
Mada me cry, laugh... everything."
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,"Kept you in the edge of your seat, wondering. And the FEELS!! lol"
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,would give it 5* if it had more porgs and more ewoks
"Jan 14, 2020",negative,"This film is representative of a more far-reaching evil - visually stunning mediocrity.  In a world of the social media persona, and the neglected meaning of the self, this is the movie you make.

It looks indisputably beautiful.  It has no substance.  No core.  No courageous aspiration.  None.  There's nothing for the child viewer to aspire to, except 'just being awesome', not earning awesome.

It has a rag tag bunch, with no common purpose or discipline, beating a regimented military force with an ideology.  ""Don't worry, teenagers, you don't need to make anything of yourselves; just jump on your ponies and you can ride right through authoritarian ordnance.""  No.  You can't do that.

It has entitled discord with the previous films.  All of them.  Nothing for the adult viewer to allign with their own relationship with Star Wars.  It's like your partner going away for a year and coming back with a traumatic brain injury (TLJ); and then she goes away for another year, gets another TBI in a vain attempt to fix the TLJ; she comes home, staggers through the door and yells, ""HEHHHH, HANNNYYYY,  I'M HOMMMME!!!    . . . [drool]"" and voids ber bowels, giggling.

This film is frivolous.  It treats the source material as frivolous, and reaps the whirlwind."
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,Excellent end to the most recent edition of the Star Wars saga.
"Jan 14, 2020",negative,"If you love explosions and cheap thrills, then you will probably love this movie. From where I'm sitting, no amount of talent from the actors and other creators can compensate for bad writing and an ill-conceived plot."
"Jan 14, 2020",negative,much of the movie didnt make sense and did not go along with prior jedi powers
"Jan 14, 2020",negative,"Unoriginal lazy writing, just when you think Disney can't make the saga any worse... "
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,This was the best Star Wars since the original over 40 years ago.  Really enjoyed it.
"Jan 14, 2020",negative,"Writing is very lazy, plot points don't make sense, random new force powers, ignores points of the previous movies, characters do things without motivation. feels like the movie was made to look look first, but nobody thought character motivation mattered."
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,I'm a massive Star Wars fan but this one was not the best. Highly recommend watching The Mandalorian instead and wait for this to come to DVD or streaming. Few decent moments but nothing to have you on the edge of your seat. Ending was a bit lame too.
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,Better than I expected
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,the ending is thrilling
"Jan 14, 2020",negative,"This whole movie felt like a redo of other Star Wars films. The dialogue was stale and the story was very weak.
This is supposed to be an epic story. EPIC. I think of The Odyssey, The Iliad, The Lord of the Rings. This one does NOT hold up.  It felt like they were writing the story as they were filming.
Honestly – I didnt care about what happened to any of the characters good or bad totally not vested in any of them.

This film is called Rise of Skywalker. MEH!!!!!! Totally failed to deliver.
And now Ben and Rey can heal other people?! WHAT?!!  It is a KNOWN FACT in all science fiction that if you bring someone back from the dead, they do not come back whole (ZOMBIES! Frankenstein, anything!)"
"Jan 14, 2020",neutral,"More Star Tours than Star Wars, the movie is like a series of cut scenes put together than a coherent movie, but like the ride it is fun in the moment, if you don't think about it to hard."
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,"Great movie , much better that the Last jedi."
"Jan 14, 2020",negative,"This whole new trilogy was terribly derivative, and disrespectful to the legacy of the Original Trilogy and its heroes. So sorry we missed so many opportunities here :("
"Jan 14, 2020",negative,"Pretty much an effort to undo what happened in previous movies. Due to that and poor character and word building, it creates a story that does not make sense or follow its own rules. Very pretty though."
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,Loved it!! Helped bring the past Star Wars movies together without closing it all out.
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,Fan service and shortcuts taken but packed with plot and action. Was fun
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,WOW that is all...IMAXLASER
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,We loved it! Definitely kept my attention and I liked that you were all caught up if you hadn’t seen any of the others.
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,"Star Wars never disappoints! This one is, in my opinion, is the best one yet. Full of action and suspense, excitement and emotion!"
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,"A little long... 
Scene with the Emperor near the end could have been shortened."
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,"As often, the movie money mongers behind a project gutted the script, resulting in a movie with hollow character development and poor storytelling, which is bloated with CGI and attempts to push the merchandise. They forget again and again that great storytelling is the one true basis of every successful movie."
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,"There was a lot of material covered for the movie length, and it left some questions to be answered elsewhere, but that's one of the great things about the Star Wars universe.  Plenty of open ends to explore through books, series, other movies, etc."
"Jan 14, 2020",negative,Just a lot of flash bang with nothing new.  Same old same old.  The good guys have the old stuff and the bad guys are state of the art but it is all garbage.  Could be all the clips that were cut out of old versions.  A good one to skip.
"Jan 14, 2020",neutral,Not a bad addition at all. A good way to continue the legacy.
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,"Have been a Star Wars fan from a young age after seeing Episode IV in 1979. This movie, I believe, was a fitting end to a beautiful story."
"Jan 14, 2020",negative,"After weeks of thought this is my review. The conclusion to the Skywalker Saga is filled with Plot holes and bad writing. There are things that happen in this film that have never happened in Star Wars before with zero explanation. You walk in with questions, yet walk out with more than double what you walked in with. The writers are to lazy to build a word or character they can’t grab your attention for more than 5 minutes, which mind you 5 minutes is about all you’ll get before the movie cuts to something else entirely. This movie is so poorly written and badly paced. The only reason I give it 1 star is because of the visuals. This movie looks great (other than the sloppy use of the light sabers and saber fights, also there’s a blaster that disappears in the film mid fight) but that can’t make up for how awful the story is. This movie along with the last 3 before it are not cannon for me. Very sad about this as well life long Star Wars fan and hate to see bad writing and poor management on Disney’s part has led to this monstrosity of a film to have the name “Star Wars” in front of it."
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,Entertaining but not as amazing as I thought it would have been
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,"Living up to the Star Wars legacy is virtually impossible. I think they did a wonderful job of coming as close as they could. This movie is visually beautiful, evokes all the ""feels"" and nostalgic emotion tied to the original series, and decently ties up story arcs and relationships set forth in the trilogy. Is it perfect? No. However, I have complaints about most of the complaints. The force should be allowed to evolve and new people should be able to channel it in new ways. The relationship between Poe and Finn was sufficiently beautiful without being romantic. The plot holes are to be expected in most movies of this category, and I didn't feel that they were drastic enough to warrant a bad review. 5 stars to combat the barrage of what I believe are unfair ratings. Give it a chance! :-)"
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,Told a great story and filled in the  history of the characters.
"Jan 14, 2020",neutral,"Pudo ser mejor.  El beso entre Ray y Ren no siento que haya sido necesario. 
Y ... ella no es una skywalker!!! Si el apellido no te define, xq no usa su apellido con orgullo y demuestra que puede ser diferente?!?"
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,"Good ending, a little cheesy in parts, but for being written back then, all good."
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,doesn't feel like a star wars movie but it's a must see for a star wars fan
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,"RoS finished the Skywalker saga perfectly. There were minor flaws, and some of the dialogue was weak, but overall, the movie made me laugh, made me cry, and it made me very very satisfied. Definitely recommend!"
"Jan 14, 2020",negative,"Completely underwhelming. A mess of different ideas that are underdeveloped. Not to mention ripping off the original trilogy and bringing back characters that are dead for no reason (cough cough palpatine). George Lucas should’ve been allowed to be involved, atleast as a consultant because the whole trilogy is without direction and frankly pointless "
"Jan 14, 2020",negative,Awfully poorly written in general. Painful to watch.
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,Rounded the story well. great ending. fear makes you feel alone. you are not alone.
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,Loved it! Wrapped up all the years of Star Wars in an epic way!
"Jan 14, 2020",negative,tried to wrap up too many things.
"Jan 14, 2020",negative,"horrível, sem planejamento, um desperdício"
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,I liked it and I loved the closure...
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,"Keeps the continuity of the original trilogy, lots of cameos and great special effects as usual."
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,"It was ok, not great and not bad. The special effects were very good. But I think the story was flawed."
"Jan 14, 2020",neutral,"There are parts of this movie I absolutely adored and other parts I absolutely loathed. As a massive Star Wars fan I'd say this film was fun while it lasted, but forgettable and full of wasted potential."
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,"I saw it in 4D -terrible . The stupid chair shaking , cold air blasting & water being emitted onto patron was totally unnecessary. It took away from trying to enjoy the actual movie . The movie was definitely descent. I’d see it again , but not in 4D -ever!!!"
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,Had flaws but appropriate way to end the main movies.
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,Loved it more the second time!
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,"Dispite it's flaws, felt the characters' arcs were fufilling, and the end battle entertaining enough for me to enjoy the movie."
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,it was a starwars movie.
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,"A visual spectacle, but a lackluster conclusion to the new trilogy."
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,Palpatine was creepy as a Zombie--- But Rey and the rest of the Resistance were as always - amazing!
"Jan 14, 2020",neutral,"To quote another film that expresses my feelings exactly! Here is my review of The Rise of Skywalker.

""I'll tell you the problem with the scientific power that you're using here, it didn't require any discipline to attain it. You read what others had done and you took the next step. You didn't earn the knowledge for yourselves, so you don't take any responsibility for it. You stood on the shoulders of geniuses to accomplish something as fast as you could, and before you even knew what you had, you patented it, and packaged it, and slapped it on a plastic lunchbox, and now... you're selling it, you wanna sell it.""

A film so fearful of its fans it basically gives up on a consistent story and provides ""apparently wanted ideas"" and shoves it into the story. It is fun on its own and extremely safe. 

I honestly believe The Last Jedi is the best film of this trilogy. Its the closest one that echoes the feeling of the Star Wars universe and has the heart of the franchise. The Rise of Skywalker is a film that has been edited way too much and so, in the end, the feeling is lost. This trilogy barely featured the name Skywalker and that was fine with me, but then it pushed itself into a corner and decided to say the ""End of the skywalker Saga"". We were all bound for disappointment. 

I really enjoyed Force Awakens and especially Last Jedi but Rise of Skywalker was a terrified child saying ""YES"" to everyone just to make friends but in the end, it shows no spine or conviction. I do not think that it was JJ's fault, it was just too many cooks in the kitchen."
"Jan 14, 2020",negative,I have watched it two times in two days and I have come to the conclusion that I don't like it.
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,"Loved the action and thought Disney did a great job, but when it comes to the star wars story, there seemed to be a pattern in plot with return of the Jedi."
"Jan 14, 2020",negative,"Hot garbage, just like the other two movies."
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,Loved the movie! Some scenes dragged a little but overall the story was great! Glad I saw it!!
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,"I would recommend watching this movie. It was better than 7 and 8 and though it can be frustrating at times, it is a masterpiece."
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,Last Jedi was better but I enjoyed this
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,Excellent closing to an epic adventure
"Jan 14, 2020",negative,Weak plot but better than the last Jedi
"Jan 14, 2020",neutral,family movie night and not my choice.
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,I think it nicely wraps up most open items from the first 8 episodes.
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,Loved it.  Better the 2nd time around. Recommend seeing it 2nd time if you are not sure. The first time the movie went to quickly and I missed many things.  Don't try to analyst the movie.  Just enjoy it.  It is a Star Wars movie.
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,Fun!  Not the best film in the franchise but a satisfactory ending with nods to previous episodes
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,"It was awesome.
A GREAT ending for a GREAT saga.
It's a pitty there wont be any more chapters."
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,Besides a few small issues I loved this film 
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,Liked where the story went and how it ended. Entertaining with some humorous and sentimental parts.
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,Forced romance at the end. Not in line with the story.
"Jan 14, 2020",negative,Has potential but they fucked it up again.
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,Absolutely loved the ending of this trilogy. One of the better Star Wars Episodes
"Jan 14, 2020",negative,I saw the first movie in the theater in 1977. I wish I didn't  see this  one at all. Nice job Disney! That's what's called screwing up a free lunch!
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,"It tied up a lot of loose ends, but the story line kind of felt tired. Tired tropes. Fun evening, though."
"Jan 14, 2020",negative,Worst of the new movies.  Very predictable.  Let's take everything from the old movies and recycle again.
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,Great movie.  Very entertaining.
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,Such a great movie! Talk about a plot twist with Ray’s family line!! :(.   Sorry it’s the end of the Star Wars series.
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,Great ending for the series. It was fun seeing so many of the cast from the original three back to end the saga.
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,"Could have been a little more generous with the ending, I mean it was the end, dont short change us! Otherwise it was all the good stuff you love about StarWars"
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,GreAt movie and very surprising ending
"Jan 14, 2020",negative,"A sloppy story with way too many contrivances. Doesn't stand on its own, doesn't gel with any of its predecessors. What a shame. Way to go Disney"
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,At times it almost takes you back to the magic and feel of the first films. But I guess it's just me being nostalgic. Still.a good movie.
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,Absolutely phenomenal!
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,"I waited so long to post this review because I wasn't really sure how I thought about when I first saw it opening weekend. I've since come to realize I have mixed feelings about the movie. Maybe its just me but I like it when I see like a rebellious hero that looks they are heading towards the ""dark side"" (Rey). The plot and character developments are not as good as the earlier films, but this movie is still fun to watch none the less. If you are a fan of the franchise and don't mind less character developments, more albeit not amazing action and some twists and turns than you'll probably enjoy this movie, and I think it was a fine finale to this beloved franchise."
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,"I am not a die-hard fan of the Star Wars sagas, so I didn't know the story line.. With that being said, It wasn't done very well.  It felt too rushed.  The director tried to push to much into the time he had.  Even the fight scenes with the swords looked staged.  It was good to see the originals cast though."
"Jan 14, 2020",negative,"This felt like 2 movies being forced into 1. The who thing felt like a course correction, but we're already at the end... I didnt like The Last Jedi but trying to retcon everything at the end just made it feel fake."
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,It was OK but not great.
"Jan 14, 2020",negative,ruined so much of the franchise's history and lore
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,Loved seeing the original cast. Great action
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,Best of the sequel trilogy!
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,Don’t listen to the critics great movie
"Jan 14, 2020",negative,"Rotten Tomatoes doesn't let people write negative reviews for this movie, so who knows if anyone will ever see this. If you manage to come across this comment and you consider yourself a Star Wars fan; DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE. Any self-respecting Star Wars fan looks at this Trilogy and asks how they get away with doing this to such a beloved IP. The Force Awakens was a shot for shot remake of A New Hope. The Last Jedi had more writers than good scenes, should have never happened. The Rise of Skywalker tries to erase TLJ from history while also beginning and ending a story. JJ tried to make a Trilogy into a Quadrology. He wanted to make Star Wars into Guardians of the Galaxy. This trilogy will go down in history as what happens with big money tries to buy movies. You can't buy a good movie, you need to actually put in the time to make one."
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,"Meeting personal expectations for static predictability and brand name cheese, I was surprised to find that I wasn't overwhelmed by disappointed.

[C+] -- 64%"
"Jan 14, 2020",negative,"The same thing as last time, only less entertaining. There was no reason to make this movie."
"Jan 14, 2020",neutral,So many plot holes. Were there things I found enjoyable about it? For sure. Was it a satisfying end to the Skywalker Saga? Definitely not. Just one mans opinion.
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,Ok movie. Just didnt have the punch I was hoping the last movie would have.
"Jan 14, 2020",negative,No supieron cómo terminar la saga después del desastre que hizo el anterior director.
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,"If you are a Star Wars fan this is the movie for you, it perfectly ties up the skywalker saga with enough emotion, action, and humor to satisfy any Star Wars fan"
"Jan 14, 2020",negative,What a terrible way to end the saga. Felt like watching Mulan in space. Definitely a Disney movie. Hard to relate to the Star Wars story line at all. Entertaining but not for Star Wars fans.
"Jan 14, 2020",negative,"The movie was predictable and completely lacked in creativity. Where the old movies had a least some percentage of mystery that caused interest, this movie did not. Although it was clear they had a large budget, it was seemed to be all spent on pointless fight scenes. After the first few minutes, the entire rest of the movie was fight scenes following periodic ‘witty comments' the classic logarithm for which they produce every single marvel movie with. This means that there was no character development of any sort, no twists, and the only conversing that was featured was all extremely cliche. I was fairly disappointed because after all of these years the main audience is clearly older. With this system the only people who end up thinking these movies are ‘cool' are children, who would probably be satisfied either way. It is just sad that the final movie in the series had to be ruined, and as disney slowly grows and takes over more and more, probably so will many more of the franchises we have previously enjoyed."
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,used to the effects so was hoping for a better plot
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,"Great as always, not the best in my opinion. I thing the previous one was actualy better."
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,Lots of inconsistencies tbh
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,The editing was awful. So much plot lost.
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,GREAT MOVIE! That is if you've haven't been a diehard fan since the beginning! To his credit The Last Jedi was such a mess that he wasn't left with much to work with. The damage had already been done. But as a standalone movie I thought it was tremendous!
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,I don’t usually do 3-D movies but I will say that this movie in IMAX 3-D was amazing! The visuals jumped off the screen and really made an impact. Thank you Lucasfilm!
"Jan 14, 2020",negative,Sì vede troppo l'impronta disney con pure bacio alla principessa finale
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,"Loved It!!! The Story Just Keeps Getting Better, which  the other movies more significant, #StarWarsFan4Life #ForceBeWithYou"
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,"It was a good movie, tied up some loose ends left a few more out there... was almost a fancy 2020 version of return of the Jedi plot like sequel"
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,I like everything about Star Wars ...the plot & action was great!!!
"Jan 14, 2020",negative,"If you watch the entire series of films, none of TROS makes any sense. Visually it is stunning but intellectually it is vacant. They made all three sequel films up as they went along, independent of one another of he original trilogy. 

Dreadful."
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,Loved every minute. Sure you can dissect and find flaws if you’re inclined but I was highly entertained.
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,"Let me start by saying, I am not a SW groupie. I do not know the ins and outs of SW. in fact I go in knowing I will be utterly confused. I go see SW for nostalgia and entertainment. I thought it was good. I am a fan of Oscar Isaac, but Poe is not the character for him to play."
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,They should have brought back Vader. Why not they brought everyone else back!!!!
"Jan 14, 2020",negative,"This movie did for me what Fox did for hardcore X-Men fans... Just trash... I almost went and threw away all my Star Wars merchandise.  The lead-up to the climax was about as enjoyable as watching paint dry, the climax itself was predictable and dry, and the ending.... Well no spoilers here, but WTF?!"
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,Completely Satisfying .
"Jan 14, 2020",neutral,"What was resuscitated with such promise in Force Awakens ends in a hot mess, with non-sensical plot twists and meh performances all around. Just about every performer was better in Awakens. "
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,Perfect culmination of the series which I've been enjoying since childhood.
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,Great movie! Acting was excellent and the story was really geared toward hardcore Star Wars Fans!!!
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,"As a huge Star Wars fan, I absolutely loved this movie."
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,"A great conclusion to the current trilogy. They handled the death of Leia well I thought. There were some campy moments, that I'm sure bother people, but Star Wars has always been like that. The movie was super dark at times and redeemed The Last Jedi."
"Jan 14, 2020",negative,Exciting action....but the development of the characters plots were weak.  I didn't feel anything for them because every time the dialog was about to get into a characters story line....an action scene breaks out and we never return to that story line.  The movie just keeps moving forward without taking a second to build on someone.   Alot of action...almost want to say that its only action.
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,"I’m a huge Star Wars fan, especially the original trilogy and I loved this movie. Easily the best out of all the ones created with these characters. "
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,"I have gone to this movie twice in the theater, once in 2-D and once in 3-D. the 3-D does not make the movie better. the only good thing about this movie is that it is better than the Last Jedi at least. it did not quite make up for the last movie but it tried."
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,Certainly not the worst in the franchise. Excellent visual effects makes up for some of the stories shortfalls. An enjoyable end to an era. If you watched the first movie (4th in the series) in the theaters back in the late 70’s you should be required to watch this in theater. If you can recapture your childlike wonder you will love this one too.
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,Absolutely loved it. If only the last movie was done better and answered more questions this one could have been even better.
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,This was an excellent ending to the amazing Skywalker saga. Packed with action and tons of surprises it fulfilled everything I wanted to see to complete my journey I started in May of 1977.
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,"It wasn't the best film in the trilogy, but it explained a lot of open questions about who was with who (family). The action was OK but there were some run on's with scenes that could have end quickly. But at least this episode leaves the door open for side stories like (Solo)"
"Jan 14, 2020",negative,The Fall of star wars.
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,A welcome return of characters from the original Star Wars movies.
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,"Great! Closure to the series, very well done!"
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,"Me encanto, una excelente forma de culminar la tercera trilogía de STAR WARS"
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,Epic finish to the greatest story of my lifetime
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,An ok film. At times it nearly captured the feel of the first 3 films. But that might be just me being nostalgic.
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,Good attempt to save the sequel trilogy.
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,It was assume watching it on the big screen with 3D glass & the surrounding sound.  It felt like you were there in the moment.
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,"Loved the film. I felt like I was watching Star Wars again. It takes you on a ride, with some bumps along the way, but it was a fun ride through the galaxy."
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,the ending though predictable brought closure
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,I loved how all the characters reacted to each other!
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,Liked the whole thing.  The message in it.  Never too late to redeem yourself.
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,"Its Star Wars, whats not to like."
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,Great story. Lots of action
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,Great saga ending. Hope to see more from this series
"Jan 14, 2020",negative,"Sad ending to something that inspired generations to be better.

Just too much going on that makes no sense, and laden with plot device after plot device."
"Jan 14, 2020",negative,"Imagine taking every terrible fan fiction idea of star wars and then jamming it all in a film with terrible pacing and awkward plot development.  The lack of continuity insults all the story development that was created in the original trilogy.  JJ Abrams literally pulls things out of his anus in this film.

Casual star wars fans who just want something entertaining would probably enjoy this film, but passionate star wars fans who actually wanted a deep plot development and new exciting ideas brought into the star wars universe will probably watch this film and stop caring about it mid way."
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,"great story telling, loved that they we were able to see our Princess Leia!"
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,"While panned for it's amount of fan dedication, The Rise of Skywalker is an emotional, action packed adventure, that still has it's dull moments, and plot holes, but forgetting all that it sticks the perfect landing for the last minutes of the film that couldn't have been done better, which concludes the Skywalker saga with the fans in mind, rather than the critics."
"Jan 14, 2020",negative,Goodbye Star Wars saga.
"Jan 14, 2020",negative,"One of the laziest, soulless, most non-sensical  Star Wars movies I have ever seen. more than half of the movie is spent backtracking decisions made in the previous film while inserting as much pandering as they possibly could to appease an audience who hasn't been the target market of these films since 1982. 

JJ ensured that the sequel trilogy characters will not be able to stand the test of time and delivering incomplete arcs for each of the main characters that are anything but satisfying. He even has Rey ending the movie on the very planet where Luke's journey BEGAN, making the film feel like it hasn't actually concluded. She is left wandering and aimless, with no hint of what will happen to her now.

This film asks nothing of the audience, treating them like they are imbeciles who will not pick up on all the contradictory writing decisions these two self-proclaimed Star Wars aficionados (JJ and Terrio) have conjured up. They sloppily hide the fact that they had no real plan for any of these characters beyond turning them into hollow versions of themselves that have no character development in this film.

this film bastardizes the legacy of the OT characters, presents no original ideas and blatantly steals from the previous movie at many points (Rey and Kylo playing tug of war, the ""I know who your parents are"", Holdo Maneuver, etc). What's more, they are objectively worse versions of these scenes, giving us none of the emotionality that made those scenes so memorable. 

never is there a sense of urgency and the Final Order fleet and Palpatine fail to seem like an actual threat at any point, with the former very much being yet another rehash of Starkiller Base and the Death Star.

This movie greatly misunderstands the fundamental message of star wars being about hope, compassion, love and the nuance of the Force, and instead forces it's characters into these grim little boxes and told them to pick a side. 

maybe next time around they will get it right."
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,"Enjoyable and satisfying end to the series.  Amazing feat after the disaster that was the ep VIII, The Last Jedi.  Thank goodness."
"Jan 14, 2020",negative,"This movie is a fast paced war movie... in space... so it could be called a ""Star Wars"" movie, but the thematic redundance can't be outweight by this name. Instead of character developement we got (long dead) archetypes. One of those is well alive and cuckels. Instead of a focus on the new characters of Kylo Ren, Rey, Finn and Poe we got a series of hommages paid to previous movies. These hommages are so cheap and forced that they feel like a waste of screen time, not like compliments. Instead of an end for the new trilogy we got the absurd effort of repeating arcs that were closed 37 years ago. Instead of killing of the old characters in an epic battle against either Kylo Ren's reformed First Order or General Hux overthrowing Kylo Ren and leading the First Order against the Resistance as well as Kylo Ren together with his Knights of Ren, we got even more old characters back. Instead of explaining more about the established factions, their differences and similarities, we got a third faction which is presented as a threat to both the Resistance and the First Order... Just to be the First Order's overpowered clone and ally. This movie rose more questions than it answered, which would be okay If it was the first or second movie in a trilogy, but is just bad for the ending chapter of a saga."
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,"The new Star Wars films have proven to be incredibly divisive with fans.

The Force Awakens does take a lot of beats for echoing A New Hope but I really enjoyed it. In fact I loved it and it is the only film in ages that I went to see twice while on its original theatrical run. It felt like I had seen a Star Wars film. I have gone on record as saying this before. I have seen it many times since and I still enjoy it.

I walked out of the Last Jedi feeling like I had wasted a few hours of my life.I walked out of the Rise of Skywalker feeling totally and utterly confused as to how I felt as quite honestly it is a mess of a film. A total and utter mess.

With the sad passing of the wonderful Carrie Fisher the creators were left with unused footage of her from the previous films to use and it really shows. The dialogue is exceptionally clunky and it is a little uncomfortable to watch. There is however a distinct feeling that you got to give the a pass on this as it is what they had to work with. I found myself uncomfortable with how awkward it was but also forgiving for this was the material they had to make work It really doesn't.

On the same subject of dialogue prepare yourself going in for HEAVY exposition.

As above mild spoilers ahead but if you have seen the trailers then you already have massive spoilers. This does not help when the film is already predictable. There is a very early scene where Rey is asked a question and her answer made me think.

""Oh … So that is how they are going to end this""

And they do.

The Last Jedi hangs around the Rise of Skywalker like a lodestone and its obvious JJ Abrams is back peddling desperately to undo some of the flaws of of the previous film. There is an ever present feeling that he has got back from holiday to find the office junior has made a mess of things and he is doing the best he can to engage damage limitation.

So is the movie a total mess? Yes. Is it a good movie? No. Is it a bad movie…..?

Weirdly ….. No.

Unlike the Last Jedi there are many scenes that stick in the mind and I really want to see it again. I want to see it again unencumbered by guessing what is going to happen and slumping with disappointment when I find out I was right.

It does feel like it has many elements of a Star Wars film without being a Star Wars film and yet many of the elements alone are actually enjoyable. I could mention many scenes that stuck in my head but Kylo Ren (who was never one of me favourite characters) has a blink and you will miss it moment of such awesomeness I could have cheered. Whilst the film itself never feels epic on its own it does feel epic as being part of the franchise. It is held up by its own mythology and roots.

And because of that it does feel like it bookends the Skywalker saga, not totally and utterly satisfyingly, but not disastrously. There in lays the strangest feeling of all and why I was so confused when I left the cinema. As a Star Wars film in itself it does not feel like one of the franchise but looking at it as a whole it does.

I did not so much as enjoy the film as witness the ending of a story I had followed since I was a child.

It did not leave me empty and it did not leave me fulfilled.

It did however leave me wanting to see it again soon and on the way home I almost popped into a toy shop to buy a lightsabre.

So a mess …. But not a total failure."
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,Liked it but felt like scenes where missing still
"Jan 14, 2020",negative,I just feel like this series fell and with it my love for star wars with the events happening as they do. maybe in the future we can get a better story and my love shall return. the effect were nice but everything else just didn't do it for me I say skip this movie and read some of the old novels
"Jan 14, 2020",neutral,"wooden characters, chaotic plot, a sort of creepy CGI? leia and a very confusing interpretation of the Force. On the other hand, there were many callouts to other plot points and characters from throughout the series. It didn't quite live up to my sky-high expectations for the end of the series, but my kids said they liked it better than other Star Wars movies."
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,great storytelling ending of episodes. nerding out when lightsabers came out! 
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,"Good for non-original series fans, I guess. The ending really let me down. The message conveyed was that you should discard your origin if it does not seem to reflect how you view yourself and that it is ok to usurp the origin of those that you do identify with. This shows a complete lack of self-pride, perseverance, and rebirth into something new from the origins from which you forged yourself. Totally a wrong message for kids and young adults."
"Jan 14, 2020",negative,Glad that Disney has finished ruining the Skywalker/ Geore Lucas saga. I'm just gonna pretend Episodes 7-9 didn't happen.
"Jan 14, 2020",negative,"It was as good as anyone could expect. 
And still, it was terrible. If you want to learn why, just go to youtube.  There are tons of videos that do a wonderful job explaining how this sequel trilogy was doomed from the get go. 
The Cast is wonderful, they did the absolute best they could with the material they had.  JJ did his best to attempt to make a movie that felt like Star Wars.
Unfortunately, the writers and producers of this movie--and all of the sequel trilogy--just didn't understand what made a Star Wars movie, a Star Wars movie.
With time we can let this fade into the past..  we can let it die.  Kill it even..  if we have to. ;)"
"Jan 14, 2020",negative,Too all over the place.... smh. A true disappointment on have a terrific saga ended.
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,"The movie was entertaining, but the story didn't make me care about any of the characters or what was happening to them."
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,Slow beginning great ending.
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,"The acting of Adam Driver and the music of 87 year old John Williams makes it worth the time, especially if you are a fan of the series."
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,"it's good. Entertaining and wrapped it all up just like I wanted. Got me to see it twice. Its Star Wars, so always a must see."
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,Kept my attention throughout the movie. Good visuals and computer graphics!
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,Enjoyed seeing Princess Leah.  Suspense and action packed as usual. Door seems open for yet another installment
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,hmmmmmm enjoyed it but would definitely change things. no spoilers. lol
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,"Sound was too loud, and the movie was Silly"
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,"Look, this film expects you to just go with the flow and believe certain aspects without being introduced prior. I decided to just go with it and I found myself having a much better time. To me, the ending was pretty sweet and it kinda sets up a future. Check this one out and make up your own mind"
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,The movie was amazing! it was weird that there were commercials before the movie.
"Jan 14, 2020",negative,"Set your bar low and you probably won't be disappointed. Story has so many holes in it, it's sad. More of a bon voyage movie than anything else. Too bad."
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,Great movie a must see for all. I do recommend seeing all previous Star Wars movies first.
"Jan 14, 2020",negative,Starwars is dead! The movie was terrible but not as bad as The Last Jedi. And that's not a testimony to how good this movie is... It's a testiment to how horrendous The Last Jedi is!
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,A perfect finale for the series. I actually saw A New Hope when it came out originally and have been a fan ever since.
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,"Enjoyed the movie, a little too long"
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,"An entertaining movie with the sometimes overshadowing weakness of having to correct its 
predecessor and tendency to hide this by using an insane amount of fan service. The first act was messy, but the rest of the movie exceeded expectations. Well worth a watch."
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,"We loved the movie. It was an emotional movie, with lots of action. It was a great conclusion to the Skywalker saga."
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,It finishes the nine films with a bit of confusion but a satisfying conclusion. Could it have been better? Sure. It could also have been a lot worse.
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,I’m a casual Star Wars fan. I left the theatre feeling highly entertained with stunning visuals and great action. Story was okay but all in all it was a great time in the theatre !!! 👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,"Loved it! This one was more emotional, and the end left me with questions. Saw it in XD, glad we did. Big explosive scenes, rocked the walls. One of my favorite of the series"
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,"It was as if I were eating my favorite pie and it needed a little more ""something"" to make it taste like I like it.  But I still wanted to keep eating it and was eventually satisfied when all was gone."
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,"They forced Lando into the movie, made it kwirky and dumb at times."
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,I loved it. I know a lot of people were disappointed but I feel like whatever the last one was would be disappointing because it’s the last one. It was consistent with other episodes as far as action and story.
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,"I wasn't planning on seeing this in the theater but after friends and family commented on how much they liked it, I just had to see it for myself. I was not disappointed!! So much better than I expected! Be sure to see it on the big screen!"
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,Loved how it all came full circle.
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,Pretty good ending for all of the original characters. Apparently JJ Abrams had additional storytelling that Disney cut out. I would have liked to see JJs full version:)
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,Waited 40 years for this movie & it was great!!!  Absolutely Loved it!  Watched it with my son on opening night D-Box and with my daughter almost two months later (after we binge-watched all the other Star Wars movies she had not seen).   Perfect way to end the series!!!
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,I thought the movie was great.
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,Good job all around!!!
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,"What a great ending to the Skywalker Saga! As a Star Wars fan that was hurt by the poor writing and direction of The Last Jedi, I felt like the fun and mystery were finally put back into Star Wars. Thank you, Disney. Also, if you have a chance to see this movie in a 4DX theater its worth every penny! What a ride!!!"
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,"Ok, but rushed with many plot holes"
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,"Great movie , wonderful tribute to all the previous Star Wars movies. We only wish for Ben Solo to live"
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,Great movie. True to the Starwars epic.
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,"It was much better than I had expected based on other people's opinions however, it still left something to be desired, something hard to put one's finger on."
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,"I was entertained and on the edge of my seat every minute!  Every t was crossed and every i was dotted!  Every Star Wars fan should have felt closure. I laughed, I cried...I will never forget!"
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,Great ride.. Clear finish
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,I thought it was a beautiful love story. About love winning against hate. A fitting tribute to the old Star Wars with amazing special effects. Fun from beginning to end. Best light saber battles!!
"Jan 14, 2020",negative,"*SPOILERS*

Totally and utterly incoherent. 

An absurd plot, that spends its entire time trying to actively retcon the complete and utter massacre of the intellectual property that Rian Johnson carried out in The Las Jedi, but in doing so forgets to actually develop any characters in any meaningful way. 

The whole series of events is entirely predicated on nothing more than luck. There's no way for characters to know where the other is yet absurd turns of events happen that just *luckily* put them in the right place at the right time. Daggers that just happen to be the exact object that they need (one object on an entire planet) are found in random pits they fall into when being chased?! 

A complete and utter disregard for the wider world of Star Wars, with The Force becoming the ultimate Deus Ex Machina plot device - something that is repeated over and over ad nauseam. From a wider plot point of view, bringing back Palpatine makes the entire original trilogy and all those characters completely pointless. Luke failed and turned into a total idiot (imagine turning Luke Skywalker into an absolute scrote - the horror), Vader never beat Palpatine and never brought balance to the force (his sacrifice was meaningless) and the only person who actually could beat Palpatine was Rey who is a Palpatine?! All the Skywalkers are dead and in the ultimate piss on their grave moment she, a Palpatine, decides to call herself a Skywalker after she beats him. 

What a complete mess. Script writers of the future please take note. You need to PLAN YOUR CHARACTERS AND STORIES meticulously. Making shit up as you go along is not writing."
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,good ending to the saga.
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,"Würdiger Abschluss der ganzen Sage. Sehr guter und schlüssiger Film, auch wenn er mir zu schnell runtergerasselt vorkommt (zuviel Story für zuwenig Sendezeit)"
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,"Saw it in 4xd, sonawesome."
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,"Taken from the perspective of a long journey of movies in the series and expecting a feel good movie and you'll be okay.  Die hard fans will analyze and point out the plot holes and the ""What the...??"" moments."
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,"This movie is stupid, but I loved it."
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,"Really great movie that is fan service. Know that going in. Only complaint was the acting at certain portions that lead to a loss of emotion in certain spots. Star Wars fans are hard to please, I believe they did a good job "
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,Loved it hated to see it end will see again
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,Went in with high expectations and they were met!
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,"Not a very good plot but I had a fun time watching it. They did too many pump fakes where they make you think somebody died but then, surprise, they're still alive. Just a few pretty cheap plot moves. Light sabers are still cool though and I like some of the characters."
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,"loved it. fixed what the last one messed up. nicely wrapped up everything, and a nice ending to the Skywalker films"
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,Loved that Ben became a Jedi/good in the end.
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,This movie pulled the last 2 together so it all worked.
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,"This film was amazing! It help fill the gap fans felt after the release of The Last Jedi. It leaves the end of the Skywalker saga on a high note. This movie was imaginative and will appeal to all Star Wars fans. It had references to the original trilogy, from locations to music. So get your wookie copilot and jump to hyperspace, this will be the best two hours of your life!!!"
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,I really enjoyed this movie.. I am. Not a Starwars expert but for the love of movies and excellent entertainment.. this movie is worth your money
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,Highly entertaining... however the ending falls flat and JJ takes way to much liberty with the force for the final movie.
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,Great movie acting was off.
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,Don't listen to all the bad reviews. People look for things to complain about. The movie kept me interested with lots of twists and turns. Good flick!
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,I love all Star Wars.
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,"As a lifelong Star Wars fan, I couldn't be happier with a conclusion to the story so far. Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver are electric. Each character gets a logical arc,  the cinematography is incredible, and the movie is just phenomenal. Seen it four times in theaters with my wife so far."
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,Good solid storytelling. Visuals are fantastic. Proper conclusion to the tale of the Skywalkers.
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,Great ending to a 43 year epic saga
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,"A fantastically entertaining and emotional end to the trilogy and the series overall, within the movie chronology!"
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,"Great finale. If you don’t like it, you just don’t like Star Wars."
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,Answered so many questions. Great movie!
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,The story line was a bit weak. The story would get set up for an awesome action fight and the action would just fizzle.
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,Very good movie. I guess it was a decent ending for the saga
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,I liked everything about it
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,"Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is one of those special things were the sum is greater than the parts.

There are huge things about this movie that I didn't like. But, in the end it didn't matter... it was still Star Wars.  It was a fun, breakneck ride that didn't stop for air... it just kept going and going.

I could nitpick lots of things to death. But, judging it OVERALL, instead of this thing and that thing and that other thing... it was amazing.

But, as it's Star Wars - there is going to be plenty to dissect and pour over and nitpick to death.  Right, I am reveling in the glory of STAR WARS."
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,Star Warsy and iconic!
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,it's a great movie for what we were dealt with from the last jedi I think JJ did the best he could!
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,I thought the movie was fantastic and a perfect ending to the original saga.
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,I really enjoyed it.
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,entertainment and fun. graphics were exceptional.
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,Didn’t like the ending. Tried to wrap up too many story lines.
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,There was plenty of action and special effects. The story line followed with the previous episodes which help make the movie more interesting. The movie is a bit long though.
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,fantastic ending to the skywalker saga
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,Movie had stretches of dead slow action. Otherwise a great Star Wars story.
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,"This movie was waaaaay better than The Last Jedi, and did everything it could to fix everything it could with what narrative was left. From someone did not like the last movie, I did say I can appreciate this one. It was a good movie overall. Not perfect but made me feel just a slight bit better about Starwars as a whole after I swore I would never watch a Disney Starwars again..."
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,"Fantastic sequel, loved the cameos from prior characters.  Held my interest all the way thru."
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,Great movie! Sad that it’s the end of the saga.. :(
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,Loved it!! will deff see it again and again!
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,"Too long, but entertaining"
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,"As Star Wars fans since the very beginning, we are pleased with the way the series was wrapped up."
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,"Movie was dark (literally) plot was 'on the go' during non-stop actions.  Needed some 'down-time' to develop characters/relationships, etc. and a little humor inserted wouldn't have hurt."
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,"As a Star Wars fan from childhood,  I felt that this movie was a fitting end and completely satisfied me as a conclusion to the story I began when I was a child! I absolutely loved it and would go see it again in a heartbeat!"
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,"Dont listen to the naysayers. I really loved it. Of course anyone could pick it apart, but I think it fits in well to the overall story arc. Go see it."
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,"An amazing way to end this movie saga!!! So beautifully filmed!!! Liked the added new characters and the wonderful way the most loved characters, Luke, Leia and Hans were back!!! Just an awesome awesome awesome film!!! Thanks so much!!!"
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,"Fun movie, good dialogue, entertaining story. Stayed true to the original Star Wars storyline. Some plot holes, yet still enjoyable."
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,IMAX entirely tooo LOUD. My Apple Watch has a decibel  meter on it. A lot of the movie had sound levels greater than 82 and topping to 96. Lots of noise levels around 92 decibels. Could not get emotionally involved with most of the characters. Too many sky battles and light saber battles. Not many people in the theater either.
"Jan 14, 2020",neutral,"Stupid plot, poorly written and bad acting. The franchise just continues to go in the wrong direction. Rogue One was excellent but the last three Star Wars movies have been trash"
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,"Story was good 
 Special fxs good. Just enough humor for all"
"Jan 14, 2020",negative,"The movie is extremely poorly paste. Causes many plot holes in previouse movies destroying the Cannon set by George Lucas. It felt like JJ tried to make his own TLJ while also making RoS, twice the movie, double the disappointment."
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,excellent incorporation of old stars and focus on the new rising stars.  Wrapped things up nicely and even left a crack open for another trilogy.
"Jan 14, 2020",negative,"It was better than Last Jedi, at least."
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,One if the greatest Star Wars Movie ever.
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,Entertaining movie if you can turn your brain off while watching it but it gets worse the more you think about it. 
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,Good flick. Good job bringing Billy Dee Williams back!
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,Enjoyable movie even though the story was insulting as a huge star wars fan!
"Jan 14, 2020",positive,Only if you have seen the rest and filter out how insane suffering and death of hole civiliasations is marginalised by focusing on some lucky heroes.
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,it was ok. not nearly as bad as the last jedi. it did help tie things together in a bit of a rushed way.
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,"It’s a good, fun time. It’s absolutely in line with the Star Wars franchise. Don’t expect some amazing intricate plot or nomination worthy acting. Just sit back and enjoy."
"Jan 13, 2020",negative,"This franchise is becoming less of a parody than spaceballs. 

Adam Driver is the only reason to see this movie (or because for some reason everyone (myself included) considers every starwars release a must see...) 3/10"
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,Amazing special effects as always. Good action the whole movie.
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,"I really enjoyed it. It's not perfect, but it's much better then the previous two, and ties things up in a pleasing manner."
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,Loved the scenery and story. Best one of the new Star Wars!
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,"The critics are idiots!!!!  Amazing, exciting and worth seeing multiple times."
"Jan 13, 2020",negative,"I enjoyed Kylo's arc and, surprisingly, his dynamic with Rey. But the story was way over the top, rushed, and sloppy. Very disrespectful to George Lucas, and would have to loved to see a fitting and respectful end to the Skywalkers."
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,An entertaining movie with flaws.
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,I loved the end of the Skywalker saga.  I love learning the origin story of Rey. The use of Carrie Fisher posthumous footage was great. I look forward to seeing the extended cut later on 2020.
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,I personally really enjoyed this film as a StarWars fan despite popular belief and reviews. It of course had it's problems but those are inevitable as it is such a complex franchise. I was very hesitant to see this film due to how incredibly horrible the last one was but I was pleasantly surprised. I loved seeing new characters as well as old. I think they ended the saga as good as they possibly could have with what they have set up for themselves in the previous films. The actors all did amazing especially Adam Driver. I would enjoy seeing it again.
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,"Don’t listen to the critics, was a good movie it had to live up to the 8th movie which was awful but they did very well with what they had good job J.J"
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,Excellant movie.. A must buy on blu- ray 
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,I liked the movie overall but it didn’t WOW me. The storyline was ok but I did not like the dialogue. This felt more Disney than Star Wars.
"Jan 13, 2020",negative,"This was the biggest movie disappointment I've had since The Blair Witch Project in 1999. It's such a pathetic end to the saga that I wish I could wipe it from my memory. It was chalk full of poorly written, down-cycled, back pedaled plot points and an ending that seemed like it was pulled straight from JJ's overrated ass."
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,"Whether or not you've liked all of the previous 8 Star Wars films, this has been an epic series. That said I was somewhat disappointed with the lack of a coherent climactic close to the story. It feels like it should have been bigger, but, the story over the last 3 movies did meet a welcome conclusion."
"Jan 13, 2020",negative,Very disappointed. By far the worst star wars movie made. The story was way to far fetched and just flat out ridiculous. Would have been better as a video game but not a movie. Its a shame
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,"I am not a robot.
This movie was to close out the saga. Were mistakes made? Yes.
Was I entertained? Yes.
Would I see it again? Yes.
Do I still hate JarJar and The Last Jedi? YES!!!"
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,"Loved it!  I went in with low expectations and I have my gripes about how Disney has handled the final trilogy but JJ Abrams did a great job trying to wrap up, not only this trilogy but a 9 movie saga.  It was a fun movie that brought back some old characters in a way that finished the story in a satisfying way.  The critics are dumb.  Go by the audience scores and that will tell you more about a movie than anything.  Its good!  Go see it, you wont be disappointed"
"Jan 13, 2020",negative,"Incoherent plot committed completely to giving unearned fan moments instead of even attempting to make an interesting movie or trilogy. No convincing character arcs whatsoever. A failure not just on the part of Abrams, but on the part of Kennedy/Lucasfilm/Disney for failing to come into the whole trilogy with any plan whatsoever."
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,"Same type story line as the first.  Good against evil. Nice bringing back actors to do history of family.  Nothing really new and endearing. Oh,  Maybe the little cycle creature."
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,"Great conclusion to this major epic, some questions weren’t answered but the movie itself is great"
"Jan 13, 2020",negative,"It's truly difficult, as a major fan of Science Fiction, to sit thru another JJ Abrams film filled with loud, unnecessary action and a ridiculous, absurd plot. I'm tempted to write a great deal about how very much I hated this film, but no one cares what I think. This nonsense will continue to dump buckets of money into the Disney barrel and I'm sure, will be repeated far into the 21st century with more and more drivel! The only way to short circuit that depressing future would be for audiences to some how realize how much damage these films inflict on one's ears, eyes and brain...and stop paying money to further destroy a once venerable art form. Lotsa Luck!"
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,Loved it! Answered a lot of questions.
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,Like a tale from O'Henry plenty of twists and turns....I am so glad I did not watch ANY trailors....I was totally ready for anything in the film.
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,Love the visual effects
"Jan 13, 2020",negative,"Fan service doesn't make a film automatically great, you have to tell a compelling, intriguing and though through story as well. Abrams must have missed that part."
"Jan 13, 2020",negative,trash movie all about fan service jj strikes again
"Jan 13, 2020",negative,worst movie ever. fell asleep at the end
"Jan 13, 2020",negative,"Trash!  Better than the last one, but that's not saying much."
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,"Compared to the last jedi this one is worlds ahead, but its far from perfect I still feel Lucas's story would've been much better, but this is what we got, and it is star wars so. I love the franchise, but this trilogy just wasn't what it needed to be."
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,Amazing movie in almost every way. A million times better than TLJ. Can't wait for directors cut.
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,cinematography was very good. lot's of action.  All the characters were well represent.
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,Pretty good. My mother liked it.
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,"Cinematically impressive however very let down by the story/plot, it was cliched and inconclusive seeming as it was supposed to be a ‘finale'"
"Jan 13, 2020",neutral,"Was it entertaining? Yes. Was it a fitting finalé to the Skywalker trilogy? Well, it was a finalé, of sorts.

Having really enjoying The Force Awakens and quite enjoyed The Last Jedi, I was really looking forward to discovering Rey's backstory and how the empire would be destroyed this time. But my hopes were left unfulfilled. Yes, there are funny moments in the film (mainly provided by C3P0) and cheesy one-liners and nods to the fans, the overall plot is muddled. There are twists and turns in the plot that just seem to be thrown in there without much thought, and some of these just feel plain wrong.

I can't blame the actors – I thought they all did a good job really. It was just the script and plot became overly complicated and unnecessary.

By all means watch the film. You'll probably be entertained by it. Just don't be too disappointed by the last line (my god, that was irritating)."
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,Unlike most fans i can simply enjoy it for what it is..
"Jan 13, 2020",negative,Watching JJ Abrams undo most of the last movie ideas is heartbreaking
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,"Completed the story.  Rushed at times, had its good moments.  Left unfulfilled."
"Jan 13, 2020",negative,"Already did a Review, but It was somehow erased...

Just to keep It simple... The movie has no story.

EDIT: Typo"
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,Ignore the critics!  This is everything Star Wars fans could ask for!  Fantastic!
"Jan 13, 2020",negative,This movie brakes so many things we know about SW universe... It is still better than previous part but it pains me how much plot-holes were created. JJ did what he could but movie seems assembled in a way that makes no sense. I really hope it was not intentional. Maybe there is something I'm missing but as last movie in this series... It is just stupid in some places. Also I would be more than happy to speak with someone that is able to give this movie 5 starts. I would really like to know how it keeps score over 85% o_O It is just baffling for me.
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,"Well from the start the movie felt ‘Forced' the scrolling storyline at the begin felt rushed and as if the writers had given up , then the story ..... well all the special effects and action doesn't help bad acting and forced ‘funny moments , the writers have lost focus on the original story and by using the original cast to help  get the story to the original is very poor , Mark Hamils performance is getting worse as he gets older , I always maintain they should have left the original movies alone and started a whole series from scratch , the casting has always been a issue too , I've never liked Adam Driver as Kylo REN , he just looks wrong for the part and has to be one of the worst actors in the series , Disney should have gone the way of 3D animation for its movies as some people have done with gaming clips on YouTube (atleast the special effects are better ) 👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼"
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,"Dull, devoid of creativity but still having it´s enjoyable aspects. Star Wars: The Rise Of Skywalker cements its place alongside The Godfather Part III, Spider-Man 3 and The Dark night Rises as the meh third movie that serves as a fitting end to the saga yet an unsatisfying an rather disappointing movie if look at on its own."
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,Predictable but in the best possible way.  Loved it.
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,Basic great Star Wars story with unbelievable production
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,"Eu AMEI o filme de verdade, eu diria que e o 3 melhor filme Star Wars"
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,GOOD TRANSITION FROM OLDER GENERATION TO YOUNGER OF STAR WARS FANS.
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,It's pacing is strange and 95% of the scenes are recycled. None of the characters have a real story other than Rey supposedly being related to palpetine because of vague reasons.
"Jan 13, 2020",neutral,at least i didnt came out of the theater mad that time. but still....
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,"Yes, this movie has plot holes, yes it has plot conveniences and yes it is rushed... it is also obvious now that jj abrams and rian johnson had two very different visions and that there was either no outline for this whole trilogy or two very different ones...but as someone who adored the force awakens and hated the last jedi, this film feels like a cinematic apology...daisy ridley and adam driver were both phenomenal and were never better as rey and kylo ren. the adventure vibe of the first act is a love letter to spielberg classics like indiana jones and 40's serial adventures (one of george lucas' biggest inspirations for star wars). finally we get to see our new leads (rey, finn and poe) go on an adventure TOGETHER. They have an amazing chemistry and this should have happened before. The old crew returns as well and every single one of them acts as a mentor figure...jj treats luke, han, leia and lando with nothing but respect...even the emperor (who to be honest) came out of nowhere surprisingly works once again as the single most evil person in the galaxy... the action is amazing , the acting terrific and the finale satisfying...not perfect, but satisfying... to me the end of the skywalker saga will always be ""return of the jedi"" but as a conclusion for this new trilogy it does work...and it gets way too much hate in my opinion. the set design, the cinematography and john williams score must also not be ignored.may the force be with you!"
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,"Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker was fun from beginning to end. The number of old friends that come back to bid us farewell was a treat unto itself. The new characters introduced blended right into the story. The Rise of Skywalker moved me to tears many times. Aside from one totally unnecessary romantic moment, I loved this movie, though it is mixed with the sadness of saying goodbye."
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,This movie was surprisingly good. I liked it despite many people hating on the new trilogy.
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,"It spends a lot of time trying to make up for the disaster of The Last Jedi. I wasn't expecting much so, in that respect, it over delivered. The sloppy writing continues (a good amount of dialogue recycled from previous Star War films) but on the whole the story is entertaining. In retrospect, I wish this film could have been split into 2 films with more attention paid to the story in general, and get rid of The Last Jedi (very aggravating to sit through)."
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,suspense the battle the dialogue graphic
"Jan 13, 2020",negative,This movie was a risk-less pile of horse manure. Script was terrible--- and completely ignored the second film. It was confusing. It was awful.
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,"Many problems were present, but it was a very watchable movie."
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,I believe this is my favorite episode of the Star Wars saga. it was full of action and drama with a special twist and just the right amount of comedy.
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,"Loved the many cameos of so many SW characters. The treatment of Leia was beautiful. There were some plot holes (don't star destroyers have shields) but overall, the movie was well worth it."
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,Ending should have been better. But I enjoy it.
"Jan 13, 2020",negative,"Sinopsis: the wizard did it 
Terrible"
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,Loved it. Liked how loose ends tied up
"Jan 13, 2020",neutral,Fun but...kinda pointless. Bringing back Palpy was always going to be an eh move for me. The pacing was terrible and too many characters to actually be capable of focusing on any of them enough for there to be any development. Among my least favorite Star Wars movies. I'm good on Star Wars movies for a while now...
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,Excellent! We really enjoyed the movie. A must see!
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,"I finally saw Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker last night---in Dolby at AMC Vernon Hills. 
I liked the movie and seeing the nine-part epic (starting in 1977) completed. 
The picture and sound were awesome and the movie had the fun and adventurous vibe of A New Hope. 

The first one-third of the movie was cool but didn't totally grab me. 
But those plot surprises in the middle (the ghosts of Han and Luke) really kick-started things for me. 
The last two-thirds were stupendous, especially the space battle and confrontation between Rey and Emperor Palpatine. 
I'm glad Poe was named general. I liked the various alien characters introduced, too. 
I think Rey and Finn had their strongest performances in this movie."
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,Pretty good Star wars Movir
"Jan 13, 2020",neutral,"While infinitely better than TLJ, this is largely because they retcon that movie and actively try to fix its mistakes. The take away from this movie is that the skywalkers don't matter. Vader is little more than a footnote in the galactic history. The first two films of this series could literally be completely done away with and have no consequences on this film. This would have been a great first film in the trilogy if you add about 10 minutes of introduction material to familiarize the audience with the characters. Rise of Skywalker is entertaining on its own, and unlike TLJ will not enrage the serious fan. However, this entire trilogy was mishandled from the start and is a very disappointing ending to a legendary series and a huge disservice to the first family of the Star Wars universe."
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,"I really enjoyed the movie. I thought it was better than the two previous one. A lot of action ,fast paced."
"Jan 13, 2020",negative,"This would be nothing more than a scatterbrained sci-fi film with an often baffling plot if it weren't the last movie in an epic saga that's touched generations. But it is, which makes it an egregious reversal of the works that came before it and a slip-shod ending to the series that makes you wonder - what did the sequel trilogy add to the Star Wars story at all?"
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,It was fast paced and interesting.  I didn't fall asleep!!!!!
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,"I really liked, thought that JJ Abrams did a great job of wrapping things up. The small touches were the best, like Chewie finally getting his medal he was cheated out of in A New Hope!"
"Jan 13, 2020",negative,"Honestly, this movie is a mess. JJ Abrams (who I'm generally a fan of) seems more interested in kowtowing to the loudest and most obnoxious corners of the Star Wars fan base than he does in actually crafting the best story and best ending to the Skywalker saga. Also, his attempts to undo much of what Rian Johnson did in the previous film feel both disjointed and petty. I give it two stars in that it was fun to watch for its visuals and it's humor. But the story is.... a mess."
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,I loved this movie! I understand that it was a bit fast paced but it still hit all the Mark's I'm looking for in a Star Wars movie.
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,It was pretty cheesy (like the original). And having all evil summed up in one bad emperor has all the moral depth of a Batman TV episode from the 1960s. BUT I liked the idea of Rea becoming a Skywalker.
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,Absolutely fantastic movie
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,I think it was justice to what rían Johnson did with Star Wars . The force awakens was beautiful to me and set up millions of possibilities with the new trilogy then rian killed all of the story and meaning of Star Wars in the last jedi and what ji did with the movie I personally think it does justice for everything that happened
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,Great finish to the StarWars series an emotional rollercoaster with twists and turns and the most heart-pounding story and action
"Jan 13, 2020",negative,"What a complete mess. The passing of this film is all over the place, very over done on the fan service. Massive plot holes, jump cuts and terrible acting ""they fly now,they fly now"". After last Jedi I thought this would be a train wreck and I was right. Stick with the original 3 films."
"Jan 13, 2020",negative,"After 2/3rds of a trilogy with no overall arc or direction, Rise of Skywalker tries to fit three films worth of storyline into one. It doesn't work.  Rife with plot holes and inconsistencies, it's a bunch fast action sequences stuck together with minimal room for character development or interaction.  Messy and incoherent."
"Jan 13, 2020",negative,Terrible. JJ Abraham’s is a Star Trek fan and he fucked up Star Wars.
"Jan 13, 2020",negative,"I am so disappointed. What a way to make the franchise take several steps backwards, pointlessly undoing the progress the previous entry made. And that KISS! WHAT???"
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,Always dependable for an entertaining movie. Unique imagery not usually in a Star Wars movie.
"Jan 13, 2020",neutral,Nothing new just closed old stories
"Jan 13, 2020",negative,"Split in the middle on this film.  Beautiful and epic, it's action packed and continually trying to push you to the story's end.  At the same time, it is sloppy.  Storytelling is all over the place with incomplete, neglected story lines. 

I love watching, but hated following along and not hearing a story.  It's difficult to discuss with friends, so we don't talk about it.  So disappointing to not be able to share this with friends."
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,I really enjoyed how they tied the whole series up in the end - I found it totally enjoyable and thrill ride!
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,They did a great job finishing the loose ends .
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,Great movie! Recommend!
"Jan 13, 2020",negative,Хуже лишь зомби могут снять фильм!!!
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,"Great movie, didn't expect to see some of the twists and turns this movie offered.  Special effects were great, probably one of the best Star Wars movies to date.  Can't believe this is the last one, I've been watching this series since I was much younger."
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,All the Kylo Ren and Ben Solo scenes were my favorite. But the pacing was too fast. I cant believe too much action in a SW movie was too much for me. Daisy did great! I loved John. Isaac was perfect.
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,Much better than the first two sequels
"Jan 13, 2020",negative,The film was honestly just what I expected. The mess of a conclusion that stems from not having a thought out plan or directorial view for the trilogy. The first film was a new hope rip off. The second film really pulled away from a lot of the tropes and did a great job of stripping star wars down to what is really important. Not lineage or generational power but good will and hope. This third film ruins all of the good work of the second film and backtracks to a very underwhelming conclusion. It makes a couple of brave storytelling decisions but never has the balls to stick to them and retcons them in the later scenes. It really is quite tragic. There is also a horrifically forced love story at the very end that is never set up or justified in any way.
"Jan 13, 2020",negative,"The original Star Wars were amazing. But now ep. 7-9 have no point. it's only a lot of beauty pictures. no actor playing, no scenario. disney filmed it only for making money. it's desgusting"
"Jan 13, 2020",negative,"Disgusting!! No story, mary sue bs, paplapatine's return makes no sense!!"
"Jan 13, 2020",negative,"It seemed that all of the writers had their own agenda, and it showed. This movie like The Last Jedi looked thrown together to make the most epic fight scenes but lacked any real depth. Fin doesn't show any signs in the first two movies to be force sensitive, and then all of a sudden he is in this movie? There are too many things to type out that I found wrong with this movie."
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,4DX is the way to go!
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,It was true to the original trilogy. Lots of action. Dont want to say more and be a spoiler.
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,"It's very enjoyable and gives the saga a satisfying ending but like most of JJ Abrams work, it isn't very original."
"Jan 13, 2020",neutral,"Star Wars: Rise of Skywalker is just fanservice. It isn't bad it isn't good it's just mediocre. The worst part about the movie is how it completely just tries and forgets about episode eight and it should have stayed on the track that Ryan Johnson set it on. You may think Last Jedi was bad or good but you should at least not get rid of a whole movie plotline someone worked on. In the end, the movie made me say leaving the theater ""I did not just watch the last star wars movie""."
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,"It was enjoyable.  Very questionable decisions made by Abrams, but enjoyable."
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,Already long movie but some plot points needed more bows on them.  Didn't like that certain characters died.  Liked the feel of the movie.  The ending of the bad empire feels incompelte.
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,Very entertaining throughout. The visuals and special effects are excellent. The story line was good. My wife and I liked everything about it. I think the critics are being way too harsh. Enjoy it for what it is...epic Star Wars!
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,"A satisfying conclusion to this particular trilogy, this committee-made film has enough to satisfy every Star Wars fan whoever their favorite is."
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,"I thought it was a fitting end to the saga.  Things were tied up a little too neatly, everything ended the way we all wanted it to (unless you were a fan of the Sith Lords), but I liked it a lot!"
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,It was a very moving storyline. The characters were well developed and the acting was very good. I would watch the movie again!
"Jan 13, 2020",negative,"Poor ending for a poor trilogy.  There were so many problems with this film's story.  The return of Palpatine was a huge let down.  So many lame story points.  It did not end the ""Skywalker saga"" at all.  Stupid."
"Jan 13, 2020",negative,"They failed. Very disappointed, I have never not liked and endorsed a Star Wars movie till now."
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,"I always enjoy Star Wars movies, and this was no exception. That being said, it fell far short of its potential potential. The story felt too rushed, with important plot points completely unexplained, and the stakes didn't seem real. It was also pretty obviously trying to undo some of the bold and interesting storytelling choices of The Last Jedi. On the other hand, the completion of the character arches for Rey, Finn, Poe, Kylo, and even C3P0 were satisfying for me. 

Aside from the plot, this movie excelled. The cinematography and the choreography of the fight scenes were mesmerizing. The music was incredible, probably my favorite Star Wars score to date (though it disappointingly didn't include Duel of the Fates, as the trailer led me to believe it would). 

Overall, probably one of the higher of the lower tier of Star Wars movies. It could definitely be better, but that didn't stop me from enjoying it, nor will it prevent me from seeing it again."
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,Lots of action and some surprises
"Jan 13, 2020",negative,"This was pretty terrible. My husband (who likes all movies) actually called it awful. The acting was incredibly poor and it oozed with cheese. I really enjoyed the past star wars, this one couldn't get over soon enough. 20 bucks and 2 1/2 hours we definitely wasted."
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,"Deus Ex Machina followed by Diabolous ex Machina.
Lead villain comes right the h__l out of nowhere.
Jedi powers unbelievable, even in the universe lore
At least 6 beloved characters robbed of their agency.
Pros: lots of action, plenty of meaningful interaction. New toys to buy--I guess."
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,"I thought the movie was a fitting and grand conclusion to an epic saga, tied up a lot of plot-lines, and heavily had callbacks to the previous films.  However, I thought you could see this movie in a Stand Alone way, without it's companions and it would work well.   This isn't an ""art"" film, it won't challenge you on an intellectual level, but it's a great film for fans, and people who like compelling characters and great story."
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,"I felt there was a bit too much swashbuckling type action. Samo, samo, story. Got to destroy Final order fleet!!
Impossible to have a thousand bad guy ships hiding for many years?
After 9 movies, we still dont know exactly who was Anakins/Darth Vaders father???, OR who are REys natural parents???"
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,"As a lifelong Star Wars fan, I thought Abrams did the best he could with the material he had. As a fan, I don't agree with many of the plot points, but the action was spectacular and would recommend that you see it if you like Sci-fi, action or the Force. I am glad to be taking a brief break from the movies, but I am looking forward to the next series outside of the Skywalker saga. For those of you who have heard about the JJ cut, I truly hope they bring it as I felt disappointed by the ""mind-blowing"" ending that was promised."
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,Everything you want in a Star Wars movie!
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,"There were some holes or things that didn't make sense in the movie that I didn't like, but with a new director I get it. There were a few things that happened, that didn't need to, but again I get it. The graphics were great, and overall didn't make sitting through a 2.5hr movie terrible."
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,"I love it, jaw dropping and a lot of action"
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,"Loved the action and all of the fight scenes. Star Wars in general can be a difficult movie to follow because of the movie plot language involved, however the action was amazing."
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,I liked and disliked the ending where ray claims to be a skywalker because it was sad to see the true skywalkers go yet awesome that she took up the name like taking up the torch for the Jeddis.
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,"The Rise of Skywalker is interesting. The editing is so erratic and quick that you can tell they wanted to put as much as possible in this film. I'm honestly exhausted from it. It would have benefited from longer run time to let moments breathe. It really felt like they tried to cram two films into this one (for one reason or another). I really hope there is a 3-hour directors cut released at some point. I cannot confirm this but I don't think they abided by the conventional Star Wars pacing chart (google it) and therefore it doesn't have the cadence of a regular Star Wars film.

That being said... welp... it's very hard not to say anything without spoiling it. Like Endgame or Infinity War, you cant talk about the content (even vaguely) without spoiling it cause it moves so fast. However, I'd say that the film gave me whiplash. Reveals happen so quickly that it's hard to take in the last thing that happened. So quick that some setups are immediately paid off within a single scene. It has no time to pump the breaks at all. There isn't really an A and B plot but a super-strong A plot that just plows through the story.

As a Star Wars fan, there are some moments that I almost loathe but also some moments that I really love. It's a fast-moving mixed bag but it finishes the Saga adequately. Old lines and quips come back full force and are nestled into the fabric of this movie. Definitely see it for yourself and talk to me about it."
"Jan 13, 2020",negative,"Very glaring flaws but it just managed to cover the bare essentials of ""what makes a star wars movie"". The script is entirely reliant on luck and no plot point really feels earned, not to mention how many unexplained, new abilities are granted to the protagonist. Overall, the scriptwriting was atrocious and the damage control from its predecessor could have been managed a lot better but, in the end, it was an enjoyable movie. 4/10."
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,Unexpected and exciting. I loved this one!
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,"Great finale to the trilogy, plenty of action & vidual effects, lots of suspense and a good plot twist"
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,Brainless but not as outright offensive as the critics seem to suggest.
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,Solid Star Wars movie. My daughter and I both enjoyed! Was not expecting too because of poor ratings!
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,"As a stand alone film I thought it was great! It had  great visuals and brilliant lightsaber duels and I really enjoyed watching it! But I didn't think it lived up the plots of the original trilogy and prequels. On the whole though, it was pretty good and I'd recommend giving it a watch!"
"Jan 13, 2020",negative,"Nothing more than one fight scene after another. Violence for the sake of violence. Poor plot with too many holes. Ridiculous movie. I went to see it because it was rated as no bad language, but it was a really bad movie."
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,Loved the action and the plot.
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,They tied up loose ends... By making new loose ends.
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,"certainly the best of the trilogy.  Abrams tries to remedy some plot holes created in previous episodes.  The end result is a film that is enjoyable but which, in my opinion, is not Star Wars."
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,story line was great - a lot was left open for more stories in the future!
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,Nice wrap up. Lots of ambiguous plot movement but great action. I would definitely recommend seeing this film.
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,"Good movie overall.  A lot of action.  My only letdown was why they had to go to so many places to accomplish their mission.   Otherwise, this was still a well done movie."
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,Took my grandkids so they could experience what my kids did when I took them to the first Star Wars in 1977. No one was disappointed!
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,"Before going I had heard mixed reviews from Star Wars fans regarding the plot/story line. No one told me any spoilers, just that they either liked or had mixed feelings about this movie. Personally I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. I felt that it was good mix of action and story line. (Even in places I didn't necessarily agree with the story line direction.) I don't want to give away any spoilers, but it felt a lot like Return of the Jedi."
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,"I'm one of the few that enjoyed the curve ball Rian Johnson threw with The Last Jedi. Although it would have been nice to see J.J. Abrams make the occasional bold move, in The Rise Of Skywalker he unstitches and resews plot points from the predecessor. The pacing in the first act feels rushed and could possibly be an entry in to the saga on its own. However, it serves as a perfect ending for the Disney trilogy."
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,"For me it had it all!! All the good stuff we already know, but what made it more like six star was the clear direction, hence fully understandable, plot, well placed light humor, and the same with touching moments. Balance and direction, outstanding!!"
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,Everything expected from a Star Wars movie!
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,This movie was an epic conclusion to the Skywalker Saga. JJ Abrams perfectly ties the Skywalker Saga in a neat little bow with this enjoyable film. Some minor flaws here or there but the best Star Wars Film to date.
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,"Since 1977 to 2020, Ive enjoyed the Skywalker saga. Im satisfied with the last chapter.  Ties up everything nicely."
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,"The critics are idiots on this one.  It's a kids movie, and it was fun.  My 10 and 14 year olds both loved it, and so did their old man who was a teenager for the original.  Best of the new series of Star Wars films, and far superior than any of the reboot.  Rey and Ren were both awesome together.  Loved it.  and I only cried a little bit when Leia died onscreen."
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,"Definitely the best of the new trilogy, this movie had everything a good Star Wars film needs, and with great payoff too. I don't understand why people are hating on this film, as it was greatly enjoyable and truly brought the viewer on a roller-coaster ride of emotions."
"Jan 13, 2020",negative,"I have seen the Rise of Skywalker finally.
Mostly, nothing wrong with the acting, but the story line was over extreme.
I understand from reading that JJ Abrams appears to have a Ho-Hum attitude towards people's critique of his work.  I suppose from his point of view; he can't please everyone.  That is rather a defeatist attitude to adopt. 
I saw Star Wars and The Empire Strikes Back in cinemas on their first runs.  I was a child and was blown away, naturally, nothing had ever come close to this new franchise.  I saw Jedi a little later, around 1993 and loved it.  I was in my 20's by then and had enough time lapse to have an opinion beyond that of a child.
Six years later comes The Phantom Menace and I was caught up in the media frenzy.  Internet was a new toy to most of us and I loved it.  However, reflection occurs and I despise the Jar Jar Binks Character.  My kids enjoyed the prequels, especially the Revenge of the Sith.  What an awesome movie. So, my kids then saw  the original trilogy and were in awe.  They preferred them and for good reason.
Then, years later, my eldest daughter doing her masters degree in digital animation and effects.  She sees the Farce Awakens and enjoyed it mildly. Very much a critique of the dire acting the forced coincidences of the movie and she actually opened my eyes to the mess of the story.  The ridiculous notion that a planet can be formed into a base and still contain seasons and life, whilst sucking the fuel from a star.  Then the carbon copy of a New Hope action.
As a fan of the movies, I am always interested in peoples opinions, a talking point; naturally.  
My opinion is that Rian Johnson should have been watched carefully.  I see he has become a scapegoat for the crap he turned out.  JJ Abrams was involved... I saw his name in credits...so why didn't he do something about it?
The Force Awakens was a mess, plastic acting (Daisy Ridley) over acting (John Boyega). Apparently, Poe Dameron can fly an X-Wing in gravitational forces and not pass out. He can also shoot down everything all around him. 
The Last Jedi was Rian Johnson giving the main protagonist a personality make-over. Ruining everything George Lucas created.  The Last Jedi is utter crap, as a movie and as huge waste of money and resources. Yes, it sold tickets, because it's Star Wars.  But it doesn't rake back and pay for the loans Disney took to purchase Lucas Film.
Ticket sales bombed and didn't make the profit and lost money. (After paying the loans back.)
The Rise of Skywalker.  I will admit, Abrams had the shite task of mopping up the bloody mess Rian Johnson left behind.  Here's a clue boyo, when you produce something, make sure you keep an eye on what is being churned out.  The Salkinds did with Superman The Movie, firing the director for over shoots.  George Lucas did with The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. (Not that Irvin Kerschner needed help)
Why didn't you?  Oh.. because it's your name and you expect it to sell.  Bottom line mate, your movies stink and you're rich.   If you were my employee, losing money, you'd down the road in the dole queue.
Of course, much like Paul Feig and Ghostbusters, you can't complain, because people like Kathleen Kennedy accuse you of being sexist, racist or what ever else is the fanciful name calling of the day.
Fans were so upset with the Last Jedi, they tried to raise money to have it re-done.  Rian Johnson laughed at them.  What a complete tosser.  Johnson upset the core people then laughs in their faces.
This latest instalment is full of the same nonsensical character change rubbish.  Palptine. Same actor, same voice...but what?  Talking in a way that just isn't reminiscent of previous movies.  you can't do that!! It raises eyebrows and people hate the continuity errors.
When Mark Hamill is telling you something is wrong, you would do well to listen. Everything has gone wrong.
I don't know where to start with this movie.  It was the worst idea in the history of bad ideas. There wasn't even breathing space, character reflection, a feeling of purpose.  Actually speak to fans, get a feeling for a loved franchise before you destroy their hopes in turn for your own vision, which, let's face it, it's your vision and it has nothing to do with the lore.
Palpatine taking out entire fleets of ships alone? I can't say anymore.  Let this one get flushed into the river with the rest of the turds."
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,Good ending nice to see old characters
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,"Loved, loved, loved this movie.  We were sitting on the edge of our seats with all of the action, special effects, laughter, and crying.  A lot of emotions were brought up in this movie, so it was well worth the money, time, and effort to go and see it.  We also didn't notice how long the movie was, since we were so into the movie."
"Jan 13, 2020",neutral,"short on depth of story line, could have had real depth but left it wanting."
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,"The best that could have been expected after TLJ.  I have been to the movies to see every mainline Star Wars film since the original but I was highly disappointed after the last instalment.  Critics will pan Rise of Skywalker as having too many reused plot points and callbacks but that's kind of the point a set of three trilogies each about a different generation but each facing the same battle of light and dark one finds darkness, one light, and finally one balance.  The stories should be similar. Abrams understands Star Wars in this context, Kennedy and Johnson do not.  I watched this film and enjoyed myself no out of place jokes to take me out of the story, no heavy-handed social commentary paired with pointless side missions, and no attempt at creating a NEW Star Wars without finishing the old.  Yes the pacing was very fast, and a good bit of deus ex machina use but I enjoyed it and did not come out of the theater having to convince myself that I liked it, like I did after A Phantom Menace or utterly despondent like after The Last Jedi.  I came out of the theater feeling like I had seen a Star Wars film a real Star Wars film."
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,Excellent movie. Good wrapup to the original Star Wars thread.
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,"I thought this was a pretty good film.  Nothing is ever perfect, but this is a good installment in the Star Wars  series."
"Jan 13, 2020",negative,"This film was just a total mess! The pacing was way too fast and all over the place, the plot hammered too much stuff into it and it was trying too hard to please everyone in the fandom. Say what you want about TFA and TLJ, at least they had a steady flow and pace to them. It's obvious that Disney/Lucasfilm was desperately trying to win back the fans who hated TLJ and didn't see Solo, but also didn't have a plan/structure for how this 'Sequel Trilogy' would pan out. I didn't hate this film, but as the 'final' instalment to a 40+ year long saga that changed the face of sci-fi and cinema, it just doesn't live up."
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,loved it!! felt very nostalgic!
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,I liked how it was a happy ending but it was a little predictable.
"Jan 13, 2020",negative,"Brilliant visuals, but no stakes. Blow up the one thing and everything is defeated with no real cost. A forgettable entry to Star Wars and a wasted opportunity imo"
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,"Really don't understand the hate, I'm a lifelong Star Wars fan and I loved it, for me it tied up all loose ends, it answered all my questions and there were enough laughs and feel good moments that left me smiling all the way through. The action is spectacular and the space battles are breathtaking. I was looking forward to this and I wasn't let down. Bloody brilliant!"
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,At this point if you’ve seen one you’ve kind of seen them all. Formulaic to the point of predictability.
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,This was the perfect ending to the perfect Saga.
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,A excellent final conclusion to another controversial Star Wars film. See you next trilogy when everyone hates it all over again then we wait 15 years and go eh maybe it wasnt that bad
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,Excellent movie! Well done!
"Jan 13, 2020",neutral,Too many stories crammed into one movie. Lazy writing. Whenever anyone was in peril there was an immediate solution to the problem. I still liked it because its star wars and it was great for the kids. They loved it. Whoever wrote rouge one should write them all.
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,Loved it. Was never a Star Wars fan till my husband sat me down and we watched every single one and Im hooked. This movie was amazing cant wait to see more Star Wars movies
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,"More dialogue and screen time regarding Reys parents would have been nice but great way to end the saga that Ive loved for over 40 years, from the very beginning."
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,"Outstanding 
I believe that they tied up any and all loose strings. A great way to cap the 9 movies"
"Jan 13, 2020",negative,Messy story. Fast paced to avoid giving you time to release how poorly written it is.
"Jan 13, 2020",negative,"Does too much. This film desperately tries to save the car crash that was the Last Jedi, but fails.."
"Jan 13, 2020",neutral,"Two much like fan fiction. Tell me a story, show me a good film. Mainly appeals to nostalgia."
"Jan 13, 2020",negative,"Unfortunate. I find it truly hard to believe how one could make such a mess out of a movie, even by incorporating so many characters from different trilogies. The abrupt yet unsurprising revelation of Rey's origins turned out to be quite a substantial disappointment, along with constant scenes with close to zero correlation with each other whatsoever. Everything in this movie is sudden. The most frustrating point is that the movie doesn't care less in explaining certain phenomena. No reasoning is shown for anything the characters do, besides the typical concept of ""hope"". 

Now, incorporating hope is great and all, but when it's mentioned in every last second of the film? Not everyone's favorite choice. JJ Abrams did a marvelous job in adding on a nasty tail to the great Star Wars series with the most typical dialogue and story lines that define the lack of creativity and organization the new trilogy movies have."
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,"I like the ending, even I have questions about why Emperor Palpatine is in this movie again."
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,Kept you on the edge of your seat!
"Jan 13, 2020",negative,"A mess of a film, bad dialogue, bizarre and pointless plot lines, reliance on fetch quests and MacGuffins, character's given next to no development whatsoever, only thing it has going for it is it looks pretty.

All in all not a satisfying end to this kerfuffle of a trilogy."
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,"Somewhat entertaining. Lightsaber fights were disappointing. Actors done alright. Abrams deflected most problems the Last Jedi left but the trilogy is somewhat pointless, short and uneventful. Pulling Sidous out of the hat is a joke. Disney wiped the extended universe created by like 40years worth of books only to cherry pick elements from it and underutilize them. Those are still the most interesting parts of the trilogy. Creative bankruptcy 100%. Abrams competently made it for sure but I don't feel I'd lose anything if I have not watched any of it which is probably the worst kind of feeling one can get by watching Star Wars. Disney for the love of God, have a plan and let creative people do what they are good at like with the Mandalorian!"
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,"OK, it's not a great movie, but after the mess that was ""The Last Jedi,"" I'll take it. It's a Sci Fi movie that is supposed to be fun. It honors all the characters, new and old that we fans care about. Job done."
"Jan 13, 2020",negative,Way to crap all over the Star Wars legacy Disney!
"Jan 13, 2020",negative,"You're doomed from the 1st second when the main antagonist of a story/trilogy is introduced to the trilogy in the opening crawl of the 3rd movie. This is what you get when you'd rather please a group of people (fans) than actually TELL A STORY.

I love Star Wars. I love this universe, but after 9 movies and 4 decades, and ending these stories like this is just disappointing."
"Jan 13, 2020",negative,"I can't stand this trilogy anymore after seeing The Rise of Skywalker. For a movie that has this much going on I have never experienced such an anti-climatic ending for a story. With a plot twist straight out from Star Wars theory subreddit, Disney managed to destroy everything that had been built by the two previous episodes. And to think about that we had to sacrifice the Star Wars EU for this half-assed junk."
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,I truly hope that we haven't seen the last of Rey and Ben solos relationship. Or the whole squad for that matter. Please Disney!
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,"I absolutely loved this movie! It is the first star wars movie that had truly emotional impact. It had really funny moments, moments where I had tears running down my face, and moments where I wanted to cheer out loud! I am a true star wars fan. However I don't get so wrapped up in expectations. I truly believe that rise of Skywalker is the best movie out of the 9. I know it is sacreligous to say that but I also truly love the prequels. Too many fans are all wrapped up in only liking the 4,5,and 6. Well they are great movies but so are the prequels. Last jedi is the only one that I would say that I think is good but not great."
"Jan 13, 2020",negative,"The movie is absolutely awful start to finish. From the terrible pacing, to the nonsensical plot, to a terrible character arc for Rey. This movie makes the whole sequel trilogy worthless and in desperate need of being removed from canon. All Disney has to do is recreate the great stories from the many novels like Darth Bane's trilogy or the stories of Revan and Darth Plagueis yet they allowed JJ Abrams to single handedly ruin Star Wars by doing a remake of A New Hope and then this latest disaster."
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,"The critics are crazy.  Great movie, one of my favorite in the entire series."
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,Who cares what the critics have to say! I really enjoyed this film
"Jan 13, 2020",negative,they cut my boy Anakin SKYWALKER out of the movie to Focus on Rey.. ok funny I was sitting here thinking the movie was called the rise of SKYWALKER
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,Continues to relive my childhood with each succesive movie. Episode IX did not disappoint.
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,"I seemed to enjoy it at the time, but 12 months later. I have no real memory of the movie."
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,"Entertaining, I recommend it."
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,It was a great story and well done. The actors and actresses were amazing. It definitely parallels Luke's story and there were a few times I got a Harry Potter vibe.
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,I loved it!  Great way to end the Skywalker Saga
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,it is an end of an era for those of us who were among the first ones to see the originals.
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,I can't wait to buy this movie and watch it again!
"Jan 13, 2020",negative,"The Star Wars movies seem to all be the same the same plots, same bots, same scenes, same old characters wandering in and out of the “story”.  This franchise is tired."
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,I was a little lost I've never been a big follower of this series but my son who is 13 loves it and seeing how excited he was and the way it ended was really really awesome 5 stars no question
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,Completely awesome!!!
"Jan 13, 2020",negative,A disappointing end to a franchise. It did not do the story any justice what so ever.
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,"does what a star wars film is meant to do - fun, action packed and not to be taken to seriously!"
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,"I am a huge Star Wars fan and watch everything that’s canon. I didn’t like episodes 7 or 8, but I loved 9. It gave me all the nods to the originals that I wanted. The only thing I wish it would have included was Anakin at the end with Luke and Leia because after all he is the original Skywalker."
"Jan 13, 2020",negative,"Likes Core cast ( Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac ) had good chemistry. Babu Frik.
Dislike: Everything else. Regardless of how anyone felt about the last movie, the fact that so much of this movie is spent undoing TLJ is at best counter productive. There is zero logic or internal consistency, I counted at least half a dozen character deaths that were quickly undone within the film. While it can be hard to gauge the intent of a filmmaker, they probably didn't want me laughing out loud during their big dramatic moments, and yet, here we are. 

The difference between an error and a mistake is simple. Anyone can commit an error, but it doesn't become a mistake until you refuse to correct it. The sequel trilogy thus ends as a huge, pretty looking, and very expensive mistake."
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,By far.. The best... Star Wars movie... Ever made!!
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,"Best Star Wars movie ever! One critic said it lacked emotion, he is devoid of it  obviously. Story and graphics top notch. Saw it twice and loved it as much the second time!"
"Jan 13, 2020",negative,"2-1/2 hours I will never get back. Recycled dialogue disguised as homage. Incomprehensible relationships. Idiotic plot devices. Baffling storylines. I started timing the intervals between explosions, which devolved from less than 3 minutes to nearly constant. I give it 1-1/2 stars only because I pity the otherwise fine actors involved."
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,"I took my 13 year old twin grandsons who are all about everything Star Wars. They enjoyed the movie, however I found it interesting they only gave it a 7 out of 10. I really expected much more from them than a 7.
As someone that doesn't know much about Star Wars, it held my interest and kept me on the edge of my seat. It was really long."
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,"Absolutely amazing, only thing was if your a true Star Wars fan you would notice a fue errors but still an amazing movie."
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,good ending to the series
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,I'm confused about the story line.  I have lost track of all the characters.
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,"i felt it was a good movie,  was not expecting a block buster,  just a good movie,  i was not disappointed."
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,I loved this Star Wars. I think it was one of the best ones
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,"I thoroughly enjoyed the movie.  I didn't go in with my notepad ready to pick it apart.  I went in with the desire to be entertained.  You know, sit down with pop corn and a soda and get taken somewhere else for a couple hours.  And Rise of Skywalker did just that.  The humor was fun, the action was fun, the character interaction was well done.  And I'll be honest, I thought the acting was well done.  When the characters had dialog among themselves it seemed natural.  It is easy to see, that if these were actual individuals, in actual times, with these personalities and relationships, this would be how they act and react.   When I watch a SciFi or Fantasy or action blow 'em up style flicks, I'm looking for entertainment.  I do not need huge emotional development or payoff or commentary or reflection on modern times.  If I wanted any of mommy or daddy of family tragedy and drama, well... Hollywood still makes Oscar contenders for a few million a pop.  But Star Wars, that is for fun and Rise of Skywalker delivered."
"Jan 13, 2020",negative,"An absolute mess of a film. J.J. Abrams TROS is riddled with bad acting, an even worse story line and cheap fan service. This film is truly an insult on a long list of insults to the original trilogy. While George Lucas himself has done many disservices to this beloved franchise on his own; J.J. Abrams, Disney/Lucasfilm and Last Jedi director Rian Jonhson have massacred this conclusion and final trilogy as a whole. The main issues of the film are simple: 1. A single film cannot fix the mistakes of the previous two films even if it were 5 hours long. 2. J.J. Abrams has and possibly never will learn how to end a story that leaves audiences feel truly satisfied or even wrap up the narrative in a precise fashion, With the immense responsibility of ending such a beloved franchise Mr. Abrams ultimately fails and its not a pretty sight. 3. The first act of the film is such a mess of unfinished story lines there is no way to redeem this film. You can paint a pile of shit gold with flashy CGI and cheap fan service but its still just a gold smelly shit."
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,Great goodness I watched it twice. I loved it.
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,"Lots of action, enjoyed it!"
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,"The story had so much heart, and I honestly did not what know what to expect I loved the ending! Of course there are always a few small unexplained things (when did the force start doing...?) , but overall it was a great story, and true to the series."
"Jan 13, 2020",negative,Pure garbage... Disgraceful to the starwars legacy
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,"When all is said and done, the film is magical, but sometimes in ways that require you to believe in magic—you know, as in in fairy godmothers—with some characters appearing out of the blue to help resolve old wounds.  And yet, when all is said and done, I did have loads of fun watching this movie, taking in its grandeur. It's a hell of a ride nearly from beginning to end. Just don't expect the ride you are taken on to always make sense."
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,I liked it better than the reviews said I might! Cant miss it if youre a a Star Wars fan!
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,Great!  Star Wars fans will not be disappointed!
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,"The ending, wish it couldve been more to it."
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,"For fans, I believe it was a fulfilling, satisfying end to the story.  A winning stand alone movie, with enough easter eggs and parallels to make even the most hard-core fan smile."
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,It was good a few corney emotional parts at the end but I liked it
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,"Best of the recent three, and perhaps the best new character of the recent three!"
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,The best one in the latest trilogy!
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,"Story felt rushed, too much flash/bang and extras that didnt have a lot of value to the story."
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,Better than the last 3 Star Wars movies with more story and closed all the less clear issues. A must see for anyone that has watched this series.
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,We thoroughly enjoyed it
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,The movie was very entertaining and better than the last one!
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,"I loved every second of this movie.. and in sorry for anyone that wasn't moved by it.. I was looking to be disappointed, but I felt the complete opposite.. wonderful directing and acting!! I should mention I did not like the last movie lol"
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,"Finally watched.Speechless. I found and excuse every weekend to not go, but deep inside I really did not want to watch the end of these series since it meant the end of what truly awaken my love for movies.Kinda sad to say goodbye but the movie was absolutely beautiful."
"Jan 13, 2020",negative,"Unnecessary ending for an unnecessary continuation of the saga. Money spoke louder than artistic need. Not logical, not believable, and not original. A forgettable movie that should not have have happened after the original unforgettable trilogy from the 80s"
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,"Enjoyable film, the story was super rusb but the action kept the story moving forward and there was always something happening which made the film not drag"
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,"Everything about this movie was awesome! I couldn't want for anything more, so much action, everything was summed up, so many years as this series ends."
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,"Loved movie, everything you expect from a star wars movie and more!

Minor quip
they had technical difficulty starting move but told us it would play but be a little late 
I think they did every thing they could to keep on time."
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,"This review is coming from someone who hated Episodes 7 & 8. I made peace with 7, but 8 was a disaster. That being said...
JJ Abrams did a marvelous job concluding the Skywalker saga. I'm a diehard fan of Star Wars, and though 7 & 8 were absolute travesties, but JJ did a good job. I made a Rotten Tomatoes account just to leave this review.
Yes, it feels jumpy and there are some awkward things in it but JJ had to fix the screw up Rian Johnson did, and if you can understand that, the movie becomes that much better.
If you have reservations about the film, its worth it. Its better than the last two and was done right.

Thank you JJ Abrams."
"Jan 13, 2020",negative,"From reverting the climax of the original trilogy to more shitting on the Skywalker name by having Rey even vaguely associated with it, this film isn't just a lacklustre film for the modern series, but also feels it has to drag Lucas's orginals with it."
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,"To be honest, it’s the best one to watch for a casual fan."
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,"Loved the action and the excitement. The story was great to finish the three trilogies. Looking forward to more Star Wars stories. Not an ending, but a beginning."
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,"The first half was all over the place, and sadly how our princess was treated in the film was really bad. After the half way point however it became the Star Wars movie it should of been."
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,"Loved it. Suck it, nerds."
"Jan 13, 2020",negative,"The worst of the whole series! Even without Jar-Jar...it was horrible. I won't go into specifics (don't want to put out any spoilers), but this movie was just not entertaining to watch at all. It was a huge let down...from the plot/screenplay, to the acting and the way too numerous one liners that were thrown in there to try to liven up the script. I almost didn't go see the movie because J.J. was in charge. He killed Transformers with the last few he did...now he has done the same to Jedi. I left before the movie was over. I couldn't take it after we found out Ren's family heritage etc."
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,It was amazing!  I've already seen it four times.  I cried like a little girl with a skinned knee.
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,"I loved this movie! I don't break down every aspect, I just enjoy. It wrapped up the series that I've enjoyed since 1977 (I try to forget episodes I-III) in a very satisfying way."
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,F*** the critics the movie was fantastic
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,Loved Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker!  It keeps you on the edge of your seat.  Very entertaining.
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,"I thought it was a good film.  There are a few minor issues. For example, we see a pilot climb into an A-wing, but when he's shut down we see an X-wing crash.  Over all, I really enjoyed it."
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,No comment.  It is a good movie.
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,"Great Movie, comfortable seats and environment. Tickets were very easy purchase"
"Jan 13, 2020",negative,If you hated the last jedi you're not gonna like this one either. This movie is pretty cringe with everything they try to force in to fix the mistakes made from the last movie. Just wait to see it in Disney+.
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,"Although a little cheesy (bringing *every* character back in one form or another) that also made it very satisfying. The themes of love, of family (there was only one bad apple to the end), and hope to overcome a dangerous legacy have universal appeal."
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,Its a Star Wars movie so that gets at least 3 stars.   Nothing new or exciting so no additional stars.  The Mandalorian storylines are much better & Solo/Rogue One were better than any of this trilogy.  Very disappointed in Disney for not giving the fans a better product.
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,"Even with some story issues, this is a phenomenal movie and great way to end the saga! Never a dull moment!"
"Jan 13, 2020",negative,"Really great visual effects and Adam Driver is great, but other than that it's way to fast pace and bloated and there is no development or heart in any of the emotional subplots or any plot at all because of that. The ending was stupid to, its just a bad conclusion to trilogy."
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,It was awesome. Still think there is more. 😊
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,Absolutely amazing from start to finish!
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,"One of my favorite Star Wars movies. I am so grateful to everyone who brought this story to us, and these characters who I will miss so much. (We love Rey!) This movie was made with so much care, love for the source material, and and absolute attention to detail that left me so satisfied and teary eyed."
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,Enjoyed every moment!
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,Script should have been written and directed by George Lucas to complete the 42-year vision.
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,Amazing film. Best of this series. A little hear wrenching.
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,Loved it although they’ll need to start a new evil somewhere for continuity sake.
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,Yea I didn’t need my heart. You can have that. Amazing movie!!
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,What an amazing movie
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,Great addition to Star Wars!  Nice way to tight it all together!
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,"So hood, I watched it twice!"
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,Great conclusion to the 43 year old series!
"Jan 13, 2020",negative,"It should have come out at Thanksgiving, right along side of all the other turkeys.  Ghosts of Star Wars past swoop in for a final cameo, with the possible exceptions of Darth Mar and Jar-Jar Binks.  Dialogue is one cliche after another, each over-acted and incapable of generating any emotion or sympathy.  All in all, its more of an effort to get this thing over with instead of a real plot."
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,"Really enjoyed the movie! Suspenseful, exciting, and just great fun.  Hard to believe it's been 43 years since the 1st Star Wars."
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,Hoping this isn’t the last we see of Skywalker !!  We loved all of it.
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,"It kept me entertained, but as a conclusion to the saga...pretty bad overall."
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,it was ok. the ending could've been bettter. but the pace was good. story was ok. the main bad guy was lazy in concept but that's star wars for you.
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,Great movie to watch in 4DX
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,I Loved the storyline and plot!  Well written ending!
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,Thought it was a great movie! Didn’t like the way it ended with Ren and Ben!
"Jan 13, 2020",negative,I'd rather stick an broomstick up my ass than to watch this stupid piece of shit movie again. Just sayin'
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,"Great movie! first time to this theater since it's been changed to AMC, it was actually nice and reasonably priced"
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,The IMAX sound experience was very immersive - I was impressed!
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,"If you are a casual starwars fan you will like it as the characters are actually interesting for once in this saga and it’s visually beautiful. But the whole saga has no good coherence. Furthermore, there are some decent plot wholes in this move that will make you shake your head. For the starwars fans it’s a slander of the original trilogy."
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,Fitting ending to this trilogy.
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,from what jj had to play with. Amazing
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,One of the best.  Kept me engaged from the first scene.
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,"Great movie, action, sci-fi and even romance. Brilliant!"
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,"This movie brought back the older characters Luke, Leia and Hans Solo in interesting storyline twists.  I enjoyed the way they ended the movie.  There were some very happy parts and some very sad parts."
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,My favorite Star Wars Movie of them all!
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,Special Effects and production
"Jan 13, 2020",neutral,"I wanted to like it more but pacing is terrible, and really rushed. 90% of the movie was spent fixing the last Jedi mistakes to appease angry fan boys."
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,Fun and great way to end this trilogy. (Star Wars characters...NOT a Star Wars movie but still entertained)
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,Predictable but fun.
"Jan 13, 2020",negative,"What a waste of an amazing cast. The plot was nonsense. It was so busy retconning and heteronormalizing everyone and everything that the already squicky relationship between Rey and Ren felt hamfisted and forced. It wasted great new characters. Instead of writing engaging scenes for already established characters, it writes them out completely. Rose is treated horribly. Hux is thrown away. Our heroes are less charming and more mean at times. Unbelievably, Ren is dull, Rey is frustrating, only Finn remains even remotely adorable. What even is going on with that plot? It's emotionally manipulating and so hackneyed I can't. Actors and characters are treated horribly in a nonsense, bloated film that thumbs its nose at Millennials and diversity."
"Jan 13, 2020",negative,Whoever decided it was a good idea to make a 40+ year old story almost completely inconsequential deserves to be fired
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,"No, it wasn't perfect, but I believe this was still a great ending to this modern trilogy, despite what the ""purists"" have to say.  In my opinion, if you're going to the movies to be entertained, then this is for you.  If you're going to just go to critique it to and gripe on what you would do instead, then just stay home and continue playing with your Star Wars action figures.  My kids loved it and my wife and I enjoyed it!!  It was worth the money and we will most likely buy it, when it's available to stream."
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,It was ok. It felt like a lot of it was rushed through to get to the end.
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,"The writing has Shakespearean moments, with some wooden dialogue. Overall, it was ok, but not as engaging as The Last Jedi. "
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,It was pretty AWESOME!!
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,loved it!! movie had me interested from beginning to end. may the force be with you!
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,it was ok. repetitive
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,"A great film! Critics of this film are so off-base they themselves are in a galaxy, far, far away. Time to see it again."
"Jan 13, 2020",neutral,"Failed to impress, not the best ending for the series."
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,It was ok. Much better than Last Jedi so that's a bonus. It just felt like they left some things unanswered because of missed opportunities in The Last Jedi.
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,Buttons up almost every question you could have for the entire series.
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,Loved it!! Id goce it 2 thumbs up as a great way to bring a long loved saga to an end.
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,"I was shocked at how much better this was than the previous. It should have been the 2nd of 3, instead of the last."
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,Abrams did a great job rapping up the loose ends.
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,"Emotional, exciting, and true to the Star Wars legacy established in the other films.  Overall very satisfying end to the series."
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,They kept the original cast of people...
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,"I walked out of the theater feeling satisfied, but the nagging issues took root over time and it seems like a slapdash effort to finish the Sequel Trilogy, fueled mostly by nostalgia."
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,"Amazing special effects, closure for previous movies and possible sequel."
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,Amazing! Keeps with the heart and soul that Star Wars has carved out in our lives for the last 40 years!
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,"Better then expected.  But, there’s no reason Star Wars should have been “Better then expected”"
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,I thought it was a great ending to the storyline!
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,Redemption is always a good story theme!!
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,"Critics want the perfect ending for everything. Your not going to get it. But between plot twists you weren't expecting, amazing battles, awesome scenery, and a little bit of inspiration to fight the battles inside you, this movie deserves a lot more credit then the bombing reviews they have been receiving. ""The Rise of Skywalker"" is easily one of my top three favorite Star Wars movies, and I'll be buying it as soon as it releases. May the force be with you!"
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,"A movie made for Star Wars fans....a great conclusion to a story that has captured hearts and minds for 42 years. Not perfect, plenty of storyline holes, BUT satisfying. JJ paid homage to the Star Wars saga..."
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,There was never a dull moment. Great movie! Loved it!
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,"I feel like there was so much more they could have done with it. Felt super rushed. Just, forced honesty. Expected more from Starwars."
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,Epic.  Very good.  Fast paced.
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,Nice wrap up to the saga!
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,Nicely done. They could stop making movies  with this one and I would feel like they answered all my questions.
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,Watched it a 2nd time and loved it even more.  Caught so much more detail this time around.  The beginning isn't perfect because The Last Jedi served as a poor setup.  But it picks up perfectly about 20 minutes in.
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,My son and I loved it.
"Jan 13, 2020",positive,"Eh. Better than ""The Last Jedi"". Didn't take any creative risks and had way to many new characters to care about; every needs to get their ""15 minutes of fame"".
Rey's character deserved more than Daisy Ridley's Angry/Constipated face the entire time. Kylo Ren's arc was the only thing the movie seemed to care about, although I believe it was executed fairly. Very touching moment when he threw his saber away. Hats off to Adam Driver's performance.
At its core, it was a carbon copy of ""Return of the Jedi""."
"Jan 12, 2020",negative,"this film made me cry.
If I want a watch a film where there is little plot (or a pointless and/or convoluted plot) then I wouldn't watch star wars.
Disney took the biggest brand in history and turned it into something people now mock and got bored of.  That takes real talent............."
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,Did a great job of wrapping up the story. A must see at the big screen! The floor won't shake at home like it will in the theater.
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,Enjoyed very much.  Only drawback was lack of clarity in establishing Rae's heritage.
"Jan 12, 2020",negative,"Not my Star Wars. I don't know what has happened since Disney has taken over, but wow this is just really trashed on all levels."
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,"As someone who saw the first one (before it was called ""A New Hope"") at age 13 in the theaters, this was an awesome conclusion to the story.  I don't get all the hate, but if you enjoyed all the movies, it's OK to love this."
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,"Overall an enjoyable movie that unfortunately had to cram far too many plot points into its time due to the terrible mess that was left by TLJ. The movie was also worsened by watching it in 3D. (please! producers/directors/etc, never ever do 3D conversions, they almost always make the end product worse)
It actually made TLJ even worse in retrospect, impossible as that may seem.

It had some nonsensical moments, though they're mostly excusable. (because of the previous reason) And at least it got the overall feeling right for me. I kinda wish they didn't kill off the one character that would have made the ending surname scene make sense. But oh well.

Just like TFA it again makes me tentatively hopeful for the StarWars franchise, despite the flaws in TFA and TRoS."
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,it was good other than Daisy not taking me to the premiere or to see it made.  also IMAX was good but not as good as the 3d in Knoxville.
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,Easily the best of the three sequels. A decent repair job after the dreadful mess of Episode VIII. The acting was excellent. C3PO was a LEGEND in this film. Best outing he's had since the 1978 expanded radio edition of Star Wars. And that's saying something.
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,"I liked everything about this movie. The cast were great, stunts were great. I’m very satisfied with the ending."
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,Great movie! Love the 4DX seats!!
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,It was not the ending to Star Wars I wanted
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,The storm troopers need to be better shots.
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,I loved the special effects especially the sea scenes!
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,Loved it! Didn’t even know Princess Leia would be in it—and she was a major player.
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,"Answered a lot, great movie and great ending to the skywalker story, if that’s the end?"
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,Thought this was a perfect Star Wars movie. Not a perfect movie but it was indeed a perfect STAR WARS MOVIE.
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,A bomb resolution to Star Wars
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,Great ending to a great saga.
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,It did good to close the series!!!
"Jan 12, 2020",negative,Movie was aight. Rey is a palpatine but said she was a Skywalker. Pretty much the only thing that made sense in this movie.
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,Such a great addition to the series.
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,"Saw this with my friends, pretty good, not a lot wrong but it feels bloated at times. But the charecters are amazing and the dialogue is natural and flowing"
"Jan 12, 2020",negative,"The title is misleading because they should’ve titled it, “The Rise of Palpatine.” As that is exactly what took place. Nobody wakes up one morning & says, “gee, I think I’ll change my name to (full in the blank)” because genetically you’re still whoever it is you are that yo ur e trying to disassociate yourself with."
"Jan 12, 2020",neutral,Ok. Some parts are really good. Most is just ok.
"Jan 12, 2020",negative,What a massive let down. Such a shame they couldn't be bothered to plan a 3 movie arc considering the source material. 
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,This was one of the best Star Wars yet in my opinion. If not THE best. Such good pace and action throughout the movie and the acting was terrific. All around it was a terrific movie. 
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,I was so happy to see how they honored Carrie Fisher and the rest of the old guard! Excellent wrap up!
"Jan 12, 2020",negative,"This one was very disappointing! The movie had a  lot of missing holes and often dragged. A lot of scenes felt thrown together and too often Rey's daydreams went on too long. Action was descent, but just overall poor writing!"
"Jan 12, 2020",negative,Uno stupro per la saga
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,It was all right. Not my favorite of the new three. Probably number two after force awakens. Kind of disappointed
"Jan 12, 2020",negative,This movie was the AV equivalent of eating a soggy saltless saltine.
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,Worth every penny. Amazing.
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,I loved the way it rekindled my memory of being a 13 year old in the summer of 1977 and seeing what would eventually be known as Episode IV: A New Hope for the first time.
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,Good ending to the saga! Humorous and very enjoyable. Dragged a bit at times but overall a great movie to watch in theaters
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,"While theres certainly plotholes and problems with this film it certainly rose above The Last Jedi to offer us an satisfying conclusion.  J.J. could have done a much better job, I'm certain, if he'd been in charge of all 3 films, but it is, what it is.  Maybe someday we'll be given a bigger peek into how Lucas really planned the last 3 films, but in the meantime, this will do as an conclusion."
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,I loved it. I loved the the themes and characters. I had a great time watching it.
"Jan 12, 2020",negative,"Embarassing piece of abysmal quality cinema. Badly written, terrible story, boring and meaningless. Undescribable garbage. No emotional involvement can be achieved. Seems written by a child with unlimited funds at his disposal."
"Jan 12, 2020",negative,The movie was like a really bad ending to a sequel that should have never happened. Not only was the story kind of a patch to the last Jedi but it didn't even bother to try to creat something original but instead felt like a terrible recap of the return of the Jedi. The sequels in general were just a terrible mimic of the original three.
"Jan 12, 2020",negative,Just set your expectations to low. It's not horrible.
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,Bad editing. Example Lando and young girl at end.
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,Great ending to a incredible series.
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,"usual, exciting star wars movie."
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,If you don't like this star wars movie you're not a true fan and you probably enjoyed the last Jedi way more then you should.
"Jan 12, 2020",negative,"It's lucky to get two stars. The fact that they had to spend a third of the time making corrections due to the failures of the previous film hampered an already heavily laden movie that needed to waste no time in getting it's work done and out the door. I don't blame the director, the writers or the actors for this. I blame the CEOs and company heads that should have seen this coming, and should have known better. Thanks for making a trilogy I'll only buy out of a bargain bin."
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,"A decent enough conclusion to the new trilogy.  A bit over the top in some ways, but it IS Star Wars;  Ultimately it's a kid series that happens to still appeal to a lot of adults.  So there's going to be a bit of that.  Mostly, it's just solid work, with some nice surprises and gorgeous set pieces.  I'm happy to be done with this trilogy though, so hopefully Disney can move on from old characters and make something new with the setting."
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,"Sad that the producers didn't follow the last movie's iideas and plot for a more ""fan-service"" kind of ending"
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,It's was a great movie!! I hated the last Jedi but this movie wasn't boring and I enjoyed the plot.
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,"Good effects but predictable (which was expected ) but hey, it’s Star Wars and it wasn’t Ike I was expecting a high brow murder mystery."
"Jan 12, 2020",negative,Star wars has been distoryed by bad writers directors and poor story telling.
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,"Yes. There were a few cheesy moments. And, yes, some of the ending was somewhat predictable. However, J.J. Abrams was tasked with buttoning up a 9-episode movie series that started in the 70s, survived through a horrible prequel series, and was left with numerous odd story line issues following The Last Jedi. He managed to pull it all off with a clever, fun, interesting, and exciting movie while recovering from a lot of odd decisions made by Rian Johnson. The actors had more to work with, the script was better, the storyline was good. The characters were used better, and the ending was solid. Given everything, I’m not sure what would have satisfied the negative critics. But I do recommend it as a solid conclusion to a fun series of movies."
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,Loved it! Wife loved it! Daughter (15) loved it! Highly recommended. 7.5 out of 10.
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,The movie was riveting from start to finish. We were on the edge of our seats throughout the movie. Never an empty space. I wanted more a!
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,One of my favorites so far!
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,"""I've got a feeling I've seen this before.""
Film looks really good, all three do, but this one is certainly the weakest one. 
It feels like they've recycled the same themes etc. from the original trilogy."
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,Enjoyed bring back all the old stars still the best is original!
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,Best movie by far finally got the ending I’ve wanted
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,Really really good! Loved it
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,"The special effects were super~crazy, with non-stop action. IDK it was entertaining and tiring to watch at the same time. But worth seeing on the big screen."
"Jan 12, 2020",negative,"Complete nonsense. Fanfiction, not to be considered canon"
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,"I very much enjoyed the movie. Some twists, some obvious outcomes but a fun ride and a pleasant closure of the trilogy. I’m glad they didn’t just throw away characters just because they could."
"Jan 12, 2020",negative,if your not super into star wars i can see you liking this but as a long time fan this movie was god awful. The best part is that it ended this trilogy finally.
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,I disliked that this is the last of the saga. I loved all in the series. We'll see what the next series will bring.
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,Definite end for the saga
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,"Entertaining, despite the plot holes."
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,Good story and action. Fun to see some familiar faces. At times felt a little forced and overdone. But enjoyed the end to the saga.
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,"good acting, good action, great special effects, great movie!"
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,Good ending to Star Wars.
"Jan 12, 2020",negative,wish I wouldnt have wasted the money.
"Jan 12, 2020",neutral,not enough relevant plot
"Jan 12, 2020",neutral,Better than Last Jedi. I appreciate JJ trying to save the series. The emperor coming back is dumb. The plot is terrible. It was fun though.
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,I don't care what the critcs say rise of skywalker was a fast paced worthy ending to the Skywalker saga! Long live star wars!
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,Love the effects and action! Story line was excellent
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,"seemed a little rushed in places. always a fan, but not the best we've seen."
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,"Really good, mostly because of the fact that its the last one😩"
"Jan 12, 2020",negative,"it seemed rushed, the store was all over the place and the writing was lazy.  it's a shame that jj had to follow up the last jedi and try to make a good story out of it.  the fault is with disney.  the executives are more concerned with making money then producing good quality content for people to enjoy.  if jj would have had the entire trilogy to do I think he could have done a good job but having to follow the last jedi screwed that up."
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,Way better than TLJ. Not up to Lucas standards but an enjoyable movie nonetheless.
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,Absolutely stunning. Great story in the time constraints. Will see again!
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,I absolutely loved the movie it was amazing the end makes it seem like there is gonna be a continuation but we never know because to me it seems like there is and the movie was just all a 10/10
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,Great watch. excellent addition to the star wars movies don't listen to the bombers. its a great movie.
"Jan 12, 2020",negative,"Good cinematography, acting, score... but none of that can save the convoluting plot that makes no sense, terrible dialogue, and over abundance of cringe worthy fan service. "
"Jan 12, 2020",negative,"Visualmente o filme é interessante porém o diretor não teve cuidado algum em respeitar toda a história construída trilogia original, por isso o filme ficou desconexo até revoltante para os fãs."
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,"Too long. 
Too much imagery, too little acting."
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,Shallow. Copied schemes from old parts.
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,It had throw backs to the old movie and new stuff that was entertaining also.
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,"I liked the story line and how everything played out. The movie could have been about 30 minutes shorter. It seemed a bit predictable, but that was okay or it wouldn't have been a Star Wars movie."
"Jan 12, 2020",negative,It was all over the place and extremely predictable. Felt like they just tried to retcon everything that happens in the last movie instead of trying to build an actual story.
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,get off your high-horse people...great movie.
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,"Star Wars: Rise of Skywalker was disappointing because it could have been so much more. It should have been so much more. 
The final film of such a beloved series should have had me laughing, weeping, and screaming throughout. Kind of like Avenger's Endgame and Infinity War. It didn't even come close.
While it wasn't awful, tons of fan service does not a great ending make. If you love Star Wars watch it. If not, skip it. You aren't missing a lot."
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,This was one of the most epic of the Star Wars saga!! I can’t wait until it comes out on Blu-ray was I can have the full collection!!
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,"It was ok, not a movie I'll be watching more than once."
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,Loved it! I was gripped throughout and it didn't dissapoint.
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,"É bom de assistir, pra passar o tempo e apreciar a qualidade cinematográfica, mas... em se tratando da história e do universo de Stars Wars, os Episódios I e II deixam o IX para trás. Um bom filme de ação/aventura, mas um péssimo desfecho para Stars Wars."
"Jan 12, 2020",negative,"This movie is a miss a complete miss of what is SW, there is no concrete history, no logic in the actions of the caracters an no rason for the comeback of Palpatine.
A complete GARBAGE!!!"
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,It is so excellent!! 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,"Great chapter in the franchise. Reviewing a Star Wars movie is like any genre, you know pretty much what you're getting going in. Little darker themes this time around which made for excellent drama."
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,5 because it is Star Wars and is a family favorite thru the years.  Character development for this trilogy was 3 stars.
"Jan 12, 2020",negative,"Visually stunning and another John Williams masterpiece for the soundtrack. However, the movie's pacing was chaotic, lack of coherent plot, and a complete deficit of character development. No fault to the actors at all. Daisy Ridley is amazing as Rey but the character as well as Finn and Poe suffer from poor writing and an unbelievable story arc. Disney and Lucasfilm have forever ruined the STAR WARS franchise with the incredible amount of plot holes and inability to connect to previous STAR WARS films. The Last Jedi made me feel ill. The Rise of Skywalker completes my loss of enthusiasm for Disney made STAR WARS feature films. "
"Jan 12, 2020",negative,"If you never watched star wars before Disney bought them, then you might like them. They are determined to kill off everyone from the first six movies of star wars. Their story line for these last three movies had potential in the first one but they just go all over the place with the story. If I never see any of these movies again, I will be alright and won't miss them. I am sorry that George Lucas sold the rights to this series to Disney."
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,Enjoyed it start to finish. Very well done.
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,Nice movie. But it was too much predictable and without brand-new things. Better than EP 6 for me
"Jan 12, 2020",negative,"You will go see it because it’s Star Wars as I did.  But a nap would have been a better use of my almost 3 hours dreaming of what a Star Wars movie and trilogy could have been.  If you have to watch it, wait till on tv and there are commercials as they will at least provide some entertainment.  If you hated the ride at Disney, this movie is almost worse."
"Jan 12, 2020",negative,"This was just not that good. Still, it was better than the 8th and the prequels!"
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,one of the best Star Wars I've seen it covers all the bases from acting to the way it look to the stunt work great fight scenes
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,Amazing star wars movie. Went in with no expectations. My friends and I all had a great time. Enjoyed every bit. It’s a movie people. Just enjoy it.
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,Definitely a better movie than the previous one. But still more of a fan service than a masterpiece.
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,This was SO much better than the last Jedi and a perfect ending. I’m a huge Star Wars fan and I don’t understand how someone could not enjoy this movie. I’ve seen it 7 times in theaters already and plan to watch it again today.
"Jan 12, 2020",negative,Written and Directed by Dudebros.
"Jan 12, 2020",negative,"same old story told worse than previous with less interesting characters. after seeing this movie, I could care less if they ever make another star wars movie or tv show."
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,"Lots of action, great story line, went out with a BANG!"
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,"It wasn’t the best of the Star Wars movies, but it wasn’t an awful ending."
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,Star Wars fan here. Need I say more?
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,A satisfying wrap-up to the Skywalker saga.
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,a good story and great way to end the original series.
"Jan 12, 2020",negative,"I am an absolute Star Wars fan and considering that this movie was supposed to end the saga it was really disappointing.  During the whole movie there is no real bad guy!  Palpatine was weak and Kylo never turned into anything close to a Darth Vader character, which was really disappointing although this was Kylo's best movie of the saga.  I never really liked any of the characters in this movie and another disappointing thing is the creature, Babu Frik,  that was supposed to be cuter than Baby Yoda from Mandalorian didn't live up.  Overall this movie was the worst of the Star War's saga in my opinion."
"Jan 12, 2020",negative,A mess from a storytelling and film-making standpoint. The rare combination of boring and seizure inducing.
"Jan 12, 2020",neutral,"Liked Rey and Kylo scenes and the little alien mechanic. Mostly boring, a handful of scenes were awesome and should be seen on the big screen."
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,Better than the first two.
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,"much like the last two films of this final trilogy, i won't be rewatching it beyond maybe a 2nd and 3rd viewing.   

both rogue one, and the han solo movie...were fun. and worth seeing again. hell, i rewatched the prequels more than ive desired to wanna see any of the last 3.

its not that they are bad; they just lack a charm....which is so much more apparent now that we have the mandalorian which doesn't shy away from telling a classic story and rewards audience based on lore and narrative, without just assuming we care.

as others have said, these films have made us stop caring.

so, while i would say yeah, go see this new one in theatre...i won't be collecting the action figures from it. i won't get a poster. i won't dive into the tech and craft of it was made.

and, i will still watch the original trilogy over and over again, because they are like fine wine, instead of this fast food disposable media which is now these movies.

i really prefer the direction of the one-off films and what looks to be a great show w the obi wan series coming soon too.

so, the universe of star wars isn't over, but i sure hope the story of the characters from these 3 films is put to rest."
"Jan 12, 2020",negative,Esse filme é um desrespeito com star wars. Ele tenta corrigir os erros de the last Jedi e acaba piorando a situação.
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,It was a good ending to another Star Wars trilogy.
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,Soooooo much better than the last! Space wizards at their finest.
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,"To start off, this movie is basically split into two parts: Part one is director JJ Abrams addressing all the “mistakes”, “missteps”, and conflicting plot lines that exist between what he set up in The Force Awakens, and what Rian Johnson developed in The Last Jedi. The second half is Abrams now building on what he created and set up in The Force Awakens to excellent climax. Right off the bat, it’s the best of the Sequels. It’s got its issues, like pacing (this movie definitely needed an extra 30 minutes to iron out the wrinkles), and some questions still left unanswered. However, it’s magical, and captivating like any good Star Wars film should be. It possesses the right balance of fan service and originality that The Force Awakens couldn’t reach in new material, and what The Last Jedi absolutely lacked in nostalgia. Any fan of the originals and the prequels will love this movie. It’s without a doubt a shining gem in the pile of “fake diamonds and cheap stones” that make up the Sequel Trilogy."
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,It was kind of the same all thing was Star Wars it was entertaining but I got tired of watching it halfway through
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,The best Star Wars movie ever. However we didn’t like the 4DX in the theatre as it  disturbs the movie focus. The Regal City North team were great and accommodated us to move over to the IMAX hall.
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,"Good movie , massively underrated."
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,"The ""supposed"" final chapter in the main Star Wars saga was enjoyable. It unfortunately had the dubious task of following a film which did next to nothing to further the story (The Last Jedi). Thus this film tried to do too much. Abrams once again pays a lot fan service through out and the film much as the Force Awakens used the first Star Wars as a template uses Return of the Jedi with a dash of Empire. The film is uneven in pacing especially towards the end, but it is much more satisfying the previous entry. I could dissect the flaws of the film, but I won't it was enjoyable. I just had a hard time getting too excited for any one character. It was a somewhat satisfying conclusion to the Disney trilogy, but missing the magic of the originals and the spark of hope that the Force Awakens started."
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,I loved the action and the storyline was genious.
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,"If you need closure, this movie is excellent. A little vague on the reason for certain events, such as the return of a familiar foe. Nonetheless, a very enjoyable watch."
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,The conclusion to the series was excellent
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,Was the best of the final 3.  Ending should have been longer but overall a good movie.
"Jan 12, 2020",negative,They desecrated the entire Star Wars saga. What an utter shame! How can these fools be given the reins to such a franchise? It was like I was watching a fairytale for kids. All mumbo jumbo. Palpatine has so much power he can destroy entire fleets? What bollocks?
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,"I loved this movie compared to Last Jedi, not sure why such a big critic and fan divide. It was great! Go see it on the big screen!!"
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,awesome and astounding film! don't listen to overexpectant fans about the story. it's a SEQUEL story! enjoy it.
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,So Rey kills Emperor Palpatine with that much ease? Yeah...okay...
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,"I saw the movie with my SO who is a huge Star Wars fan. I enjoyed it, although in my opinion the ending was cut off. He said it was ok and had too much fan service! I’d see the movie because it is a nice ending to the series."
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,Total surprised on some of the Charters death and Reye's last name choice. In the End I am happy how the Whole Star Wars story was wrapped up. Evil is defeated!!!
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,"Super entertaining and loved seeing Carrie Fisher again. The costuming and special effects were so realistic and mesmerizing. It could have been a little longer to wrap up some of those loose ends, but still so good."
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,Nice wrap up this trilogy of trilogies.
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,It was great! I enjoyed watching it.
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,One of the best in the series.  The whole family loved it!!
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,"To long, story line predictable"
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,Like they way they incorporated elements from the previous movies.   Well done.    Only one odd moment at the end involving a kiss.  Still dont understand that but everything else was great.
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,"I loved this movie I have waited for this movie, and feel it was a terrific ending to a legendary story. Happy, sad, exhilarated all feelings being sensed throughout the movie a must see for anyone."
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,"It was really emotional the first time i watched movie , the movie is ok but kylo ren is excellent"
"Jan 12, 2020",negative,Unfocused mess. Such potential wasted.
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,Loved it! I thought it was a perfect way to end the saga and move into another future chapter.
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,"It has some small surprising moments but was mainly predictable. Had both good point and bad points and never really succeeded getting me to the edge of my seat. Although, it did satisfy me and I would accept it as a end of the saga."
"Jan 12, 2020",negative,destruction of Star wars achieved with this one....
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,"I like the story line, always hope"
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,"Spoilers ahead! I was never bored watching this movie. Good CGI and special effects. Acting was, though, no Oscar winning performances. Plot was a little all over the place. The movie was set up as an episode of Downton Abbey, once something interesting starts, cut away to something else. I hope the Star Wars franchise stays a science fiction/drama stays away from /action series and stays away from social commentaries because it will make it dull.
To many new characters, not enough Lando or R2. C-3P0 and Chewie get a chance to shine. Rey still emotes and has overdone facial expressions. Ben Kylo still acts depressed. 
A lot of the plot borrows from ""Return Jedi"" and ignores ""Last Jedi"". Misplaced humor here and there. ""How It Should Have Ended's Villain Pub"" gave away the ending, and ending, I thought left open another movie. 
If you want to see it, ignore what everyone has been saying and go to be entertained. If you are a fanboy/girl, there is a lot for you!"
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,I really liked this movie even as a Star Wars fab.
"Jan 12, 2020",neutral,It felt incomplete in some areas. The flow wasn't as smooth as the others.
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,I’ve seen all the Star Wars movies that was my favorite by far
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,"Life long Star Wars Fans May most likely be upset by most of the decisions JJ Abrams and the Lucasfilm folks made here. However for what it’s worth, the saga ends on a striking note, even if the film felt sorta unfinished and rushed at times. (Not all plot lines were resolved unfortunately, and there was a lot of stuff that was not explained, that should have been explained) I really do love a few things they did with this movie. However I do wish that things such as already Established Character Romances weren’t ignored, and I wish we got an explanation on how Anakin’s Lightsaber was all of a sudden fixed. I also have to somewhat agree that this film does negate a few trilogy plot elements that was set up by the Last Jedi. The big standout here (and one of the very great moments of the film) is the surprising return of Ian McDiarmid as Emperor Palpatine/Darth Sidious. It was also just incredible Seeing Billy Dee Williams play General Lando Calrissian again! If Carrie Fisher was still with us today, she would have been very proud of how the story of Princess Leia ended. "
"Jan 12, 2020",negative,"There were some fun scenes but the movie felt disjointed and all over the place.  It's like JJ took 2 separate movies, cut them in half then mashed them together.  

It was also a terrible way to end the series.  They left out way too many details and it was full of plot holes... I recommend waiting and just renting it.  Honestly I was bored 95% of the time at the theater when watching this movie.  It's full of groan moments.  They fly now!  Uhm.. they have been able to fly since the original trilogy lol"
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,"As much as I hate to see the saga end, this was a great tribute to the entire works.  Now, anxiously awaiting more from Disney on Star Wars breakouts, like Mandalorian.  Keep em coming!"
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,"This is a solid movie, and I enjoyed my time in the theater. There are a few weaknesses to watch out for, some first attempt at humor, and some forced throwbacks to Moments in the original trilogy. But on the whole a good story well told."
"Jan 12, 2020",negative,It was simultaneously bloated and thin. It's hard to understand how experienced filmmakers don't seem to re-read their screenplay to be sure a compelling story is being told -- heck to be sure it makes sense. Sad ending to a once enjoyable series.
"Jan 12, 2020",negative,Disney killed Star Wars.
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,I was surprised. There were a lot of nods to the old movies that really made it for me. The last Jedi felt like it was made by someone that hadnt really seen Star Wars but this was made for the geeks. It does basically gloss over most of The Last Jedi but its better for it.
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,"I thought this was a very well done movie. As always, the special effects were great.  The story line was good. The battle scenes were a little drawn out, but to be expected for Star Wars.  All in all, I really enjoyed it and would recommend."
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,It’s Star Wars!  In recliners!
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,"The Skywalkers don't go out with a bang, but with a whimper. Disappointing."
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,It was just all over the place expected more
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,Star Wars Awesomeness
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,"I liked how this installment tied up most of the storylines from previous movies. Also, It was packed with witty humor. It was quick and subtle, yet very effective. An all around good show."
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,"It is better than Rian Johnsons’s abomination, Last Jedi."
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,Certain details but it wasn’t too bad was very entertaining and funny
"Jan 12, 2020",neutral,"The first half of the film moved too fast. And the scenes with Leah felt unnatural and awkward. The second half of the film was better, although it still had moments that made me go ""WTF?!"" And not in a good way either. It was definitely better than The Last Jedi, but not as good as The Force Awakens. In the end, I didn't hate it, but I also didn't like it either. It was just kinda, ""meh""."
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,A fitting ending to a remarkable story
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,Solid fun ending to Skywalker storyline
"Jan 12, 2020",neutral,"Its ok to be angry on the movie, but epis.9 is much better than the 7 & 8. It is not a copy-paste of the others movies , its original & good in the same ways. But unfortunetly this Star Wars is not good enough the save this new trilogy. Better was the 6 films before and spin-offs (1 to 6,). Anyway im satisfied of this film(for once). But this new trilogy is the bad thing in Star wars universe!"
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,"Hard core fan of starwars here, Since day one back in 70s. And this is a good movie. Mat be hard to swallow for this old guy ,but yes, it's a good movie. The end of the original generation and the beginning of a new one. Very good transition. Bring tears to me eyes this switch, but this is like real life. "
"Jan 12, 2020",negative,"A bloated mediocre soulless mess. Waste of the potential of The Force Awakens, made me appreciate The Last Jedi."
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,Great end to the sky walker series
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,"As a lifelong Star Wars fan I thought the movie filled in a lot of holes. The story completed the character development where some old school Star Wars fans may have questioned where Disney was going with this franchise. It was the fastest 2:20 minutes that I can recall in some time. I would see it again. And will definitely add this to my collection.  If I have a negative comment, a couple of the nuggets were cheesy however my overall review of this film... Awesome!"
"Jan 12, 2020",negative,It's just not good... at all...
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,"Seen it 3 times in the theaters, love it more every time. Already purchased in iTunes. A must see if you are a real Star Wars fan. Fast, full of action, amazing visual effects, lots of laughs, good story, and superb soundtrack. 10/10."
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,Thoroughly enjoyed the movie.
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,"I have a new favorite Star Wars movie! I didnt think anything could top my old original series favorite, but this did. It neatly tied the whole Saga together and gave it a satisfying conclusion. I laughed, I cried, I had good nostalgic memory moments as they brought back old favorite characters. I have seen it in theaters twice already. Love that they stuck with the central theme of Star Wars. HOPE. We Hope."
"Jan 12, 2020",negative,"The movie is boring and nothing really happens during most of it. While the secondary characters seem completely useless and never really do nothing, Rey somehow became overpowered and after some training she looks like the most powerful force warrior ever existed in 9 movies. Talking about this, the finale is something terrible: did I actually see Palpatine, the whole star wars line biggest antagonist, who can see in the future and in the heads of enemies, cheated death, discovered cloning, Yoda-like lightsaber warrior, die in a 5-seconds fight because his force lightning couldn't overcome a second lightsaber, and instead bounced on it and killed himself? The most intelligent character of the entire saga resurrected, with plans to move his spirit in Rey body, got all of his power back as he shows with a tremendous force lightning in the air and just then dies because it looks like Rey ""helped by the Jedis"" is by far stronger than him. 
I didn't like Kylo Ren story in the movie: he's super weak as he can't beat anyone and makes a deal with everyone he meets. In the end, he basically comes to die for nothing. We just see the (interesting) lightsaber telepathic transmission, Kylo Ren getting life-energy sucked and being thrown away from the fight, die by saving Rey. Wow, i can see the Rise of the Skywalker."
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,"I'm not a big STAR WARS fan but I took my daughter who really wanted to see it 
I really liked it! Action packed, didn't have  to know all the background to enjoy"
"Jan 12, 2020",negative,The last few Star Wars movies feel like the same movie over and over again.
"Jan 12, 2020",neutral,When did leiah learn how to fight when did she get a light saber where did the heal powers come from who had that power
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,I thought the movie was a little slow in it's pace. The flow of the movie was slower than previous movies.
"Jan 12, 2020",negative,"Too much ""same old"" and dependence on special effects."
"Jan 12, 2020",negative,Some nice ideas like Palpatines return but overall it was rotten -.-
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,Really inspiring in times when the people need to unite.
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,"As many of the Star Wars movies the plot makes little sense, but it has to be like that in order to look cool.
Still I like to watch them."
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,Rise of Skywalker is a messy but fun send off to The Skywalker saga.
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,A perfect end to an incredible saga....visually stunning  but the storyline was even better. May be my favorite movie ever...a must see!
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,"When I noticed elements from the old legends books in this movie, I knew I'd love it. Abrams did what he could with what he had, and I think he did a great job. I was happy to see references to the Legends lore of the 80s and even some of the things talked about in Luceno's book on Darth Plagueis. I was also relieved that there was no ""side mission"" to distract from the meat of the story. My wife and I were both very happy with this movie. It's our favorite of the new trilogy. I hope that future movies in the franchise will be more willing to incorporate some of the elements from the old hit legend books as well. Nice work, JJ Abrams and all those involved in the making of this movie!"
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,"Chopped up into scenes without a transition of any kind.
Spent too much time trying to figure out that What is on second!"
"Jan 12, 2020",negative,Too kuevenile....poor acting...crappy story line
"Jan 12, 2020",neutral,"This movie is the climax of a trilogy that was entirely improvised, and that is entirely evident in the nonsensical plot and spotty characterisation. If you have to watch this, turn your brain off and watch the awesome lightsaber fights without thinking about if it makes sense."
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,Fantastic movie!!!  Never fails
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,"A total rip off of the ""Return of the Jedi"". No more new story ideas?"
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,"I don't care what you think, the movie was great as well as the sfx"
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,not the biggest star wars fan but I thoroughly enjoyed this one. good story and brought back a lot of old characters.
"Jan 12, 2020",neutral,"marginally better than the disaster of the last movie. Rise of Skywalker had numerous (a lot actually) of plot holes and open ended story arcs that were simply ignored and never explained. Somehow there there were very few lessons learned from the previous movie in introducing new technologies and force powers that have never been part of Star Wars. The Script was very lazy and at times chaotic, having many WTF moments of not understanding why or how certain characters magically appear in places. The actual story was a mess of incredible coincidences and all scenes seemed to presented on a plate to the audience without allowing for any sort of thought or imagination. At this point Star Wars should stick to TV shows only and come back to movies when they have real think about how they can be done in a satisfactory way (as other franchise have proven, you can please both the fans and the masses)."
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,"Storyline was great, I enjoyed every minute of it!"
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,"Visual and audio effects were perfect, but light-saber fights are what let this movie down. It looked like two children swinging sticks recklessly at one another. Cliches have become a recurring theme since the new trilogy started.
Definitely not bad, but could've been better."
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,"Me and my girlfriend loved the movie ! Much better than the 7th and 8th, this movie feels like it's found its way to the level of the first movies. There's the right amount of light sabers, fun, and action !!!
Great job !"
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,"Great visuals & special effects (that's to be expected from a Star Wars film, though, isn't it?). But apart from this, honestly, it's kind of a mess. The story feels rushed, and there's just TOO MUCH they're trying to cram in. It's certainly better than The Last Jedi, but that's really not saying much, as The Last Jedi was TERRIBLE. I suppose it (this film) is entertaining on a surface level, so audiences will probably ENJOY it, but when you get to thinking about it, it just doesn't make much sense. I give it 3 stars for not being absolutely TERRIBLE, but it is predictably (considering the previous 2 films) muddled. An unworthy end to the Skywalker saga, but after decades of desecrating Star Wars, I must say, I'm kind of glad it's finally over. Put Star Wars - and us - out of our collective misery, and just let dead dogs lie, for Christ's sake. Let it be."
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,"A fitting way to end the saga. Yes not particularly clever or groundbreaking, but an enjoyable and emotional ride."
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,"J.J. did what he could. Disney needs to create a trilogy and plan it out before actually making the first film. Also, why hire the same screenwriter that ruined DC for two years?! The lack of originality and the movies laughably painful way to undo its predecessor and its controversial themes actully hurts the film and leaves the Skywalker Saga ending on a “meh” note. While Episode 8 was divisive at best, this movie should have been brave enough to continue with what was given to them. This movie is cowardly, yet entertaining. Unoriginal, yet captivating. Underwhelming, yet not terrible. They should no better. "
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,Excellent!! Nonstop action and suspense! Perfect conclusion
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,I wish the ending included the force ghosts of the light side of the force.  The movie should’ve been longer and was really fast paced. I still really enjoyed it!
"Jan 12, 2020",negative,"Rushed and slopped together with huge spectacle that, much like the plot and story of this film, is inevitably meaningless."
"Jan 12, 2020",negative,"So utterly disappointed by this uninspired conclusion that tries to cram in way to much and make everything so big, that the rest of the saga becomes utterly ridiculous in its light. Utterly loveless plot like you would not even expect in a video game."
"Jan 12, 2020",neutral,"There are good things about this movie, Palpatine and Driver among them, but anytime you're about to enjoy something they throw another forgettable sacrifice or fan-service moment at you and break any immersion you might have felt. It isn't the culmination of anything, and it doesn't take a single significant risk. Beautiful art and sound design can't carry the burden of myriad untraceable storylines and forgettable dialogue. It was pleasant but forgettable."
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,"It was pretty good. I saw 'The Force Awakens', but I never watched 'The Last Jedi' because everyone said it was terrible. So I went into this movie wondering if I'd be able to follow what was going on without having seen the second movie. I knew that Luke died, but pretty much nothing else. I didn't have any problems. I actually started to wonder what they did in 'The Last Jedi' for two hours, because like, it seemed like there was nothing I missed, or was supposed to know before walking into 'Rise of Skywalker'. It was cool it's so accessible though. If anyone else missed 'The Last Jedi' you can just go right to the last movie, you'll be fine. It was cute, they did the Carrie Fisher stuff pretty well, and the characters were fun to watch together."
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,"Had the same warmth, humanity and drama of the original series. Great return to form. Ridley is absolutely epic in her role."
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,"It’s a fun movie for the Star Wars fan. I’ve loved these movies since I was four and I’m 42 now, so this movie was fun. I felt like it was too short and there were some clumsy plot threads that got lost. Not nearly as good as THE LAST JEDI, which made me more excited than any Star Wars movie had since I was little, but a proper closing entry for this trilogy, if not for the entire saga."
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,Lives seeing everyone in it! Good battle scenes. Fun  night out for my teen son and I
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,I thought it was good.
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,"Absolutely amazing movie! My second fav Star Wars of all time (behind Empire). Saw it 5 times in theaters. Love the characters, the plot, the Legends elements they brought in, all of it. Couldn’t have had a better ending to the saga. Absolute must see!"
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,great addition to the franchise
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,Story was good till they got till about half way threw then nothing made sense Disney really screw this up.
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,Ten thumbs great ending to the saga
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,"Seems like JJ Abrams was in for full damage control after the disastrous ""the last jedi"". Part 9 is satisfying, but raises the question how much more the trilogy could have been if JJ would have directed part 8."
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,It was really great! So many inspiring lines or scenes and in between trying to remember the episodes of so long ago...definitely watching again!
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,I enjoyed this movie very much!!!!
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,"라스트제다이의 문제를 수습했지만, 그 수습을 해야했기에 본작의 완성도는 떨어졌다. J.J 에이브람스는 최선을 다했으나 전작인 라스트제다이의 문제가 너무 거대했다."
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,Starts out great but runs out of gas at the final show down
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,I really enjoyed this! Never a dull moment. I’ve really loved how this latest arch has come together!
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,Over the top special effects
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,As a life long Star Wars fan I can say I have had mixed feeling about the latest trilogy. The last installment I thought was decently entertaining and enjoyable. As long as it's not taken too seriously. It's not perfect and yes there are plot holes and discrepancies but all in all it says true to Star Wars franchise. It made me feel like a 10yr old boy again!
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,"I had lowered expectations from what I had heard, but I enjoyed the movie. 

It was a little too complex, trying to check too many boxes. Reprising too many characters."
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,"a lot of exciting things, i loved the movie though."
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,Fights scenes were great!
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,Hurray the Jedi fans win over the Seth critics. Outstanding film!!!
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,The best kind of roller-coaster ride in a movie!
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,They definitely saved the best for last - loved everything about this movie!
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,"Fast-paced action adventure, liked it!"
"Jan 12, 2020",negative,Not the worst film in the latest trilogy but it really leaves you questioning how did this entire trilogy start with so much promise only to end up adding zero value to the SW franchise overall. Perhaps the better strategy for Disney would have been to stick to origin or prequel movies like Rogue One and completely left the original cast out of the new story line.
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,"I loved the whole movie, from beginning to the end, it was a wonderful movie"
"Jan 12, 2020",negative,"Even it's uncomfortably fast pacing and well-casted characters can't save ""Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker"" from being another throwaway sci-fi franchise feature. It genuinely surprised me how boring most the movie was to watch, even with an even opener mind on the second viewing. See the movie, get your 'Star Wars"" credits and be thankful there are other movies in theater worth your time and money."
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,LOVED EVERYTHING ABOUT IT
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,"For all those who say they won't go see it because they believe that J.J. Abrams ruined the story, or some other rumor about the film, I say Balderdash!
Having been a fan of Star Wars since 1977's original, seeing it brought to a close the way it was, brought tears to my eyes with a smile on my face!
The way it ends, with Rey returning to Luke's home on Tattoine, when asked her name and she says ""Rey...Skywalker"" was perfect!
It was a fitting ending and tribute to Carrie Fisher as well.
I will most definitely see it again before it leaves the theatres, if just to catch things I missed the first time!"
"Jan 12, 2020",neutral,Not the best but ending was good
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,"For those that said The Last Jedi was awful, I don't disagree...but not 100% to that end.  For those that say Rise of Skywalker is worse, I absolutely DO disagree 100%.  But here's the thing...it's not all one person either making or breaking the film & Franchise.  It's a ""family"" effort...and we all know what family I am referring to...cough <DISNEY> cough.

While my two minor issues with Last Jedi, the mentioning of running out of fuel (for the first time ever) and shells fired in space arcing (as if there is gravity pulling them downward) and the MAJOR issue I had with Rose (her character existed solely to provide conflict, and that whole Canto Bight scene could have been totally omitted and the film would have been better for it)...I felt none of those same issues with Rise of Skywalker.   No minor issues nagging me (aside from Finn never saying what he needed to tell Rey), and no major issues bothered me.   So what do I think of the film as a whole?   I felt it was a very triumphant way to bring closure to the Skywalker saga.  But lets dive into some of what makes this movie tick.

Time:  There's a LOT of time passed since Last Jedi.  So much so that we see Rey now near Luke levels of ability in the Force, and has Leia as her Master.  Peo apparently flies the Falcon as good or better than Han (and for me, that is a HUGE admission as a life long Han superfan), and Finn has become a confident and capable soldier of the Resistance in so many ways.  And speaking of, the Resistance has been pushed up against the wall here.  Palpatine's return threatened the entire galaxy threatened with an entire fleet of mobile Death Star's but perfecting the planet killer technology by making it fit on a Star Destroyer (he has had 30 years of uninterrupted time to work on it, so sure...I'll go with that).  

So now we have that, a mole in the First Order, Rey STILL seeking answers about her parents, Ben/Kylo Ren still trying to get Rey to his side, a quest to find a Sith artifact to help get Rey to where Palpatine is to kill him, and basically an ""all or nothing"" space battle that is one of the best I have seen put to film.  Ben becomes Ben again, he and Rey face off against Palpy (lose), Rey gets a second wind, Palpy loses, Rey and Ben do their thing together, the galaxy is saved, everyone calls it Miller Time.  Rey goes to the LArs (not Skywalker) homestead to return Luke and Leia's lightsabers to where their story (sort of) began and declares herself a Skywalker....roll credits.    And by the end of the film, the 3 predictions I made immediately after Force Awakens were actually confirmed.   Rey was a Palpatine, Kylo Ben would get killed by Rey, and Finn would be discovered to be Force-sensitive.  There were minor details off in how my predictions were accurate, but never the less, I felt very vindicated.

But while this film succeeded in so many ways, it's shortcomings were not absent.  However, the faults of this trilogy as a whole can largely be laid squarely at the feet of DIsney, despite so many wanting to lay blame on Rian Johnson and J.J. Abrams.  Let me explain.

J.J. was brilliant, is brilliant, and I feel is one of the better directors in Hollywood currently in terms of creating compelling stories and original ideas (him, and Christopher Nolan who I darn near idolize now).  Rian Johnson, while not having as long a track record as J.J., still turned out a great film prior to Last Jedi with his offering of Looper, and has now put out the great ensemble-cast film Knives Out.   So a LOT of the ideas put to film that get attributed to them aren't really coming from them...but rather Disney.  

Example one...Mighty, not Mickey Mouse

When Force Awakens was greenlit and J.J. met with the House of Mouse over how it should go, he was given explicit instructions (as was Rian for Last Jedi) to kill as many of the original characters as possible because Disney didn't want to pay the licensing royalties to George Lucas for Han, Luke and Leia...which is why only a handful of characters had screen time from the original trilogy.  And even then, they were barely there at all.  C3-PO and R2-D2 had more screen time in Rise of Skywalker than the last two films combined...and quadrupled.    Lando had all of like 3 scenes the entire film, and Chewie...well Chewie...I feel bad for how LITTLE they used him, but still tried keeping him there.  Each director was told to use all-new characters in favor of the original trilogy characters.  I know this was ""Star Wars for the new generation,"" but are you honestly telling me that NONE of the original characters could have beenm spared to see the galaxy OFFICIALLY rid of the worst threat it ever faced, which they also faced themselves in their youth?  Apparently Disney didn't feel that they needed to stick around for it.  So they essentially flexed their mighty Disney muscles and did theior best Picard impression and told them ""make it so.""

Example two...The Force is all over the place with this one.

The Force.  Oh..the use of the Force is there in abundance, but now apparently there is nothing someone CAN'T do with the Force.  Sure, Rey and Kylo Ben have their own special little quirk going with it, but Rey now has what I call ""Superman Syndrome""...there's apparently NOTHING she CAN'T do with it.  She can jump really high, float, float other things, mess with people's minds, push something away or pull it to her, heal anything and anyone, do a lightsaber baton hand-off to someone else not even in the room with her!!!  I mean seriously...that's why I think Superman is the most BORING superhero in existence...he can do ANYTHING!   BORING!   And at that point, so was Rey.  And I felt truly bad for Daisy Ridley.  She is such a talented young actress, but Rey was EXTREMELY undeveloped as a character compared to Finn, who I felt was actually the most interesting of the new characters from the word GO!  Problem was, it was planned that way.  PLANNED!  So we were intentionally given a character that just felt bland and expected to embrace her.  Big problem as one of the staples of great film making, and what made the original trilogy so effective, is that we were given characters we could empathise with and relate to.  We related to Luke being bored on Tattooin and wanting to go learn to fly at the Imperial Academy, but what is there to relate to with Rey?  Poe is essentially the new Han, and developed as much as Han was originally (as in not at all), and Finn was a breath of fresh air all around.  But these were not character development idea made by wither Abrams or Johnson.

Example three...all the things they said by not saying anything.

For everything done in Rise of Skywalker, the majority of it is accomplished by actually NOT telling you anything.  And that's an issue.  Like...when did Leia every study enough with Luke to be able to train someone else?  Rey is supposedly learning ALL she needs to from books?  C3-PO has some supposed block in his programming to prevent him from telling anyone what the Sith dagger they found says (remember...he was built by Anakin, who at the time didn't know what a Sith was, and barrely knew what a Jedi was either), Kylo Ben can now have his little conversations with Rey at will despite being told by Snoke/Palpatine in Last Jedi that it was him doing it all along (so when did Kylo Ben figure it out?)...I could go on.  Don't get me wrong, sometime time-gaps need to be done and forced exposition just feels unecessary in some cased to catch people up to speed, but fo so much to happen and give NO explaination and just say ""just go with it"" can often lead to audience dissatisfaction.  And that was the road Disney advised J.J. and Rian to take a lot of times.  

When it comes down to it, Rise of Skywalker, in my opinion, is the second best Star Wars film coming in just behind Empire Strikes Back.  Rogue One is high on the ""overall Star Wars galaxy"" list as well, but not part of the Skywalker saga formally.  Could it have been better...sure.  But all films could say that at some point.  But for me, I loved the film and am glad to see so many stories given meaningful closure.  

Now if I can just get Disney to greenlight my Boba Fett short film..."
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,Lots of noise and special effects that were very well done - as usual - but the story line was at times harder to follow.   Entertaining but other choices might have been better.
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,"Excellent movie, lots of fun."
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,Fun and satisfying end of the saga
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,A great and fun adventure to end the saga.
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,By far the best out of the new trilogy. The only problem that I had was a few wasted character moments. But other than that It's worth every penny.
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,AMAZING MOVIE. MUST SEE.
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,Absolutely loved this satisfying finale! Dont know why these great actors arent nominated for awards! Dont pay any attention to those awful unenlightened negative reviews! Theyre crazy!
"Jan 12, 2020",negative,"I couldn't even clearly tell you what I DID like. The whole movie is a mess. It ignores canon from other movies. Characters miraculously gain powers when the writers couldn't think of something else. The whole movie is 'WE GOTTA UP THE ANTE' storytelling, but that was their only trick. The only scenes I enjoyed were scenes that called back to the other movies, pre-Disney. If I thought it would work, I would ask Disney for a refund on my time and money. As is, I'll have to settle with: Disney, stop it, just stop."
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,eh. it was alot of information in one film..
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,I loved the movie and the action was awesome!!
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,Good job of tying the story to a close.
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,Real good story this time and the special effects were great.
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,Bit of a mess but it is the most entertaining of the Disney trilogy.
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,"The movie did a good job turning the franchise around.  I personally loved it!  The reviews were so bad I almost didn't go see it but really glad I did.  Coming off of the previous Star War movie that was basically trash, I think you could not have hoped for a better close out."
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,"I don't care what other people think, I had a really good time with this movie."
"Jan 12, 2020",negative,Tedious. Boring. One good scene does not make this a good movie.
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,"nostalgic for sure, great seeing past characters. brought closure and answers to the Star Wars Saga"
"Jan 12, 2020",negative,Do not spend money to see this movie.
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,It was pretty good but still could’ve done better I guess
"Jan 12, 2020",negative,I just miss the first three original. This movie was lame all over. I was happy because my daughter rested her head on my shoulder. That was heaven.
"Jan 12, 2020",negative,"Plot line seems disconnected, not enough development of character changes, way too convenient ways out of trouble suddenly happen. I think children may enjoy it for the scenes and action. Acting, special effects, world design and dialog seemed good."
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,"Left with some unanswered questions, but overall a great movie!"
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,The balance was finally reached. I loved it
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,An excellent ending to the Star Wars saga!! ❤️
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,I really enjoyed the whole movie...my favorite part was seeing Princess Leia!!
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,"Cameos, referenced to past films. The way Carrie Fisher’s death during filming was treated in the final cut. The special effects. The ending."
"Jan 12, 2020",negative,What a boring mess of a movie. Not a single Wilhelm scream either...
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,Great movie. Superscreen views
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,I’ve never watched Star War movie but my daughter made me do it today and it was pretty good to say😉.
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,Slightly predictable but very good.
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,It's better than the last jedi
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,"Epic space battles unlike any ever seen, multiple lightsaber duels, rich with emotion, & breathtaking visuals. A Star Wars film for the ages."
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,Not a huge Star Wars fan but it had enough to keep me watching. Nice to see blasts from the past alongside the new heores.
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,the movie had a lot of action
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,"Really loved this movie.  It actually made me revise my opinion of the Last Jedi, which I hated the first time I saw it.  My only gripe was that the film could've stood to be about 30-45 minutes longer and I'm afraid I may have played a part in them not giving it the necessary time as I was a committed boycotter for awhile after TLJ and I think Disney was worried the boycott would've had more of an effect than it did and did not want to chance a bomb with a 3 hr+ film.   I don't believe this is a spoiler so i'll add I was very glad they brought back Palpatine as it makes the story as much about him as it does the Skywalkers, and they have hinted at his resurrection since Ep. 3 at least."
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,"The music was spectacular but there wasn’t enough  time to tell all the stories that needed to be told. After 40 years, this franchise deserved a better ending!"
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,I loved it! Not a fan of the franchise but I did see the first movie back in the 70s. I was blown away by the way this movie was brought together. Must see.
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,Fantastic end to a series of science fiction.
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,"Great movie, I thoroughly enjoyed it 🤠"
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,"Let me say, its a wonderfully great story considering our present political turmoil, illustrating what heroics are defined as, Reys sacrifice to safe the rebellions purpose without regard for hers was a good lesson."
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,Definitely a well worth movie to see. I really enjoyed the faceoff between Rey and Palpatine!
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,JJ Abrams tried his best to end the Skywalker saga and did a good job. Even though it felt really fast in some conversation scenes it was a worthy conclusion
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,I wish Rey would have been more tempted by the dark side
"Jan 12, 2020",negative,The movie and Mike strantz watching Star Wars there's a lot of things that were brought back such as the Death Star that first of all never was sunk into an ocean it blew up there is no existence of it JJ Abrams should have stuck with doing what he enjoys doing and left the Star Wars movies to George Lucas now I understand why George Lucas to not want to go see this film and did not like how this film and it up the movie does sort of describe a little bit of how Palpatine stayed alive but altogether if you look at the movie as a whole JJ Abrams screwed up and he screwed up big time with this movie I'm watching it here at home and unfortunately I can't walk out of my bedroom because I can't leave my bedroom because I'm sick so if JJ Abrams ever watch this the comments on Rotten Tomatoes for reach them JJ Abrams stick to doing what you enjoy but stop making Star Wars you destroyed the Legacy that George Lucas created
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,"Uh, it's Star Wars. Hello!"
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,"JJ did the best he could with what he had, and honestly did a great job. Is it perfect? No. But it was satisfying."
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,"After the profound disappointment of Rian Johnson's insulting Episode 8, JJ Abrams brought this all-time sci-fi epic to a satisfying epic conclusion.  No spoilers.  Go see it on the big screen, in IMAX 3D if possible.  I saw Episode 4 in theaters in 1977 when I was 8.  I'm 50 now and in Episode 9, Abrams did a masterful job of tying up all of the loose ends left by Johnson's disaster as well as the overall story arc beginning with Episode 1.  Well done Disney, Lucas, and Abrams."
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,Action packed from start to finish!! Don't miss it!!!!!
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,"It's Star Wars - funny, corny, fun story. If you a fan, you will enjoy it if not, don't bother"
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,"This was a family date, enjoyed it a lot!"
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,great  movie don't leave your seats. the action never stops
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,The storyline connected back to the original Star Wars movie. Great special effects and chemistry on the big screen. I might go back and wat h it again!
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,The sound and display was awesome just made the movie that much better.
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,"The Rise of Skywalker makes up for the mess they call The Last Jedi, but I still have mixed feelings about it."
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,"I really enjoyed this movie!! I definitely had somewhat low expectations based on the reviews I saw, but then I went and saw it. I truly enjoyed myself! Great cast, the effects were awesome, and I felt like the story came to a good resolved place! It's not deep thinking film, but just pure entertainment which is what I expect from this franchise. I loved it!"
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,Loved it. A beautiful culmination of the entire saga. I loved them bringing back stuff from the first movies and going back to places from the very beginning.
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,A very predictable ending to a predictable series.
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,"Loved it! Stands on its own. Special effects, score, sound, story, characters, costumes, pacing- all great. Will see it again. C3PO was a riot! Highly recommend."
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,Fantastic movie. Awesome way to wrap up the movie series.
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,it was awesome. loved the movie
"Jan 12, 2020",negative,"I can't put the blame solely on J J For this mess of a film. After The Last Jedi director Rian Johnson selfishly cast out every plot device midway through a trilogy in an effort to make himself seem interesting, J J had nothing to work with. Rise Of Skywalker is an attempt to bring in a new main antagonist after Snoke was snuffed, fixing mistakes left behind by Rian, and tried it's damndest to give OT fans a reason to watch this movie."
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,Excellent job wrapping up the story...tough to please everyone but the story was interesting and the movie was very entertaining
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,it was a great ending to the story.
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,"I LOVE EVERYTHING in the movie!! For Star Wars that have watched ALL, but haven’t seen this movie, it’s a definitely recommended to watch!"
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,Movie was for the most part good.  There was a lot to answer from Episode 8 and a few things beyond their control that they couldn’t get right.
"Jan 12, 2020",negative,"Mierd* de película, lpm"
"Jan 12, 2020",negative,"The whole movie is so obvious, not even entertainment"
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,before this is a great movie! I'm not a super Star Wars fan by Emma Star Wars fan. This is the second best of the six episodes. There are no slow parts and lots of action with great dialogue.
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,I thought this was a fantastic end to the whole series. It explained the second movie good enough and did a great job with the story line. Some parts were on the cheesy side but not enough to lower the score 
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,"The opening 45min is inexcusable, but the remainder does tie a nice bow on the story. Adam Driver delivers possibly the best performance in any of the nine canonical movies."
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,Not as awful as Episode VIII
"Jan 12, 2020",negative,vomit with a dash of still water
"Jan 12, 2020",negative,"What a mess. Interesting ideas and plot elements rush past with no time for consideration or development. With a proper editing pass, this might be a decent movie."
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,AWESOME!! FANTASTIC!! AMAZING!!
"Jan 12, 2020",neutral,Movie was too long and lacked action
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,Daughter of *********** she seemed quite weak as well as the son of Leigha.   Weak ending buts fits a goofy goofy Disney type story.  Would have preferred to see more Jedi spirits in the end
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,Better than I expected. A good end to the trilogy.
"Jan 12, 2020",negative,Incongruente con gli altri film
"Jan 12, 2020",negative,"Completely derivative. Felt like I was watching a big budget fan fic play, written by an alien who thinks they understand how to create a human story. Disney should have never been sold this franchise."
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,movie was great ending to  glorious rein..
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,Absolutely breathtaking!
"Jan 12, 2020",negative,"A very convenient, predictable and neatly wrapped typical JJ Abrams film. Spends more time trying to fix the many errors of Rian Johnson's The Last Jedi while speed running you through the rest of the story for what's supposed to be a conclusion to a 42 year old franchise. The visuals are fine as should be expected but the writing just desperately tries to please everyone. Still not as bad as The Last Jedi but that doesn't say very much."
"Jan 12, 2020",negative,Finally the “Rey” fillet arc is over.
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,"loved it, cant wait for next one"
"Jan 12, 2020",negative,"Barely passable as a standalone space adventure.
TERRIBLY disappointing as a follow-up to one of the best films of the saga, and as the finale of that saga."
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,could have been just a tad better but one of the best of the star wars films since empire
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,"A fitting end to the series that I've been watching since 1977.  I  would place it after the original, Empire, and Force Awakens, but better than Return of the Jedi."
"Jan 12, 2020",positive,Movie was good ending was trash
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,I would have given it 4 stars .maybe 4.5  . I'm in different that it's the end of the trilogies .  . I still feel they could have done with Kylo Ren . .  But it was a good ending .
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,"It was a great  Skywalker story, loved the shockingly story we’ve been waiting for."
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,Great close out of the series
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,Star Wars Fast and Furious style!
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,Fun to see the old gang and some new warriors. I’m also glad the good guys win . . . . Again!!
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,Babu Frik!! My oldest friend!
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,Loved the whole movie. Cried a few times. IMAX is a must. I saw it twice so I obviously liked it. Sad it’s over... for now 🙄
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,Cinematography. Music
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,Liked the movie. Great conclusion to the series.
"Jan 11, 2020",neutral,"It was fair. Rather underwhelming for the conclusion of a trilogy. And despite the fact that it was non-stop plot for the entire 2.5 hour runtime, it still felt like it dragged on towards the mid-point of the movie."
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,"Classic Star Wars. Just what you would expect, and the ending was decent."
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,Finally a good Star Wars in this trilogy. There may have been some elements that could have fixed the major issues with ‘The last Jedi' as we were utterly bombarded with new characters and plot points. However all said and done it had the laser sword fights and the scenery to make add this to my top 3 Star Wars films of all time.
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,Loved this version to close the series. Seemed like there was some rushed writing but it came together nicely. 
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,They pretend that most of Last Jedi doesn't exist and made a much better movie. Best of the new Star Wars movies!
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,From a fan watching the original trilogy as a young kid I thought it was outstanding. I had a tear in my eye most of the time and I thought Rey was the stand out star of the show.
"Jan 11, 2020",negative,"I don't regret paying money to go see this movie, but it was entirely forgettable.  Actually, it would have been forgettable, but I keep thinking of things that were just ridiculous or nonsensical.  However, I'm sure I won't care in a few months."
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,Best since Episode III
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,fantastic movie. I feel that Disney redeemed themselves quite well with this one.
"Jan 11, 2020",negative,Very disappointed. Predictable.  Bad acting.  Nothing new.  Bad ending for the star Wars saga.
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,I avoided spoilers and went in with low expectations and I wasn’t disappointed. Took my son who is 9 and hasn’t seen all the originals and he thought it was good too.
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,"Much better than I thought it would be. I had very low expectations after “The Last Jedi”, but I was pleasantly surprised. It’s not perfect, but given the mess the previous movie caused, I’m thoroughly satisfied."
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,"Perfect ending, ties everything up nicely"
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,"I think it was really good. But the ending was very disappointing because of the kiss. It felt forced to satisfy the reylo fans because they set up Rey and Finn in the force awakens when Rey kissed Finn's forehead while he was unconscious at the end. but they got rid of that when they added rose, which I hoped they would kill of in this movie, but they didn't sadly. That's it, that's the only thing I didn't like, but everything else was super good, y'all should check it out."
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,Nice way to end the saga
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,A great end to a long series. A must see if your a true Star Wars fan
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,"very good action packed movie, luv star wars..."
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,"sith history, chewy was funny, unlike the force awakens the plot in this movie was unique and not repetitive in the process."
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,‪Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker was SOOOOOOO GOOOOOODDDDDD!!!!
"Jan 11, 2020",negative,"A travesty. Disappointing in nearly every conceivable way.

The amount of adults I know that enjoyed this movie is flabbergasting to me. 

I could pick this thing apart all day long, but the majority of my points are shared eloquently in so many reviews already. 

Suffice to say, the movie feels rushed and contrived, and is basically a neon billboard that shouts ""AT NO TIME DURING THIS TRILOGY WAS THERE ANYTHING RESEMBLING A CLEAR OR CONSISTENT VISION"". 

It feels like going to a fine chophouse and having cold, old pizza slapped on your plate. 

It's not the actors' fault. I'm not even sure it's JJ's fault, though I'm not sure he's capable of creating a true cinema masterpiece in the first place. 

Ultimately, it smacks of corporate greed run amok - the movie is contrived and seems to have been made by committee, and either hubris or cowardice precluded common sense. 

I suspect if they had allowed the deadline to slip, this movie would be much better than it is. 

Whoever is ultimately responsible for this mess should be held accountable."
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,Our family enjoyed this one the most. Love all the good vs. evil applications to life.
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,"Rise of skywalker ties off the series the best way it possibly could. I truly believe that it is a beautifully shot, well written, and heartfelt entry in the franchise and deserves its praise. Don't listen to critics, this movie is pretty good"
"Jan 11, 2020",negative,"Huge plot holes, rapid fire story progression and lack luster dialog. huge missed opprotunity here."
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,Enjoyed it but felt very little meaningful dialog and mostly special effects. Tried to bring back old images to remind the original fans of the journey. Characters lack charisma of the original cast.
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,some generic but overall a good movie
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,a pretty decent way to end the series
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,A fitting end to the saga. The kind of movie George would have made.
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,"Despite all of the critic's reviews, ‘The Rise of Skywalker' was an epic ending to the Skywalker saga."
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,The story made me tear up a couple of times.
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,"I love it, it is a satisfying end to the Star Wars Saga"
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,i wish we would of seen more of fen  lightsaber action
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,Best of the most recent trilogy!
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,The real point of the movie was to basically explain a lot of unanswered questions
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,The best Star Wars film Disney has ever made. by far my favorite since they've taken over.
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,excellent! one of the best!
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,I like clearing up the origins of the cast members. I like that the relationships and That they all came together to be important to understanding the new series.
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,"Fantastic ending to a fantastic series! Not going to lie, I shed a lot of tears in this one. Carrie Fisher about broke me! Loved the unexpected hero at the end!! 😢"
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,"Great movie!!! I’ve seen it 2-3 times now and it’s definitely my favorite of this trilogy. Episode 8 lacked a lot of the action that I’m used to in a Star Wars movie, but Episode 9 did not disappoint with plenty of epic lightsaber battles and plenty surprising events occurred throughout the movie that I did not expect. "
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,"Fun movie, but somewhat predicable and over done."
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,"Story is a little messy, but the film is still so much fun. Great ending to the Saga."
"Jan 11, 2020",negative,Horrible and completely made all the other films void of meaning...! Thanks for the destruction of the legend of the chosen one and the Skywalker saga.
"Jan 11, 2020",negative,"as a fan fron the very beginning (1977), very disappointed with the conclusion."
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,"it has some good moments 
but the plot and the story felt rush
I have mix feelings about it"
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,"The acting superb, and the special effects were stunning. Storyline has a few gaps and a lot of history rewrite for the Star Wars universe. There's less of a feminism push in this film which was refreshing. The film was rushed in the end, and it would've been better if it was longer. All in all, it's the best out of this trilogy. Considering episode 8 committed the greatest error of cinematic history in killing off Luke Skywalker, and making him a recluse, there wasn't anything J.J. Abrams could've done worse than that. It's a somewhat satisfying end to these 3 films."
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,"Great movie, but not the best conclusion of a 42-year-old Saga."
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,Loved it. Great summation of the in entire series.
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,"I DONT UNDERSTAND HOW THIS MOVIE GOT BAD REVIEWS! The Rise of Skywalker ties in beautifully with the Star Wars Franchise, and makes the viewers and fans have incredible adrenaline rushes throughout the movie. If you are a fan of Star Wars just as I am then this movie will have you sitting at the end of your seat and have you asking so many question either in your head or out loud. The lightsaber duels (as All Star Wars movies have, no spoilers in this review)  are miraculous and bring in new fighting techniques that we have never seen before in the past Star Wars movies. There are major plot twists throughout the movie that will make you scream ""WHAT!"" at the screen, and any movie that can physically make you scream or talk to the screen deserves a 5 star rating. This movie made me not want to take my eyes of the movie theatre screen for even a second and made the excitement in me in flow like crazy. I really hope you enjoy this movie as much as I did, if not more. See ya."
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,Main characters were well cast and enjoyable to watch. The ending was great. I just got bored in the middle and almost walked out.
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,I liked the actual and taking progressing the Force abilities but I didn’t like the similar struggles. It is as if she is the new Luke.
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,I like the fact that the season was wrapped up.
"Jan 11, 2020",negative,"I don't even know where or how to start, so I'll just simply say that the world was a better place before the new trilogy. I'll never forgive Disney, and I'll never watch one of their movies again."
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,"Overall good movie, entertaining and a nice way to tie the saga together."
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,Best Star Wars Episode of all time!
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,Absolutely loved this film!!!
"Jan 11, 2020",negative,It makes every other film in the Skywalker saga pointless. The legend of the chosen one and the sacrifices made by past character are now meaningless. What a waste.... thanks Disney.
"Jan 11, 2020",negative,I didn’t like the movie at all
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,"Star Wars Rise of Skywalker was an okay movie. This installment was entertaining but leading up to the release was so incredibly overhyped that no matter how good it actually was it was never going to live up to that hype. This Star Wars movie had too much going on and never felt cohesive enough to flesh out the characters and tie off the many unfinished character archs. The ending was too predictable in this good vs. evil plot line. While the Star Wars lore, music, sounds and familiar characters new and old were evident this Star Wars installment and final film of The Skywalker Saga could never live up the lofty, impossible to reach expectations set before it. This is an average and ultimately safe-to-a-fault jump through hyper space type movie. Fun and entertaining but average at best."
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,Just saw it! Glad I didn’t listen to the critic reviews. My son and I were on the edge of our seats the whole time. This was the best of the new trilogy. To sum it up in one word without spoilers.... “EPIC” ... Cant wait to watch it again. 
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,"The visuals of this movie were pleasing to see, of course with Disney pulling strings. The closure was climactic and left you wanting to see more. There was a disappointing amount of potential left on the table, but an acceptable formal closure to the final trilogy."
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,Love the movie 2.5hrs fly’s by with this movie and the chairs are really comfortable
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,We liked the movie action and were not disappointed.  Hope there is another movie made
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,To my surprise I would not actually go and see this movie but I have a client that wanted to see it and it was very very good action pet store it was rich and I enjoyed it
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,I thought it was better than 7 or 8. Some odd points here and there but overall a good movie!
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,Plot feels rushed but I had fun!
"Jan 11, 2020",neutral,"I had no headcanon going into this, but I liked what was set up in Force Awakens, and was amazed by the depth and subtletly of the very substantial and beautiful Last Jedi.  In contrast, Rise of Skywalker makes little sense (and being an OT kid, I've seen ROS three times to try to make sense of it) - evil wins in the end, despite love and compassion and self-sacrifice and redemption.  The bad guy wins the long game.  Rise of Skywalker taints the entire saga.  Let alone incredibly poor characterisation (Finn, Rose, Maz).  Only saving grace is more Chewbacca, more Poe and much more C-3PO.  Really wish one director had done all three films to give us something bare-minimum coherent."
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,loved every minute of it!!
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,"JJ Abrams does as good a job as can be expected at polishing the turd left behind by The Last Jedi. The Rise of Skywalker is fun, exciting, and engaging, but clearly the story was rushed since any semblance of a cohesive storyline established in The Force Awakens was obliterated by its immediate sequel.  The movie also falls back on the cheap thrills and humor used in The Last Jedi, but somehow manages to make it palatable through good writing.  In summary, as a standalone it was decent, but as the third episode of a trilogy, it falls woefully short."
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,Great last Star Wars movie!  Go to see it!
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,it was a little to cheesy and political along with a boring story line and a few things that happened that made little to know sense.
"Jan 11, 2020",negative,"A disastrous end to the ""Skywalker saga."" If you took all the worst parts of the Star Wars movies and jumbled them together, you'd get this movie. Bloated, incomprehensible storytelling. Corny dialogue. Poor characterization. Data-driven plot choices. I thought the prequels were the worst that could be done to the franchise, but no... This was much much worse. I'd rather watch Phantom Menace... Ugh."
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,The movie was a great way to cap a 9 part franchise. Absolutely can’t wait for the next 9!
"Jan 11, 2020",neutral,To touchy feely for a star wars movie.
"Jan 11, 2020",negative,Der Film ist einfach nur grottenschlecht
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,I loved it. I thought it rounded out a lot of the whole story. Very well put together.
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,Amazing. That’s how you make a movie.
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,Epic ending. A little rushed due to a lack of arc from episode 8. JJ did a really good job
"Jan 11, 2020",negative,"It's very unorganized and almost seems thrown together if youre looking at this as the third installment of a trilogy.  I believe it would have made more sense and had more direction if it was a standalone film. This movie was your typical scavenger hunt adventure film. The acting was great and the visuals were awesome, as typically in-line with every Star Wars film.  However, the misses were major. The storyline was jumbled and certain scenes made no sense (horses running on a spaceship midflight).  Overall, trilogy lost its direction after the first film and never could recover."
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,"The movie is about what I exspected. Looking forward to the sequel. It maybe awhile,but there will be another STAR WARS"
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,I’m not even that big of a Star Wars fan but I totally enjoyed this movie. Adam Driver as Ben makes me swoon a little :)
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,Absolutely incredible ending to a series of movies that mean so much to so many people.
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,Thank you John Williams!
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,Best one of this series.
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,Ayeeeeeee.... if you know you know
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,Resolved story lines. Great performances. Will see it over and over and over and wish it's not the last one!
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,"It was definitely a good movie, with some turns that were very well done. But as the culmination of a 43-year, culture-defining legacy, it was disappointing. It's a must-see, and your effort will be rewarded, but it could have been so much more. Here's hoping they make an Episode X to really get it right."
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,"Awesome it was exiting , funny, and sad."
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,"Satisfying end to the 40+ year arc, even for an obsessed SW fan (according to family). Plot holes, yes...but acceptable at least for some."
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,Action pack easy to follow storyline
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,I thought it was an amazing movie. I started jumping out of my seat in the movie theater when I saw all the ships come from space. Great movie!
"Jan 11, 2020",negative,it's too Disney and not enough star wars.
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,"5 Stars... for those of a certain point of view.

If you did not grow up with the original trilogy, you will not get a lot of the referencing in 'The Rise of Skywalker' and will probably think this movie is okay at best. You will probably also be in the camp that loved the previous movie in the series ‘The Last Jedi'. 

However, if you grew up with the original trilogy, (and don't care to pick apart all the plot holes, just content to enjoy the ride) you will love this film as nostalgia (and will probably be in the camp that hated ‘The Last Jedi'). You will probably also look forward to the plot holes being filled-in with the inevitable Star Wars expanded universe of books, tv projects and video games. 

For me, I absolutely loved it! It is fast-paced, emotive and ticks all the fan boxes that were unchecked in the previous movie.

So 5 stars it is!"
"Jan 11, 2020",negative,"Great respect to the tech part, no respect to the story and those who attempt to cheat with the audience."
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,"As an older person, Star Wars was released when my children were 10, 11 years old.  I never tired of the movies.  Loved this movie."
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,"It was Star Wars all the way. Cameos by Leia, Luke, and Han, The only disappointment was the lackluster performance by Mark Hamill. He sounded like he could not care less about being in this film! Lots of action and space battles. I liked Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley as the new stars of the last 3 in the series. I've seen all of the Star Wars movies in the theater as soon as they were released, so yes I'm an old fan! The only ones I didn't care for were The Clone Wars, Phantom Menace and Revenge of the Sith.  I'm just sad that it's all over, but glad that George Lucas got to realize his dream of bringing the whole story to life even if it did take 42 years to do it."
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,"Not as bad as the tamatometer would make it out to be. As a non star wars fan, all of the fan service got annoying, because I don't care for fan service."
"Jan 11, 2020",negative,"To begin with, your time and/or money is entirely yours, of course, to spend, but here you are warned: This movie does not worth it. Trust that.
That said, If you did... Oh, dear.
What a way to destroy a legendary franchise! True, this trilogy started bad, and it was ruined completely with Rian Johnson's The Last Jedi, so there's no much left for J.J. Abrams to do to try not to let this ship go down. Nevertheless, the film is an disaster in it's plot, story and script, not to mention the questionable editing and the decissions taken to resolve this ""Rise of Skywalker without any Skywalker alive"". All in all, this trilogy is, as well as this film is, a diserved failure. If you have good memories left of this franchise, watch this at your own peril/risk."
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,"Predictable but good. Special effects were great as was the acting. Honestly, it’s a really good story but I wouldn’t go in to watching it with the mindset and wanting your “mind to be blown.” If you want an all out good story of light vs. dark, then this is your movie. If you want a massive storyline filled withplot twist and shockers, try something else and come back when you just want a good tale."
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,As a Star Wars movie - it’s pretty good. As an action-adventure movie - pretty good. I’d see it again.
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,Not enough action at the end and a lot of unanswered questions.
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,Good conclusion and appearances.
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,"A fairly good ending to the 3 trilogies.  A few plot holes, but there's always a plot hole in such a large story.   Glad they could wrap it up in such a nice, neat little bow."
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,The movie was really good but Disney kind of made it worse with the movie.
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,I have gone to the theater and watched this movie 3 times so far. What do you think that means?......
"Jan 11, 2020",negative,So there is finally something worse than the holiday special!
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,"Great way to end the last trilogy. A lot of fun and feeling. Well done, Disney! "
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,Excellent ending of an era.
"Jan 11, 2020",negative,"Offensive to all that preceded it, cheap and clearly directed at those who lap up fast paced action with no heart. The answer the haters wanted."
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,"Every Star Wars movie I see manages to outdo the previous one. I loved this movie more than most others I've seen. Although, I'm not super duper involved in the Star Wars universe, I thoroughly enjoyed it"
"Jan 11, 2020",negative,"This movie was SUCH a disappointment. The way the story was told, how it was told. The script just EVERYTHING. They focused more on ""look this is so cool"" rather than the actual plot IMO. Judge it for yourself but not worth the money, and not worth the time. Never wanted my money back for a film before until I saw this."
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,"It was entertaining, funny, and enjoyable."
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,Great conclusion!  Terrific score! Really enjoyed it!
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,Loved this movie. Teared up a bit. 
"Jan 11, 2020",negative,"It destroys the character arc of Anakin Skywalker. 
Force healing creates tremendous plot holes for the Saga. 
Palpatine kills himself, I guess he didn't learn from the encounter with Mace Windu.
Kylo Ren should have never been redeemed. 
Continuity is non-existent and it disrespects everything that has come before it.
This is not Star Wars. 
My single star is credited to the actors and artist."
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,Give them credit for trying to fix the DUMPSTER FIRE that was the Last Jedi. It was just too much damage to recover from. They really did try to make things like Rey being awesome at everything make sense... but the characters are just not very likable.
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,"I loved it, but it’s great that my kids will be able to grow up with Star Wars like I did."
"Jan 11, 2020",negative,"Disappointing & sour taste to end this beloved saga. The film was rushed, course corrected & too much fan service. The plot was a hot mess, biggest let down in cinema of 2019, possibly 2010 decade."
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,A perfect and fitting good-bye to the characters and story we've known for most of our lives.  Both of Abrams' chapters were successful in capturing the spirit of the tale with which Lucas originally captured so many of us.
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,"I enjoyed the movie from start to finish.. It stood to the standards of the 'Star Wars' saga, loyally. Although political correctness has liberally shown it's ugly head, that treatment is to be expected in the story lines of today ."
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,Story 3/5. Acting 5/5 visual and audio 5/5. Fan service 5/5
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,While it tied up some loose ends it felt cobbled together and provided an ending that is pretty formulaic.
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,"If you are a fan of Star Wars, this movie is for you. As far as being a good movie, it falls short. The story is a mess. It makes no sense even in the rules if the Star Wars universe."
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,Loved it! Great to see the old and new characters bring this story to a conclusion.
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,It has everything you love in Star Wars and more!
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,I thought it was a good ending to the Skywalker saga
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,"I liked the action and the filming was great. It closed a number of questions, but also raised a few."
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,Cliche...but entertaining.
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,"JJ had a lot to overcome.  He did an excellent job, all things considered."
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,Great movie! A perfect way to end this over 40 year old story 
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,Suspenseful all the way through! Highly recommend
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,"Loved this movie. And that is what it is A MOVIE. Don’t dissect it, don’t get caught up in flaws...watch it and enjoy it for what it is. I thought it was a beautiful movie with fun and laughter, but also powerful action and drama and everything cheesy about Star Wars. Saw it 3 times, would see again."
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,I liked that the story of Star Wars was concluded without remaining questions. I liked the appearance of the three main characters of the original movies even though all of them were dead by this time. It gave a finish fo the saga of the wars and answered all the questions remaining.
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,Characters are good the just seems like it was missing something like rushed like it couldve been two movies and plus give a little more detail on some things and it was just weird them trying to go back and hit and show things and characters from the previous movie just to kind of like summarize the entire series it was little off.  Its like they take you back to someplace that maybe was in the first movie or what are the others and then its almost like this feeling of hello and goodbye forever..
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,"Amazing film. Great sequences of action, development of characters, themes of redemption and love, and moments of laughter and tears. Many beautiful surprises and a great mix of characters new and old. Don't know which movie the critics saw, but ROS was brilliantly made."
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,Don’t overthink it and it’s fine.
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,"I was there in 1977 for the original, if your like me this is the perfect end.  Don't get caught up in the social media hype.  I think the uber Star Wars Geeks love to hate the movie that is out for some reason.  Fun action packed and I loved it as much as the original episode four, when I sat in the theater as a kid.  You will not be disappointed don't wait to see it on DVD. See it where it sounds great and is the most fun in the movie theater."
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,"Highly engaging, at times a bit corny, but overall riveting"
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,I loved it.....big Star Wars fan!!!
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,"This is a fantastic film that resurrects the failing ""Sequal"" trilogy and repairs some of the damage left behind by its unfavourable predecessor for all fans alike. Though it does have it's faults throughout, they can be forgiven by it's action packed scenes, compelling story and it's interesting finale. A marvelous way to end a lovable and unforgettable franchise."
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,"More of the same, I wasn't awed this time around."
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,This was a good ending to the Skywalker chapter of Star Wars we know and love.
"Jan 11, 2020",negative,This movie was a big joke.
"Jan 11, 2020",negative,10 years ago Star Wars was just 1-6. It already had an ending and this movie contradicted everything. It contradicted the plot that Anakin alone was to destroy the sith and bring balance.
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,"In my opinion, JJ Abrams tried to walk a very tight line - in most places, I felt he succeeded in doing so. The film is fast paced and exciting. For what Star Wars is - a popcorn munching, pop-culture phenomenon - this entry is a perfect, nostalgic sendoff for the main saga of films. It will surely leave this generation with just as fond memories as those films which came before it. 8/10"
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,I enjoyed the movie.  I'm not a hard core SW follower but have seen all the movies.  I only wish the scene where Rey had the forces of all the prior Jedis with her had been a tad more climactic.  I was left feeling very underwhelmed for something that seemingly should have been a much more powerful part of the movie.
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,An amazing and epic ending of a saga that has made such an impact on the movie industry and on popculture. I loved Star Wars from the very beginning and this ending is perfect!
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,Typical Star Wars - cheesy but totally entertaining!
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,Best Star Wars movie
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,"I thought they worked in Carrie Fisher beautifully as well as Mark Hamill and Harrison Ford, but I missed O-b-won and Yoda!"
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,It was a replay of Episode 4’s storyline.
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,Best of the newest movies!!
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,"Overall I think that Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker was a great movie.  It was well made and boasted amazing graphics along with the development of the Star Wars characters we all know and love.  The movie also featured lightsaber battles and an inner conflict between Rey and Kylo ren.  Although the movie is great in all of the areas you would expect this kind of movie to be great in, I do have a couple gripes about the movie.  First of all, throughout the whole movie you knew what was coming next.  For my taste, the movie was too predictable, something you just don't see in a billion dollar movie.  Lastly, the movie did a very bad job implementing Palpitine.  Having him as the ruler of the dark side with the same manipulative abilities, but without the power you would expect from his former self.  While this movie shined in most areas, the movie is too predictable and Emperor palpatine is not what you would expect which irritates me."
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,"Spectacular movie with an amazing ending, at Tatooine."
"Jan 11, 2020",negative,Could of been fun but it felt like two movies crammed into one. It felt like several versions of scenes were made then cobbled together to see which order of then would offend the least amount of people.
"Jan 11, 2020",neutral,"Shallow, brain dead, superficial, fun.  You certainly leave the theater with the realization that nothing is accomplished with the final three movies, and also, balancing the force was never actually a thing."
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,"While I definitely had my issues with it, overall I enjoyed the movie and had a fun time watching it."
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,Thrilling end to a nine film saga
"Jan 11, 2020",negative,"just when you thought it couldn't get any worse, they  totally destroyed the franchise with the worst Star Wars movie of all time. lazy writiing, inconsistency and pure nonsense. Disney and Abrams seemed  to be more interested in diversity than a good story. The writers and director must think the audience are complete imbeciles if they expect us to swallow this. It does not deserve to be called a Star Wars film. shame on Disney and J.J. Abrams for doing this to the franchise."
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,"Nice end to the latest trilogy but the pacing of the movie was a bit strange and at times seemed too predictable - but that's Star Wars! Probably the worst of the latest films but having said that it is still enjoyable to watch. A wasted casting for John Boyega, screaming ""Rey"" for three films isn't the best way to use such a great actor."
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,"Action packed  and well connected to previous Star Wars Movies.  If you liked the previous movies, this is a must see.  You will not be disappointed."
"Jan 11, 2020",negative,"Bad story, broken canon and even bad visual and audio compare to others movies. The only somehow working character is Ren. Other - is more than just bad."
"Jan 11, 2020",negative,Some truly amazing scenes muddled with a very rushed pace and lack of emotion throughout. Needed to be a two-parter to feel at the right pace and allow you to think about what you've just witnessed without questionable plot devices and the strong feeling of missing scenes throughout. Ending sequences are hilariously bizare and frustrating. Makes the prequals a better experience.
"Jan 11, 2020",neutral,"It was a hood movie, just not as good as some of the other Star Wars. Glad we went to see it."
"Jan 11, 2020",negative,"Underwhelming, poorly edited (they forgot the trademark LFL scene transition effect for the entire thing) with a incoherent story that recons The Last Jedi as well as their own comic books and canon material released in 2019.
I was annoyed and at the end I wished I could unsee it."
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,"must see for SW fans. Has it's faults but loved the homages to
the original characters. CGI enhanced rather than hindered and cast
on fine form."
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,"I cannot comprehend why people are so intent on hating this film. It was a brilliant end to the saga, and finally tied up loose ends, and FITS THE STAR WARS STORY! Yes it's fast-paced and there's fan service, but please don't hate this film because it's too Star Wars."
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,"As a Star Wars fan, I went into this movie hoping for the best. I had heard the negative reviews but chose to ignore them and create my own conclusion. The reviews have been a bit too harsh, but not far from the truth. The beginning of the movie is so scattered and I could not understand the plot because of the fast changes in the scenes. I felt the ending was very confusing and left me wanting more, but not in a good way. If one can ignore all the plot holes and just go for a fun time, then it will be a great movie. As a fan, however I was a bit disappointed."
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,Visually the movie was fantastic. The story is struggling.
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,I am not a Star Wars fan. In fact these movies are really boring to me. But I enjoyed this one a lot.
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,"Had fun watching the film and liked the fan service overall.  There is so much to process and will need a second viewing to see what I missed.  The movie needed more time to develop some plot points and characters.  Hope there is a Director's cut.  This is why the future of storytelling is on TV shows and Video Games, if done right you can develop characters and stories with more detail.  2 to 3 hours is not enough."
"Jan 11, 2020",negative,The writing was horrible. The plot made no sense. Canon was destroyed. Repeated storylines and everyone is always related. Done with it.
"Jan 11, 2020",negative,"Full of plot holes, disrespects...no...DESTROYS Luke AND Anakin/Vader's story arcs. Logic definitely flies off to another galaxy far far away."
"Jan 11, 2020",negative,"I came into this movie having the bar set so low, and yet, I still find myself disappointed. I will admit, I loved the first 2 minutes of the movie after the title roll. The cinematography of Kylo and his search were well done. After that, it was a downward spiral. The film moves so fast, it's hard to keep up. They easily packed 2, maybe even 3 movies into 1. Each subplot is immediately solved in a matter of minutes, sometimes even seconds! This movies honestly seems like it was made for trailers. Everything you see in the trailer makes absolutely no sense when you're watching it. It's so messy. I appreciate J.J. trying to appeal to fan service, and I did love how he basically gave Rian Johnson a big middle finger to the previous film. Other than that, I hated the rest of this film. If you love pretty visuals in movies, you might enjoy this. However, if you're a fan a Star Wars, you will be insulted. Disney is insulting the intelligence of its fans."
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,"PLOT TWISTS, SEQUENCE. EFFECTS, AND CHARACTER ARKS!!! THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO SAY!"
"Jan 11, 2020",negative,"For the amount of breathless action in this film, it was pretty dull. Lots of McGuffins, lots of getting from one place to another, lots of winks to fandom and digs at The Last Jedi, lots of crises immediately defused, lots of Force-related abilities that don't make much sense."
"Jan 11, 2020",negative,full commercial shit
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,regardless of what anyone says movie is fye
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,I liked who/whatreally Rey is
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,"The new characters are still cringy, tone them down a bit and you have something. Definitely a penalty flag for excessive celebration near the end. Loved the the young Luke and leia scene, touched on what I really wanted out of this trilogy. The first exegol scene was good as well. All in all this was a decent movie but the trilogy as a whole is a giant missed opportunity."
"Jan 11, 2020",negative,What a dumpster fire of Swiss cheese plot problems and a “let’s just try everything” blind swings. 
"Jan 11, 2020",negative,It poised more questions than give actual answers.
"Jan 11, 2020",negative,"It seems like they didn't have any story here. I was watching a PlayStation game where random characters provide clues to keep the story going.

Let's not even start with the force 
1. Ability to heal now is wide spread
2. The force can hold back a spaceship...really why didn't Darby Vader do that to the millennium falcon 
3. Palpatine can disable an entire fleet of rebel ships...seriously this is god like 
4. Communicate across the galaxy and be able to grab objects.

Wow Disney...."
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,"Great movie, I saw it in 3D.  It was worth it."
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,Good movie. Little bit of fan service in parts but altogether my favorite of the sequel trilogy. Felt like a nice way to end up the Skywalker Saga.
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,I actually really loved it!!
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,One of the best Star Wars movies. Top three
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,A good conclusion to the latest star wars chapter
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,"Liked: Answered all the questions that lead up to its final installment. Story is awesome, interesting, and intriguing. Disliked: wish there was alittle more lightsaber battles and I felt that the ending fight could’ve been added more to as well."
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,42 Years of my life wrapped up in 2.5 hours. It was not perfect but it wrapped up all the stories while adding some twists. I enjoyed the tension between Kilo & Rey and where that went. Who Rey is not what I saw coming but it follows the whole timeline. There are still place to go with the stories so it will be interesting to see what comes out of it.
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,"I honestly enjoyed the movie. I also think it could have been a 9a and 9b. The reason why?, because of plot. I would have love to have seen what happened to palpatine leading up to the final showdown. Even how Snoke was made. The explanation of the diode would be a added bonus. The movie itself is great from what time they had left to pull this off."
"Jan 11, 2020",negative,"This movie was very enjoyable, I loved watching it. Everything that happened in the film, where the story was taken and how it inevitably ""ended"" the saga was just pitiful. I couldn't tell if Abrams was creating something new and unique for Star Wars is if he was just trying to provide damage control to a movie that die hard fans despised. Disney did really well with this movie regarding the visuals, and the music was just spectacular. I found that the main villain was wasted, and all the other small villains were just boring or misused. A lot of the supporting roles (and the main roles) were basic and dull. Adam Driver did a good job, I guess - he did as good as anyone could do with what he was given. It's unfortunate, Force Awakens was a blast, Last Jedi was shocking evil and Skywalker was just... sad."
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,I wish Ben didnt die  great movie though
"Jan 11, 2020",negative,"Es un ejemplo de que hay cosas que son perfectas tal y como están. Star wars era perfecta así como quedó pero sacaron una nueva trilogía que nada que ver con la trama, algo rebuscado, batallas que dejaban un sabor amargo, momentos épicos sostenidos por las verdaderas glorias del pasado (luke, solo, r2d2, leía y chwie) donde nos alegrabamos más de la emoción del recuerdo que de la misma película...
Felicidades Disney.. Dañaste a star wars"
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,I wasn’t disappointed. Liked  how the story developed.
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,Star Wars was Awesome!! Made me cry made me laugh!!  I wouldn’t change s thing.  Absolutely loved ever part of it I am 70 now and I still as young as I was (at26) watching A New Hope!  ❤️
"Jan 11, 2020",neutral,Not that exciting of a story.. fairly predictable and by the end all the ghosts of the past had been dredged up to bring the goodness back to the screen.
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,Great finish to the Series. Glad I saw it
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,"While better than The Last Jedi, the story was still overly derivative of the original trilogy and tried to cram too much into one film. The pacing was too frantic and crowded leaving little space to care about what happens to whom. An underwhelming end to the saga."
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,I love it!!!. Great way to end an amazing saga.
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,I loved it. I can't for what's to come.
"Jan 11, 2020",negative,This movie just didn't make sense. Poor writing quality. What a half assed way to end a saga.
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,Pretty good.  Weakish story but pretty decent acting and reasonably good effects.  See it if you want.
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,"Waited for a long time for this one and it was definitely worth it! Seeing it in 3D was totally amazing, not to mention the theater shook every time there was a big action scene. I would definitely see this one again."
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,"I really like the acting from Daisy Ridley & Adam Driver. I liked the sets & props. I thought the editing was too fast & choppy. I thought the story was a mess. But I guess that's it for this storyline... Let's go on some new adventures in this Galaxy from a long time ago far far away, shall we?"
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,"Good but not great. Aside from the ending, every battle or action scene was very minor. Needed more large scale battles in my opinion."
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,"Words cannot describe my feelings for this movie.
It is epic beginning to end.
SPOILERS

Palpatine is used if not annoying how he wasn't explained how he was alive other than a prequel quote but he was used very well and drove the story to  one of the best final battle scenes in the saga. 
Rey being a palpatine but at the end calling herself a skywalker shows that names don't define a person and it it the person who makes a difference.

10/10  SEE 10000 TIMES"
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,Amazing movie .. I think this is one of my favorite now
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,I'm not a Star Wars devotee so the movie was good but I got lost on some of it's meaning.
"Jan 11, 2020",negative,I didn't think it could get worse. But it did.
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,"2nd time I've seen it, yeah there are things I would change, but I don't think it warrants the hate it deserves."
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,Awesome great  movie
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,Best since the originals! 😁
"Jan 11, 2020",negative,Film that does not take any chances at all. Director who did nothing innovative and only took advantage of things that already existed. This is a fan fear.
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,I enjoyed the movie thoroughly it was fast paced but I had no trouble keeping up. There were things I would have changed however I understood why things were made it was a great experience. Always fun to watch a new Star Wars film
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,"Satisfying yet frustrating, overall the Episode 9 ties too nice a bow on the final trilogy (probably) of the Star Wars franchise.  There's a lot of nostalgia and good feelings and walking out of the theater with the music playing in the closing credits still brings goosebumps.  The set pieces are captivating even if the material isn't fresh and the script is nearly total formula.  Don't think about it too much and enjoy it!  Final Score:  7.1/10"
"Jan 11, 2020",negative,"Predictable and frankly a bit boring. The special effects were awesome, but the plot and unfolding story was all over the place. It seems the director was trying to pull another film from an already stretched saga."
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,Loved it!! My favorite so far!
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,Great way to end the trilogy and Skywalker era movies....nice closure to a bunch of stories with surprising conclusions...
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,Way better than the previous installment
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,Really feel like it lived up to the star wars legacy. Made me feel like I got to see one of the original trilogy movies in theater.
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,Probably my favorite Star Wars movie ever.
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,"Too many plot holes, but still very entertaining"
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,I always enjoy following the Star War episodes.
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,I was a great ending to the Skywalker Sega
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,"Probably the most disappointing Star Wars movie since The Phantom Menace. Now, I actually don't have a lot of issues with this film. Only 3 issues really stand out to me, but they are 3 very major issues. The first is the pacing. Were the prequels or The Last Jedi too slow for you? Well, this movie moves along so fast it barely gives you any time to breathe! For some who just want to go on a fun ride, this might be a good thing. For me though, slowing down and letting the characters just talk to each other is really important. This movie barely does that. There is always something going on or a plot twist being dropped. It went so fast, I didn't even have time to comprehend a lot of it! This movie feels very rushed. It does slow down a little later on, but it's still a major issue with a good chunk of the film. There are also WAY too many new characters introduced! You have a large enough cast as it is, just work with what you already have! My second issue is Palpatine. It's no spoiler that Emperor Palpatine returns in this movie. His voice can be heard in every trailer and he's on the teaser poster. You're supposed to know this going in. Palpatine's return is handled horribly. He's supposed to be the main villain even though he's been completely absent from the last two movies. It's completely anti-climactic. None of the characters know who he is or have any real connection with him. We're supposed to accept that he's somehow still alive even though we saw him die! He fell down a pit and EXPLODED!!! It's not like bringing back Maul or Boba Fett. They literally tell you he came back to life in the opening crawl and then go on to hand-wave it away with a prequel meme. That's it. I'm not kidding. It's embarrassing how poorly-written he is. They never explain where he's been all this time, what he's been up to, why he's been doing it, how he's been doing it, why he's waited so long, or how he was resurrected. Did someone fish his body out of the Death Star? Is he some kind of clone, like in the old Dark Empire comics? Is he a ghost? I have no idea, and I bet the filmmakers don't either. It's insulting. The third issue I have with this film is the lack of continuity with the other movies, The Last Jedi especially. A lot of that movie is either ignored or undone by this movie. Rose is replaced with a giant slug monster and relegated to a background role, they bring in an Emperor figure when the last movie made a point to get rid of that and have Kylo Ren be the main villain, and let's just say that Rey isn't exactly a nobody. Could you imagine if Richard Marquand got rid of Lando and made Luke not actually Vader's son in Return of the Jedi? It's so frustrating. JJ Abrams sacrificed a flowing narrative for this trilogy for his own original vision. It's selfish and it's childish. Again, this may be a positive if you hated The Last Jedi. I really like The Last Jedi, so this really bothered me. It's clear that there was no plan for this trilogy from the beginning and the filmmakers didn't have enough communication with one another. It's not only TLJ that this movie retcons. Bringing Palpatine back really diminishes Anakin's sacrifice at the end of Return of the Jedi and kind of rewrites the entire Star Wars mythos. He was the chosen one, prophesied to destroy the Sith and bring balance to the Force. He did that by killing Palpatine in Return of the Jedi. Only he didn't, Palpatine survived. I had the same issue with the old Expanded Universe. I thought the reason they got rid of the EU was so that they could improve on the post-Jedi storyline, not repeat the same mistakes it made, only somehow worse. Who's the chosen one now? What's the point of the prophecy? What did Anakin die for? I have no idea! This movie also contradicts some of the newer books and comics. Again, I thought the point of getting rid of the EU was to create a more cohesive universe with the films and the non-film material. If the movies are still going to ignore or contradict the books and comics, why did they find it necessary to discontinue the old books and comics from coming out at all? They could have two timelines going on at the same time, I don't think it would be confusing! Anyway, I'm getting very nerdy and off-topic. From how much I'm trashing this movie, you might think that I hate it. I don't. I still had fun watching it and there was quite a bit that I enjoyed. Rey and Kylo Ren are still great, the effects are excellent as always (The integration of the Carrie Fisher footage is pretty seamless.), the action is thrilling, there's good comedy, the acting is good and there are many surprises that got me genuinely excited. I also liked how it didn't retcon the Luke storyline from TLJ, they just made it more clear for those in the audience who didn't fully understand the point of it in the last movie. This movie also explains why Hyperspace ramming isn't a common tactic in warfare in the Star Wars universe, after it was shown to be so deadly in The Last Jedi. Overall, this movie is an absolute mess and a major disappointment, but it makes for a fun time out at the movies. Just don't think too hard about how it connects with the other Star Wars movies and you'll be fine. I can see why people like it, it's just not for me."
"Jan 11, 2020",negative,"Meh, just meh. It was alright, if it wasn't supposed to be the conclusion of a predetermined 9 episode series. Perhaps this should've been the 1s first film of the final trilogy."
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,Great action and a true Star Wars movie
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,It’s Star Wars!!! It tied everything together nicely!!!
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,This movie was amazing. It answered some questions and left some to be desired. The graphics were amazing and the acting was top notch.
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,"Great story line, lots of action."
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,"Enjoyable movie, but more of the same storyline.  Too PG for my liking."
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,Great way to end the Saga!
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,There were a lot of things to like in this movie. I liked the way they brought back all the old characters from the original trilogy. I also like the way it came full circle at the end. I especially liked the redemption of Ben through Rey's compassion and healing. I just thought that was really uplifting.
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,"This movie was excellent!  Kept me on my toes, I teared up,   Couldn’t believe it just like the cast lol, I’m literally going to start all over with movies... I don’t disagree with how it ended contrary to some of the opinions I’ve heard... I thought it was perfect!"
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,Really good movie. Kept my attention through the entire movie.
"Jan 11, 2020",negative,"This movie was horrible not only in the grand scheme of the star wars mythos but as an individual narrative. This movie tries to ignore aspects of the other two films, pulls out random get out of jail free cards because movie, continues the trend of making Rey unessecarily powerful with an explanation that is not sufficient enough to justify it, both Rey and kylo are inconsisted characters(poor daisy and Adam too cause acting wise they did fantastic just bad writing), and certain characters who were built up as supposed to mean something didnt matter. The biggest issue I had with the movie was the infornation of it all in that what needed to be explained was never explained and what didnt need to be explained was not only explained but sometimes more than once. That and the idea that two separate scwnes in the film allude to another time period just loke in the last jedi where it makes the viewer feel like we missed a complete other movie. There is more I wish to go over but it would breach on spoiler territory. I still feel it is worth the watch but because it is star wars not because it is good. This film is the end of an era and hopefully when the next trilogy is better than this. I would also like to highlight that many of this films issues were a direct result of Rian Johnson's work horrible work on the last jedi but I digress."
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,"it was just okay , I liked and I hated . I don't know how to describe all my feelings or to slam it as a bad movie . My childhood feels incomplete says this 41 yr old man who was hoping for an epic conclusion . It is what it is ... the good, the bad,  and The End!"
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,Loved it...felt like one of the original 3
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,It was Star Wars from beginning to end. Not a perfect movie but it's a great Star Wars movie!!!!!!
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,"I am not a Starwars fan but the movie wasn't bad. I mean, I kind of like Starwars but overall, I liked it!!!!!"
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,Stars Wars speaks for itself
"Jan 11, 2020",negative,its the worst movie I have seen in the past years. what a waste of money and time.
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,Wife was a little annoying
"Jan 11, 2020",negative,"Like a multi-layered Jello-O salad, each dissonant component of this movie is miserable and disappointing in its own right, and yet somehow the whole is worse than the sum of its parts."
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,Critics are being a bit harsh on this one. It got a lot right pulling some heartstrings. And it also went for bigger instead of innovative and got a bit jumbled in trying to fit so much in.
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,Finally a feature-length space Western action soap opera with representation!
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,"I watched all ten prequels just before watching this one which made it more enjoyable, but I was thrown off by the introduction of all new sets of random powers that didnt correlate to the earlier movies. Made me feel like I was watching another avengers flick where the rules of what the heros powers and strengths are change scene to scene. But I was still entertained. The quality was great, as were the characters sand the actors  who played them."
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,"Spectacular!
Better than we expected. 
Still a little lost in parts of the story but this was a very entertaining movie, we loved it, and plan to see it again. 
The IMAX experience was really great."
"Jan 11, 2020",negative,"Another spin off movie that seems to be a dream sequence storyboard. No need to watch prior 8 movies, this will only create confusion. 

**Spoiler **: Anticipated Rey was a Skywalker by blood not by a last minute decision before the movie ends so the title had a purpose... Rey's bond with portrayed father figure Han Solo in ep. 7 and brother Kylo Ren in ep 7 & 8, left me anticipating a finishing tale to explain how the Skywalker bloodline finishes the destruction of Darth Sidious once again and continues the training of the Jedi as episodes 1-8 lead up to."
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,I loved it and can’t wait to watch it again
"Jan 11, 2020",negative,"Cheesy, poor character explanations, too many plot holes to name"
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,"The conclusion the fans expected. Thanks JJ Abrams, you have been in charge of this trilogy from the beginning. Dear Disney: delete episode viii the last jedi. Say goodbye to Rian Johnson and Kathleen Kennedy please and we forgive you all Disney."
"Jan 11, 2020",negative,"Don't watch it. Don't consider it canon. Seriously. This is not worth it. This trilogy is not worth it. Just consider it non-canon, don't watch, don't show this trilogy to future generations. This movie legitemately takes a dump on the original saga. This whole trilogy does that, but especially this one. Just don't. Don't. Don't."
"Jan 11, 2020",neutral,"Ah, another Stars Wars movie that you have to see. Jumbled abysmal plot, bad dialog, questionable acting, less than the best CGI. Thankfully, it does move at a quick pace"
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,I liked the way they ended the Star Wars saga.  Further I was impressed with the portrayal of Leia even though she passed away before this movie was made.
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,My husband and I really liked this Star Wars Movie better than the last one!
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,brings a sense of epicness back to the sequels. I liked it but can understand why a casual fan would get lost
"Jan 11, 2020",neutral,It was better than The Last Jedi
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,The best one yet. You can watch and enjoy without having watched all of the others.
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,Luke Skywalker: fixed. Rey's insane power: explained. Hyper space ramming: fixed. Kylo Ren: finally well utilized. Snoke: explained. The characters: finally had meaningful relationships and interactions. Pacing: mild whiplash
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,The second time was better than the first!! 
"Jan 11, 2020",neutral,"Fraco, o mesmo  roteiro de filmes anteriores... Pegaram um chapéu de mágico e tiraram um filho de Palpatine..."
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,Excellent story lines and secrets revealed!!! Amazing cinematography...loved it...I sense another movie in the works eventually
"Jan 11, 2020",neutral,"I've seen all the Star Wars films, however was minimally entertained by the last 3...yawn.  Watched this for just $6.50 and nearly walked out.   Not a big fan of non-sense fantasy or magic while a huge fan of more science based scifi, so have always been more Star Trek oriented.  Recent Star Wars films have increasingly moved into the fantasy direction that are on the level of non-sense super hero stories.  Also casting seems to be appeasing all the politically correct and global marketing types.  Dialogue was so predictable and tended to touch all the pc bases.   Not likely to watch any more of these films."
"Jan 10, 2020",negative,"Terrible. Just terrible. The writing is completely non-sensical, as the main character, ""Rey"" is a Mary Sue. A Mary Sue is easily defined as the universe bends to the characters will. We see this as A: a character shown in previous movies is written to be a professional pilot, and all a sudden this lonely hermit who's lived their entire life alone is suddenly better than them. And B: everyone loves the character, and she does NOTHING wrong. If she does do something negative, it's an accident and she was trying to protect them. This character was only invented for political reasons, and like effing clockwork, it is a terrible mess. As a long-time Star Wars fan, seeing this dumpster fire of a movie just makes me sad. This is mostly Disney's fault, as apparently they meddled with everything. You have ruined my favorite fiction story."
"Jan 10, 2020",negative,"Filme bagunçado, ruim!"
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,A really exciting movie. The Star Wars movie thus far.
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,Entertaining and satisfying.
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,Too long to wait for action
"Jan 10, 2020",negative,tiring and repetitive and cheezey
"Jan 10, 2020",negative,"A truly uninspiring finale to what should have been the greatest big-screen adventure of our generation. Every part of Rise of Skywalker feels contrived and mediocre. The characters take a back seat to unbelievably awkward plot choices and convoluted worldbuilding that’s as thick as a jungle and every bit as unkempt. It’s clear at every turn that Disney and Abrams worked feverishly to walk back each one of the interesting decisions Johnson made in The Last Jedi, making it abundantly clear that Abrams is great at regurgitating stories, but possesses no real spark of originality. The emotional weight of the trilogy’s most interesting characters gets sidelined by flashy visuals and ill attempts to shock the audience, and each moment intended to make a resounding impact simply falls utterly flat. Rey is suddenly a completely uninteresting heroine, with new connections that dodge the greater emotional implications of her arc in the previous two films, while simultaneously cheapening her arc in this one. We’re expected to believe that she’s been genuinely tempted to the dark side when we’ve only ever seen her get a little miffed here and there, and that she—by herself—has the strength that the most accomplished Jedi masters at the height of the Jedi Order did not. Beyond that, the one great shining light throughout this whole trilogy—Adam Driver’s Kylo Ren—gets utterly deflated and turned into a dopey awkward child with no real sacrifice to justify a redemption (and significantly less motivation than Vader had as he watched his son—one of the last connections to his departed wife—get tortured to death). It’s clear Disney wanted to answer fan questions, however their obsession to address every single one of them means they don’t really answer any of them at all (see: Snoke). Overall it’s a very disappointing ramble through the bits of a galaxy far far away that no one ever really cared to see, driven at a breakneck pace that seems to hope you won’t ask questions if they just move fast and get it over with as soon as possible. As a pretty hardcore fan of the Star Wars franchise very few things have left me as disappointed as this film. I also feel like I should say my cold response wasn’t the result of me expecting to see my own story ideas or the choices I would have made on the screen, i think I was just hoping for a cohesive conclusion to a three-film saga that respected each installment and allowed the characters to grow in organic ways. They could have easily ripped this script off of a reddit post that was upset about The Last Jedi. At the very least they buttoned up the story well enough that none of us should ever have to look at these dismal characters on the big-screen ever again—and for that I can say I’m grateful Rey is the last Jedi."
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,"Better than Last Jedi, but still not as good as Force Awakens. Amazing visuals but not the greatest overall storyline "
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,I had high hopes for this film but I was disappointed. it has good action scenes and the visuals are great but it was too hard to watch. in the first 20min the dialogue was terrible plus there are no surprise moments just wtf moments I hope this make sense the second time I watch the film best performance is by Adam driver.
"Jan 10, 2020",negative,"A horrible end to a great film series. The Star Wars saga was complete at the end of Return of the Jedi. Great special effects does not make up for a lack of quality story telling. Adding a 4th act is simply structurally poor writing, and I am sure George Lucas was well aware of this. The latest installment is as hollow a tale as its two predecessors. If I could give negative stars I would."
"Jan 10, 2020",negative,It was as bad as the second one. It shouldn't worth not even a $0.10 ticket.
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,Loved how they tied everything together!
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,"Solid,  not awesome.. I will take it. Hard to speak without spoilers, but in quick bullet points - knights of Ren, disappointing, Kylo Ren - awesome, Rey - no spoilers, but predictable, flashbacks - solid, fights - need more lightsaber action, space battles - awesome, story - final, finished. There is no going back. Probably for the best. If you didn’t like two before ep  IX, you won’t like this one either. If you did, you will have fun. Thank you to all the people who made this real through their hard work. I appreciate it!"
"Jan 10, 2020",negative,The story line all over the place and it was hard to follow. Thanks
"Jan 10, 2020",negative,"Not as bad as some have said BUT plot holes you can drive a fleet of star destroyers through
So, my rating – worst to best
The last Jedi (after Rise this movie need not exist)
The Force Awakens (A New Hope v2)
The Phantom Menace
Rise of Skywalker
Attack of the Clones
Return of the Jedi
Revenge of the Sith
A New Hope
The Empire Strikes Back

The force has no rules - it can do whatever you need it to."
"Jan 10, 2020",negative,"This movie moves so fast and makes so little thematic sense that it's hard to imagine it not being in the bottom three Star Wars films when we look back in a few years. JJ Abrams completely failed to rise to the challenge that Rian Johnson presented, tried to please two different fan camps, and broke the story."
"Jan 10, 2020",neutral,"Works as a movie. Lots of action and less story, but hey, don't think Abrams had an easy starting point and he didn't mess up completely"
"Jan 10, 2020",negative,"For a movie that was so long, it seemed to be filled with a lot of fluff. There was a lot of pointless action scenes in the first half that seemed to go nowhere that could have been cut out to make way for scenes to transition the plot. It seemed to just be a linear ride instead of a story driven by characters. While the CG looked amazing, I was quite bored until the climax."
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,Loved it! True Star Wars fans must give in to the Hate
"Jan 10, 2020",negative,"This is not my Star Wars.I don't know what happened,but apart from the visuals ( got that Disney money yo) and some intresting ideas that never get fully developed,there is not a single thing about TROS that makes me appreciate it."
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,Perfect cape to complete the series!!
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,"I absolutely loved this movie. Yes there were problems (mostly because of the disaster that Rian left) but it was so much fun, so fast, so full of action and feels that I could look past the flaws, at least on the first viewing so far. All these stupid comments about fan service just drive me nuts. Isn't that who these movies are made for? The FANS! Want a brand new movie going experience or something that is going to surprise you? Go see a good Rian Johnson movie, Knives Out. He is a great filmmaker when he is completely doing his own stuff and not taking the reigns of a 30 plus year franchise that has crazy loyal fans. But if you want a Star Wars movie, filled with characters and action and plot points that you love and want more of, go see this movie. JJ Abrams is a true fan and I only wish he could have done the story as he wanted it played out."
"Jan 10, 2020",negative,"Allow me to preface this review by stating that I enjoy every Star Wars film (yes, including The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones) and this was no exception. It was a highly entertaining romp that included many fun call-backs to service long-term fans of the franchise, from revisiting the ruins of the Death Star to seeing the return of Luke Skywalker's X-Wing from A New Hope. That being said, The Rise of Skywalker suffered from indecision and inconsistency within itself and in the context of the Star Wars canon.

JJ Abrams was not expected to have further involvement in the reprised Star Wars series following his direction of The Force Awakens. This is painfully obvious in The Rise of Skywalker, which seems determined to disavow the developments of The Last Jedi – such as the romance between Finn and Rose, the use of force by laymen and Rae's unspectacular parentage – in favour of a return to traditional form.

The Rise of Skywalker sees the return of Emperor Palpatine, who was believed to have been killed by Darth Vader in Return of the Jedi. While the return of a historical villain is itself indicative of the film being mired in the past, it is made more problematic given that it is revealed in the opening crawl, with no explanation of how it occurred, nor any comment on its significance.

In the course of the film, it is revealed that Rae is the granddaughter of Emperor Palpatine. This undermines the narrative development of The Last Jedi, which had sought to establish that Rae's force ability was not genetic, thereby heralding the possibility that regular people could harness the power of the force. The Palpatine lineage also becomes a crux for poor storytelling, justifying underdeveloped plot points such as Rae's proficiency with a lightsaber, despite her having no prior experience.

Additionally, The Rise of Skywalker suffered from the traditional flaws of most Disney films, being that there was a lack of stakes and that the desire to please the audience outweighed the need for narrative cohesion and originality. This was most evident in the multiple resurrections that occurred in the film, which robbed the audience of the opportunity to actually feel something.

The Rise of Skywalker was at its strongest when it focused on the relationship between Rae and Kylo Ren, and this is perhaps true of each of the new films in the reprised triad. This can be attributed to the sense of interiority of the Kylo Ren character – he has dimensionality, which makes him the most interesting person in a film that is populated with many stagnant personalities. Adam Driver carries the narrative tension of the film, as it is Kylo Ren who is truly torn between the light side and dark side. This is why it is so satisfying when we see him wield a blue lightsaber when he joins Rae in her battle against Emperor Palpatine. That being said, I am unsure that his turn to the light was truly earned, having been prompted merely by hearing his mother call him ""Ben"", his true name.

In spite of the above, even Kylo Ren is not safe from the broad strokes of fan-service inherent to a Disney movie. After Emperor Palpatine has been destroyed, Rae is dead and Kylo Ren has survived. In many other films, this could be considered a bittersweet and impactful ending, which acknowledges the importance of sacrifice. However, Disney is insistent that the ""hero"" be preserved. Accordingly, Kylo Ren uses his remaining life force to resurrect Rae and dies in her stead, bringing the story back within the Disney framework. I was pushed beyond mere annoyance and into a blind rage when Rae and Kylo began to kiss as he was dying, thereby confirming a romance that had been highly sought after by many Star Wars fans.

The sheer level of on-the-nose wish fulfillment displayed here speaks to the detrimental effect of social media on our culture, at least to the extent that artists pay heed to what is voiced on these platforms. Great art (and therefore great film) requires the creator to express their true nature in a singular, cohesive vision. When the audience is allowed to influence the creative process, their competing opinions and ideas result in a highly-fragmented and ultimately incoherent piece of work.

Overall, while The Rise of Skywalker is an enjoyable cinematic experience, I am disappointed by what feels like a missed opportunity to expand on the Star Wars universe narratively and conceptually. Abrams' desire to return to the status quo is, rather comically, made physically manifest in the poor reconstruction of Kylo Ren's helmet, which had been shattered in The Last Jedi.

 This brings to mind Hannibal Lecter's musings on entropy:

""you may see a cup of tea fall off a table and break into pieces…but you will never see the cup gather itself back together…the increase of disorder, or entropy, is what distinguishes the past from the future.""

The Last Jedi dismantled many of the assumptions that existed within the Star Wars canon and Abrams spends the entirety of The Rise of Skywalker attempting to reconstruct them. The law of entropy suggests things cannot be restored to their original state once they are broken. The Rise of Skywalker insists on trying to do this anyway, and this is why it is ultimately unsuccessful."
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,It was amazing! The special effects were great. The emotion from Rey was intense and very well done.
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,Perfect in every way. Well done!!
"Jan 10, 2020",negative,"Was hopeful for at least a decent movie but no, it was boring and I fell asleep 3-4 times. By the end I was glad it was over. Too disneyfied, lacking soul. "
"Jan 10, 2020",negative,Way too happy. Way too jumbled up. Why spoil the Sideous mystery first thing? Why not build up to him.. Why have his ships completely unprepared just so that the resistance can come blow them up in the nick of time? Nothing made sense. Subpar.
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,"Loved it: this movie was exactly what I needed to see. cried like a 10 year old girl like 3 times. For real, I needed to see this. Thanks Abrams"
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,"Steps out of the rehashing found in Force Awakens and Last Jedi (deferential to New Hope and subversively mashing Empire Strikes Back), presenting old and new faces. Entertaining while not rising enough to be great. There are wonderful scenes, like Babu Frik becoming friends with C-3PO, Kylo/Ben's conversation with his father, and seeing Luke finally lift his X-wing with the force that really stand out. Finally seeing a Sith planet, or a small glimpse of Leia training as a Jedi are nice too. The movie tries to do too much, packing in the finale for both the Disney Sequel Trilogy as well as the 9 movie Skywalker saga, which is its ultimate downfall.  The movie has enough fun to be worth a watch and for non-critics, it will be less polarizing than its predecessor."
"Jan 10, 2020",negative,Sucked. Lame story line.
"Jan 10, 2020",negative,The movie was extremely bad. Not did it have a bad story but also it had man bullshit moments and extremely cringy ones. It missed so many opportunities I can't even list it and anakin not showing up or the other jedi was extrem stupid. Having kylo die makes the force be out of balance yet again. This movie destroys the original trilogy and anakin arc basically it destroys starwars. For me this movie is not Canon and especially at the end I had a good laugh.
"Jan 10, 2020",negative,"While the visuals and score are amazing, The Rise of Skywalker is filled with plot holes and edited incredibly poorly. Also Rey is a jedi god and Palpatine is somehow alive..."
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,"Es una muy buena película sinceramente es genial pero al ser el final de la saga de skywalker se ve muy forzado ya que en anteriores películas de Star wars como the last Jedi no se sentía mucho la conexión con the rise of skywalker faltó más para ser el final de una gran franquicia pues la batalla final se ve muy forzada si hubiese Sido el final de una trilogía la cuál tendría otra continuación  está película hubiese Sido perfecta para que la película se sintiera como el final es la aparición de varios personajes antiguos como yoda, Obi wan, qui gon jinn, windu bueno la Unión de varios personajes antiguos puede ser un plageo de endgame pero hubieron personajes muy importantes que influyeron mucho en la historia también una aparición de Anakin skywalker hubiera causado una gran reacción por el público y también otra dónde aparezca Padmé. Una gran fiesta como en el episodio VI dónde toda la galaxia festeja y que todos aquellos  que murieron aparecieran envés de solo Luke y Leila ese final de que rey se hace llamar una skywalker fue perfecto para que la familia volviera a asender"
"Jan 10, 2020",neutral,Should have been two movies. Too much material without character or plot development.
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,"It's a fun movie. I watch these Star Wars movie and the flash bangs happen, and I forget everything at the end."
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,"I liked it. It's a good enough ending and it's a thrilling movie to watch. While there are always a few things you can quibble with in a Star Wars movie, I think for the most part they did right by the franchise and I'm sorry we won't be seeing more of these characters. Or will we?"
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,It was very average and not very creative. It seemed like a movie Disney puts out on every ending blockbuster movie like endgame. And Ray complained she didn’t know who she is and she banned the truth of who she is at the very end.
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,Exactly what I expected. I wouldn't change a thing.
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,great movie fitting end of the Skywalker series
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,Best of the new films.  Fixed some of the problems created in the first two movies.
"Jan 10, 2020",negative,"So many inconsistencies, so many poor story lines.  Erasing a droid's memory(which seems improbable) but suddenly giving it back. Killing Chewie but immediately bringing him back.  Kylo Ren has to be the most feckless bad guy of all time.  Lando suddenly shows up in the Falcon to help, never saw that coming(sarcasm).  Horses in space. Heroine never paid her dues. And Palpatine coming back with no explanation.  One positive, they didn't make us suffer thru anymore Rose Tico storylines.  The Disney elite have proven they really do know how to kill a franchise.  But alas, I am sure they didn't because the franchise will always make money.  the thing they don't realize is that if they had given it to somebody who understands the culture and has a vision(not an agenda) like for instance Favreau, they would not only have made money, they would have broken the box office."
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,I found myself rooting for the bad guys so they could put the protagonists out of there misery.
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,I  like the sound effects
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,It wad a popcorn movie with a decent story.  a few plot holes were never filled and it somewhat felt like a video game.  A story filler with a quest then a boss fight then the next level.  Worth seeing once but no need to see again. its not as bad as the utubers are ssying but its not going to win any awards either.
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,"It was fantastic 
It kept with the feel of the first one in 1977"
"Jan 10, 2020",negative,"Bland, nothing new and too much of an attempt to make the film politically correct."
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,Absolutely magnifique!
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,There’s nothing like Star Wars!!
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,it drew me in and had me transfixed until its satisfying end.
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,It was good but ending was just not their. Almost but just missed the mark
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,very inconsistent to the original story. cool to watch.
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,"I understand why some didn't like the movie, but overall I loved it! Seeing it in 3D IMAX is a must!!!"
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,"Huge Star Wars fan but this feels too fast and not imaginative as past films. It would have more impact if these characters were battling the same force previously.  Nevertheless it is a fun ride with a great cast. One can hope for an extended edition but perhaps this would have been better told over two movies. Come soon Episode X, it feels like it just got started again and we're back where Return of the Jedi ended"
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,Really enjoyed watching this movie.  Have watch everyone that came out at the movies and thought this was one of the best.
"Jan 10, 2020",negative,"It just doesn't make you pay attention. Very little interesting action, very lfew interesting characters. A lot of plot holes."
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,Best Star Wars movie yet!!!
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,"The story wasn't told very well, but it was good to see some of the characters again. CDW"
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,"Visually it's outstanding. Plot wise it lacked the least out of the last three movies but had too many ""where is this going?"" moments.

The film suffers from having to carry the preceding episodes of the trilogy. One could say that Episode 7 and (especially) Episode 8 put up some sort of energy field that prevented this ball from getting over the outfield fence."
"Jan 10, 2020",neutral,"Not a good movie but a fun one. If you open your mind and let all the unanswerable questions go you will enjoy this movie. But the second you spend any time thinking about the plot of this movie the dark side will take you over and your anger will lead to hate, which will then lead to suffering! "
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,"A heroic effort at redeeming the mess created by the previous episode, but ultimately can't save the trilogy from itself.

In many ways it is unfair to try to rate this movie because it can't exist in a vacuum.  It has to be reviewed in light of the previous two installments, and to be really objective, with all 8 previous canon movies in mind.  That being said, the movie is enjoyable, and JJ Abrams deserves a large amount of credit for bringing the trilogy to a palatable close.  This was no small task given what he was left to work with after Rian Johnson's deliberate attempt to pee in the proverbial Star Wars pool.  But, despite his best efforts, the trilogy concludes in a disjointed manner leaving most of the supporting cast with characters that had no development or arc to their story and leaving the audience with little reason to care about them."
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,"I was pleasantly surprised by the latest Star Wars film. Although the manner of death good guys seem to take is getting ridiculous but I can't comment about that further without spoiling the plot. The same with some new abilities Jedis seem to have, that in hindsight would've been pretty useful.
I think J.J. made a stellar job at saving what was left and at least getting SW slightly on track."
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,Absolutely stunning and action packed
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,It was truly a turnaround for the better in the trilogy that gave me exactly what I wanted.
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,Nice way to end the saga!
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,Great conclusion to an amazing Epic.
"Jan 10, 2020",negative,Movie is nothing but contrived story with more plot holes than interesting characters.
"Jan 10, 2020",neutral,"Shaky storyline maybe too much action to cover up the lack of a strong storyline

A little disappointed"
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,"La película es una de las mejores de la saga, se puede sentir la nostalgia de la trilogía original y el paso de una nueva generación a través de los actores
Sin dudas en mi opinión es una de las mejores películas en toda la saga"
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,was a very good movie all the usual twists and turns when all hope is lost type of thing expected from all the star wars movies
"Jan 10, 2020",negative,Ridiculous plot devices.
"Jan 10, 2020",neutral,"Enjoyable enough, but there are waaaaaay too many plot points that are crammed in at the last second. Also, half the movie is essentially fetch quests that don't do much to advance the plot. Probably not worth seeing in the theater."
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,I liked this one and was thoroughly entertained. Worth the watch.
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,best movie that's the way to end a trilogy trilogy loved it loved everything about it I must go see for any Star wars fans
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,Action packed! Didnt disappoint!!! Im going to go see it again!
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,No surprises. Thought it was a bit formulaic.
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,A fun and rousing way to conclude the Star Wars saga.
"Jan 10, 2020",neutral,Star Wars: The Rise of Fan Fiction
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,I love it - a great ending to a timeless story.
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,"It is still good verses evil where the good wins out in the end.
The message:  Hope is the great motivator for those willing to work for something better.  It is the message we need today as much as ever before.
Even the bad person can redeem themselves.
There is a case where the bad destroys the evil."
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,"One of, if not the best Star Wars ever. Loved it. I rarely see movies twice but will be going back to see this one again."
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,better than the last one
"Jan 10, 2020",negative,better than last jedi but so badly edited and plot holes throughout
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,I enjoyed the entire movie especially the special affects
"Jan 10, 2020",negative,"Garbage. Total, incomprehensible garbage. There's nothing about this movie that makes sense. Lazy, incompliant."
"Jan 10, 2020",negative,"Pretty boring, lots of spectacular effects, characters were uninteresting as was the plot"
"Jan 10, 2020",negative,It was boring and dull. Very over rated.
"Jan 10, 2020",negative,"Just stop, the horse is dead as is so stopped dragging the dead freaking horse."
"Jan 10, 2020",negative,"What a mess.

Clever tie in with prequels and original trilogy though."
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,Saw it twice and loved it both times. This movie is getting a bad rap. Go see it and make you’re own mind up.
"Jan 10, 2020",negative,"While better than TLJ at trying to be a fun and enjoyable starwars movie instead of a hate filled, out of place political lecture, it is too late to fix any of the gaping plot holes already setup. In fact it introduces even more plot holes. The story as a whole is impossible to follow because everything it hinges upon makes absolutely no sense when compared with the final reveals and motivations... What I mean is, if you think If THAT is what the bad guy / good guys wanted, and rewatch it, nothing makes any sense at all. Even the mechanics of ""how"" they go about what they do makes no sense. It seems the *only* thing driving the movie is a desire to string together some ""cool"" imagined scenes and everything was clumsily written to try and shoe horn them in. Finally while I appreciate Abrams attempt to ""fix"" TLJ I get the feeling it is more out of a desire to snub Johnson for snubbing him and these points in the movie really pull you out. If the director isn't starring in the movie, watching a scene shouldn't pull you out of the movie and make you imagine the directors arguing like youtube commenters. I couldn't stand Johnson's take either, but I'd have preferred it Abrams had just left it alone and not reminded us instead of these ""no you didn't!"" moments that would have been less interrupting and more fun as a directors commentary track"
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,Great movie! Loved the storyline.
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,If you love Star Wars its a must see.
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,Obligatory for those like me who've seen every installment.
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,"Only saved by special effects, story disappointed"
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,"A wonderfully beautiful mess of a film that is the perfect case study of Disney's handling of the Star Wars franchise overall. It continues many elements introduced in the highly divisive previous installment, and even enhances said installment, if not making it more endearing as a part of the overall story. All-in-all, an entertaining finish to the Star Wars sequel trilogy, and if you go in with zero expectations and turn your brain off, you should hopefully have fun."
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,It was amazing- action packed - you will not be disappointed!
"Jan 10, 2020",negative,What a disgrace to a beloved franchise. Just cements how much they don't care about advancing lore and just relying on nostalgia and a messy direction to make money.
"Jan 10, 2020",negative,"The garbage in this movie is pretty much the same garbage that has plagued every film in the series going back to Return of the Jedi: complete and utter lack of originality. I was cautiously optimistic about it from the first trailer, until that cackle from Emperor Smarmatine. Seriously, they had to bring him back?! What a pile. And it turned out to be predictable every single step of the way."
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,Overall good movie that tried to tie up all the lose ends...
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,Loved it! Did a good job of linking it to the original Star Wars.
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,That was a nice movie. The reason of this film to entertain the audience. I enjoyed with my family from the beginning to the end. This film was much more close to the original series. I would by a ticket for a film of any journalist who dislike this movie. Than I can see will that movie be more coherent and interesting like this.
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,Fun ending to the saga
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,It was action packed and beautifully done.  O Love All the cameos from the first actors. Great movie!
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,had a great time loved the way all the characters were brought back one last time
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,"To invest this many years in the Star Wars series, just to see it end in this way -- with bizarre, truly unbelievable storylines and forgettable new characters -- was disappointing. They, in my opinion, went to the well one too many times with the shocking unveiling of the surprise origins of characters. Star Wars has become a story of estranged siblings, parents and grandparents who, after a series of battles and chases, come to find out -- too predictably now -- that they are linked in some way, rarely for the betterment of the story but almost always to the detriment of it. The surprise connections eventually fall flat, come off lazy and forced (no pun intended) and do a great job of almost burying completely the original brilliance of the storytelling."
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,"Beautifully shot, could have been two films, but worth the ride"
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,"I thought the movie was excellent and had people sitting on the edge of their 
seats. The movie had plenty of action and made you feel like you were actually there. I liked the way they went back to previous episodes to bring you up-to -date with episode 9. I  enjoyed the movie especially with my family
and discussing it after the movie was over. May the force be with all of us!"
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,"In my opinion, this was one of the best episodes yet.  It had so much that was unexpected, but also had a few things that could have been left out.
It was a very good way to end the saga!"
"Jan 10, 2020",negative,"The beginning I liked. When they found the Death Star, it went downhill from there."
"Jan 10, 2020",negative,what a let down. feels like a case of film by committee.
"Jan 10, 2020",neutral,"Felt like we’ve been there, done that. My kids really liked it though."
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,"My kids and I enjoyed the movie thoroughly for it was entertaining.  For them, it was action-filled, exciting, and funny (at times).  For me, it answered a lot of Star Wars questions which was satisfying."
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,"The movie as a whole was good, but it was not on the level with all the other star wars movies. To have Rey save kylo, only for him use everything in him to save her was over dramatic.He was supposed to be so powerful, yet he died doing it. Lame. And she should have kept her family name as an example to show that there is always good, even when blood relatives are bad (sith)."
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,Rey and Kylie were AMAZING!!!
"Jan 10, 2020",neutral,"It is visually stunning. Acting is earnest and intense. However the storyline is too predictable. And where it was unpredictable, like bringing Palpatine back, and introducing new secondary characters (that don’t matter) — made me think the writer(s) were desperate and rushing to finish the trilogy.  I usually go back for a second and even third viewing. But this one, nope. Not wasting my time and hard-earned money."

"Jan 10, 2020",neutral,Very disappointed with this conclusion of the saga
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,Good movie tons of action.  Cool use of the force.
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,"I thought they did a great job. While not perfect , what really is."
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,Loved all Star Wars movies and this one didnt disappoint.  Hope this really isnt the end. Took my 7 year old grandson and he loved it.  Want to watch them all with him.
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,"Loved the story, cinematography, imagery. Even some of the snarky bits were great. The movie did feel like it tried to make many call backs to the original trilogy, some of which felt forced. But, the great character reveals, and the unity projected at the end, left me satisfied with the conclusion of a tale that has spanned my whole life.

The 3D IMAX experience was cool, but not really worth more than standard admission for this film. The quick transitions between shots made it difficult to appreciate the visual effects on the ginormous screen. Coupled with the blurriness incurred if you moved your head slightly out of center, it wasn't worth the extra money for the presentation."
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,This is the best starwars of all time! Must see!
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,It's got a bunch of references from previous Star Wars movie and the story is amazing even though it's similar to Return Of The Jedi.
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,What great movie I would watch it again 
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,"The movie was great and is really what you’re looking for to round out the series. There was a super awkward kiss at the end that I feel was unnecessary. Other than that, it was pretty good!"
"Jan 10, 2020",negative,This movie is terrible.
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,whole movie was great.
"Jan 10, 2020",negative,the worst way to end the most epic saga ever
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,Great movie. It was very exciting and it came to an exciting conclusion
"Jan 10, 2020",negative,What a mess! Nothing made any sense in this movie.
"Jan 10, 2020",negative,"Bad writing, lack of suspense, too many loopholes."
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,This was just awesome
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,Kind of like any Star Wars movie.  Pretty good. Enjoyable if you aren’t taking it too seriously and haven’t built up unrealistic expectations.
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,I liked how the story progressed.
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,"Overall I enjoyed the movie. I did cry a couple of times. And I was 12 when the very first Star Wars movie came out in 1977, so I understand some of the complaints that I've heard. But I have taken the movie as is, and I realize with the death of Carrie Fisher they unfortunately had to change things. We miss our Princess. I look forward to the new endeavors from Disney in the Star Wars universe!"
"Jan 10, 2020",negative,"Anyone that gave this movie 5 stars is either in denial or lying. This was straight garbage that fails on almost every level. The plot was nonsensical at times and confusing at others. The sequel trilogy failed to make me care about any of the characters, except Kylo Ren. This movie, more than the others, cashed in on nostalgia and references to much better movies. As a movie, it failed to have a coherent plot. There is no beginning middle or end. Rey is a terrible character that never went through the heroes journey or even had adversity. Poe seems like a wasted opportunity as he just had quips this movie and doesn't really serve a function. Same goes for Finn. The movie relies on coincidences far too much. What are the odds you run into Lando wandering around Coachella? Or you find exactly what you are looking for by accidentally falling into quick sand? The final space battle made no sense. Ground assaulting a star destroyer with horses?????!!!! You destroy one star destroyer the rest are useless? While the rebel fleet is just fine flying around individually, Palpatine's ships are all connected to the same router???? The Rebels, or whatever the heck they are called, were basically destroyed in the last movie, but now they are powerful? And for some reason they are rising up against authority at the end because of some reason? Makes not sense and feels like lazy writing. Palpatine's army makes no sense either. Who built it? Why make them all connected? Why destroy planets when you know that will turn public opinion against you? Why not enslave the galaxy via the ideas of Aldous Huxley? Have you learned nothing of sentient psychology? Even Orwellian control is better than randomly destroying a planet. This movie is lazy, anger inspiring, and worst of all....boring. I heard it was bad, but I had to watch the final Star Wars. Movies I loved since I was a child. I have seen them all in cinema starting with the Re-release of the original trilogy in the late 90s. This is a terrible ending and one that retroactively shits on the earlier ones. This made me miss Jar Jar Binks. I would give this movie 0 stars as it was such an offense to the audience member, but I heard that RT doesn't calculate a 1 star in it's averages."
"Jan 10, 2020",negative,"it is a tale
Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,
Signifying nothing."
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,"Fit well within star wars franchise, good plot lines for each character."
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,Great End to the series!! A lot of great special effects
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,The special effects were great!!
"Jan 10, 2020",negative,"reviews were not good, but i never could have anticipated how unmitigatingly stupid a film could be.  2+ hours of lowest grade fan fiction, absurd plots, military action without military consult, that's now a travel if it's problems"
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,Loved it this was the 3rd time I saw the movie
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,It was very good just a little over due on effects
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,"{De fato é bom} recomendo  mas não é impressionante como o filme : Star Wars VII : O Despertar da Força, mas é bem mais impressionante do que o último filme : Star Wars VIII: Os Últimos Jedi, digamos que falta criatividade"
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,"So, for me, best movie of the entire series!"
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,Not the best or the worst.....it’s Star Wars  !
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,THE BEST STAR WARS MOVIE EVER!!!!!!!!
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,"I was saw it. It's cool final of saga. Not bad. May be better? Not sure.
We can't compare Original Trilogy, Prequels and Sequels = that 3 absolutely different epochs (time of creation) and 3 different stories about 1 choice: YOU WILL BE GOOD OR BAD (WO)MAN??"
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,"It was a fun, and great way to end the saga. It doesn't deserve the backlash it has been getting. Worth every minute"
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,"I like this movie, they’re never gonna please everyone but this is a good end to the whole sweeping saga. Plenty of action, plenty of emotion and some fun to round out the whole thing."
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,The movie was great what do y
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,Loved it!!!! I hate that it is over.
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,"Parts were good, other parts felt like past plots slightly redone."
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,Great Ending to a saga!
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,Really good ending to the series! Great story line
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,"It had everything a life long starwars fan could want, it ticked all the boxes"
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,"What a fabulous movie, enjoyed ever minute."
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,answered a lot if lingering questions and wrapped up the series very well
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,"Its spectacular visuals, spellbinding score and well-choreographed action make The Rise of Skywalker stay easy on the senses. But, Abram's arrogant overcompensation for the (supposed) faults of the previous instalment chew up valuable minutes, minutes that could have been spent crafting a story of moderate emotional potency and unpredictability, mostly through a little bit of imaginative intelligence (please!) —- but there is some pleasure to be had watching Driver and Ridley give it their all.
Iroh's grade: C+"
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,Great conclusion to the Disney trilogy.
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,"It relied on action, nostalgia and CGI spectacle to carry the movie and is stuffed with tons of story, which the movie rushes through to make all the story elements seem plausible. At closer examination, it is very convoluted and flawed."
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,"Thank you J.J. Abrams. This one had it all...action, comedy, suspense & even pulled at the heartstrings! Def a must see!"
"Jan 10, 2020",negative,Quality of movie effects low grade actors who could not act was a negative star rating it was horrible
"Jan 10, 2020",negative,A big waste of so much time....
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,Amazing and all the feels!!!
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,Action packed!!! Loved every minute of it!!
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,"Loved every single bit of it. Yes of course being a Star Wars Fanatic you kinda wish things would've ended different, but I wouldn't change any bit of it"
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,Movie Was very interesting bringing back the most powerful sigh of all time . It would of been better if they would of kept Luke . So he can Face Sidious for the final Fate of the galaxy
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,didn't end the way I thought but still as good
"Jan 10, 2020",negative,The whole movie was an inconsistent mess
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,Absolutely spectacular way to end the saga. Fan service is WHATS necessary to finish something of this scale in terms of impact to pop culture.
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,Love the way the old characters back from the first movies
"Jan 10, 2020",negative,Considering what they had to follow with the last train wreck of a movie they did a decent job and I enjoyed parts of it but honestly the route they took for the plot was awful and very predictable even though you could tell they were trying to be anything but. Wouldn't recommend for any true star wars fan. The books were better if you want good plots.
"Jan 10, 2020",neutral,"The movie just didn't make a whole lot of sense to me. I understand that plot points need to be met and characters need to get from a to b but it felt rushed. 
We lost most the classic cast to make way for the new cast, which makes sense, though the new characters didn't seem to be respected so I've got to wonder if it was all worth it."
"Jan 10, 2020",negative,"What crap! It was insulting. How can anyone like this movie and claim to be a Star Wars fan? It was a remake, a reboot, damage control, pandering, crap movie. Disney killed Star Wars."
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,Great ending!  Surprising!
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,"I left the movie theatre with a strong of sense of nostalgia: so much of this film reminded me of my childhood memories of falling in love with the original Star Wars saga. The filmography was gorgeous and the characters were easy to connect with. All in all, this was a satisfying adventure in a galaxy far, far away."
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,It was good overall. Way better then episode 8. Just a couple of scenes that I still didn’t like now that I’ve seen it a second time after the premiere day. The kiss (ugh dreadful) and the emperor being kinda OP (or actually alive for that matter).
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,Regardless of its flaws it is my favorite of the three new films because I cared. It hit where it counts and honored the legacy of the originals. It’s too bad it had to make for the debacle that was The Last Jedi and try to cram two movies into one but it was overall satisfying and enjoyable and even tugged at my heart. All the new characters finally got their due. Daisy Ridley was great and I’ll never understand the hate she gets. She’s been good in all three films. Great final image. I’m actually shocked. I went in ready to hate it. Cheers
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,May The Force Live On!
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,Loved seeing the old cast. Loved everything about it!
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,Excellent movie. I loved it. Thank you!
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,I loved it. The only problem I had is that the movie needed to be way longer.
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,Fixes all the problems from the Last Jedi. JJ did a great job cleaning up the mess. You got to go see it! The critics with the bad reviews are clueless as to what a good movie is.
"Jan 10, 2020",neutral,Nothing crazy. Entertaining and glad to see it finally come to a close. Lots of OP moments and wtf’s. Not that great 
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,It was one of my favorite Star Wars movie!! A must see
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,really good movie 👌
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,"It was ok. Not great, but not terrible."
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,"Each Star Wars trilogy has had a different feel.  Episodes 7-9 are far more action oriented, and Abrams is able to save this trilogy from the dumpster fire it had become under Johnson."
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,"Yes, Rise of Skywalker is a disappointing conclusion to the Skywalker saga but it is not a terrible one. Yes, this film is filled with fan service and a bloated plot but is nothing but entertaining.

Grade: B-"
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,Great movie! Maybe not perfect but well worth $11 price of admission.
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,I loved this movie !
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,If you can realise and understand the inner genius within the movie and are a die-hard fan you well love the movie and appreciate every bit of it
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,Un crudo final para la saga
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,"Excellent story telling, imagery, and character development. Outstanding movie in every way."
"Jan 10, 2020",negative,not enough action poor graphics and not satisfying with the drama of the film
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,I enjoyed the movie. I thought it was a great finish to one of my favorite series.
"Jan 10, 2020",negative,"Its Trash, not a Stra Wars"
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,Confusing as to where they were but at least I knew the good guys from the bad guys :-) State of the Art effects. Satisfying ending ties all together.
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,This was the perfect ending to such an amazing Movie Empire. I highly recommend this movie to anyone.
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,"Good story line, action packed."
"Jan 10, 2020",negative,Thought it was very poor for the last of what was a Great series
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,Plot line....it want to all lightsabres and sky battles.
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,Best of the last 3 movies.  Nice save JJ
"Jan 10, 2020",negative,The plot was incoherent and essentially ignored everything that happened in the previous film. Will probably be remembered as the worst Star Wars film ever made by critics. Some of the set pieces are really cool but it is a cinematic failure.
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,Absolutely loved it! So much was answered and ends tied up. An excellent movie that comes full circle at the end. I cried thru so many scenes-happy tears!  I need to go see it again!
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,I don't know. It was fine. Somewhat boring.
"Jan 10, 2020",negative,"A huge splash of special effects with no real story, or at least not one that would take 2.25 hours to tell.

Rey seems to spend 90% of the movie wandering off or staring into space.

The rest was predictable and pretty lame.

Oh and having one of the big parts being played by a dead woman is awful."
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,I thought this was by far the best Star Wars movie out of them all.
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,"A multiple number of actors/actresses return for the 2019 Star Wars film that is Star Wars The Rise of Skywalker that include: Adam Driver John Boyega Daisy Ridley, Harrison Ford, Billie Lourde, Kellie Marie Tran, Mark Hamill, Billy Dee Williams,Anthony Daniels, Naomi Ackie,Domhnall Gleeson,Richard E Grant, Lupita Nyongo, Oscar Isaac, Keri Russell, Joonas SuotamoIan McDiarmid, Cailey Fleming, Carrie Fisher, and more actors/actresses. The character foils of Kylo Ren/Ben Solo and Rey continuing to evolve to bring out the best in each other is a sight to behold, the appearances of Luke Skywalker and Han Solo are an interesting surprise that also adds to the essential development of some of the characters, the dynamics of Rose Tico Finn and Poe Dameron are also explored. How the main antagonist ties in with two of the characters was an unexpected element that added to the creative unfolding of the show. I admit that it was just that I found the ending extremely surprising though my husband helped me understand why. I want to be considerate of those who have yet to see the show and are viewing this review, lets just say that one of the multiple reasons why I was surprised at the ending was because there are dynamics involved that almost mirror the concept/idea of twin flames. However, I am very grateful that my husband paid for us to see this film with money from his current job"
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,It really explained a lot  and it was action filled. It’s
"Jan 10, 2020",neutral,"As a mindless action movie, it was decent, even good.  But as a Star Wars movie, it was barely mediocre.  I will be avoiding any spoilers.

The Bad:
The first half of the movie basically sprints through plot points like it's going for gold in the 100-meter dash, and then spends the last half with weird pacing that left me exhausted.  

There are a number of plots that either get unsatisfying conclusions, or get no conclusion at all(how did Palpatine escape the Death Star explosion, why did a certain character make certain decisions towards the end,etc).  Let's not talk about the number of plot holes requiring such a suspension of disbelief that no amount of Jedi mind-tricks can hand wave away.

Most characters get little to no real further development in the movie, which is a bit of a shame.

If you're a fan of the new Extended Universe(not the Legacy stuff that came out before Disney got Star Wars) then prepare for some confusion and anger as Disney stated that their new EU was the new canon, but then clearly failed to develop a fact-checking department to ensure that all of their stuff matched up.  For a company looking to get merchandise purchases, this is a merchandising failure, as why would I buy EU stuff you say is canon only to overturn it at a whim.

There is also this odd issue where the filming quality makes major downturns at random moments, like one moment the scene has crystal clear images that are beautiful to see, and then the movie switches to another angle where it is extremely fuzzy, to the point you might wonder if your sight has gone.  

The Good:
Kylo and Rey's character development, that was actually done pretty well, I felt satisfied for the most part. 

The set pieces; gorgeous, and really added to the background of the galaxy and were wonderful to see.

Conclusion:

Like I said, a good action movie, but barely mediocre Star Wars film.
If the rumors about Abrams filming a total of 3.5-4 hours worth of movie, only to trim it down to the 2 hours and 25 minutes were true; I'd have rather had a part 1 & 2, at least more effort could have been point into it that way."
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,Great movie.  I've seen them all.
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,Awesome!!! Wish the series could go on forever😢
"Jan 10, 2020",negative,"Like Episode 7, it’s derivative and poorly conceived."
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,Fantastic movie! Great way to finish the series!
"Jan 10, 2020",neutral,Rise of Skywalker was probably the safest ending to the Skywalker saga. It focussed more on fan service rather than the story itself.
"Jan 10, 2020",negative,"More enjoyable than the Last Jedi, but felt cheap and kinda ruined the whole point behind the prophecy of Anakin/Darth Vader."
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,"Did a great job of tying up loose ends.   Despite the length, the time flew by."
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,Great movie for any fan of Star Wars!!
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,Great movie special affects were wonderful.
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,action filled wonderful movie.
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,"Fantastic finish to the new trilogy, so glad JJ Abrams came back to the franchise!"
"Jan 10, 2020",negative,"The Rise of Skywalker was a bad movie, full of plot holes and lack the connection with the previous trilogies. It was better than The Last Jedi for sure, but the damage was done since The Force Awakens, the arc of the characters were poorly designed, and I basically couldn't care less about them. It is not worth to watch this film."
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,This was my 2nd viewing. I liked it MUCH BETTER this time! TROS did tie into Episodes 7 &8. Go see it!
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,Best one after empire.
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,the movie is great for any star war Fan. their is allot of grey area where they could have done more story with characters.
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,"JJ Abrams did a great job of fixing what rian johnson did in last Jedi. He created a film that was great visually, but also had a good story to tell and helped the audience like and appreciate what the characters are going through. Abrams had a mess to clean up and he did a pretty damn good job of it. My faith and love of Star Wars has come back and I thank JJ Abrams for that."
"Jan 10, 2020",negative,I felt really let down by The Last Jedi. The Rise of Skywalker made me wish Rian Johnson directed it.
"Jan 10, 2020",negative,"Barely deserves to be called a movie, there are only 2 characters in this so called film, the rest of the cast are just actors saying their lines (not to their fault, but the writers'). Nonsense forced, rushed plotpoints that don't make any sense. The first 30 minutes feel like an attack on your senses, and by the end, you just want it to be over."
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,Amazing movie and a must see
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,Great movie great graphics. Could of ending better
"Jan 10, 2020",negative,"If anyone can tell me what happened, completely, I’d be surprised. There was no Skywalker rise. Just bad."
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,"This final film in the 9 movie Skywalker sagawas entertaining and action packed. However, for all of it's action it was not a great ending to it all."
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,"It was definitely a good movie but not the best Star Wars film I’ve seen, overall it was time well spent to watch!"
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,"So the Skywalker saga has come to an end, and once again follows the previous installment (The Last Jedi) in being divisive amongst fans and critics. The Last Jedi was overly praised by critics and overly bashed by fans, and this time around it is fairly well-received by fans and nitpicked to death by critics. And while my thoughts on the Last Jedi were relatively mixed, The Rise of Skywalker (though flawed) is hands down the better movie.  Yes there are pacing issues, yes certain plot developments feel a bit out of the left-field, but what did any of us really expect? Due to the failure of The Last Jedi to effectively move the plot forward, The Rise of Skywalker has the added baggage of being a second and third act of the entire trilogy. And for a massive roadblock being thrown in the filmmaker's path by Rian Johnson's overuse of creative freedom, I think what J.J Abrams managed to produce is pretty damn effective and was a really exciting experience.

The visuals are once again fantastic, but what makes this stand apart from the other films is the horror movie lighting on the Sith planet of Exogol.  The best usage of this atmospheric lighting is during the introduction of our main villain. Completely shrouded in darkness, until you get a flash of lightning which reveals the ghoulish visage of the reanimated corpse of Emperor Palpatine as he croaks out one of his most iconic phrases. Just phenomenal! The characters have also been allowed to shine much more from when we last left them in The Last Jedi. The best of them is without a doubt C-3PO, who steals the show with one laugh after another. Luke, a character who was kinda unlikeable in TLJ was the complete opposite here, making me wish he would have survived episode 8.  Before I wrap it up, I must mention the beautiful tribute this film paid to Carrie Fisher. seeing her on-screen one last time was almost tear-jerking, and giving her top billing (though long overdue) was a lovely send-off to an actress who kicked down the doors to our hearts with her wit and sass.  

overall, I loved this movie. It isn't as good as the original trilogy or The Force Awakens, and it certainly has its flaws. But it has a lot of heart, and so I award it 4/5 stars."
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,What I felt from The Rise of Skywalker is how they manage to tie up some loose ends from The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi greatly. The film gave Rey and Kylo Ren an outstanding character development and ended the nine Skywalker saga successfully.
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,Too much action. No down time. As a Star Wars fan I loved what they did with the story.
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,Fitting end. Epic and emotional
"Jan 10, 2020",negative,"This is a train wreck of ideas smashed together. The pacing is rushed, tons of plot holes, and has too many ideas that run in contradiction of previous films in the Lucas Legacy. This film is a dumpster fire of nonsensical quest items, chase scenes for the sake of driving the plot forward, and not letting characters develop. 
Rogue One was a far superior installment, and the entirety of this sequel trilogy should be de-canonized. 
This is a Star Wars experience that is barely watchable for passive Star Wars fans, and is unbearable for those who enjoy Star Wars philosophy, and lore."
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,"How can you be in the movie, but not be a force ghost?! This is outrageous. It’s unfair!"
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,Redeemed the sequel trilogy.
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,loved the cliffhanger!
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,Best Star Wars EVER!!! Loved it!
"Jan 10, 2020",negative,"Well, that was lame."
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,Lots of excitement and action. B
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,"I absolutely loved this movie! Sure there were some parts that could have been changed to make it better, and it felt a little rushed at times, but I think it was a satisfying ending for the Star Wars saga."
"Jan 10, 2020",negative,Shit is awful. Should have put a bullet in the head of this franchise a long time ago.
"Jan 10, 2020",negative,"More of the same, chapter from chapter"
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,It's a classic Star Wars film. It's a great way to end the saga!
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,"So Episode 9 hit ALL the nostalgic ques but for a life long fan,  missed so many opportunities to connect and close  each characters development arch. I left the movie with more questions than answers :(  Would I watch it again, absolutely! The music and visuals were awesome throughout the film and the way the movies are filmed leave you emotionally invested in the characters. Like I said, I just have a ton of questions!"
"Jan 10, 2020",negative,the choreography for one of the fight scenes was cool and Palpatine's display of power was cool.  There is no other good qualities about this movie...
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,"I’m not much of a Star Wars fan, but this movie is phenomenal!! So much action and plot twists you never expect. Highly recommend this"
"Jan 10, 2020",negative,"After the explosive fan reaction to The Last Jedi, and the financial underperformances of previous Star Wars affairs, JJ Abrams attempts to make a finale that ties up loose ends, and brings everyone together. He (unfortunately) fails. What started off in 2015 with great promise, ends with a rushed, exposition-stuffed, convoluted mess that lazily re-hashes Return of The Jedi, but without any logic. There are multiple fakeout deaths, several McGuffin plot devices, and two first acts that feel like they should've been in the second film of this missed opportunity of a sequel trilogy. The legacy of the originals and the prequels have been tarnished, and it all feels so corporate now. This should all perhaps be disregarded as fanfiction."
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,"original trilogy are still the best, but this is one franchise that’s work hard for the fans"
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,Definitely best seen at a theater. Very glad we went to see it.
"Jan 10, 2020",negative,a disgrace of a star wars movie!
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,I hated it. I loved it. I’ll have to think about it.
"Jan 10, 2020",negative,Good movie NOT fit for the ending of a 40 year series and they should have never made them ending the way they did she is NOT and WILL NEVER be a Skywalker and if they wanted to make her a sky walker they should have made her a skywalker to begin with and used like and Mara jade as her parents
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,"There were some things I wish they'd done differently, but it was an entertaining, if a bit lacklustre, end to the Skywalker saga, but part of that issue can be placed at the feel of The Last Jedi which, while I didn't hate it, I do take exception with some of the decisions made for that movie. Overall, the sequel trilogy would have come together better, in my opinion, if there had been a solid plan in place before any of them had been filmed rather than letting each director do whatever they wanted. As is, the trilogy is a bit of a disappointment, but hopefully going forward we will get better new stories. As a saga endpoint, Rise of Skywalker could certainly have been worse."
"Jan 10, 2020",negative,"This movie reminded me why i can't give up on my dream of movie making.

Palpatine has returned, and sends a terror signal across the universe. Rey, Finn and Poe start a hunt for a ""Wayfinder"". Something that will lead them to the planet where he's hiding. Meanwhile Kylo is on the hunt for Rey. To either turn her or kill her. All to end the saga of the Skywalkers.

(Looooong sigh) I really don't know where to start with this one... I really don't. To me, Star Wars was never this.... This Hollywood, blockbuster.... Mess. Sure, there's a space journey seen by millions churning out billions of dollars. Disney bought the property for 4 Billion for a reason. But in the heart of the explosions and lightsabre fights, was something real, something organic. Luke's hope for his father. Anakin's anger and betrayal by the Jedi. Yes, not everything was perfect, but it still felt ""honest"". This though... It feels hollow. The whole trilogy has. I always let it go, especially in 7, because i was sure it was leading up to something, but here is what it's been leading up to and.... What the hell?
(Let me explain myself):

- The plot is pointless. While they should focus on setting up the conflict and establishing what the movie should be about, they go out on a plot coupon hunt (no they're not McGuffins) for the first half of the movie. Since they focus on that, we have no clue what any of the characters wants, why they want it, we just have to tag along and hope that we care by the end. Many maybe did, i didn't. Not even a little bit.
- This movie also has a HUGE problem of ""i want the movie to be like this"", ""how do we get to that place so it makes sense?"", ""doesn't matter.... Dew it!"". Here's a few examples:
It took Palpatine 20 years to build the Death Star, and it was so scary, that it lead the Rebellion to come out of hiding and attack. Now though, every fucking Star Destroyer has Death Star tech and is capable to destroy planets. Do you know why there was only one Death Star and he didn't build 10 in the same time? Because it's fucking huge and powerful and takes a hell of a lot of time and energy to get something that big and powerful, but here a thousand Star Destroyers are now able to do the same job. Just raise the stakes. It doesn't matter if it makes sense, just raise the stakes! Now the Death Star is a joke, just so get their fucking stakes. Now, the world has lost all sense of reality for me. (again huge spoilers!)
Another example is Palpatine being back... ""How?"" you ask? I asked that as well. You shouldn't expect an answer though. I expect one, but didn't get one. Well, i got it, but it was pretty much ""he's back"". They try to give a few sentences here and there, but it makes no sense. He fell into the reactor of a Death Star that blew up?!
The force powers as well. Rey and Kylo Ren suddenly have the power to ""give force energy"" from one person to another, healing them, but it just makes me wonder, why the fuck couldn't Obi-Wan do that? He had been training for years under Qui-Gon... It could have saved his life? Rey also from out of nowhere sends force lightning. Because that's how it works now, just use a new power whenever you feel like it. I thought that was a spesific Sith trait? Why can she do it? Her last name does not make her to a Sith. It has never worked that way. If so, Kylo Ren should never able to force choke for the same reason. Consistency. Luke also returns, and he stops a lightsaber right out of thin air. What is it that these ghosts can't do now? Stop physical things, send force lightning bolts? Come on! Rey and Ren also has this weird teleporting ability where they can fight eachother and/or give eachother different items. They try to explain, but once again it's really weird. They have this ability because she's a Palpatine and he's a Skywalker... So... The Force has given these two a special power only they can use because it realizes that Skywalker has been Palpatine's arch enemy? Why would that be a thing? If someone can explain this to me, please go ahead. Still, it just makes them seem ridiculously strong. Stronger than Yoda could ever dream of being. How? Who cares...
^All these changes slowly but surely takes this epic saga about family, war and politics to turn into a YA novel to me. That's why through seeing this i felt empty inside. Emotionless. I care about none of these people. Why should i? These big moments that i'm supposed to care about, i just don't. I sat there silent. Only time i got emotional, was seeing the old characters being killed off, or showing back up. I felt upset, they deserved something more.

There's also a not-so-subtle jab at TLJ in here. C-3PO gets his memory back, and at what does he remember? Everything from episode 1-7, but not TLJ, because it was stored right before Rey leaves to meet Luke in the end of 7.. I don't get why he wrote that. Could just as easy wrote that it was the start of this movie, or the last few months.

Also wtf is the kid with the broom? I thought he was gonna fix everything! We better get his spin-off movie. ""Broom Kid: The Movie"".

Ok, now it's time to somewhat explain the rating you're raging over, even though i've done that above too. How can this be rated below TLJ!? Well, even though i have a lot of the same problems, TLJ had one big thing going for it. It was drop-dead beautiful. Absolutely stunning-looking. This... This is Hollywood, and everything you expect from it. Yes it has good looking CGI, and costume design, but still, everything still looks so bland and boring.

The way they treated pretty much every character as well, it's just so... Disappointing. (again huge spoilers) Leia dies in the most ridiculously pointless way ever. Chewbacca gets captured. Why? How? Because he just randomly wandered away from the group? Lando just shows up at a random place when the plot needs him, but tbh, i've never really understood him, at least not since 6. Hux... Oh Hux... It's not that i care that much about his character, it was just so laughably bad. At one point in the movie he said to Poe ""I don't care if you win, as long as Kylo Ren loses"". I laughed at that point. Maybe my favorite new character from this series, turned into even more of a joke than from the last movie. I was literally thinking ""did a 2 year old write this? He's acting like a fucking child"". They also rope-a-dopes us twice. Chewbacca is dead? Yeah! 10 minutes later, he's alive. Kylo Ren is dead? Well we don't see him for a long time and there was nothing from that length that he could grab onto, but oh wait! Hand grabs platform!

What did i like about it? Well, there's a very small amount:
I said the new characters are hollow, they are, but some of them still serve somewhat of a purpose. There's a woman called Jannah (Naomi Ackie) that joins Finn in the fighting that used to also be a stormtrooper, and their connection was pretty nice, and gave some more insight into what the First Order has been doing. Still though, considering the plot coupon-hunt lasted for so long, it gets almost no time. Also Allegiant General Pryde (Richard E. Grant) in The First Order was pretty menacing and interesting. Pretty much what i hoped Hux would be. There's also a funny view into Poe's life, but again, it gets way too little time.
In general, i've really liked the actors. They're great and have amazing chemistry, but instead of that making me feel good, it just makes me upset. They deserved better. Better planing, better writing, better management, better care. So did John Williams.

I'm really trying to find a reason to bump it up to 1 star, but i don't see a good reason to. The few good things i found, are so ridiculously tiny in comparison. I hate throwing around the 0.5 star rating unless i fucking KNOW it deserves it, like Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2.... Fuck that movie.... Ahh hell. You guys can try to change my mind i guess. Tell me what's good about this movie. Maybe i'll agree. I'm just struggeling to find any true good point. These feelings are very fresh, and i even know there's TONS of bad stuff i'm leaving out, but i'm stopping this here. It's already become long enough. Let's hope it takes less than 141 mins to read this. We all know talking about the review can't be longer than the movie, or we'll know it's not worth reading..."
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,It was 8/10 it felt really rushed but that’s not JJ fault it’s RJ fault from the second movie.
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,Good movie missing some answers in the movie but overall loved it good ending to the saga
"Jan 10, 2020",negative,one star and is for the movie have good especial effects and good video quality.
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,Awesome movie .  It I don’t want it to end . Bring back more please.
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,"I saw the movie with my dad and best friend and we all left feeling happy and satisfied people need to stop being negative, bringing peoples mood down and just enjoy the movie"
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,It was good movie just needed a few more light saber battles and force moves
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,The image and action was great... not so much the writing of the movie.
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,Good but not excellent.
"Jan 10, 2020",negative,"This movie was a rushed mess of a story that does more harm than good to the saga. It has plenty of action and good visuals that will please many people. However, if you truly care about the Skywalker saga then I don't think this one is for you. Retcon this whole sequel trilogy."
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,"I may have missed it, but who were all those people in the stands in the emperors stadium acting like a Greek chorus."
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,"Star Wars the rise sky walker was an action, comedy and a heart felt film. I thought this movie was amazing and it was a great way to end the saga, but the only flaw in this movie was that it was a bit rushed , but other than that i thought it was great and I recommend seeing countless times."
"Jan 10, 2020",negative,"Boring and predictable. Empty and tired characters. Senator Palpatine? Really? Millions of dollars in budget and the creatives came up with the senator? Probably the worst of the saga. I gave 2 starts because of Mark, he was impeccable."
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,"much, much better than Episode 7&8"
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,Fantastic close out of the Skywalker saga
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,Loved the feel of the show.
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,The movie was fricken fantastic!!! Love every second of the movie!!! Tied everything up perfect!
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,Best movie in decades! Great story and great way to wrap up the entire series.
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,I loved how they brought back cameos of stars from the past movies.
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,"It was definitely better than the last one, but still so many flaws and silly plot items to put up with. Patience needed. Worst of all was -- no Anakin/Darth?? Really?? Since the entire saga is The Saga of Anakin Skywalker and his Offspring, Luke and Leia. This was the biggest silly plot hole of all. Now that I think about how upsetting that was to watch, three stars could be too generous."
"Jan 10, 2020",negative,All of it. Left early!!
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,Great movie.  Answered lots of questions.
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,Good wrap up of a story that took decades to tell.
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,"The fight and battle sequences were too long. As a result, the movie was too long by about 25 minutes.

Some aspects of the storyline do not make sense. (I won’t give away the plot.)  this is either the effect of too much Disney or not enough Lucas.  However, it’s Star Wars episode nine and I’ll be there for episode 10."
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,It was good I guess I was just expecting a little more
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,"I thought the movie was good, but it was very predictable."
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,"Great fight scenes, awesome intro to some new characters all in all a great way to end"
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,All stars were great.  Sad to see it end.    Awesome story and effects
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,Great energy. Reminds you of the original trilogy
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,"I am a giant star wars fan and have been my whole life.  Although I choose to like all of the new Star Wars movies, I am not blind to some of the problems with the Last Jedi. I thought the two JJ Abrams films were excellent though, and I thought the Rise of Skywalker was great and gave me all the things I was looking for to wrap up this trilogy, without just being completely predictable."
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,Went in with low expectations. Surprised by Joy! Hollywood critics are deluded. T'was INSPIRING and moving. The critics love movies that are sad. To them good triumphing over evil is boring. Thank you Abrams for one of Star Wars BEST!
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,It's a Star Wars movie. It's awesomeness is relative.  Lol. See it.
"Jan 10, 2020",negative,"Visually stunning, but one of the most convoluted screenplays I've seen. No  amount of schmaltz can make up for the thoroughly lame plot. My daughter summed it up best: ""It's like the writer was child with ADHD and tripping on cocaine."""
"Jan 10, 2020",neutral,Disney doesn't know how to take good care of their child because they have too many!
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,This is a good movie to watch to cover for the butchering of The Last Jedi. They make up for many bad decisions made in the previous movie. If you hated The Last Jedi this movie will fix most of your hate for the new trilogy.
"Jan 9, 2020",neutral,"Since I was a part of my childhood, the skywalker storyline is still the best. I believe it depends where the magic first attracted you to the franchise is the start of everything. As all Midlife Gen like me, George Lucas ‘Star Wars’ will always be a classic on my book!"
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,Great way to end the saga.
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,"I enjoyed the story and the relationship between Rey, Fin, and Poe. I also like how Luke, Leia, Hans, and Lando Calrissian were integrated into the film."
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,I liked how it brought the entire Star Wars story together.
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,Not a perfect movie but a very good one. It kept me hooked from beginning until the very end
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,"Some flaws, but thought it was really good and wrapped things up well.  There was certainly fan service...but it was all part of the same story, so it worked for me personally."
"Jan 9, 2020",negative,I think is a little bit forced
"Jan 9, 2020",negative,"If you ignore the gaping plot holes and focus on all the special effects like they want you to, then the movie does it's job as popcorn material. J J Abrams has successfully taken Disney's closing installment in the main Star Wars cinematic line into a complete nose dive. Most movies, including ones considered to be cinematic masterpieces, come with a few plot holes but when you take a series as iconic as star wars with all the backing of a fan base that spans generations and the financial support of a company equally as iconic as Disney and STILL come up short, that's pretty bad. The writing is so sub par that even the actors struggle to dig their characters out of the graves that were laid before them. This movie had a bunch of flash yet no sustenance and relies too heavily on the Star Wars name as a crutch in a vain attempt to bring itself up to mediocrity."
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,Pretty epic ending! I love Star Wars and the last Jedi left me unsatisfied. But this movie more than made up for it. The story was awesome. I really enjoyed it! I hope they come up with some kind of spin off or something. I WANT MORE!
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,Great movie and FINALLY the story is told.
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,This brought my childhood love to a satisfactory close.
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,"Don't get caught up in the passionate extreme hate or extreme love of the nerds (""only a Sith deals in absolutes""). It is really fun and really enjoyable. Not without flaws, especially in pacing, and perhaps is not the ending that some wanted. Still, this was definitely great to watch, definitely felt like Star Wars, definitely gave me all those Star Wars-y happy feelings, and definitely made me want to see it again."
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,Liked everything wow
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,"Great finale to the Rey trilogy. Like all Star Wars movies, this one has its flaws, but overall I loved it and think it treated the saga with reverence."
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,"After the miserable train wreck that was TLJ, went in with little expectation, figuring this would be another drab, miserable affair. Expectations were so low that it actually took three weeks to drag myself to see it. What a wonderful surprise, ended up loving it. Sure, there are some cons. The break neck pace of the film with carefree failure to service the ""many"" important character/plot developments is the main issue. There are plenty of ""did that just happen?"" moments and a few stretches that seem perhaps too over the top even in the SW universe. For example, since when can characters freely walk around in space on top of star destroyers? Some of those escape sequences are kind of ridiculous. But hey... I'll take it since ultimately, the film does deliver. Lots of great nods to fans who grew up with the original trilogy. And thankfully, he mostly nudged out the miserable Rose character. Too bad she's in it at all. 

It's a shame they didn't have the same director handle all three of the movies for I still can't get over just how bad that last one was. What a mess of a snoozy, cgi nightmare. Total disservice to Mark Hamill's character and the Luke Skywalker legacy. Trying to forget I ever saw it."
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,Lots of action all the way through.
"Jan 9, 2020",negative,"As far as I'm concerned, none of the Disney films are canon."
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,Fantastic movie! The 4dx Experience combined with Star Wars was probably the most incredible movie experience Ive ever had!
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,Good final of the Star Wars Saga
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,"The acting wasn't always believable, but the story line was filled with unexpected twists and turns. That's what made it captivating and increased the desire to watch all the way to the end."
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,It was a bit too long.
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,It was ok.  Not bad.  Good ending to the series
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,I really enjoyed it.
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,DISAPPOINTING. A lot of fan service. They could of done without the whole Palpatine story line and plot. Everything about this movie (including Carrie Fisher's scenes) felt shoehorned and/or forced in. Overall an entertaining film for us fans.
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,Perfect ending to the whole story.
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,Love it! After episode 5 and 6 this is my all time favorite Star Wars movie!
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,The powerful scene between Palpatine and Rey! Good over evil....
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,Best Sequel Star Wars Movie by far. Not too many side stories and excellent plot!!
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,I thought it was really good!! Was very entertaining!!
"Jan 9, 2020",negative,the worst movie of Star Wars by far!! the history has no line! horrible!
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,I mean keep in mind its owned by disney so it has that disney magic at the end but other wise a great movie
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,"It was a good movie. I liked it. None of the Star Wars franchise will ever be 5 stars for me, but it was good."
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,10/10 its a movie. it gets the job done.
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,It was an amazing way to end an epic 50 year old saga!
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,there was a lot of action but they miss a lot of opportunities to develop some characters
"Jan 9, 2020",neutral,"Was it an improvement on the the last jedi? Yes of course it was, but then again.. that wouldn't have been difficult. As this was directed by JJ Abrams it was very much in sync with the first of the sequal trilogy, the force awakens. I will begin with the positives as i feel there aren't many and that leaves time for the real meat of this review. The emperor was portrayed in a way that he truelly should have been all along, menacing, scary and evil. Thats a thumbs up from me. The idea the millennium falcon can 'hyper-skip' also a simple but genius idea. There.. thats the postives done. Now for the rest of the film.. the plot was, well, there wasn't much of one. It was again, like the force awakens, a carbon copy of A new hope. However this is a rehash of return of the jedi - especially the end fight when all the galaxy comes to the aid of the resistance. It's like they picked up the Return of the Jedi script, scribbled out the title and wrote The Rise of Skywalker. The idea the Emporer could be defeated just by deflecting his own lighting is ridiculous, otherwise he would have died in Revenge of the Sith. (Mace Windu vs Palpatine fight) But to top it off.. Rey and Ben had to kiss didn't they. (I would wager Disney insisted that this had to be included) but the moment that genuinely had me angry.. and i mean actually angry is how they killed off Leia. So apparently she sacrifices herself by communicating to her son Ben, long distance, via the force and the shear power that it took overwhelmed her and she dropped dead. Really? Really Abrams? Pathetic. Complete betrayal of the character. Overall this film will not stand the test of time and I hope disney get their act together produce good quality Star Wars films like Rogue One."
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,it is a great tribute to all of the past actors
"Jan 9, 2020",negative,bad but not bad enough
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,"There were a few confusing parts, but overall a very good movie. The only thing that took away from the experience was the person sitting next to me. He was very aggravating."
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,"I enjoyed members of previous movies, especially the originals."
"Jan 9, 2020",negative,Its  just disgusting. This shit should be Removed from the Star Wars history
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,"I liked the end being in the location that it all began. Good tie in to all characters past and present,"
"Jan 9, 2020",negative,"The plot holes were massive, the story was contrived and the characters were bland. It's a bad sign when the best parts of a movie are the callbacks to a previous movie."
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,"It had its things but I liked it overall. It wrapped up the trilogy well enough. As a huge Star Wars fan, I’m not one to complain and just enjoy the fact that I am getting new Star Wars movies."
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,"Very nice and touching tribute to our Princess, Rey and Ben!  Well thought out. A little slow and korning in the first few minutes, but quickly gets moving into the next mission."
"Jan 9, 2020",negative,This was a dumpster fire and a betrayal to the fans.
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,"It's not a bad movie, but some of the story felt like filler, including the part with Keri Russell. After a while the film was getting repetitive. It did end on a nice note, however."
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,Perfect way to end the saga!!!! Loved it!!!!
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,The special effects were well done. The movie kept this viewer glued to the screen every second of the very fast moving adventure.
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,"One of the best Star Wars movies we have seen. Full of action , new characters , and adventure!"
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,"i loved, much better than its predecessor"
"Jan 9, 2020",negative,"Awful writing, tons of pointless ""lucky"" breaks, 0 thought put into this movie other than pissing like a male cat claiming his territory. I left disgusted."
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,Great cinematography. Lots of action. Great plot with a surprise ending.
"Jan 9, 2020",negative,"This film ends the saga that failed expectations even with none set in place going in. All I can say is dis-honorable deaths to characters (Leia ""fades"" away), plot holes such as force healing and lightning issue (Rey uses it and it destroys a ship, Palpatine uses it and it only shuts down computers on a ship), Palpatines fleets do not know how to go up, the space cancer that blocks people from entering can be flown around, why does Palpatine have a map to his planet, Rey is still a Mary Sue, Kylo as a character is still inconsistent, apperently force ghosts can now do anything with the force including move objects, the whole dagger being a map is absolutely silly and nonsensical (fragments of the death star shouldn't even exist, what about erosion to the ruins of the death star from water which would ruin the point of the dagger map, and if the characters weren't lucky to be standing at the right spot they wouldn't have even seen how the map works), so many things in this movie done with ""a feeling"" for plot convenience, and the list goes on. Severely disappointing and as someone who grew up with the prequels, this is a new low. You not only ruined the star wars story, but as well as an entire brand (toys, collectibles) has turned into utter garbage you find in the clearance section. Well done."
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,One of the best movies ever! It had the high tech special effects but still held true to the Star Wars nostalgic feel. Not a dull moment in the entire movie! Definitely a movie to see on the big screen versus waiting for it to come out on DVD or netflix!
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,"It was a good ending it the trilogy, but fell short of the expected level of excellence ..."
"Jan 9, 2020",neutral,Too many plot twists that were immediately resolved.
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,Just okay not close to the actual story but lots of action. Worth seeing if that’s all you care about.
"Jan 9, 2020",negative,"Hard to believe this was the best a billion dollar studio could come up with. Tragic that there was no overarching plot that could have been thread through these movies. Takes no risks, offers no creativity, and few characters we should care anything about."
"Jan 9, 2020",negative,"Very predictable, little bits from all the previous movies all in 1. "
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,I throughly enjoyed the movie
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,Excellent....especially in 3D!!
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,"Overall a good movie, I mean its Star Wars so cant really go wrong. Wont say really what I liked or disliked. Was just a good overall movie."
"Jan 9, 2020",negative,"It's a fittingly trite and hackneyed end to the JJ Abrams SW duology.  The best thing one can say is that it's not as aggressively, insultingly terrible as The Last Jedi.  That's faint praise because this movie is very bad in its own way.  The plot is nonsensical.  It's also rushed, cringe-inducing, and boring.  I don't mean boring as in nothing happens; to the contrary it feels like too much happens.  I mean boring as in it's impossible to care about the characters because over three films none of them have been properly developed; while pacing is frenetic, the narrative is formulaic and predictable.  Completists who want to finish ""the saga"" might be better off waiting for this to come out on streaming, but I don't think it's even worth anyone's time to watch for free.  If there was ever any doubt, it's now clear that the saga ended in 1983."
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,Storyline Wasnt very good but the special effects were good.
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,A very engaging exciting end to the Saga!
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,"I thought it was great, have seen it twice already. I really don’t understand all the criticisms but I would think if you’re a true fan like my husband and I are, then you’d enjoy this. They did a great job wrapping up all 9 episodes!"
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,"I liked how the old actors were brought in and how they were able to incorporate Princess Leah, impressive. Special effects were great.  However, I think my husband enjoyed movie better than me. I found time to take a nap."
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,"The movie moved fast, but it was worth it!  My only gripe was the scene at the end, which was an homage to George Lucas so I was good with it!"
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,"Excellent!!!
My husband and I totally enjoyed this Start Wars movie"
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,This movie was damn fun with a great cast.
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,Just saw it a 3rd time in 3D 4DX. Love it.
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,"This movie pulls off epic moments like no one's business. I got chills three or four times watching. If I had one complaint, it would be that the character development seems a tiny bit bland, but who cares! To me, the insanely well-done action is what matters."
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,"A long time ago, in a galaxy far far away, a very similar story to this one was told. And it was told much better. This is still a must see for any Star Wars fan, but not up to snuff like many of the others. Its still head and shoulders above any of the prequels, but something is still missing here. The end of the movie left me hoping someone, at some point will pick up the reins and tell a great story from this galaxy. There are so many to tell."
"Jan 9, 2020",negative,Its face paced plot made zero sense and was all luck/Force BS. This movie retconned the entire new trilogy and forced so much it isn't even worth watching anymore.
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,Great action and threads from the past movies.
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,Too much of the same old same old
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,exciting!   Special effect wonderful and story excellent...definitely advise seeing this movie.
"Jan 9, 2020",negative,REALLY bad movie. Cattered to trolls. If your someone trying to relive your childhood than youll like this movie because JJ has no creativity and copied Return of the Jedi. This movie made me hate Star Wars. I guess on the plus side you can skip the original trilogy now since Vader is meaningless and the new movies are the same with better graphics.
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,The movie tried to solve the problems the last jedi had and it did it in a respectful way and it worked but beacuse of so much damage it was hard to make it a good film
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,Entertaining and fast moving.
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,Loved the whole movie.
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,Movie is a special effects conclusion to one aspect of Star Wars.
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,The story has begun to be repetitive with few new plot lines.
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,Completely predictable
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,Having followed Star Wars since the very first I was not disappointed.
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,Good movie Wasn't my favorite though.Good movie though.
"Jan 9, 2020",negative,All over the place. Broke Jedi canon. Rise of the Emperor not Skywalker. All Skywalker died.
"Jan 9, 2020",negative,"Complete hot garbage. Felt so scotch taped together. From start to finish you are barraged with scene after scene of half baked and on the fly ideas. And we're supposed to just accept it because it's Star Wars. It spat  in the face of Vader's redemption. It invented yet more force powers that only now have come to light. Ray's force healing power was just about the stupidest thing ever. The whole reason Anikin fell to the dark side was to learn that power and yet Ray just does it. No explanation. The whole Sith planet with thousands of ships for the ""final order""..... just lol. I was left feeling that Star Wars was destroyed. There was no point to anything. The amount of times I found myself shaking my head in the theater or shooting my brother in law a looking in the theater were numberless.The characters deserved better. We deserved better. You had it all Disney and you blew it. Just blew it all to hell."
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,"I enjoyed the movie connecting the dots from the early days to the last days of the story.  Small screen shots of old, original characters was awesome.  The story telling with General Lela was overdone because knowing that she (Carrie Fisher) had passed sometime ago did not feel right or real to me!  The special affects were wonderful and allowed George Lucas to finish with all the bang that he originally wanted.  It is Star Wars, what is not to love.  I think all the main characters were there except for Yoda and Obe Wan.  Nice finish.."
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,The end of a family saga. Lots of stuff packed in couldve gone longer. We demolished a large tub of popcorn and had fun!
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,Great story and good action throughout the movie.
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,I love the full circle ...story ends where it began..I love the redemption of kilo ren...and the victory of rey..I hate that the story is ending!
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,"Outstanding score and special effects.  Good story-line, but drags a bit at times."
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,Enjoyed the whole film.   Great action!
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,"Fun to watch if you aren't a Star Wars diehard, like me, but I can definitely understand why you may hate it if you are."
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,I like everything about the movie
"Jan 9, 2020",negative,really damaging for the franchise
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,Not the best but pretty good. Not the most satisfying but it kinda works.
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,It ties all together!
"Jan 9, 2020",negative,It's just an apology for TLJ that we need to buy a ticket for.
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,Best Of the Star Wars series!
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,"I just love the Star Wars movies!  The movie flowed well, the storyline was great and it kept me glue to the screen. Hate to see it end!"
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,I thought it was a good tie in to the others and finally a winning outcome!
"Jan 9, 2020",negative,"An absolute steaming pile of shit. A plot that is totally inconsistent and contrived. It retcons the previous trilogies to the point that the whole franchise falls apart. The best thing to do would be to forget this trilogy, and consider as canon only either the original trilogy or the original+prequel trilogy."
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,"I loved the return to the feel of IV, V, and VI.  Loved the way the series  was wrapped up."
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,"well done, cleared  up some loose ends"
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,I dont even know what to say about this movie. It is just... okay.
"Jan 9, 2020",negative,"Worst cinematic experience since our 2nd grace produced movie. The emperor as the main villain is just lazy writing, Rey being his granddaugter does not make any sense and basically every scene in the move will leave you wondering what the hell the writers were smoking when they came up with this. You're better off wathing flies copulate than letting this heap of junk infect your mind."
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,"Too many stories to wrap up in this final movie, but overall very entertaining."
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,soooo good- definitely my favorite of the new trilogy. well paced and the dialogue wasn’t nearly as bad as last jedi
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,"My one dislike of this movie was that it is very fast-paced: JJ Abrams had a lot to do in this movie after the debacle of The Last Jedi. This often leads to some weakly developed and sometimes dropped plot lines.

Despite this, the movie ran that line as good as it could have and it was a wonderful wrap-up to the 42 year history of the Skywalker saga. I hope to see some characters and stories spun off from this and hope that JJ Abrams gets to steer those stories in some capacity. I don't think his original vision was given enough of a chance with this trilogy.

I really believe that had JJ's original draft of this trilogy been followed more closely after the Force Awakens and in The Last Jedi, this movie would have had a chance to slow down the pace and dig deeper into some of the character's back stories. Let's hope there is an extended directors cut released at some point."
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,"Great movie! A satisfying end to an epic saga, tying everything together perfectly.  I began watching this series in my late 20s and I'm 75 now this is well worth the wait. I hate that it's over."
"Jan 9, 2020",negative,"Desrespeitoso. Corrido, sem coerência com o filme anterior e, com certeza, o pior Star Wars de todos."
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,"Fantastic culmination of all the trilogies, especially for the Star Wars fanatics!"
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,Lots of action. With caricature building never a dull moment throughout
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,"It was entertaining and definitely way better than The Last Jedi, but still was not very Star Wars.  It felt like a trilogy itself all in one movie."
"Jan 9, 2020",negative,"A decent standalone, popcorn movie. Poor entry in a Star Wars saga; makes me wish this trilogy was removed, honestly."
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,"Although not perfect, all things considered, this entry into the Star Wars franchise is the best we could've hoped for. Never underestimate the power of the Force."
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,Cinematically creative and beautiful.
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,"Set peices, action, story are all entertaining!"
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,Had a lot of fun! Great end to the saga
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,Predictable and somewhat unoriginal. Saw the original Star Wars series and it was almost the same story line with a few tweaks.
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,"My Husband Loved it, but I went with him not seeing the rest of the Star Wars shows and was lost.  My Bad, Not into Star Wars"
"Jan 9, 2020",negative,"Just didn't care for a second, thought I was watching a SNL parody for the first 45 minutes."
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,"Loved everything about it.  Tons of action, tons of nods back to the other 8 episodes.  Really good job tying everything together.  There are a few details that were left hanging or unresolved but don't get hung up on them and miss out on the total experience of Star Wars."
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,"An entertaining film to be sure.  Hit some really good notes.  This saga's Trio has such great chemistry.  Some moments seemed rushed, but to be expected as they try to wrap up 8 movies in 2 hrs."
"Jan 9, 2020",neutral,"Meh, too much of Carrie Fisher and trying to tie it all in!"
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,I have liked all the Star Wars movies. Always needed to see them in the theater
"Jan 9, 2020",negative,"If you don't know what Deus ex machina is, watch this movie. I could've cared less what happened to any of the new characters throughout the film, but by the third turd squeezed out by Disney, you just know exactly what's going to happen: force powers win because -destiny. J.J. Abrams needs to stop making movies and read Joseph Campbell (who greatly inspired the original films) in order to make a believable plot. This movie was utter crap."
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,"It was a pretty good movie, a few funny parts and some very tear jerking scenes as well. Seeing things come full circle and even seeing a sign for future (spin off movies) is pretty exciting."
"Jan 9, 2020",negative,"Same old stuff. Bad acting, lots of fighting, and hokey sob stuff"
"Jan 9, 2020",negative,Pandering nonsense of which the soul purpose was to undo the last movie (highly disrespectful) and kiss the asses of those who screamed and cried at Last Jedi.  Congrats JJ-you succeeded in doing that & making a movie that is highly unwatchable.  I have this ranked as my lowest Star Wars movie which says a lot considering I have almost nothing nice to say about a couple of prequels & Solo.
"Jan 9, 2020",negative,It's boring and way to long....
"Jan 9, 2020",negative,Not good at all. I fell asleep.
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,"Too many plots, deviated too much from originals."
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,"Movie with good images but no context!
Very short, poorly explained ..."
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,Great movie. 2nd best movie only to return of the Jedi
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,"Mostly fast moving, great special effects"
"Jan 9, 2020",negative,"Star wars story 1/5 
Eye candy 4/5
Would I watch it again ? Watching paint dry would be more interesting."
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,I think it was good way to end a series concerning one legacy of a force involved family. There can be future adventures but we need to see new heroes take up the mantle. I see that in this movie.
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural.
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,Great and worth the wait
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,"It's good, but still not what star wars is about. The original 3 were light, silly and funny, but also serious and dark. The grind and struggle was real. Definitely have the grind and struggle in this one. Just a little too serious tho."
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,"Best Star Wars yet! But they had to make it the longest one yet as well. With that, they kept the story moving and there was no time for boring scenes. The movie kept you engaged and guessing."
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,Still s lot of unanswered questions at the end but enjoyed the action and character development in this.
"Jan 9, 2020",negative,"Predictable, shallow and too long, but entertains with good battle scenes."
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,"Not sure why Star Nerds (extreme Star Wars fans) didn't like this movie.  After all, the franchise is aimed at minors (cute robots), not adults (compare Star Trek movies - NOT the TV series).  This is a ""closure"" movie to a series and does need to wrap up its multiple story lines - thus the frentic pace and length.  I thought the disclosure of who Rey really is was nicely done, and Kylo Ren's fate was fine, but could have gone in another direction.  I did enjoy the tech that allowed Carrie Fisher to have some decent screen time.  All-in-all, an entertaining evening."
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,"A solid ending for the current story line, while leaving possibilities for a new beginning.... It's a big universe out there."
"Jan 9, 2020",negative,Absolutely disgusting mass of unrelated scenes. Only connection of Rey and Ben somehow watchable. Please leave Star Wars alone. Please
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,"Loved this movie, lots of action and great story...a fitting way to end the Skywalker trilogy."
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,Great story fast paced
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,"The Rise of Reboot:
Episode 4/7: young nobody raised on a dreary desert planet learns about the Force and becomes the hero(ine).  Episode 5/8: Empire/1st Order chase down the The Rebels/Resistance on a ice/salt planet & the hero(ine) trains with a hermit on a faraway planet.  Episode 6/9: Vader/Kylo redeems himself to help defeat Palpatine. Lando flies the Falcon."
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,"Some tears, some laughs, and some OMG moments.  If this is the end of the legacy I would say it was a good way to end it......or open a new door.  If you are a fanperson definitely a must see"
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,"While not the absolute best, it was still decent and enjoyable. There were the action parts and the funny parts and the emotional parts I expected. Worth seeing."
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,Great movie - hard to see the series end.
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,Loved the graphics.  Great storyline.
"Jan 9, 2020",negative,"Bad ending, it follows the same story pattern as the first trilogy, might as well be watching return of the jedi"
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,Great plot full of twists and turns!  Excellent! Want to see it again!
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,"The movie was exceptional!  The character relations were amazing, the cast’s chemistry was off the chart!  The only thing I didn’t like in brief instances were when the special effects were still so far out there that they seemed fake.  I’ve seen Disney so much better it’s Thor CGI Special Effects.  But I still have to say it will be one I watch again and again - and just as Last Jedi was my favorite when I was much younger, this will be my favorite going forward."
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,Good and entertaining.
"Jan 9, 2020",negative,"Just the worst, that's all I can really say"
"Jan 9, 2020",negative,This would be my 1st review on this site so here it goes. This movie's audience rating is complete BS. And those responsible whoever you are should be ashamed of yourselves!
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,"Like old home week with various cameos and scenes from all previous movies throughout the series. A ""must see"" for any Star Wars fan, young or old!!"
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,"The best of the current trilogy, but why did they have to bring back Palpatine..."
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,"I thought the storyline actually made sense and was well done. Visuals were amazing and played homage to the originals. My only issue, which seems to be a problem for a lot of people, was the fact that it seemed   rushed and so many things were left unexplained. This wouldnt bother me so much, but this is was supposed to be the kind of ending where all loose ends were  tied up."
"Jan 9, 2020",negative,"The only positive aspect of this film...the music. But, what else would you expect from John Williams. However, the amazing score can't distract from the mess that J.J. Abrams has created with this series of random action sequences that they are brave enough to call a movie. Everything good that the last two films set up (even though it wasn't that much) is rendered completely ridiculous and useless with this. The proof that Star Wars has become nothing but a money machine deprived of all basic rules of storytelling, pacing and dialogue.
1/5"
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,"Awesome Movie!
Best one yet!"
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,"Most of the movie keep with the theme. Liked it, didn't love it.  One character was gotten rid of too quickly."
"Jan 9, 2020",negative,I wish Disney would sale star wars and marvel so they can stop putting politics in my entertainment and wish I could be hired for my creativity because clearly I'm more intelligent a villain makes a movie the hero's should win but the villain should be scary and I can play chess these mess of stories by Disney need my help if they want to stop upsetting the fans! These movies are for fan entertainment not appeasements I would work with the originator and tell his vision with my villain putting you on edge of seat
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,"Фильм достаточно не плохой, Но это нельзя назвать грандиозныйм окончанием  саги 《ЗВЕЗДНЫХ ВОЙН》поэтому 3 звезды"
"Jan 9, 2020",negative,Looks good visually but the storyline was rushed and all over the place.
"Jan 9, 2020",negative,"The sequel trilogy progressively got worse as it went along, if this was truly part of the Skywalker Saga then maybe have an actual Skywalker be the main character. No, Ben Solo isn't the main character, Rey Palpatine is. The Skywalker Saga's main focus has always been Anakin Skywalker/ Darth Vader/ Luke Skywalker. In the sequels that is all pissed on and we end up with this mess. There are some fun parts throughout the trilogy but if it was truly part of the SKYWALKER Saga it would have honoured the name and the characters that carried the name."
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,"this was a perfect novel rendition, i truly enjoyed this movie. Disney i hope you keep this franchise going in all its glory!"
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,we think the movie was really awesome we love it
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,Plenty of action and new likable characters.
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,It was Action Packed and I Loved Watching.
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,"Watched it twice and would recommend- you can see all the great Star Wars of it all once the stakes aren't so high and you can relax about whether everything gets wrapped up as upj would wish. Some excellent parts  some a bit dodgy, but a herculean task to end the saga and it was never going to succeed quite as well as Endgame. Succeed it did though"
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,"I honestly don't get all the critics. Rise of Skywalker is the the best movie of this new trilogy, and i'll say One of the best star wars ever. There are severals defects, no doubt, but the same defects of every star wars. BUT! this one has good acting, good cinematography, a lot of action, and it's overall very enjoyable. I cannot tell the same about other episodes of the old trilogies."
"Jan 9, 2020",negative,"The final nail in the coffin. However it is unfair to blame JJ as Rian was the cause for such a rushed and frantic ending. Like the Last Jedi, the script is full of holes with universe breaking (albeit not as severe) scenes. This movie tries to apologize for the abysmal Last Jedi, undoing everything in said movie. However, this movie undermines and undoes al 6 movies of the original trilogy and the prequels, which is why many fans consider this series of movies as non canon. Speaking of, the disney era of films are so terrible that they desperately try to gain the fans they lost, baiting characters like Revan and the old republic as if begging for fans to return saying ""please come back and watch our movies and we'll make your favorite things canon again."" George Lucas, for all the flaws people point out, had a story to tell. He had plans. He knew and understood what to add or keep out (a good example is to keep Revan and Bane out of the clone wars series as it conflicted with the universe rules he created). disney has no such restraints. If the rumors are true and the old republic is the focus of the next series of movies, this is a good example of disney's desperation. They understand that any new ideas they have will be met with box office flops and so they MUST resort to fan favorite characters and settings in order to salvage whatever remains. The only redeeming factor is Palpatine's show of power in one scene. That is it. And even then it is impossible to fully love or enjoy due to how it breaks everything the past 6 movies built up to."
"Jan 9, 2020",negative,"The acting was alright, especially Adam Driver. The problem with this movie is the writing, which seems sloppy and lazy and if we take the events of The Last Jedi the plot also seems incoherent. Some of the plot points set up in the other movies in the trilogy just fail, and I'm especially disappointed in The Knights of Ren as we've been waiting for them since TFA. The movies pacing also feels off as the movie never gets to breathe and there's always something going on. That can be a good thing, but in this case it really isn't. To be fair, I think that people new to Star Wars, or people that just want to be entertained will be happy, but as a Star Wars I have to say I'm disappointed."
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,"It is a good Star Wars movie.  Better than the sequels in my opinion.  I have watched all Star Wars films, played 90% of the games dating back to '04, and I have read a few of the ""really good"" comic series.  This movie cannot top the original trilogy, but I feel it is an improvement from the last 2 films."
"Jan 9, 2020",negative,"This movie was a mish-mash of a bunch of stuff. It felt like a script written in the comment section of youtube. Too much pandering to the fans and not enough vision for the story. 

Also way too much fan service.

I disliked this movie as a movie and star wars fan."
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,I loved it. I know there will be haters who can't replicate their experience as a 10 year old in 1977. Good movie. My only gripe..why was there a hobbit in a star wars movie?
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,"I can tell JJ Abrams really tried to fix Star Wars, but Rian Johnson, and Disney screwed it up so bad. Either way, Im happy that I got to see a whole new trilogy to Star Wars, but dont go in expecting a masterpiece. Especially to Rise of Skywalker. Just enjoy it for what it is."
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,Good stuff follows Star Wars story
"Jan 9, 2020",negative,Just awful. A big kick in the mouth to the skywalkers.
"Jan 9, 2020",neutral,"SPOILER FREE REVIEW:
  Better than The Last Jedi, but worse than The Force Awakens.  This sequel trilogy is the worst of the trilogies.  Original > Prequel > Sequel.  

""My expectations were very low for TROS following up to The Last Jedi... But TROS still struggled to meet my already-LOW expectations""

DISCLAIMER:  - I LOVE Star Wars.  I'm going to sound highly critical below, but that's only because I love Star Wars and want it to stay true to itself so that new fans can have the same quality story-telling that we had when we first experienced the saga.  I do not dislike everything about the new Disney films; in fact there is something I can enjoy in all of the films, even the ones that I liked the least.  Disney's Mandalorian and Rogue One were pretty great in my opinion.  I loved The Force Awakens when it came out, and had a love/hate relationship with The Last Jedi, but those two movies have not aged very well in my opinion.  The more I digest them the more problems I have with the story that those two tell.  Once again, this is a spoiler-free review.  I talk about some of the traits of The Rise Of Skywalker (TROS) without going into further detail about the actual events in the film.  Without further ado, here we go...    

  TROS gets a passing grade from me (50%), but there's plenty to be disappointed about... The film was far too predictable, the writing was lazy and used the most obvious cop-outs, it doesn't answer some questions from the previous two films, it poorly handled some of our beloved classic characters, it didn't feel like it wrapped up the ""Skywalker saga"", and lastly,  it was all over the place.
  
    The film was far too predictable, it was nearly all fan-service that was forcibly shoe-horned in, and some of the most obvious ""fan theories"" or ""cop-outs"" to questions that we had from the earlier Disney SW movies came true.  The kind of ""fan-service"" that JJ Abrams used in TROS makes the film predictable because the director is going out of his way with the story just to stuff in some more recycled material or jokes (attempting to add nostalgia) from the George Lucas trilogies that WE'VE ALREADY SEEN.  Not only is this kind of story-telling predictable, but it also causes the plot to dart all over the place; the way JJ handled it anyways.  Next, some scenes in TROS were executed quite poorly (i.e.. certain characters' deaths), and some parts could have easily been left out entirely. --Think of that useless Casino sub-plot with Rose, Finn and the Codebreaker dude (from The Last Jedi) that did NOTHING to contribute to the main plot, and ultimately is just a waste of precious screen time; --I'm talking about scenes like that.  

  The poor, flip-floppy setup of the first two films of this trilogy are partially to blame for TROS being such a mess.  Having to follow up to the story of The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi, I think JJ did a DECENT job of salvaging this mess of a trilogy.  My expectations were very low for TROS following up to The Last Jedi... But TROS still struggled to meet my already-LOW expectations.  This film mostly felt like JJ was stomping out fires that Rian ""Ruin"" Johnson had set, which I agree needed to be done, BUT the result was a rather sloppy, crammed, incoherent plot. The setup from the first two sequel films are (mostly) to blame for TROS not reaching its full potential.  TROS didn't quite hit me the way that TFA first did.  Heck, TROS even had its moments where I was rolling my eyes thinking ""this might really be worse than TLJ"", but it also had SOME better moments.  There were at least enough enjoyable (or interesting) things to keep me seated so I wouldn't walk out of the theatre while this film was still playing. 

CONCLUSION:
   Due to the story of The Last Jedi doing nothing to move the story forward from TFA,--
 (Snoke died, that's about it.  Luke's death didn't matter because he was absent from the battle and can appear as a ghost at any time anyways. That's about all that happened in TLJ), 
-- JJ Abrams tried to make up for it, by trying to cram two films worth of content into one film.  The result was a messy, unevenly paced plot that creates new plot holes in an attempt to patch up the ones from the previous films.  We are left with an unsatisfying ending to a very VERY unnecessary add-on story that deconstructs the already satisfying ending of Return of the Jedi.  The ""big fight"" at the end wasn't even much of a fight, and after it, every fans' worst nightmare came true...  It really was underwhelming and ""cringey"" to say the least.  By the way, when I say ""messy"", think of the movie Aquaman and its... ""interesting"" plot.  I'm talking THAT messy.  There were still some questions from The Force Awakens that are left unanswered by TROS. - i.e. how did Maz get Anakin's/Luke's lightsaber??  ""A story for another time""... Well, it's another time now Maz, ISN'T IT?! 

Final Remarks:  
  If you're going to add-on some extra story to an already satisfying [saga] ending that is Return of the Jedi.  Please, PLEASE plan out the three movies before hand, and make sure the characters are somewhat interesting, rather than having flat one-dimensional characters (some with no weaknesses) and playing ""pass-the-baton"" between directors/writers for each of the three movies...  Remember, this is a film trilogy, not an elementary school relay race.  I'm talking to you Disney 😘"
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,"Dont worry no spoilers here.  Overall, I really loved this final installment in the 3rd Star Wars Trilogy.  Very creative and enjoyable to watch.  My big complain is that it felt choppy.  Almost like they were rushing to release it before it was fully finished."
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,"My wife loved it! As a long time Star Wars fan, I liked it. Could have been better but it was decently good."
"Jan 9, 2020",negative,"Wow, what a piece of garbage. It seemed like some crappy fanfic written by a 12-year-old girl."
"Jan 9, 2020",negative,In one movie they tried to close too much plots so sometimes was missed connections between them
"Jan 9, 2020",negative,"A lot of action, maybe too much because you get lost trying to piece what is going on and with whom. It’s a zero in my book."
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,"I'm perhaps in the minority, but I absolutely loved it. The ending was perfect."
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,Much of the same storylines and action.
"Jan 9, 2020",negative,"Hot mess of bad editing, crappy macguffins, contradictory ideas and contrived setpieces"
"Jan 9, 2020",negative,"Lazy, messy, erratic, nonsensical. What a way to end the Star Wars saga."
"Jan 9, 2020",negative,"Dumb, boring, lazy, just revive characters, bcuz why not?, the ""action"" scenes are really bad, the entire movie feels just like a bad excuse to launch a mediocre movie with the name ""Star Wards"" on it bcuz of money.

To be honest, this movie makes the prequels looks amazing and good movies."
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,"Disclaimer: I really liked The Last Jedi and consider myself a casual Star Wars fan. I've played all the games, but I'm not particularly crazy about the series. I don't own any of the toys or the special-mega-godlike editions of the movies. I don't know the backstory of a guy who was in one scene in the second movie. Here's your warning: Spoilers incoming!

Right off the bat the film tries so hard to undo the story changes from The Last Jedi that it's painfully transparent. If it was an important reveal in The Last Jedi, then it was undone here. While it's trying to do that, it's also trying to have its own story. What the film gives us feels bloated and rushed due to trying to juggle so many things at once. The quick pace introduces to many moments where you ask ""why didn't they just...?"" For one example: Star Destroyers are in formation parallel to the ground and need to launch. It's so stormy that it messes with sensors to the point that they need a navigation beacon. Why didn't they just turn the vessels upwards 90 degrees and step on the gas? They and, by extension, we can literally see the ground during the inevitable ship-to-ship combat!

Is The First Order the remnants of The Empire or is it a separate entity? Why is someone with the emotional maturity of a 2-year-old in charge of The First Order? Who built the fleet of Star Destroyers on Exegol, the forbidden Sith planet? Were said ships conjured by the Emperor, who I might add survived being thrown down a giant shift while exploding? How did chunks of the Death Star crash into a planet when The Return of the Jedi very clearly showed it disintegrate in a massive explosion? Is Korriban (from The Old Republic series) still the Sith homeworld? Why do characters get brought into the story and then have about 3 minutes of screen time? If Star Destroyers could all have planet-vaporizing weapons, then why was the Death Star even necessary? I can't believe The Emperor, living mostly alone on a planet that a 13-year-old goth would think is cool, developed the weapons on his own.

The movie could have been really interesting if Disney hadn't chickened out. Instead we get a trilogy that just rehashes the Original Trilogy. There's an Empire run by a Sith against someone from a famous bloodline that has to use Jedi to stop them. I truly believe there isn't anything new that can really be done with Star Wars, because as the fan outcry over The Last Jedi showed, anything even slightly different is met with hostility.

Is there anything particularly wrong with this movie? Not at all. In fact it's fine. The story is fine. The acting is fine. The special effects are fine. I don't know if ""whelming"" is an actual word to use, but it describes this movie exactly."
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,"It was slow, couple interesting details but it wasn’t that bad."
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,"I loved the movie. J.J saved Star Wars, while Rian Johnson ruined Star Wars."
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,It was ok. Better than the return of the jedi. It had some surprising twists. Still think the 1st 3 released are the best.
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,"Overall good, but long."
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,Major endgame vibes but disappointingly pales in comparison to its disney counterpart. TROS would've been a masterpiece if there weren't so many plot inconsistencies throughout the trilogy.
"Jan 9, 2020",negative,So many plot holes. Destroys the original Saga. Technically excellent.
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,"Great movie, sad to see it come to an end"
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,A good wrap up to this trilogy.
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,"I'm excited to see the continuation from Rise of Skywalker returns in 2021. In Rise of Skywalker, it is about Leia's dynasty, the rise of Palpatine from the dead, and Rey, Finn and Poe along with others battle against Palpatine's dynasty. Interesting twist to this film, but change to Rey's name as the grand daughter to Palpatine to Skywalker."
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,"Satisfying ending to a rich, layered story"
"Jan 9, 2020",negative,Too many characters. Too long. Too safe.
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,I love how it was tied together in the end.
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,Great movie. Loved the action and plot.
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,This was my second viewing. I enjoyed it even more than the first time. JJ did a great job...there was fan service but not too much. it's a great conclusion to the story.
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,"As a lifelong fan, I was pleased with the ending. I wish the story had gone a different way but I am sure most people have their own vision. The 3-D was very immersive and really enhanced the experience for me personally. Overall a pretty stunning visual achievement."
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,"An almost impossible feat to wrap this franchise up nicely so it feels chaotic, but I can’t see how it could have been done better. Lots of fun. I was skeptical, but pleasantly surprised. "
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,A lil cheesy but I love the cheese ya feel me
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,Great movie as always from the Star Was saga!!
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,Best of the last series of Star Wars movies. Plenty of action and closure to the story.
"Jan 9, 2020",neutral,"As a Star Wars fan, it was enjoyable. But it was a forced end to an uninteresting trilogy and spent more time trying to right the wrongs from The Last Jedi than it did entertaining."
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,Was fun and exciting.
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,"It was a great movie, I dont think it deserves the negativity its receiving. Highly recommend it. Jesus loves yall, Stay safe and God bless!"
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,LOVED EVERY MINUTE OF IT. Cried 3 times lol it was amazing.
"Jan 9, 2020",negative,"This movie was a mishmash of scenes with too many random characters, a complete disregard for the trilogy characters who were thrown aside made subservant to Poe, Fin and Rey! None of these new characters had ANY character development, except that Rey is superwoman  just because!

The most interesting COMPARATIVELY was Kylo Ren's arch.  

Anyone who intimately knows star wars can see through the cinematography that JJ and Disney completely ripped off dialogue and scenes from the original trilogy 

If you want to see a teen movie to get your fix and leave forgetting what you saw  like movies versions of hunger games, twilight or even maze runner, this movie is for you but with more beautiful cinematography and special fx.

If you are a star wars fan. There is NOTHING ORGINAL about this movie. Even the score was very similar to the original trilogy.

Disney has successfully spit on this epic piece of my childhood."
"Jan 9, 2020",negative,Not great. Very long.
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,Awesome Movie will see it again
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,I enjoyed the character development but it felt like there was a little too much breathing room. The balance of action was a little lacking to me. I enjoyed what action there was! I really enjoyed the humor as well. It just seemed slightly softer overall than I anticipated.
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,Enjoyed seeing the original cast with a great ending!
"Jan 9, 2020",negative,"Overrated and overhyped
Just a stupid cashgrabbing movie for fanboys"
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,Action packed! Loved it!
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,"Not quite as good as the originals, but better than all the other Disney star wars movies."
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,"Liked the fact that the movie had a conclusion to the 3-part saga. The action sequences were vintage star wars. There were a couple of interesting surprises to the storyline. 

I think they could have have a more nuanced approach to presenting the sith-vs-jedi conflict instead of the simplistic sith are bad and jedi are good."
"Jan 9, 2020",negative,"The movie is very pretty, but the plot was lacking quite a bit. The first 30 minutes are really disjointed, the plot basically scrapped 75% of build-up from The Last Jedi, and there isn't a lot of payoff for me. 

It relies too much on fanservice and nostalgia for me."
"Jan 9, 2020",negative,"I did write a big ass review but I click out of it so just let me say that this film was just made to make money, GO WATCH THE VADER FAN FILM from STAR WARS THEORY, THAT'S WHAT A ORIGINAL IDEA AND LOVE FOR THE FRANCHISE LOOKS LIKE."
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,It’s Star Wars!!! Of course great storyline for the decadent fan !!
"Jan 9, 2020",negative,"Really corny and boring.  I was cringing throughout the entire thing from how dumb it was.  Bad acting, stupid story, another disgrace to a once promising franchise.  Thanks Disney!  Only cool part was Palpatine."
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,Somewhat disjointed and lacking in a believable ending
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,"Predictable and a little cheesy, but it was good."
"Jan 9, 2020",negative,"Bland, unoriginal, formulaic and cliche. Waste of a Star Wars movie."
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,Special effects are great
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,Good end to the saga. It had some rushed spots and some goofy writing but I liked it overall!
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,"I’m not a Star Wars fan, but I approve :)"
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,Great movie 3D IMAX the best
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,"Great ending to my favorite movie franchise. Wasn’t a perfect movie, but I loved every minute of watching it."
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,It ties up the story nicely.  Also continues to engage with action and humor while still being poignant.
"Jan 9, 2020",negative,The story was not well written and the characters were not the greatest. I cant say Ill watch it again.
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,Plot twist and more depth of characters than the last movies in the series. A fitting end to the journey.
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,"Lots of fight scenes, a touch of romance and a little bit of touching moments good movie really enjoyed it"
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,Continued to flow like original story.
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,It was the best.  The ending was great.  I couldn't help but talk about it a lot after I left.  A MUST see.
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,it was good just felt like something was missing
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,in contrast with many opinion on media. I believe this movie is enjoyable.
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,"Enjoyed the show, tied up story lines as well as being entertaining and fun"
"Jan 9, 2020",neutral,"The movie was Ok, I didnt like how the whole story was developed, it doesnt make sense for what George Lucas started"
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,"It was good.  Just left too many questions unanswered.  But as a fan, Im ok."
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,"I think was the best Star Wars since the Return of the Jedi. JJ Abrahams did a beautiful job of tying in All of the previous movies including characters, and all of the fighters, and previous sets. They brought back the magic that was lost in many of the more current installment, Great Job,"
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,"The continuation of the story in this trilogy was masterful. The insertion of Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill, and Carrie Fisher was eloquently touching. Everything was neatly tied up, with a lot of room for future speculation and possible forward marching onward toward the 50 year mark of this magnificent series."
"Jan 9, 2020",neutral,Meh. It’s hopefully over now
"Jan 9, 2020",negative,Disorganized and lacking soul or structure. How can you even get a chance to marvel at a new planet or even begin to care for these characters on any level whatsoever when the movie pulls you off into another tangent every 10 minutes? A lackluster final corporate product that falls flat...
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,A very nice wrap-up to the Star Wars saga.  Seeing it in IMAX 3D was great!
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,Very satisfying and great action.
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,"Perfect ending to a fantastic saga! It’s been one of the grandest adventures of my life! Thank you, Mr. Lucas!"
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,It was okay probably my second to least favorite since Phantom Menace.
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,Loved it.  Next please
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,"It is a great movie, that ruined because the struggle to please everyone. 

But I kinda like the ending, it all ends well. (Should be excellent actually)"
"Jan 9, 2020",negative,I made an account just to express how awful this movie is.  That's how awful it is.
"Jan 9, 2020",negative,"Awful. The story made no sense, the characters made no sense. So many plot holes, it's literally as if someone was making it up as they went along. In true JJ style no real questions were answered only more wtf moments created. Another beloved sci-fi movie franchise ruined by Abrams."
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,Tied up alot of loose ends.
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,Fast paced and action pack. Great effects. Nice to see some of the original characters. The went on a little to long.
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,"Action, engaged the audience, and kept me wanting more as always!"
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,"A serious movie, not a victory lap. Still, the return of the emperor is a crappy plot."
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,Movie was ok. It was pretty predictable.
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,Action packed an Very well story driven a great movie after what we got with Episode 8
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,I truly do not understand the critic hate for this movie. The only way you could find real problems in this movie is if you went into it looking for them and hoping to find them. Best finally I could have hoped for given the way the previous two went.
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,"Nice end to the original three star wars movies and the two sequels.  Wow, so epic and heartwarming —"
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,"I thought it was a fitting end to the saga. a lot of fun, and actually quite an emotional rollercoaster"
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,A great end to the series.
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,"There's too much that was unnecessary, and the many attempts at satisfying moments fell flat. Otherwise, an partly enjoyable movie."
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,Liked how it tied up alot of loose ends felt sad every time I saw Carrie fisher.
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,"I enjoyed the wrap up of the trilogy, the conclusion of Leia's story (and deeply appreciated how they managed to implement Carrie Fisher's amazing talents and role into the movie after her passing), and I really loved the little easter eggs and that occurred throughout which likely only meant anything to longtime fans but also didn't detract from the enjoyment for new viewers"
"Jan 9, 2020",neutral,"It's the best & the worst film from the Disney Star Wars trilogy. Why it's the best: it has better pacing and action than the prior two. It also in some ways redeems Luke Skywalker, though not as satisfying as some would prefer. 
Why it's the worst: It retcons everything prior to it. From Anakin's chosen one arc to his own sacrifice as Vader. Force users are so powerful they can sense someone from planets away yet no one, not Luke, not Leia nor ""all powerful"" Rey sense Palpatine is still alive?
The film is entertaining & it has likable characters. However, to a Star Wars fan from the beginning, it's a let down. A film that will take your childhood heroes, wad them up like a candy wrapper and toss them in the garbage. If your first introduction to Star Wars was the Force Awakens you will probably enjoy this film far more than I did."
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,I wish Kyler ren didn't die.  I like that he turned. good!
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,"it wasn't a good movie but it wasn't bad either. its definitely the kind of movie star wars fans have seen already in the first two movies of the trilogy, but it's not really anything mentionable in terms of a finale. it's kind meh."
"Jan 9, 2020",negative,"This movie seemed more focused on spectacle and fan service than bringing the Star Wars saga to a satisfying conclusion. Still, it's fun and visually appealing right up to the end, when the frenetic incoherence reaches a point where enjoying the film becomes impossible."
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,The movie was great.
"Jan 9, 2020",negative,Sad to seee the neglect they had with the franchise :/
"Jan 9, 2020",negative,"It was hard to get through 90% of the movie, the jokes fell flat and there wasnt much intense action, that being said the final battle was pretty dope but the ending was probably one of the worst endings I have seen in a long time"
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,"It was an amazing experience but the lack of practical effects was concerning. I get it's a space film with aliens and lightning and so on, but the CGI gets shoved down ur thought just a tiny bit too much."
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,So much action and very much enjoyed the story line 💚
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,Honestly I think this is the best of the New Trilogy blends fun and serious moments very well. Could have ended 10 minutes earlier. It is nice to have a break from Star Wars.
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,"I loved the action, and the storyline.  The graphics were awesome.  Some of the one liners were predictable, still enjoyable."
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,Not as good as the first three movies.
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,I thought it was entertaining.  It gives closure to the original Star War movies.
"Jan 9, 2020",negative,The manic pace and terrible decisions ruined this movie. It had some great effects and character moments but ultimately it couldn't be saved from its writers.
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,It was the best since the original 3 came out.
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,"Star Wars was meant to be fun in the movies, which my husbands and I had. This last installment was highly satisfying."
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,Honestly loved it. It was the space opera I was waiting for.
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,Great storyline love the movie
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,"Loved it, don't listen to the bad reviews. See it and make up your own mind."
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,"I didn't expect a certain character to die, and not as climactic for the supposed ending of such a saga, hence the 1/2 star deduction.  Overall, a fantastic movie, great acting, and music was terrific.  I would watch it in theaters again, I enjoyed it so much."
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,It’s a good popcorn movie.
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,Fantastic film. Must see. Enjoyed it all!
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,thank you Mr Abrams and Mr. Lucas!
"Jan 9, 2020",negative,"An awful movie with a tpuching ending. Ruins the continuity of the franchise and ignores themes not only from the Lucas material, but also from both the Abbrams material and the Johnson material. I am very surprised that Disney approved this films release. It seems like they really just don't cate anymore. The worst part was the sheer amount of missed opportunities here. It felt like there was no real venerence for the source material."
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,Im a big fan. Fitting ending to a great saga.
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,Amazing way to cap off the trilogy and end the saga.
"Jan 9, 2020",negative,Disjointed and all over the place - glad I had a Fandango VIP reward bonus to see it for free!
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,I expected so much more...
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,"Loved  Carrie Fisher, Mark Hamil, Billy Dee Williams, Harrison Ford, the effects of Obi Wan Kenobis voice, Chewbacca, Yoda  all of the veteran characters. Not sure about the name, Rise of Skywalker?"
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,Loved this movie! Bring the tissues!
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,Did not disappoint loved every minute
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,A good save after the train wreck of the last Jedi. Still not up there with The Force Awakens or Rogue One but still least it feels like Star Wars. 4/5
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,They did a much better job with this movie compared to Last Jedi.
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,"Great movie and action. The color was amazing. The plot was believable and surprising. I loved this movie and hope there are more coming.  The end gives me hope for ,ore to come. I would see this again and again,  and again."
"Jan 9, 2020",negative,"it was pretty bad, but there were some awesome cinematography and cool scenes."
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,Great way to end the Skywalker Saga!  Watched it a few times and Thanks to Fandango for making it easy to purchase each ticket.
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,"3.5 stars.......better than Meh, but certainly not Awesome.  It was a satisfying ending to a decades-long saga.  It tried hard, maybe too hard, to pay homage to parts 4, 5 and 6.  Many of us weren't very happy with the other numbers anyway."
"Jan 9, 2020",negative,"This could have been its own triligy. It tried to fix what the last movie did. Sorry Disney, you goofied it up"
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,Great movie no complaints
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,"Amazing, first star wars my girlfriend liked."
"Jan 9, 2020",negative,I was let down by the lazy script full of holes and contrived plot devices. Expected more from the franchise finale.
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,Really enjoy it. Great end to the Trilogy
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,"2nd viewing after seeing it in Chicago just before Christmas. Just finished re-viewing The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi to see if it would add anything. Didnt see the end credits in Chicago but did today. The music was fantastic! One last time! 

Other than the music end credits, my opinion didn't change significantly. Got a lot more detail this time around. But I have to say that Finn and Poe Dameron are not particularly memorable characters in this epic space-opera spanning 1977-2019, and the fact that Rey with very little Jedi training could do all she did with the Force. Again, just my minor opinion.  Oh well... 

Generally enjoyable throughout the nine films. My three favorites are definitely IV. A New Hope, V. The Empire Strikes Back, and VI. Return of the Jedi. One of my favorite characters in the saga was actually Count Dooku (Darth Tyranus), and wished they could have explored his character a bit more. The end of an era. May the Force be with you!"
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,"Well done!  A lot of action, humor and  drama.  Story line paid great tribute to the main characters throughout the entire franchise."
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,Tied up all the loose ends.  Used the original music.  JJ Abrams was the primary writer.  The perfect finale.
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,Star Wars was definitely entertaining but a little predictable.
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,They did a good job of wrapping it all up. Got all the previous characters in.  The story line was pretty much the same but still very well done.
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,Loved return of many characters and the way they helped bring closure to this epic story.
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,Look what they did to my boy... how they massacred my boy.
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,Very enjoyable movie!  At times predictable and yet not predictable.
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,My husband enjoyed it more than me.  it was a satisfying conclusion to the series.
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,I think the whole series over all these years has been done fabulously! What a ride over 30 years of my life. It is EPIC!
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,"Awesome movie
Great storyline"
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,My kids really enjoyed this movie. We saw it in a Dolby Cinema theater. Amazing!
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,It was just what I wanted it to be
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,I loved it! Some of it was rushed but overall it was a great movie! 
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,"It was at it's best when the three main characters were together, but too many plot conveniences made what could have been a great movie good."
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,I think you’ll enjoy this if you’re a die hard Star Wars fan. It was a fitting end to the Skywalker story with great cameos and a fulfilling end.  Also it was a nice send off to Carrie Fisher’s character. Overall a very satisfying experience.
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,"Great movie. I know there was a lot of dissent with doe-hard fans, but I took the movie at face value and really, really enjoyed it."
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,It answered so many questions. Every Star Wars fan will love to see it multiple times to get the full picture again and again.
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,Big Star Wars fan... was not disappointed!
"Jan 9, 2020",negative,"while the cinematography was excellent, the plot completely tears down the whole narrative built up over the past 8 movies. from illogical to impractical to down right ridiculous. rent this movie if you are a fan of the series just to say you co.pleted this series. poor effort and horribly ruins a beloved franchise."
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,U better recognize. 
"Jan 9, 2020",negative,"Boring, have outgrown the unending sabre battles. Dialogue immature and childish. I fell asleep."
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,"Enjoyed very much, good special effects"
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,Spoiler Alert!! Didnt like killing off Ben after he saved her! Not sure why she couldnt save him back
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,Finally main cast gets to spend most of the movie together. Great fan service as well as fitting ends for the characters
"Jan 9, 2020",negative,This film is a checklist the producers think the fans want to see that ultimately feels just like a checklist
"Jan 9, 2020",positive,Exceptional visual effects combined with top-notch acting made for a movie worth watching more than once!!! And the inclusion of archival footage of Carrie Fisher interacting with present-day cast was nothing short of awe inspiring!!
"Jan 9, 2020",negative,"This movie was an over-stuffed, convoluted, nonsensical mess. I think that JJ Abrams tried his best to undo the damage done by The Last Jedi, but that is a task too great for any director."
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,Star Wars was a good movie. I enjoyed that Rey is a Palpatine princess. But didnt like that Palpatine himself was still alive. I guess they had to make the connection.
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,"Amazing, roller coaster of emotions!"
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,Another AWESOME movie! Loved the action as well as the humor!
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,It was ok. Pretty predictable from the opening credits.
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,Pacing was all over and it was too long.
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,"Luego del desastre del episodio 8, tenían por delante un ENORME desafío. Personalmente, cumplieron bien."
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,"I was the end of the saga, I think there was a big hint of ROTJ. I did enjoyed it all the same . It was nice to return to a galaxy far far away one more time . Lets hope if there is to be a new trilogy it delivers like A new hope did all those years ago ."
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,"Amazing,, fixes everything that went wrong with the last one. Blends the old with the new so well. Can't wait to see it again, and again and again:)"
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,Amazing just amazing ❤️🥰
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,Surprisingly better than I expected. Not as disappointing as The Last Jedi...
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,The ending was not good.
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,I obviously love the story of Star Wars and all of the movies. But this one just felt a little rushed and they were trying to put a bow on it too quickly. Maybe they could’ve done a part one and part two to give them more time to develop the story.
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,"Fantastic! This proves critics have zero clue about movie quality after this and the Last Jedi reviews. I'm so glad Abrams came back, we got what we should have gotten for the last movie. He should have directed all 3 or at least wrote all three. I'm very pleased with how they ended the saga. Now Disney can go exploit characters for their agenda and destroy all the character arcs they want. At least they can't destroy the Skywalkers."
"Jan 8, 2020",negative,Wow.  I thought the last Star Wars movie was garbage.  I was told by several people this one was really good.  WRONG.  One of the worst movies I've seen in years.  Complete garbage from start to finish.
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,A great rendering of the end of an epic story.
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,Ren stepping up and helping Ray
"Jan 8, 2020",negative,A big disappointment
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,An AMAZING ending to the franchise. could it be better? absolutely but it's not bad at all and has very exiting moments and I would say that just enough fan-service.
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,"I guess I must just be too easy to please, but I'm a huge Star Wars fan and enjoyed every minute of The Rise of Skywalker. Started out of the gate strong and did not disappoint for me. For those of you that just enjoy Star Wars, and aren't overly critical of movies, this is a must see."
"Jan 8, 2020",negative,It was just sad to see what they turned the star wars franchise into.
"Jan 8, 2020",negative,Very commercial and predictable. Not a good movie.
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,"'Rise' was clearly an attempt at a 'make up' with Star Wars fans.  For me, it did one important thing that the previous two films didn't: It gave our main characters time around each other.  The relationships between Finn and Poe and Finn and Rey never really clicked for me in those two first films.  They spent just a few minutes with each other and suddenly they were best buds.  Contrast that with the original trilogy, where those main three or four characters were constantly around each other and overcoming problems together.  Sure, Luke would jet off to Dagoba or be stuck on the Death Star at parts, but the others were always around each other.  To me, that allowed us to fall in love with the characters and be invested in them.  Can't say the same for Finn and Poe in TFA and TLJ.  However, this movie we got to see a little more interaction as well as a little more backstory on Poe - which was great.  They also did a better job of representing the Luke, Han, and Leia characters in this movie.  The previous movies didn't do their characters justice at all.  

In the end, it was a much more enjoyable Star Wars film than the first two of this trilogy, but it will always be weighed down by those two films.  Kylo/Ben and Rey were a great story and had great chemistry together, but I feel like the rest of the cast sort of got tossed aside."
"Jan 8, 2020",negative,"So, this is the conclusion of the SKYWALKER saga.  With that in mind this movie is a complete and total disappointment.  If you are only wanting a conclusion to this sequel trilogy, then you may be partially satisfied.  The problem with this trilogy and this movie is the obvious creative differences between directors and writers.  The fact that the original script for 9 didn't include emperor palpatine should tell everyone the problems going into this rather quickly.  With the OT cast being nothing more but campy dialogue that is restricted to repeating lines from their previous trilogy and essentially having less than a side role is another problem.  This is the skywalker saga concluding trilogy, and the skywalkers were barely a focus in it.  I could go over all the problems with this movie but I don't want to get too nit picky.  Essentially it was a cliche plot that you will already know what happens before you even walk in the theater.  

The movie felt like JJ went onto social media, wrote down all things the fans were pissed off about with 7 and 8 and put a check next to each item as the movie progressed.  
Rey origin: check
New villain: check
Snoke explained: check
Where is Lando?: check
Who are the Knights of Ren: not check but here they are doing there best to look awesome standing on cliff tops...

I won't even get into the sith way finders or the sith army, or the worshippers or....like I said, it is very hard to find anything to like about this movie.

I will say the trailer made me almost drop a tear during the C3PO scene.  When that scene came on in the movie I realized two things: every single person In the room when he says ""I wanted to look at my friends one last time"" that to either completely disrespected and ignored him the whole movie up to that point, and two this was his very first movie where 3PO actually had any interaction with ANY of those characters.  I mean Chewbacca was not even there....

Sorry, this movie just sucked...."
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,"Not a huge Star Wars fan, however it was a perfect ending to the saga. My husband loved it."
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker was a great movie! Lots of action and returns of previous characters that fill the story. I'd recommend it for all who watch the Star Wars saga.
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,Almost as good as the original movies.
"Jan 8, 2020",negative,"Horrible Lore knowledge by the writers. Very poor attempt to bring back a villain (somehow, the only threats in the universe are planet killing machines and Palpatine, for 9 movies). Obvious Mary Sue protagonist. Feels like a huge superproduction made by people who don't like what they are doing. Music: they ended the trilogy without the most iconic songs (duel of the fates, immolation, Anakin's dark deeds etc.). The choreography was appalling and childlike, unworthy of the franchise. A tiring movie with no plot nor anything that might help you swallow such nonsense."
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,"Fun, exciting and cool to see the old, familiar faces back in action."
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,"Overall, great fan service! Loved the movie but it was predictable to some extent!"
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,"To me this is a 65 out of 100. A solid starwars movie that sucks you into the story. There is things you want and don't get, but overall I liked it. How the franchise handled Cary fischer's death was very thoughtful. Not explaining how palpatine lived left plot holes but incorporating him into Rey's life was an interesting twist I didn't see. Worth seeing."
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,A charming conclusion to a long and successful franchise.
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,Definitely a whole lot of fan service but that’s it.
"Jan 8, 2020",negative,Disney - the cow has been milked dry...move on and never come back! 🐄
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,really enjoyed all the lightsaber fights
"Jan 8, 2020",negative,"After JJ Abrams set up multiple mystery boxes in The Force Awakens- to be answered in the next two films- Rian Johnson subverted everyone's expectations by painting Disney and the unfortunate director/scriptwriter(s) for episode IX in a corner. 

Rise of Skywalker attempts to correct the absolutely insane Last Jedi by shoving every piece of story and visuals in your face like someone shoving a firehose in your mouth. ""Don't actually think about this logically,"" says the movie, ""just look at all the things on screen!"". The movie is all over the place, sometimes literally, as it fights so hard to undo the sins of Last Jedi and come up with some kind of story that makes sense and finishes a saga that really should have ended in 1983. I don't blame JJ Abrams for this at all. He had nowhere to go and no options as Rian Johnson took every plot thread away in episode VIII. Where can anyone- even a better director than Abrams- produce a new threat, character development and arcs, and finish a trilogy in one movie? The answer is to shove so many visuals, throwaway lines of dialogue, and have so many things happen offscreen so your movie isn't 3 hours long and still doesn't answer the million questions that I have after watching this. As many have said, this movie should have been two movies at least- but that was impossible to do, as this was ""the end of the saga"". 
The only other frustrating thing that truly eats at me is the treatment of John Boyega in this film, let alone the franchise. Without spoilers, it is easy to see that there is something VERY SPECIAL about his character of Finn, and the movie alludes to it multiple- MULTIPLE- times, even where there is a scene where he is just about to reveal this very interesting thing. But then, the camera cuts away, because God forbid we have an intriguing plot point or a scene with depth. There is so much ground to cover to fix the trilogy to the point that too much is shoved in, not enough is explained, and the movie is begging you to just pay attention to the big budget visuals and not think critically about the plot or what is actually going on.
Overall, Rise of Skywalker is definitely better than the tragedy of Darth Johnson's Last Jedi, but it is forced to correct so many mistakes of the last movie, while being its own film, that there is nothing but a 2 1/2 hour video game cut scene mashup to finish this once-revered saga. It's over, and I hope it just stays dead this time- unlike Palpatine, I guess.
One last thing. Rotten Tomatoes, I don't believe that the real audience score is 86%. RT, you sold out. Shame."
"Jan 8, 2020",negative,Издевательство над франшизой. ужас
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,I had a pretty good time with this movie! I felt it was far superior to the Last Jedi! Without giving too much away... I felt that it did a nice job tying up the entire story!
"Jan 8, 2020",negative,it was just ok. All these years of fighting and she was still cried the entire movie.
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,it was much better than the last movie that came out. a fitting end
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,Hubby and son gave it a 7 out of 10. I fell asleep 20 mins into it...
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,"While it had a lot of fan service, it was still packed with action and amazing visual effects."
"Jan 8, 2020",negative,Totally fails as a sequel and totally fails as a stand alone movie. Awful way to finish an epic movie franchise
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,"An uneven mess of a film spoilers :

You start bringing dead characters back your taken away the threat and then you have a lead character Rey who doesn't resonate with the audience there no interest. Then you have the side characters that have nothing much to do . I have never been that bothered about a Stars Wars Trilogy since the prequels . At least The Mandorlain has shown us the way and there is a New Hope ."
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,It was not predictable...
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,Same old story. Some parts were a little hokey. Enough of Star Wars!
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,Going to see it again tomorrow
"Jan 8, 2020",negative,I thought it was only ok   They make Lea look like an elf.  I would have waited until it came out on dvd
"Jan 8, 2020",neutral,Palpatine Story Line is filled with plot holes.
"Jan 8, 2020",negative,total clusterfuck. so many side stories. feels like watching a video game. its a mess. a huge fucking mess. its better then the terrible last jedi but that dosent say much. it still terrible.
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,Great movie and I am not even a start war fan but I really enjoyed it
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,Maybe the best Episode of the franchise.
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,"If you love Star Wars, and I mean you actually enjoy watching the movies and not just fighting over ownership of it, then you should enjoy this movie. It's far from perfect; it's often a mess in fact. It's also not an abomination or a betrayal. It's a love letter to how Star Wars made you feel when you first discovered it. It's fun, at times funny, and it's meant to excite you. It's ridiculous, but it looks and sounds great, and it's an adrenaline rush from start to finish. 
Feel free to criticize what it gets wrong, and that's plenty, but it still gets more right, Simply sit back and enjoy it for what it is"
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,"Yeah, its convoluted, feels rushed, sometimes a little bit too much on the nostalgia side, all of that.
But I can't help myself: I enjoyed watching the movie. It's Star Wars, and it's ""very Star Wars"". That alone makes me like it for what it is. Besides that, the movie is very well crafted, and despite all the stuff that is going on, I think the writing is good enough to still make it work.
It's not the best Star Wars movie ever, and not some transcendental experience or something. But it is a fun movie, and a fun Star Wars movie.
Also...Adam Driver just nails it scene after scene. If you are a fan of Kylo Ren and Adam Driver's acting, you will love this."
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,"Non-stop action.  Lots of tie ins with previous movies, so some stuff might get lost or mean little if you haven't seen the originals."
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,it was ok. Nothing special
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,I’ve watched the Star Wars movies from the beginning. I had to see the last one. Been there-done that was the way I felt when I left the theater. I’m glad I went on $5 movie night. It was worth that.
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,Great end to the Skywalker saga!
"Jan 8, 2020",negative,"The force made Return Of The Jedi exciting. In The Rise Of Skywalk, the force made the story absurd."
"Jan 8, 2020",negative,This movie was such a mess and pretty much spent it's entire time trying to recon The Last Jedi
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,"I’m biased, I’m part Wookiee!!"
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,"The best possible conclusion to the primary Skywalker storyline that chronologically begins with Episode I: The Phantom Menance and through the Original Trilogy.  The parallel between the Skywalker name and the legacy of darkness come to a head in this film.  Although not perfect, it managed to conclude the sequel trilogy despite story progression issues from The Last Jedi.  With a better suited ""middle act"" film, this movie would have not suffered from the exposition issues it had to endure in order to close out this trilogy as quickly as it had to."
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,It was a little choppy but overall good.
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,"Awesome and great movie, as always!!!! 🙌🏾🙌🏾"
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,A grand finale to the Skywalker saga
"Jan 8, 2020",negative,The characters didn't even know what jetpacks are and act like it's something new and incredible like it has never been in star wars before... All I can say is oof
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,"Incredible movie full of surprises, passion and everything you’d expect from StarWars!! Awesome!"
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,"Really liked it. I’m not a huge Star Wars fan, I don’t really care for the Star Wars movies too much, but I really enjoyed this one. With Star Wars I always feel like it’s difficult for me to follow the storyline because I paid more attention to the graphics,I liked  storyline it was really easy to follow. I would say it may be in the top two of my favorite Star Wars movies I recommend it.probably not for your average geeky Star Wars nerd, but good for your average movie goer"
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,"Really great action with a story that brings it all together,"
"Jan 8, 2020",negative,Param de enganar o público! o filme é uma merda!!!! acabou com a trilogia!
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,It was all well written and well put together.
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,"Good action, likable characters, drama, plot twists. Some relationships aren’t fully fleshed out, obscuring motives behind the characters."
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,"Good story but somewhat frenetic pacing.   JJ directs well, but the writing sometimes falls flat - or delivers corney lines that make you roll your eyes.

overall though it's a fun time and a good end to the tale."
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,"The story is fun and exciting to see in some parts, but is far away from a good Star Wars movie.
They have take zero risks in the film, the fans want to see this to happen but it feels like the past of the saga doesnt really matter in this conclussion."
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,"This is an excellent movie, it made me cry multiple times, and I would watch it another 20 times if I could. You should definitely watch this."
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,"downright polarizing and stupid but had it good moments, save by the visuals a little."
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,What a great ending to an amazing saga!
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,I loved this movie even though I've seen few of the other Star Wars movies since the first few.  Dinner and a movie with girlfriends in our 60s.  So nostalgic with original characters.  Cameo with Carrie Fisher was so good that I looked up afterwards how they did it.  And does Rey become a Skywalker or go to the darkside?  Love interests were a plus+.  Good family movie.  I'm buying this movie on dvd when it comes out for my granddaughter.  I would watch it again.
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,"This movie is a breath of air compared to its predecessor. It's a shame that Disney couldn't and/or wouldn't have J.J Abrams pilot the directors chair for all three movies of the final trilogy. Sure there were some boring parts, and whatnot... but J.J had the unfortunate task of cleaning up Rian Johnsons mess that is ""The last Jedi."""
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,didn't like the ending.
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,"It was suprisingly enjojable ride, best of the newest trilogy. It was over-the-top, but redeems previous films."
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,I really liked this movie.
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,"It tied up a few loose ends, overall not as terrible as I heard"
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,"I really enjoyed the movie.

I went in with reasonably tempered expectations, having heard a bunch of conflicting opinions.  I enjoyed TFA and TLJ as well, for reference.

The biggest problem with the movie was that it felt rushed.  Like JJ Abrams needed to do a bunch of setup to get to the place where he wanted to be to start the third movie from, so he rushed through establishing a bunch of important stuff at a breakneck pace.  Like he tried to cram 2 movies' worth of stuff into one.  

The other big problem I felt was that there's this demonstrable escalation of powers from previous movies to this one.  These force-users are more superhuman than ever before.

There are some unresolved threads from previous movies as well as this one.

The plot sure had some leaps of logic and some ""just go with it"" required.

BUT all that stuff was in service of the heart of the story and in that, I felt like it did a great job.  The heart was in the right place.  The characters were handled well.  I enjoyed Kylo's internal struggle and journey.  C3PO was actually a fun character.  Luke had some redemption.  They handled Leia well.  At the end of the day, while I can poke holes in it all day, I enjoyed myself all the way through.  It gave me the feelings I expect and hope to feel when watching a Star Wars movie.  So I'm happy with it."
"Jan 8, 2020",negative,"Seemed like they had a check list of items they had to cover and crammed them all in at the last minute. But I'm sure Disney will get some toy sales out of it.
Too much, too late, awkward contrived scenes with a dead actress."
"Jan 8, 2020",negative,This Movie is not true Star Wars. Ludicrius Plot with many plot holes that have implication for past films. Was just fan service pretty much without a deep plot star wars would expect to have.
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,"Wraps up the third trilogy with lots of nods to previous trilogies, easter eggs, and cameos."
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,so sad it's the end. still unsure how Rey is granddaughter of the evil sith leader
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,Best with what was given. Although I would have loved to see 7 and 8 build up to this movie from the get go. Opportunity missed. I suggest wright out a trilogy before you shoot the movies. But what do I know!
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,My son and his absolutely loved this movie!
"Jan 8, 2020",negative,"bad as the rest of the last trilogy. To tell the truth, this one is the worst of all."
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,"Loved it! One of my favorites in the series. A couple things I didn’t quite understand but overall, I think it was awesome."
"Jan 8, 2020",negative,"Honestly, while watching the movie, I was asking myself if they got a wrong version which messed up the order of the scenes. But I had to admit that this is it... this is what ""modern"" top budget writing looks like. This happens, then this happens, then this happens, oh, this looks spectalular... Decisions? Questions? Reason? Depth? Nope. Don`t think, just enjoy blinky pointless images, that`s what this trilogy teaches us.
By the way, ex-stormtroopers are excellent Spacefighterpilots by default, and then ride into battle on horses (in space). Why? Disney, thats why.
To be fair, I fell asleep midway in, so I might have missed some steps. I`m sure they would have explained nothing.
Production, cgi and acting is ok. The editing and story is an insult to intelligence, rendering the former completely pointless."
"Jan 8, 2020",negative,"Full of plot holes, a full disrispect to the lore and to the original movies characters legacy.
the first 2/3 parts of the movie i couldnt even believe the amount of plot holes i found wile watching and the dumb logic they force in, to keep the trama going. the 3/3 part was the less disastrous but still i hope this movies never came out so someone else could done it at least with some logic."
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,"For this 70 year old who's followed the story from the beginning, this was a very satisfying conclusion to Lucas' hero story written broadly across the galaxy.   With the help of those who went before them, the compelling new characters bring this grand story to a rewarding conclusion."
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,"It was a nice movie, my nine year old son loved it."
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,Wonderful conclusion to the Star Wars Saga. The Force will live on!
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,More true to the storyline
"Jan 8, 2020",negative,"It was terribly fine. For the finale of a 30 year series of films it only succeeds in insulting the last jedi which was unequivocally the worst star wars movie of all time. This film is lukewarm in a really depressing way because the series had incredible potential going in after the force awakens. This movie just reminds you of what could have been. Disney would do well to learn from this mistake and just erase this like they did star wars legends from Canon. It's not worse than the last jedi or attack of the clones. But it is nowhere near return of the jedi or empire strikes back. It is convoluted, hard to grasp, and gives the audience no emotional attachment and takes away consequences of characters' actions. It was just fine and that is not a good thing for a star wars movie that caps off a trilogy."
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,J.J. Abrams gave exactly what fans wanted to see!! Pure gold. I’m going to see it again!! 
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,The weakest of the new trilogy but not bad.
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,Seemed like a rushed finale. It needs a complete re-write for it to become that blockbuster this should have been.
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,"Love it, what a great ending to the saga."
"Jan 8, 2020",neutral,"JJ was given shit and lemons after ""The Last Jedi"".
He took what he was given and made shitty-lemonade.
It is not a great movie....but it is a LOT better than part-2.

It is shitty lemonade."
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,They tried way to hard. Didnt have the spark of the original movies.
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,I like how the movie tied the series together bringing back pieces from the original movies. It was heart felt and kept me in the story.
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,"As a Star Wars fan its enjoyable and it was a good movie to end the saga, if you are not into Star Wars its not that great as far as movies go"
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,"The time has come to say goodbye. Well, sort of. After 42 years and nine films, the Skywalker saga has reached its end. Disney of course plans on releasing more trilogies and tv series so Star Wars is far from dead.  I have been a Star Wars fan since I was five years old. That's about 25 years for me and have continued to fall in love with it with every movie and series I see. In fact to this day, ""Attack of the Clones"" is still my all time favorite movie. With each movies release, my anticipation of my theater viewing is more exciting then any other film I ever want to see at the theater. But, here we are, just two years after ""The Last Jedi"" divided fans, which to this day, I still don't understand. I never saw what people see so wrong with episode eight. Yes, the film made some bold moves and choices, but so what. Rian Johnson was ballsy and took some risks and I think most of them payed off. No, I wasn't happy that we didn't get many answers and some of the explanations were kind of shuffled off, but all in all, in still had some great moments and will go down as another great installment in this incredible saga. Now returns J.J. Abrams to finish the trilogy that he started with ""The Force Awakens"". I was so glad when it was announced he would be returning because I only thought it was right for Abrams to finish the story that he started in episode seven. We finally get answers to our long standing questions as to who Snoke actually is, who Rey's parents and lineage is, and who has been pulling the strings all along. The film hits the ground running from the very beginning. We are treated to the return of Emperor Palpantine. I love the lighting at set design of Exogel, the planet where the Sith have been hiding along with the now zombie like Emperor. It sent chills down my spine when the fleet of hundreds of star destroyers rose from the ice. One classic line from ""Revenge of the Sith"" essentially explains how the Emperor is back. It was a nice callback but can agree that I would have like a little more explanation to his return. With a rumored extended cut on the way, we are hearing we may just get those answers. Anyway, after our great opening, we get a nice Falcon chase and get to see Rey training on the new planet for the Resistance base. I was very impressed to how Carrie Fisher was integrated into the film. Leia's scenes, although brief, still work in telling the story. Abrams and his team did a great job writing and filming scenes around the stock footage from the last two films.  As the film goes along, we are treated to many funny moments, most from C-3PO, and plenty of fan service and callbacks. Some people I know have had issue with the fan service but why? What's wrong with calling back to the classics that made the series what It is. All of the scenes with Rey and Kyle are so well done. Their chemistry is undeniable. Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver ooze so much appeal that even their intense eye stare downs have tension. That's something that pays off in the final act. Reylo fans got their wish, that's all I will say. There are many moments in the film that probably could have taken a few more risks including the fake out of Chewbacca's death. I really thought this might stick and thought it was very ballsy to do, but, it is undone. Chewbacca survives. I would have liked it more for the film to maybe have took that risk. As the film plugs along, I started piecing together to who Rey was, especially after force lightning comes out of her hands. There were rumors online for quite sometime who she might be and they happened to be spot on. I do like how after this whole saga, the Skywalker and Palpantine storyline becomes one. It made a lot of sense that Rey is who she is. There are so many moments where I got goosebumps throughout the film. I don't want to spoil them here but with a classic character return and an ending that sent chills down my spine, this movie gave me all the feels.  More great lightsaber and space battles, along with some great performances from Ridley and Driver, the saga comes to a thrilling and nostalgic conclusion that gives us plenty of callbacks and nostalgia that will put a smile on your face. It sure put one I mine. Thank you Star Wars for giving me a great 25 years and I look forward to the next 25 more with new films and series

Grade: B+"
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,"It fixes all the problems from the Last Jedi, and remains true to the spirit of the original trilogy."
"Jan 8, 2020",negative,"Spectacular visuals and action scenes do not overcome a mediocre story and poorer story telling.  The story sometimes jumps from one scene to another and you don't know what's going on or why.  I grew up on the original SW series, but every scene with one of the actors from the original series was lame.  The scenes with Luke were especially awful."
"Jan 8, 2020",neutral,It had a low bar to climb over. And it barely did. Solid acting from the leads wasted.
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,"Overall, I found the movie enjoyable.  I didn't leave disappointed but I was hoping for something a bit more original.  The scene progressions felt somewhat rushed but comes up short of becoming jagged or hoppy (see: Batman Vs. Superman for an example).  It's a fitting conclusion to a less-than-inspiring sequel trilogy."
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,"The ""final"" installment of the Skywalker Saga is well-worth the watch, so long as expectations are managed. Unfortunately, the Rise of Skywalker suffers from being attached to a weak link in The Last Jedi — a movie I recently re-watched and enjoyed much more than on my first viewing, but still hurts the overall plot of the final installments to the ennead. An example would be even hinting at Palpatine's ascendance earlier in the series than merely standing alone in the final episode. The long-run time doesn't flow as smoothly as expected and was choppy throughout. Some quality dialogue (and funny) and others were cringe-worthy — I know difficult with Carrie Fisher passing away, so not taking off for that. Finn and Rose (who apparently is still alive and well?) are not still a thing? And Finn gets potentially his third love interest in three movies? Finn's arc was always my least favorite and hurt the most from The Last Jedi. I know I'm going to sound like a hypocrite here because I had asked for more light-saber battles in the earlier movies, but… did we get too much light-sabering here? I thought Rey's arc was the most complete and entertaining, even if the writers botched her final line (which, I understand, would require changing the title). I hated what they did with Chewie — either kill-off a beloved character or let him escape, but don't do both, it's offensive to the audience. And although a tear came to my eye when the full resistance fleet appeared I couldn't help but wonder: Where were these motherfuckers during the past two movies?! All that being said, The Rise of Skywalker was an enjoyable experience — it's a space adventure, after all — and definitely worth seeing in theaters. I think it fits nicely enough as the center pillar between The Force Awakens (90) and The Last Jedi (78)."
"Jan 8, 2020",negative,"Dumpster fire of a movie on so many levels. Did not think itd get any worse after seeing Luke drink alien boobie milk in the last crappy movie. Ill never watch, rent or buy these new trilogy SW movies. Even to show my new baby. If I had never seen the original trilogy or the prequels, Id still think these new movies were garbage."
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,This one was as good as the first one!  Usually don’t get better than the first but The Rise is Skywalker comes very close. Loved it!
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,"Very, very good. Loved the Endgame feel to it (i.e. the nod to everything that's happened for the fans who've been there from the beginning). Thought JJA did an excellent job trying to pick up the broken pieces RJ left behind. The beginning was lightning-quick because of it, but that was fine. Was hoping for a Mandalorian tie-in, given the timeline of the show and movie's releases, but not a huge disappointment. The best of the third trilogy IMO, slightly behind ESB, ROTJ, and ANH (and maybe Solo - yes, I loved it)."
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,"Amazing wrap up to the Skywalker storyline. I want to watch it again! Top 3 Star Wars movie, hands down. "
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,Have seen now for the 2nd time.  Better seating.  Much better to take everything in!
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,It was better than Episode VIII.  Still left some loose ends.  Episode X by 2023....
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,It  was a great closure for the skywalker legacy.
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,It was awesome!!! Rae is an amazing action!!
"Jan 8, 2020",negative,"What i dont like the holl movie is crap from the first moment till the last is really the most bad made movie ever, the have make a joke from the franchise"
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,I loved it! It was easy to understand for non-fans as well.
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,It is a good movie.  I went in with high hopes and left without them.  I had hoped for something like IV or VI episodes and this wasn't close.
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,"Ultimately I was entertained and enjoyed the ending to this saga, but it was definitely my least favourite of the three. It was very linear, there were no offshoot storylines going on like there normally are in Star Wars movies, and I found the scenes pretty jumpy, like it was too fast paced and moved from scene-to-scene too quickly. I also found it pretty far removed from the other movies in the saga, like the other two could have almost not even been made for this one to exist. I also found the script to be very surface-level; there were a few too many one-liners for me and I found people spoke too fast in this movie somehow. 

That being said it was still an enjoyable and satisfying ending, I love all the main characters and was extremely happy to be watching them on the big screen again. So it could have been better, but I still enjoyed it."
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,Not a huge Star Wars fan but I did like this movie.  I love how they brought back the original cast into the story and that I didnt have to know all about Star Wars to follow.
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,Everything you need and want in a Star Wars movie!!
"Jan 8, 2020",negative,"The movie is allover the place. 
Nothing makes sence anymore so thank you for this disney"
"Jan 8, 2020",negative,I'm a lifelong SW fan and I could not find much to like about this movie. All the characters' arcs were regressed. Any personal growth they had made so far had been erased. The movie was rushed and the premise weak. The actors did the best with what they were given. I would have gladly waited another 2 years for a more satisfying conclusion to the saga.
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,Bringing back old characters and the whole storyline was great
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,Excellent end to the series!!!
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,"To put a bow on an epic begun 42 years ago is a difficult thing. The films last act, beginning with the last-ditch assault of the Resistance, has some heavy lifting to do. And yet, the script provides nice curtain calls and reasonable closure for characters from 4 through 9 that many of us have known all our lives. It invites us to think about all thats been accomplished by a film series begun all the way back in the pre-cgi world."
"Jan 8, 2020",neutral,"I will only say, that all involved with this film, had zero appreciation for the original films. A pity because (the first two original films) achieved quite a lot!"
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,"I laughed, I cried, and I felt like 40 year old story was given a satisfiying ending! The way the characters relationships grew and developed, was beautiful. The visuals were amazing! The writing cant hold a candle to the original trilogy but they make up with it through amazing casting!"
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,"I'm sad this was the last Star Wars, but it was all worth it in the end. This movie answered a lot of questions I had and cleared up things for me. loved this movie!"
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,"Enjoyed the movie it is a lot fun. But I understand people complaints, don’t let the negative comments stop you from watching a fun movie."
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,I thought this was the best Star Wars out the the newer SW series. Alot of light saber battles and very intense emotional moments! It definitely ties everything together well. Loved it! A must see for sure!
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,Great movie !! Deff a closure to the franchise.
"Jan 8, 2020",negative,"They attempted to correct the mistakes made in the previous two films of this trilogy but it still felt like the same story told over again, nothing new and certainly nothing inspirational."
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,Critics are clueless.  Perfect ending.
"Jan 8, 2020",negative,"A decent movie with a few nitpicks including Anakin's lightsaber activation button being wrong (maybe a result of it being rebuilt between movies) and remnants of the second Death Star even existing (watch the explosion scene in ROTJ and try to tell me that it was anything more than space dust after that). 

While this was not nearly as blasphemous as The Last Jedi, the inclusion of Palpatine is this movie's fatal flaw. I understand that JJ Abrams was put into a seeiously tough spot, both in story continuity and in satisfying the fans while still making a profitable movie. It seems like one of the best moves he could have chosen. 

That being said, the Palpatine plot completely undercuts the sacrifice of Darth Vader and the climax of Luke's journey in becoming a Jedi. Worse yet, Palpatine's survival is left to the viewer's imagination, as there is no explanation given (a common trend in this movie). 

Looking past this major disrespect to George's works, what is done in this movie is done either well or fast enough that one does not have much time to ask ""Why?"" in the moment. 

This movie is a spectacle but reveals its flaws upon closer examination."
"Jan 8, 2020",negative,"Retitle movie to ""Star Wars zoo"""
"Jan 8, 2020",neutral,"The movie is fun, so it works as a good entertainment.

However the poor decisions of the script spoil the experience as a whole; the producers should have continued the controversy, but brave decisions from the previous film.

In turn, the plot twist is horrible."
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,Plenty of twists to plot. You have to see it to believe it.
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,"The beginning of the movie seemed rushed, but I liked where they took the story."
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,Great way to end the saga
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,"Loved the action, visuals,and it had a really good story and I’m not even a Star Wars fanatic!"
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,"a good movie, yes...but as a final movie...i expected more."
"Jan 8, 2020",negative,"Marginally better than Last Jedi. Great special effects and action sequences hobbled by a contrived, disjointed, sophomoric plot. Seriously, this might have been written by two arguing eight-year-olds. So tedious that by the end I really didn't care who lived or died."
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,Great action scenes with a lot of loose ends tied up. Some of it is confusing and you must know the story line of the other 8 movies.
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,"It had many jaw dropping visuals with amazing shots and landscapes but after that it was mostly bland, that's not saying all parts were bad but were just bland. It also doesn't explain a lot that it really should have I wish it would have been longer so it could have explained itself and maybe would have had time to redeem itself."
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,Almost perfect ending to a fairytale Saga.
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,Fun movie and a worthy conclusion to the story.
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,It was good and worth seeing it for a second time. The story did seem to be rushed and left some opening for series expansion.
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,"I still remember seeing A New Hope in the theater way back in 1977. As a 4 year old it completely captivated me and introduced me to wondrous worlds and amazing characters. Over the years I have proceeded to see every Star Wars release in the theaters . While I enjoyed some more than others, I always loved the experience of being taken back to these worlds and getting reaquainted with the characters. Perhaps the best compliment i can give this film is it brought all these wonderful memories back to me and allowed me to spend a few hours catching up with some of my ""oldest friends"". For that I am grateful."
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,"A fitting conclusion to the Star Wars saga, Rise of the Skywalker is definitely worth watching. Although the story is not one of the best, the amazing battle scenes and the constantly mentioned connections to the previous Star Wars movies are enough to keep the viewers interested. This movie also provides all the answers to the baffling mysteries of the last two movies, so that's great too. There were moments when I was disappointed with the newly begun movies, but I think I'll miss Rey and her adventures."
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,I dont know why people are complaining about this film  movie was great.
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,I'm just a Star Wars geek in general so.......  There really wasn't anything I disliked about the movie but lots of things I did like.
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,"Great ""final chapter"" to an epic story. A genuine and meaning  interplay with the older and younger generation of Rebel freedom fighters. Poetic ending where the actors playing Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, Hans Solo and Lando Calrissian all make final appearances. It makes me want to revisit the entire series."
"Jan 8, 2020",negative,"Wouldnt see it again.. thats for sure, not even if it was free!"
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,"It was ok, not the best but ok!!! The actors don’t have the same energy the old characters HAVE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,Excellent SFX and cinematography. Huge show for eyes.
"Jan 8, 2020",negative,"The Rise of Skywalker, while ending the saga well, delivers a mediocre film that seems like a worse combination of Return of the Jedi and Avengers: Endgame. Despite its flaws, however, it it is still entertaining. Bad film, but at least enjoyable."
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,"Much better than what critics have you believe: I was in tears in the last scene: similar to one when Luke sees the two suns, one cannot but transport back to the first Star Wars. Brilliant closure, amazing cinematography, and solid acting. MUCH WATCH!"
"Jan 8, 2020",neutral,Watching this was like getting spit in the face by a hot super model. Your ok with it only bc she so hot. 
"Jan 8, 2020",neutral,For once I agree with the critics. The story is weak and the Jedis abilities are really inconsistent.
"Jan 8, 2020",negative,Я думаю это ужасный фильм
"Jan 8, 2020",negative,"The movie dragged on and on, with many unnecessary scenes and new characters."
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,"great movie, lots of fun"
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,High energy and very entertaining
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,Perfect ending to the saga! I'm not a line up to watch Star Wars kinda person but if I would've been for this movie. They pulled out all the stops for this one!
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,Very Good movie. The Movie didn't Flow easy for me. Loved the ending !
"Jan 8, 2020",negative,The second worst movie of the saga
"Jan 8, 2020",neutral,"As a huge star wars fan, I was looking forward to this movie in a big way.  There was so much potential for a great film. But it wasn't. It wasn't even mediocre.  In fact it was one of the most frustrating films I have ever seen, because it's recent predecessors were all incredible.
The Force Awakens was possibly one of my most unforgettable cinema experiences.  A new story, interesting characters that linked with the old.  
Rise of Skywalker however, is a messy journey where too much is unexplained and convenient accidents lead to unconvincing finds - a needle in a haystack just happens to appear when it is most wanted.
Fin has something to tell, but we never find out what it was.  The whole way through the film we are wondering but we never find out.  Yet we are left with a cheesy unsatisfying lazy conclusion after endless unrealistic CGI, flight battles and explosions.  
What happened to the slick genuineness of the sets from Force Awakens? This is why it feels lazy and rushed. 
I only gave it 2.5 because I am such a fan of the product but really it is worth less sadly.  Even the actors, originally so fresh and passionate, were unconvincing and looked as though they did not believe that the Force could hold itself together any longer."
"Jan 8, 2020",negative,"Contrived and nonsensical plot, bland characters, and mind numbing ""emotional"" scenes riding on the coattails of the original trilogy. All plastic wrapped with out of touch fanservice that is shoved down the viewer's throats."
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,"The final chapter of Star Wars was a very good watch. The graphics were excellent, the storyline was excellent. There was exactly the right amount of action (none of the 30 minute fight scene movie fillers).  The heroes were believable and well acted.  

Definitely see this one!"
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,lots of action and a good story
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,EPIC! Full of action from start to finish.
"Jan 8, 2020",negative,"Better than 8, but still horrible"
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,amazing end to this trilogy of movies
"Jan 8, 2020",negative,"Even before it is a bad Star Wars movie, it's just a bad movie. Worthy conclusion of an unworthy trilogy that, in three films, has limited itself to copying (even in an objectively ugly way) what is beautiful in the original saga. The direction is bad, the editing is even worse. Inconclusive and not received character thickness (adam driver is the only positive note). CGI in some moments definitely not up to par. There are some beautiful settings."
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,Great special effects.
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,J.J. should stick to Star Trek...
"Jan 8, 2020",negative,"This episode could have been amazing:
- Kylo Ren (Skywalker) on the dark side willing to return to light,
- Rey X. (Palpatine) in the light but tempted by the dark side,
- They are in love.

But instead of focusing the whole story on this, the scenario tells a story destroying any kind of poetry and mystery, and filled with inconsistencies.

If you have expectations on Star Wars, you should not go. If you are just looking for a big show with special effects, you will have fun.

May the force rest in peace :-)"
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,I loved it... it's rare for star wars to throw you a curve ball and keep you guessing. I cried twice!!!  I've never cried at star wars... except for when Han died. But awesome all the way
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,The storyline is confusing and unnecessary at times. Some points were so obvious it was like they asked a 9 year old where they should go with the direction of the film. The film score is great as always though and the star wars aesthetic is enough to get at least a couple stars. I’d recommend seeing it if you saw the recent films.
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,it was a great story to the saga. Lot's of action and it even made me laugh some.
"Jan 8, 2020",negative,I'm just glad this trilogy is over
"Jan 8, 2020",negative,Awful trash. At least we have the original trilogy.
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,"Rise of Skywalker rounds off the series, thrusting nostalgia at you and desperate to remind you of fonder times. It's not the perfect send-off, but it's still blockbuster fun. Doesn't quite reach for the stars enough."
"Jan 8, 2020",neutral,"As a Star Wars fan I have a few problems with it all together, as a movie man it’s a movie I enjoyed but not one to sit down and watch over and over again. Some scenes were very cringy and some scenes felt way to forced."
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,The writers tried their best to correct things from TLJ in the first half of the movie and for the most part they did a good job. Some parts are not explained well and can seem a bit rushed. The second half is great and overall it was entertaining and I'm glad they ended it this way.
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,It was an amazing movie. Everything is explained in the movie and people should really give this movie a chance
"Jan 8, 2020",negative,UNACCEPTABLE!!!! Biggest cinematic fuck up. Five minutes was all Disney needed to truly bury this franchise and it was the last few scenes of this film
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,Devastated its all over.....
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,"Mediocre, desperately tried to appease fans with yet another illogical script with way too much packed in"
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,Long movie. But lots of action. It ties up the series well I think.
"Jan 8, 2020",negative,"A runaway train wreck in a blinding strobe flash. 7 hours and 10 minutes ends in a blinding brilliant disaster. The worst crime of this movie is the tepid and utterly forgettable soundtrack by the incomparable John Williams, 2 hours of recycled themes that only remind you of better moments, of more compelling storylines, characters. Before the dark times. Before The Empire."
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,"Very dense with story but a very satisfying conclusion. Felt like Star Wars again after the bizarre revisionism of The Last Jedi. I’d rank it up there with Return of The Jedi, tied for third place after A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back. Some breathtaking set pieces and Rey and Kylo’s development were truly satisfying in this one."
"Jan 8, 2020",negative,they close door on me
"Jan 8, 2020",negative,The Fall Of Skywalker is a horrendous end to a legacy.
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,Amazing! Seeing it again
"Jan 8, 2020",negative,"After setting the stage with a charismatic young cast and a thoroughly exciting and entertaining action/adventure film with The Force Awakens, JJ Abrams fumbles the conclusion to the trilogy with a jumbled, sloppy mess of a movie in The Rise of Skywalker.  Lacking any real heart or substance, this one is primarily for the fans who only care to see people wacking each other repeatedly with laser swords."
"Jan 8, 2020",negative,Lots of unanswered questions that left the franchise off worse than it started. Quality action throughout the film but very frustrating to see so many things done wrong.
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,"I absolutely loved seeing the last of the star wars movies in 4DX!! There are a lot of flashes of lightning, flying around, and water scenes so this experience definitely made you feel like you were right there with the characters  My cousin also loved it and if it is offered again, I would like to take my dad who is also a HUGE Star Wars fan!"
"Jan 8, 2020",negative,Some entertaining scenes but the story is all over the place. Second half of the movie is pure fan service
"Jan 8, 2020",negative,Deserves the tomato. Bring a bunch
"Jan 8, 2020",negative,Unfortunately this movie is a complete miss. Only fan service makes its score for fans so high.
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,"Dragged out a lil too much and a bit too much drama, but otherwise had some really good parts to it. A must see for the end of the trilogy."
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,absolutely loved this movie!
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,Great ending to the Saga!
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,I absolutely loved it. cant get any better. Especially the ending. I'm ready for another one!!
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,Fitting ending to the series! It ended each of the characters stories in a respectful way! It have been a fun journey all these years and this was a great tribute to the saga!
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,"If you like Star Wars, you'll like this movie. Next to Yoda, Rae is the best character in the whole canon. And her relationship with Kylo Ren is interesting."
"Jan 8, 2020",negative,Crap ending to a crap trilogy.  I can't believe I now view the prequels as good movies.  Bring back George Lucas!
"Jan 8, 2020",negative,"Poor character development has plagued this entire series, and this movie was no exception. Nearly every major crisis was solved by deus ex machina. The only interesting conflict was resolved tidily by killing off the character that left no lasting conflict through an impossible resurrection. I could see the ultimate crisis and denouement coming from about 1/3 of the way in. The most exciting portion of the movie was the score."
"Jan 8, 2020",negative,"Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, was an absolute mess. This was supposed to be the Star Wars movie that wrapped everything up with a nice big bow, it was supposed to be the film that answered all if not most of the unanswered questions that we had since ""The Force Awakens"" and especially ""The Last Jedi"" but on the absolute contrary it left us with even more questions, questions that can't easily be answered. Furthermore the film was just piled with this and that and this and that, that it was very difficult to actually feel any sort of emotion when it came down to the emotional sequences, and if it did the film was extremely good at giving us merely 2 and half seconds to feel it and then BOOM! it would hit us with something else that would require the audience to feel an entirely different emotion and at some points I just wanted to tell the movie to ""wait!"" because of how fast it was going past every scene! However the action sequences were good but there could've been a lot more (by this I mean a lot more lightsaber duels, they really missed it on that part and it is unfortunate) The Rise of Skywalker is the movie that is supposed to wrap up the Skywalker Saga and that it did... with an atrocious wrapping job and a half-assed bow on the top."
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,its Star wars awesome
"Jan 8, 2020",negative,"With a lack of vision and guidance, the finale of the Star Wars sequel trilogy ends on a whimpering thud, wasting all the great performances and character potential on a confusing and convoluted story that is all over the place yet went absolutely nowhere."
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,Kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time. Sad ending ... but that's just my opinion.
"Jan 8, 2020",negative,"So much going on, so little substance. The story adds nothing to the Star Wars universe than cashing in on nostalgia and fan service. Even the widely-hated The Last Jedi broke more ground, was more worth watching. TROS is just a bog standard blockbuster."
"Jan 8, 2020",negative,"I have been a HUGE fan of Star Wars all of my life, and I am COMPLETELY disappointed with what Disney has done to it. I watched ROS and almost cried with anger at the end. The plot sucked. The characters suck. The writers should be beheaded for their blasphemy!"
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,Incredible everything as usual! Why was I crying my eyes out at Star Wars?! I loved it!
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,I enjoyed the film and the complete overlook of The series
"Jan 8, 2020",negative,The whole movie was written and ran like a poorly concocted D&D campaign. I love star wars but that film was a travesty.
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,What I love about the movie ren skywacker
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,"Go with modest expectations and accept a crazy number of plot conveniences... and then you'll enjoy this movie quite a lot! Thanks, JJ Abrams and team. This was so much better than I ever expected it could be!"
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,"I loved this movie. The finale was great because it worked on both a conceptual level and also used the characters Kylo and Rey quite well.

The biggest problem for me is the use of Emperor Palpatine which wasn't handled properly in episode  7 and 8 and thus came out of the blue in 9. Overall though. I thought it was a great move."
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,It’s a bittersweet moment for me to finally see this storyline come to a end growing up watching the original trilogy. All in all happy with the outcome and def give it 5 stars.
"Jan 8, 2020",negative,"As a life-long Star Wars fan, it’s heartbreaking to see a group of creative people that have such a poor grasp of the source material. Felt like imposter Star Wars."
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,Classic JJ Abrams action-pack movie...but the heart and soul of Star Wars seemed to have lost its way in this final episode. I wanted to feel the struggle between the good and dark sides of the force as in the first 3 original episodes...but it just wasnt there. Even the light saber duels seemed too choreographed and soul-less.
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,"Movie was great. I enjoyed it from start to finish. The pacing was good, it had a lot of action. I couldn't find anything bad with this movie. I might watch it a second time"
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,i felt they ended the series well... but left enough to make more in different directions
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,my favorite scene was actually Chewbacca grieving.  very touching.
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,it was an excellent movie
"Jan 8, 2020",negative,"Not impressive, boring at times, a fitting end to a trilogy doomed to fail from the start. "
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,"The Last Jedi was a spit in the face to all of us Star Wars fans. The Rise Of Skywalker cleans our face from that spit and gives us a kiss on the cheek by retconning some of the major insults done by The Last Jedi. 

While it's a satisfactory field to watch, it sadly had to spend a bit of its running time trying to fix the errors of the previous movie. The movie is action packed, it will fly by you if you blink, it certainly could have used some ""slow"" scenes, perhaps it should have been split into 2 parts.

The movie feels like Star Wars, The ending could have been handled a little better and while it doesn't add anything particularly new, it sure doesn't feel as recycled as The Force Awakens.

Overall, a good movie, by far the best of the sequel trilogy but sadly, a shadow of what the grandeur of original and prequel trilogies."
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,"I liked multiple individual sections, but it didn’t seem to work as well as a whole, movie or trilogy."
"Jan 8, 2020",negative,Complete cluster. A middle finger to TLJ. Plot holes as big as the death star. Maguffins galore. Some cool visuals and new force moves made it bearable. Zero stakes. A bummer of a way to end the saga.
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,it was a great movie
"Jan 8, 2020",neutral,"I watched this twice because I had to see it in both Dolby and Imax with the new laser projection. The latter was better visually, with the exception of those moments where 3D appears to be a total afterthought. Rogue One remains the only film since Return Of The Jedi to offer an enjoyable story. So very glad that my drive to see anything else Star Wars has concluded with this trilogy."
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,"A lot to hate about it but it was a very Star Warsy Star Wars movie, I liked it."
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,Loved everything about it
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,"42 years later, and after seeing the original Star Wars in 1977 (15 times I might add)  I consider this to be a satisfying finish to complete the Star Wars saga.  Dont believe the dissatisfied reviews,  another job well done by JJ Abrams!  We absolutely loved it."
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,"I think it was a great movie, given what JJ has to work with."
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,It was a great movie that incorporated characters from the previous Star Wars movies very well.
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,I love the storyline and the effects were as great as always. I thought it was a perfect ending to the series and highly recommend seeing it!
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,"New character development was very well done.  The movie did not require watching any of the others to understand what was going on.  Still have a lot of questions, but that is what makes it an epic story."
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,"I enjoyed it, but with an asterisk

Rian Johnson's Star Wars: The Last Jedi (2017) is a mess at both a structural and thematic level; it spends 40 minutes on a side-quest that has nothing to do with the rest of the film; Holdo (Laura Dern) withholding her plan from Poe (Oscar Isaac) makes no sense; Luke (Mark Hamill) throws away his lightsaber (to hell with that scene); Hux (Domhnall Gleeson) becomes comic relief; there are resurrected flying space Jedi. And so we have Rise of Skywalker, which is a course correction if not a flat-out apology. And although I certainly enjoyed it as a spectacle, it's a deeply flawed film that feels like it was created by a computer algorithm designed to tick as many boxes as possible.

The opening crawl reveals that Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) has returned, and has been manipulating events from behind-the-scenes for years. As the film begins, Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) is making his way to Palpatine's base. Seeing Palpatine as a threat to his leadership of the First Order, Ren is planning to kill him. However, rather than doing so, he watches in awe as Palpatine reveals a massive armada of hundreds of fearsomely powerful Xyston-class Star Destroyers. And so, the Resistance set out to confront and defeat him.

Directed by Force Awakens director J.J. Abrams, with a script by Abrams and Chris Terrio, the biggest problem with Rise is that at no point does it feel like the culmination of a nine-film arc. Not only is there a disconnect between the three films in this trilogy, but there's a disconnect between this trilogy and the previous two, with the trilogy never really feeling like a valid continuation of the story. At best, it feels like a spin-off, with thematic connections and recurring characters occasionally shoehorned in to try to establish narrative continuity.

Of course, a big question is whether or not Disney had a specific narrative plan going into this thing, with many arguing that the lack of coherence between the three films proves they did not. Especially important here is the return of Palpatine, which has been accused of being completely arbitrary. I can certainly sympathise with those sentiments, and I agree that his return negates Vader's sacrifice at the end of Return of the Jed (1983). However, there were hints in Force Awakens that there was a hidden big bad, and that that big bad was Palpatine, although to explain any more would constitute spoilers for Rise.

There are also smaller issues with the film. For example, it treats death less than reverentially, with multiple characters dying, only to return in some form or another, which cheapens and undermines the sense of risk. The quartet of main characters also remain as insipid as ever – Rey is still a reluctant Jedi trying; Finn (John Boyega) is still a token good guy who used to be bad; Poe is still Han Solo-lite; Ren is still a moody emo. The biggest problem is that the film is built around the Resistance trying to get to Palpatine's base. To do so they need a Wayfinder, but to get that they need this other thing, but to find that they need to go here, but to do that they need a doohickey, but to get that they have to...you get the picture.

For all that, however, I enjoyed Rise for the most part. Abrams and cinematographer Dan Mindel shoot the scenes in Palpatine's lair like it's a horror movie – deep chiaroscuro shadows, ominous caverns disappearing in the background, unnaturally powerful lightening flashing from above. Equally important here is David Accord's sound design, which features a constant chatter of unearthly and disembodied voices, like a thousand ghosts whispering at once. 

The scenes showing Rey and Ren speaking via Force Dyad are also excellent, as we see the background of one character's location appearing behind the other character, with the backgrounds shifting from one to the other as the scenes play out. A lightsaber fight makes particularly good use of this, with events in one location having an unexpected effect on events in the other.

So, all things considered, I enjoyed The Rise of Skywalker and found it a vast improvement over Last Jedi. However, having said that, it never touches greatness, with everything feeling workshopped and focus-grouped to within an inch of its life. It looks great, and it's both exciting and entertaining, but it's also safe and predictable. And sure, you might say that fans rejected Last Jedi because it took too many risks, and now they reject Rise because it doesn't take enough, and there's probably some truth to that. But the fact is that it just never feels like a closing chapter. I enjoyed it whilst I was watching it and it's a decent enough Star Wars movie, with some terrific individual scenes. But as the final entry of a 42-year-old franchise (the most popular franchise in any medium in human history), it is, perhaps inevitably, a little disappointing."
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,"I loved the movie especially watching it in 3D! I loved the way it closed out the Star Wars story and I am hoping to see Rey, Finn, and Poe continue."
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,"Rey develops her newly discovered abilities with the guidance of Luke Skywalker, who is unsettled by the strength of her powers. Meanwhile, the Resistance prepares for battle with the First Order.

I will admit I am wired with a with the sense of melancholy sensibilities. I lost track of how many times i wiped a tear while watching Rian Johnson's film. But I'm sure I also laughed hard just as many times, if not more. It is in general mind-blowing, it is emotional and it is filled with surprises. The Last Jedi really manages to keep the Star Wars spirit while being innovative on many fronts. Nothing can prepare you for the emotional ride it takes you on. It's a truly epic journey.

Star Wars: Episode VIII had some amazing set pieces. Wonderful cinematography and special effects. the 3D presentation added to the film. The fabulous film score from the greatest film composers of all time, John Williams as splendid.

The acting from Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher are sublime. Tapping into my sense of nostalgia for Star Wars Saga. Daisy Ridley as Rey tremendous. Johnson eloquently deepens his characters in the story long, long ago in the galaxy far, far away. Adam Driver is welcome strength returning as the Dark Side Force's Kylo Ren. The other narrative threads are often perfunctory in the subplot with Resistance fighters Finn, played by solid John Boyega, Poe Dameron, played by intrepid Oscar Isaac, and Rose, played by stellar newcomer Kelly Marie Tran. And how does't like Benicio Del Toro ? Fantastic !

The Last Jedi is clever, well-tailored and genuine. Heroes and villains, and those who are somewhere in between. Rian Johnson created a beautiful tale a filmed it with stylistic brilliance and terrific pacing. From the excellent cinematography, snappy dialogues and first rate music, The Last Jedi makes you feel overwhelmed and fills you with odd admiration for the story that is being conveyed. 9/10

"Jan 8, 2020",positive,"Was thrilled with the action sequences. Great Cast. Not great storytelling not too thrilled how it ended either. Some stuff felt forced in order for JJ Abrams to course-correct. Still good enough to watch it in the theater, though."
"Jan 8, 2020",negative,Bringing back the Emperor destroyed the original trilogy and adds nothing to the Disney trilogy.  The new force powers cheapen everything about the prior trilogy’s and show how laziness has replaced good story tellingly Lucas films.  I tried to like the new trilogy from day one but have been disappointed at every turn.  I wish I could wash it out of my consciousness and forget what I’ve seen.   Alas Star Wars has become a thing of childhood and as an adult you mast put away childish thing.  On a side note why the emperor why didn’t Snooke reveal to Ren that he foresaw his betrayal and substituted a clone and further reveal himself as Darth Plaugus instead of ruining the original trilogy?  I wouldn’t hire writer so inept again if I wanted to make a good movie.  Just a thought.
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,Didnt like the ending.
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,"It wasnt good. it wasnt bad. no real plot. it is what I guess. 

There was enough of the original characters to keep you interested. 

it was too long. there were a couple times I thought it was ending but It kept going. 

I went to see it  after the hype and with low expectations and I found it entertaining enough. 

Im Glad to see this trilogy and characters come to an end."
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,"The non stop action was fantastic. Great ,movie all around. Never a lull."
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,"It was good to see Poe, Rey, and Finn back together again but they spent a little to much time bantering and not enough strengthening their friendship. Dialogue was pretty good and I liked the various arcs going on. However, those arcs felt too rushed because the movie had too much crammed in  - material that should have been in Episode 8. This leaves the feeling of ""Oh, this movie has so much more potential..."" 

This sequel trilogy should have been better planned and layed out. However on the grand scale of ten movies - 1  being best -  I'd say this is number 4 or 5."
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,Last Jedi sucked. This is an improvement.
"Jan 8, 2020",negative,meaningless ending of a nonsense trilogy. the only goal to destroy heroes of the past and destroy a story of the most popular movie series of all time. all episodes IV-VI are pointless now. same turd as Terminator Dark Fate.
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,Loved it !!! Rey is amazing as the hero
"Jan 8, 2020",negative,"Disney has now officially killed Star Wars, RIP"
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,everything was great.
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,"If you didn't like The Last Jedi, you might like this movie.  It tries to explain why Rey is a super Force-user, why Luke was acting like a grumpy hermit on the island, and why the Holdo maneuver doesn't defy the physics of a galaxy far, far away.  It brings Rey, Chewie, Finn and Poe together instead of keeping them apart like they did for the first two movies.  Poe and Finn have good chemistry together in a bromance type of way.  Reylo fans will like parts of the movie and absolutely hate other parts.  If you are a Rose fan...well there isn't much for you in this movie.  The film is super fast paced and half the time I wasn't sure where they were and what was going on, but it wasn't boring.  Lando looks great and they did a good job putting the late Carrie Fisher into the movie.  I can understand why some fans see this movie over and over.  It was like two movies worth of scenes shoved into one movie.  It is a lot to take in. Overall, it is my favorite of the sequel trilogy."
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,Amazing.  Worth seeing in the theatre.
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,"Repeats itself? Yes. Not making drastic changes to the universe? Yes. But what can I say, I enjoyed It, and that's enough. I wasn't expecting to see a life changing movie, overall good movie if you don't have high expectations."
"Jan 8, 2020",neutral,"Meh, spent the first half of the movie fixing the mistakes from TLJ and as a result felt rushed"
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,Was pretty dedicated to the Star Wars  ideals but there was a couple of things that disappointed me....which unfortunately I cant say without posting mega spoilers so. Im going cryptic on this...someone shouldnt have died and even if though they did....at least have the decency of honoring them at the end.
"Jan 8, 2020",neutral,"Typically Disney movie.  The franchise was destroyed the moment Disney bought it.  Oh to be 12 years old and view Star Wars fresh again. But it’s 2020, not 1977."
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,"Special effects were incredible ... storyline was good but slightly predictable at points along the way ... Overall, worth seeing."
"Jan 8, 2020",negative,"Aside from looking the part, this is devoid of everything that makes Star Wars great."
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,I liked how they brought it full circle
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,Another Star Wars movie... entertaining but not great for the last one of the saga
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,It stayed to the whole saga!
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,"Loved it, for the most part."
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,"Loved this movie!  As last one it completed the circle of stories and was great to see the characters from the past appear in this last movie. All the good stuff was there: the strengths of the characters, their loves, determination, humor, and music."
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,I grew up with this saga-an amazing end to an incredible journey
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,Huge Star Wars fan. Lived up to the expectations
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,Excellent very entertaining and the special affects were fantastic.
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,I thought they did a really good job of wrapping up the saga.  There are some parts that were not my favorite for the saga.  I really like how they finish the movie.
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,Loved it! J.J. wrote this just for me!
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,Did not enjoy how it was wrapped up. Why not just call it Return of the Jedi 2.
"Jan 8, 2020",negative,"Rough ending and sporadically pulled together, but at least it's over."
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,Great way to end the saga
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,"Extremely exciting, perfect end to the trilogy and the saga as a whole, especially for newer fans."
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,"Nice twists, would have liked Ben to survive though!"
"Jan 8, 2020",negative,"More of the same, and not in a good way. n No imagination. Nothing different. It's as if they wanted to just play it safe. Such a shame considering the talent level of the cast."
"Jan 8, 2020",negative,Ok better than Last Jedi but just ok
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,Very good end to the franchise! Don’t believe the bad reviews. Some just love to hate
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,"Very well done film.  it should stand up well among the other Star Wars movies in the series.
Overall, the story didnt end all story lines for all major characters.  Some were open-ended.   
It was nice to see all the major characters worked into the final story of the series.  Luke, Leia, Han Solo,  Landau.  Would have been good to see Yoda, Obi-Wan, and Vader.   it was weird for Rey to end up on Luke's home world , and claim his familiy name.  
I love the movie."
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,just a few problems but best of the last three
"Jan 8, 2020",negative,"Worst from the new trilogy, didn't care about what was happening or why it happened. Just stick with the originals"
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,So much to wrap up - I’m going to have to see it again.  It was “Star Wars”.  How could you not see it !!
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,"Awesome from the start...had to use the bathroom halfway thru but, held it cause i wasn't going anywhere. J.J. Abrams is a genius....george lucas thank you for star wars."
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,"Familiar faces come back, some classic faces also.   A few faces are lost.    All in all, nicely dramatic, cohesive story, stellar special effects and, what most fans wanted--closure at the end."
"Jan 8, 2020",negative,"Even with the extremely low bar that TLJ set, RoS still somehow managed to limbo right underneath it. Contrived, aimless, and plot holes galore. A fitting end to a forgettable, poorly constructed trilogy."
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,"Not the best of the 9 movies, but not the worst either"
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,"The Rise of Skywalker was a phenomenal end to what is arguably the greatest sci-fi saga in existence at this time. While the story does jump around and moves quite quickly, it sets itself up very well to wrap up the saga. The acting is quality (regrettably, it is evident that the late Carrie Fisher has been created through technology), and it is a fitting tribute to General Organa, Han Solo, and Luke and the Skywalker story. While I do not think we will see another Skywalker on this level, I do feel that their story has been told to completion. A must-see, for sure!"
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,There won't be any more
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,Great end to the saga
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,it was very emotional at times.
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,The end of a great saga!
"Jan 8, 2020",negative,"It's a watchable, non-sensical train-wreck of a movie that tries to undo the damage of Last Jedi, but in doing so crams giant plot twists in a span of minutes. Some of the scenes and settings look cool, but it's marred by a needlessly bloated plot that has the cast zipping across the galaxy chasing Mcguffins. Adam Driver's acting is top-notch, but it's not enough to force-revive this meandering mess."
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,"This was a wonderful way to end the series of films. Questions were answered. We were able to reunite with old friends and revisit familiar lands. There were tears and laughter, moments of despair and delight, an abundance of ""the force,"" the honor of sacrifice, and bonds of love. Rey was phenomenal."
"Jan 8, 2020",negative,"Terrible.... worst star wars movie ever. Placating to nostalgia, jumping from scene to scene without a tangible story or related foreshadowing, and extremely predictable ending meant for the simplest of the masses."
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,It’s my favorite out of the last three star wars films. Good ending to the trilogy.
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,Enjoyed it!  It was more like the first ones!
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,The ending with a twist!  The movie was great!
"Jan 8, 2020",negative,"A completely baffling, cobbled together highlight reel of a first-draft script after being brutally hacked to death in the editing room and fed through a series of corporate boardroom filters. Utterly devoid of genuine creative inspiration or coherent thematic through-line, let alone of basic narrative construction or pacing."
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,Good effects and good story too
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,"Tied up the 9 story arc nicely, fantastic action"
"Jan 8, 2020",negative,This just really really sucked
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,"Ridley's performance is so good it tacks on a star on its own. She's a force to be reckoned with (PUN!) and I had the feels several times through it. Yes, it could have been better in a bunch of ways, but I was satisfied."
"Jan 8, 2020",negative,"There were plot holes big enough to make me think it was a black hole. Then again, after 10 movies you would think they would know how to write a script but no they still don't."
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,This movie was done very good. Hope there will be another one
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,JJ Abrams did much better in this film than Rian Johnson did in The Last Jedi. The Rise of Skywalker really felt like you were watching a true Star Wars movie.
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,This was a  first rate movie.  Anybody who didn't like it is being picky.
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,"good conclusion to many questions. 
brought up a few more questions."
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,"So awesome, was on the edge of my seat the whole time!! Saw it in 3D IMax, quite a special experience."
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,This was the culmination of one of the best stories ever told! Well made and well played by all.  Wonderful final to a series that has changed my life for over 40 years!
"Jan 8, 2020",neutral,"decent movie overall, the pacing just felt off, almost like they cut important parts out of the movie lol"
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,I wasn't disappointed.
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,could of went on long into more detail
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,"What a beautiful mess! The film was beautifully made, and the effects are fantastic. What's not so great is the film felt like it was in ten different places at one time. The actors were great and it was nice to see some of the old faces come back for cameo's. There was a lot of emotion in the acting, and Daisey Ridley was superb.  The worst part of the movie was the editing I felt like I was on a barrel ride and I couldn't get off. I expected more from JJ Abrams, but I will say the ending was perfect! Grab your popcorn, but don't expect the Empire Strikes Back, which is still the best of them all."
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,"Awesome, fast paced story with THE perfect ending!!"
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,"Yes, it was fast paced and there was lots of fan service, but I loved it! I think it was very well done and a great close out of the trilogy and the Skywalker saga as a whole."
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,It was a little painful to see the old characters die out in the last couple of movies but the new characters hold promise.  There was lots of action and the usual great special effects.  Long live Palpatine or is that Skywalker?
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,Everything we've been waiting to see. Ticked all the boxes for a classic Star Wars adventure and then some! Loved it!
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,Being a younger generation (24) Star Wars fan I really enjoyed this movie not my favorite but pretty dang close it ended very well I thought!!!
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,Fixes everything the last movie did wrong.
"Jan 8, 2020",negative,Plot best described as stupid.
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,"A vast, engaging conclusion to not just the Sequel trilogy but the Skywalker Saga itself, TROS blends the perfect amount of  riproaring adventure, character building and even nostalgia to weave a compellingly brisk film with action, emotion and intrigue. Can't wait to see it again!"
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,Better than Empire TLJ sucks JJ saved the saga rip poggers roflcopter
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,Great conclusion to a great fr@nchise.
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,Maybe it’s because I was expecting not to like it based on reviews. But I actually enjoyed it. Don’t over analyze it and just be entertained.
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,it was okay.  a lot of dead people rising again.  many battles won with insurmountable odds.     I'm glad to have it finished at last.
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,What a beautifully done movie. It tied everything up in a beautiful package! I wanted to stay and watch it again. A wonderful ending to a series of movies I have watched all my life.
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,"I enjoyed the movie. I'm a die hard for the original series, so I try not to compare too much. The story was good and the CG wasn't too overwhelming, but be prepared for A LOT of flashing lights and fast camera action.  My eyes were burning after the first 15 minutes.  I'm always impressed with the creativity of all the different worlds and characters.  All in all, worth seeing whether you're a fan or not."
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,"Considering the last two sucked, great way of tying everything together and closing out the saga"
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,Everything you could want and then some
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,"The movie was good and stayed true to the franchise but I felt it was somewhat of a confusing plot to follow.
The movie jumped around and was a little draggy in spots. But all in all it kept the audiences interest and attention throughout the movie."
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,People gave this movie bad reviews because they didn't understand all is it I think
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,Such a great movie!!!
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,Not what I expected but a really good movie nonetheless.  Whole family loved it.
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,Fitting end of the saga
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,Awesome movie!  Loved it!
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,loved the movie but the end made it seem like they're going to continue with Rey's story.
"Jan 8, 2020",negative,"To much like the first set of series. I kept drifting off asleep. Movie couldn't hold my attention. Nothing new, same old stuff. Was expecting something new. Boring."
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,"Loved it, but I am still a SW fan since 1976! Good story, good acting. I likes that they cleared up the big mystery, but left us hanging on one or two others."
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,Love Star Wars! What can I say. It is legendary movie already for many years. Was really enjoying to see another episode with my son. Recommend.
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,This was one of the best and the action was nonstop from the beginning.
"Jan 8, 2020",negative,Wish the real version was out. Not Frankenstein version we saw.  Disney completely destroyed the saga.  Somehow they managed to make something worse than the prequels.
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,Quite honestly it’s become my favorite Star Wars movie. Bumping rogue one into my number two spot.
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,This movie was awesome can’t wait for more from Star Wars
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"It was awesome. These critics liked The Last Jedi and didn’t like this one. Man, critics these days are out of touch. I’m going to see it twice in IMAX."
"Jan 7, 2020",negative,What just happened? Is rey god yet?
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"Great movie. Shout out to Adam Driver. Semper Fi, brother!"
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"Loved it! Hope to see a Ben spin-off of some sort down the line, as his scenes were by far the most compelling throughout the trilogy."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,Loved everything about this movie
"Jan 7, 2020",neutral,The main problem with this film was trying to squeeze too much into one movie.  It lessened any drama or thrills when the characters were pulled from one scene to the next with barely any pauses or interaction. Also all the changes made to how Force powers worked from previous stories was pretty hard to swallow.
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"This movie was better than the other two so far. It was fun to watch. Should Kilo have kissed Ray.....i personally don't think so, but hey its cool seeing new uses for the force. Yea it was really plot armor but force heal and animal friendship are rad Jedi powers. The fact that they brought back the emperor  off screen and killed him by making him shock himself again was something but still I had a fun time."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"As a long time fan of Star Wars, this film is a mixed bag. As a film on it's own, it's still less approachable than the films prior, as it spends a great deal of time trying to explain or rectify plot points from past films."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,It was a fitting conclusion. I hated the prequels. They made me grow up and move on from star wars. These last 3 films were much better but still lacking the charm and magic of the original trilogy. That being said I really enjoyed the cameos. seeing the x wing rise from the sea and a lando piloting the falcon again....I had some serious childhood flashback moments that made me happy cry. Was it perfect? Hell no!  But out of the last 3 episodes it is my favorite.
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,I thought it was a fun movie that the entire family would enjoy.  A lot of action and great special affects.  Kept moving with some exciting moments.  Several very touching scenes.  Go see it.
"Jan 7, 2020",negative,"so boring. it's the same storyline, they just changed the characters and names."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,40 years in the making
"Jan 7, 2020",neutral,"Same song, different verse"
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"I really liked this movie, which surprised me, because I am not a Starwar fan.  There were some slow spots but I still enjoyed it"
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,i wanted my force ghost hayden christensen!
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,Stayed true to the original heart of the Star Wars movies. Full of emotional connection. Loved the movie!
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"Compared to the other Star Wars movies, it was above average. Great acting, good plot and enjoyable action scenes"
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,Sad that’s it over but a great movie.
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,It was ok but not like i thought
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"A very watchable mess of a movie!! Not bad, but not amazing either. So many plot holes and unexplainable issues. Had some cool moments and looked nice on the plus side."
"Jan 7, 2020",negative,"The best of the worst saga ever. 
All the movie feels rushed terribly, the actos are just chatting among them the obvious ""linear choices"" And they end up looking clueless and stupid. There is no development of any of the characters (total waist of talent of some actors) and not even with all the Easter eggs, and the endless plot holes they tried to cover, the story is empty and without flavor. Fights are terrible (like little kids swinging sticks) and no logic on any of the story. Better than the previous one, but still very bad."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"Good  movie, expected more."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,The movie was fabulous. Seats were very comfortable.  No one talked. In fact I have seen the movie twice now.
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,Everything was awesome!
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"Checklist of things to finish, ticked."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,Fabulous to the end✨✨✨
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"This final segment of a 40 year saga was a good character driven movie.  It finalized the story of the Sith and the Jedi.  Rather than the CGI and FX being the focus, the story and the characters were the focus.  I thought it was as good as the first three."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,We loved it. It kept our attention the entire time and it was action packed.
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"Very entertaining.  Excellent film production.  Let's blow up some more battle cruisers!  Great effects.  Most storylines concluded well.  However, could it be, I felt they left plenty of room for ANOTHER sequel!  Oh yeah, les I forget, Daisy Jazz Isobel Ridley is sooooo hot!"
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"Spectular film, thank you J.J. Abrams!"
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,The coloring was boring.
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"broght 9 episodes to a conclusion, that and I've waited 9 episodes to have that one light saber fight and it was finally delivered!"
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"Rey, granddaughter to the evil Emperor.   Didn't see that coming.  The unexpected will always make a movie interesting and entertaining."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"Great closIng to the Skywalker (Rey) trilogy. Few over zealous characters but overall, great storyline!"
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,Slow in the first half. Better in last half. Cant compare to the magic of the first 2 trilogies.
"Jan 7, 2020",negative,"The plot was very rushed and didn't make any sense, there was a lack of emotion in the plot which was substituted for special effects."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"Have seen this twice now in the theater and enjoyed it both times. It's fun, exciting, good humor (C-3PO strikes again with several great lines), lots of tie-ins and references to previous films and other Star Wars universe people and places, etc. Does it's best to fix the frustrations from Episode 8. Solid film all around."
"Jan 7, 2020",negative,"It has a hundred plot holes and a very messy script. I thought that The Last Jedi was going to be the worst Star Wars movie of all times, but this one is even worse. It is nonsense after nonsense. The Disney trilogy murdered Star Wars."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"40 años, 9 Películas y 3 trilogías para completar la saga Skywalker! Y quizá dejarla así como esta! JJ Abrams hizo lo que pudo con una historia que ya iba en picada tras #TheLastJedi | En este episodio 9, se llega a la culminación contestando las 2 preguntas que todo mundo tenía 1) De donde viene Rey? y 2) Que pasara con Kylo? ... quizá pueda ser que te gusten o no las respuestas...Algunas de estas respuestas dejan otras preguntas, pero bueno, no se puede todo en 2hrs. En cuestión de acción y emoción NO se iguala para nada a #TheForceAwakens o #RogueOne por ejemplo pero si es una ligera mejora sobre #TheLastJedi ... No me gustaron algunas escenas con Poe y un personaje nuevo y no siento que nadie se encariñe con otro personaje como lo hicimos en su tiempo con BB-8 on con lo que esta pasando con Baby Yoda. En general, pudo haber sido mejor pero también te deja como que satisfecho, no lleno, pero con lo justo satisfecho. 7.5/10"
"Jan 7, 2020",negative,"To be fair, this film was doomed once the Last jedi was made and it never had a chance. But still, it did not have to ruin Anakins sacrifice and have the Galactic Civil war be for nothing. C-3PO was great I guess..."
"Jan 7, 2020",neutral,Dont start a trilogy without a plan
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,It was time to end the saga and it was put together well. A little slow at times but overall a must see if you are a fan.  A 1-watch film for me but happy i watched it.
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"It's better than you think, no thanks to the critics RT score."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"I sat down in the cinema feeling nostalgic prior to The start - thinking about me pleading with my father to go see Star Wars new hope in 1977 at the Liverpool Odeon, London road. I leaned over to my 9 year old feeling excited that we were both  going to be in for a movie of all movies!
Sadly it was just Okay - I mean kinda good but not Great I fact very predictable and a Lack of Imagination from the Writers/Director/Producers. 
In 77 I got Scared and Excited and first 5 minutes But Unfortunately it's started quite Poor. And the fighting scene with kylo in the woods fighting  against strange hessian sack covered beings that had the worst or lack of choreography?
The Emperor should of been used a lot more and possibly not revealed  until About midway through the movie. Maybe looking into the sith society/figures along the way. Kylo turn to the light much much too easy and early  (Han Solo thirty second chat  wow.) a bit like when kylo  killed his dad? Oh oh err did I mention this movie should of been renamed the rise of Deja vu!
SERVERE LACK OF IMAGINATION 
PLEASE DONT MAKE ANY MORE FROM A DISSAPOINTED LIFELONG FAN!"
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,Older movies were more exciting.  But this one was great to see the actors from the first ones.
"Jan 7, 2020",neutral,"They seriously ruined this series.  Started great, totally flopped on the second, now this, which fell flat.  Thanks for ruining Star Wars Disney."
"Jan 7, 2020",negative,"A rushed and disjointed mess that spends the first 3rd doing it's best to pretend TLJ never happened and frustrate as few people in between.

Afraid to upset either side of this fandom, they strike an unsatisfying and disappointing middle."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"Standard Star Wars formula. Wrapped up the 9 film series, perhaps too quickly, but nicely."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"what the fuck is wrong with people? this was a fun thrill ride, and a great star wars film--thoroughly enjoyable"
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"Go with the audience score. At times, it moved a big fast. But I really like the characters and the overall tone of the movie. A fitting ending."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,Loved it! This was by far the best of the series! You have to have seen all of them to understand. Also watch carefully because it can get confusing but overall it was so suspenseful.
"Jan 7, 2020",negative,Too complicated story line.  Characters with no personalities. Action pretty good but sound levels all over the board.
"Jan 7, 2020",negative,Star Wars: The Fetch of the Quest Oof. 
"Jan 7, 2020",negative,"Loved the new trilogy, but the final film disappointed me. Felt like a force-fed fan service buffet that I didn't want."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,Best Star Wars movie! A little cringe was seen.
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,Wasn’t a satisfying conclusion. Had good visuals though
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,I personally liked the way that they wrapped up this
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"Worth watching the final movie in the Skywalker saga!
Action and laughs and an overall Star Wars adventure awaits!"
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,I loved this movie!!!!!! It was a great ending to the Star Wars story. I took my son to the movies to watch the first one and l just enjoyed the last one with my 17 year old grandson! They did a good job with the story and the acting was superb!
"Jan 7, 2020",neutral,To many story lines not enough answers
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"I’m not into Star Wars, honestly only went to watch it with my husband, but this movie was really cool! A lot of fun to watch!"
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,every detail.. will see it again
"Jan 7, 2020",negative,"The movie is just not good. Forget trying to rate it as a Star Wars film, but as a movie, in general, it is just bad. It suffers mainly from some horribly frantic pacing in the first half to 2/3 through, which leads to some very rushed and poor line delivery. The lines come across as being read right off que cards rather than memorized and rehearsed. The cuts from sequence to sequence make little sense and typically confuse the action. And again we are plagued by underdeveloped characters that are supposed to add depth, Keri Russell, but really add nothing because they are in the movie for so short a time that they fail to be anchored properly to the rest of the story."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,I just recently watched the entire Star Wars series for the first time and this movie was soooo good! So intense and full of emotion.
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,My family and I loved it
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"Overall, this tied up the 9-film saga well. There were some missed opportunities, some predictable scenarios, and some cheesy lines, but I was pleasantly surprised. Definitely worth catching before it leaves theaters."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,The story felt like it was lacking something.
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,This was the best of the Disney Star Wars.  Much more like the Lucas style.
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,All you haters are crazy. J.J. Nailed it!!
"Jan 7, 2020",neutral,"Honestly, they could have done way better. Seemed rushed and left a lot of plot holes. Heard through the grapevine that JJ Abram’s cut is way better than the final cut that Disney wanted a lot of the things we ended up seeing in theaters. Sad if true honestly."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,Too much fuss about the story.  This is what movies were made to be...enjoyable!
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,Action packed! Love Star Wars!
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,I’m not a big Star Wars fan but I loved the movie.
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"May not agree with everything they did to end the saga but this was a good movie, especially at the end. Effects were good, score was good, acting was good, and the movie spawned a lot of conversation with the family afterward as we all had differing opinions. A movie you can debate, in my mind, is a good movie as the experience goes well beyond the rolling of the final credits."
"Jan 7, 2020",negative,"Horrible. Way to shove it down my throat. Also, no soul, lifeless, soulless."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,Loved loved loved the movie. Great story. If you’re a Star Wars fan u won’t be disappointed
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"Was never going to please everyone, I really liked it, best of the new trilogy,"
"Jan 7, 2020",negative,"Too long, too loud and repetitive.  Very strange and unsettling to see Carrie."
"Jan 7, 2020",negative,Great performances but the plot was a complete mess.
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,Simply amazing. I felt that each of the last Star Wars movies has been exceedingly better than the last. Very fun and entertaining. Such a great movie!
"Jan 7, 2020",negative,A travesty of a movie thank god this saga is over.
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,It was a movie that was fun to watch but nothing that special and defiantly isn't as good as it could have been.
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"Perhaps a bit too tied up with a bow at the end, but definitely a wonderful journey and a fit ending to the series.  The actors were superb in their roles. A movie with heart and humor as well as excellent dramatic action. Must see!!"
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,could of/should of been better for what it was.
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,Much better than that first two in the series.  It felt more fresh and original versus the other two which were just regurgitation of the earlier movies.
"Jan 7, 2020",negative,Such a disappointing ending to a series that helped redefine science fiction cinema. this was purely a cash grab by Disney and in trying to please everyone they pleased no one. even though the Last Jedi was divisive at least it took chances with the story and an exciting opportunity for others to wield Force powers. Instead of continuing that story they dropped almost everything from The Last Jedi as if it didn't exist. This felt like a Saturday morning cartoon that was trying too hard to please everyone and was just toying with our emotions/nostalgia and not explaining anything. It just assumed the audience is stupid and won't question the script and goes along with whatever happens. 
"Jan 7, 2020",negative,"This movie is for simpletons. That's it, enough said. If you can live with 2 plot holes per minute, enjoy this movie. But (like episode 8 and 9) it has nothing to do with Star Wars. Like Rian Johnson, JJ Abrams doesn't understand Star Wars, space, the force, light sabres..  It's plain ridiculous how those 2 directors managed to drive a good franchise into the mud and beyond."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"Was a bit disappointed. I think 7 was the best of the last 3. 8 sucked. 9 tried to fix things, but still felt liked it was just all crammed together."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,It was so filled with great actions from all of the actors.  It really kept me alert!!
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"Enjoyed it, not perfect, but it at least undid some of the crap they pulled in the previous ones. The old characters that were brought back were enjoyable, so were Kylo and Rey. Fin and Po are just there but don't really add to the movie much.

The movie was to fast paced, would have been better if it was longer.
For me it receives a 5 just for undoing crap and not giving Rose a bigger role."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"It was really good. I thought that it was REALLY superb. I mean, there were a couple plot holes which were not well explained, but it was an extremely well done and emotionally riveting. 
It was just really good. There were plot twist, betrayals, and amazing character development. There were like 2-3 missed opportunities in my opinion, but it was really great.
So, yeah, I would definitely recommend that y'all see it!"
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,It was one of the best Star Wars films of all-time!!! Totally recommend going to see it! Best ending possible for the Star Wars saga!
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"good action, nice to see old characters. liked it!"
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,Dislike that it wasn't JJ Abrahms original cut
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,It was ok.My wife and I saw the first one as friends the 2nd one as a married couple and this one we took our 14 month old little girl to see.She was really behaved and wasn't scared of it.
"Jan 7, 2020",negative,"Full of plot holes and nonsense, completely destroyed George Lucas Saga."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"The rise of skywalker is satisfying conclusion to the skywalker saga. Even though some of it is rushed it is fun to see that Kylo Ren is a jedi again, and to see that Rey is a palpatien. Its a fun ride from start to end is an amazing movie and the hate that this movie gets unfair. Yes Rian Johnson messed up Star Wars but the episode fixed the series and to me is top 5 if i rank the Star Wars films"
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"I enjoyed ""The Rise of Skywalker"". However, I feel it was rushed. Too much crammed into two hours. Too many unanswered questions."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,I feel they did a great job of wrapping up the saga and answering some lingering questions. The visuals were amazing and there are some treats for those of us who started watching the saga when it first came out in the 70s. Mt girlfriend really enjoyed it and she isn't into Start Wars whatsoever.
"Jan 7, 2020",negative,"To fast paced, convenient plots, lack in character development. To the point you don’t get invested in any of the characters. I don’t by Raes struggles and see her grow into a Jedi, because every thing comes to easily. I don’t by any of the relationships between any of the characters. It’s  a microwave relationship. Instant best friend, instant love interest, I couldn’t by into it. I had no suspension of disbelief. I haven’t since they rebooted it, it’s just gotten worse. I don’t like being negative, unfortunately I’m not able to pretend this was worth my money or my time."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,It has a Return if the Jedi feeling to it.  Very good!
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"whatever, it's fine. didn't feel like the end of a 40 year saga though.  guess disney is gonna milk this one forever."
"Jan 7, 2020",negative,Total waste of film stock.  Glad this series is over.  Sad that it tarnished the good work that came before it.
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,It is amazing! I recommend that people go see it multiple times in the theaters!
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"I really really enjoyed it, don't really care what other people think. Best one so far.

Not flawless but still very good. I recommend watching it."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,I ranked it up there #2 just behind Return of the Jedi. But the 3D was the best movie I have ever seen in it. But it was great movie. It was so much better the  last the last Jedi!!!
"Jan 7, 2020",neutral,"Too fast-paced to fully enjoy. It does have a couple of good moments, but in general the story feels nonsensical. I miss the times when writing a good story took risks and not a ton of focus group studies."
"Jan 7, 2020",negative,"Terrible, suspect Disney just wanted to get it out of the door"
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"It’s a 6 - 7 / 10, imho. Basically, it’s the Return of the Jedi Redux with better acting and effects, but a questionable storyline. It’s worth seeing because it’s the end of the saga, but it still falls short of The Empire Strikes Back and Rogue One."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,Loved it! Some surprises here for sure. Sad this series has come to an end.
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"It was a wonderful movie, one of their best I think!!"
"Jan 7, 2020",negative,"The visuals and soundtrack were amazing, but that's about it. The rest of the movie was contrived and imbecilic. But hey, Disney made their $ so why should they care about the quality of their product. As long as the masses keep gobbling up sugar coated turds, they will be more than happy to keep taking massive dumps on the franchise for them."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,Saw it twice. Thats how good it was.
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,I liked the movie a lot
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,Action was great fun.
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,This was an action packed epic adventure with a good plot.  Good movie for all ages.  Would like to see it again.
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"I loved it. Don't listen to the naysayers. The events in the movie could come as a surprise, but I really think it was the only way, in the end. I'm completely satisfied, just sad it's over."
"Jan 7, 2020",negative,"Hard to stomach, the story. Good acting and great special effects."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,It was wonderful having JJ at the helm again... felt like Star Wars had returned. “Chewie... we’re home.”
"Jan 7, 2020",negative,This was the director going down the list of the viewers' unanswered questions while simultaneously filming a chase scene. I found myself unable to care about the answers or anything else. It didnt seem like the director cared either. Very disappointing.
"Jan 7, 2020",negative,No plot. Weak acting. An attempt at an emotional connection with past characters in a well-remembered classic. A feeble attempt to waste 500 million dollars.
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,awesome tied up some loose ends
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"Great addition to the Star Wars series.  Pays homage to the past while focusing on the new characters and how they react and effect the overall story.  Movie works as part of the overall Star Wars story.  It has everything you want: lightsabers, droids, lasers, force powers, space ships and good vs evil.  Try not to analyze it too much - just enjoy it for what it is (a great adventure) - I know I did!!!"
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,Another good Star Wars movie in the books!
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"On a clinical level, TROS is not great. The plot is convoluted, the characters have little development, and at times it seems to revel in spectacle for spectacle's sake. 
On the other hand, this is a movie where people have superpowers, giant lasers and yet STILL fight with laser swords. It is inherently ridiculous, and I grade it using that curve.
I recommend this movie. It moves quickly, delivers sumptuous visuals (too much if you are photosensitive) and ties up enough loose ends that it is a fitting ending to a story that simply got too complex for its own good.
In summary, buy a ticket and expect to be entertained, but not much more."
"Jan 7, 2020",negative,Really terrible way to end the trilogy.
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"Maybe too fast-paced at the beginning but ultimately, I got into the story.  I thought it got better and better and yes, I did love he ending."
"Jan 7, 2020",negative,Too much fan service with a lot of plot holes. Cinematography was excellent.
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,Lots of action and adventure.  Story unfolds right before your eyes and it's plot wasa easy to follow.  Great use of old characters as well as new ones.
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"Good action and wonderful special effects, as always what you expect from George Lucas. They left it open for the possibility of a sequel...(which isn't supposed to happen?)"
"Jan 7, 2020",neutral,Great special effects but formulaic and predictable story line. Just more of the same plot with different characters. Fun escape but that's all.
"Jan 7, 2020",negative,"TROS simultaneously deepened the inevitable heart of the story and gutted it. It gave the characters and audience long awaited payoff to immediately rip it away, leaving both the film and viewer feeling hollow. It turned a happy ever after into a tragedy, a cautionary tale. The pacing was terrible, they lacked continuity with all previous films, characters had ret-conned story arcs, Rey lost all of her agency, and the script writer has literally said ""we haven't seen the twins on Tatooine before"" - as if he's never seen  Return of the Jedi - which explains a lot about the movie."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"excelente, fechou muito bem a saga dos Skywalkers"
"Jan 7, 2020",neutral,Poorly paced and it seems Reddit had more of a hand in writing the movie than Chris Terrio.
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,Great story.  Upbeat for once.
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,It was more character than cgi effects driven. It nicely closed the arc of the series. It left me satisfied
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"A great movie theater experience! I’ve enjoyed every Star Wars movie experience, and this one’s no exception. It had thrills, suspense, moments of terror, excitement, and all-around fun. Loved it and have seen it several times with many more to come."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,It is one of the best in my thought.
"Jan 7, 2020",negative,"Had it's moments but was ultimately hamstringed by Rian Johnson's abysmal Episode 8. Here's hoping that the ~190 minute ""JJ Cut"" is real and can redeem the finale of the Skywalker saga."
"Jan 7, 2020",negative,Sux. A bd remix of return of the Jedi. 
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"I didn't want it to end, especially knowing this was the last in the series. It was heart pounding and unbelievable Jedi tricks as well as Syth powers."
"Jan 7, 2020",neutral,"This movie need more time looks like 2 movies in 1, trying to fix the things in TLJ.....at least they try"
"Jan 7, 2020",negative,"A desperate scream to be accepted. The film tries to meet all expectations without breaking any and in the end delivers a cowardly, visionless and even meaningless movie"
"Jan 7, 2020",negative,I mean it looked good for the most part. It was such a mess of a plot that never slowed down to let you or the actors Cath your breath. I'm being generous with 1.5 stars. That was so terrible but I blame Rian Johnson for this mess.
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"I saw the first Star Wars movie when I was 12 and have been in love with all the characters ever since! I am now 56 and this final chapter in the Skywalker saga, did NOT disappoint this life long fan! Saw it in 3D IMAX and I was blown away by the action and storyline! This is definitely a ""see it on the big screen"" type of movie and is NOT to be missed!"
"Jan 7, 2020",negative,"Calling it garbage is unkind ... to garbage. Those that tell me they like ANY of the movies in this last trilogy, they can tell me they want to marry their sister or thier hero was Hitler and they wouldn't have as bad a degrade in respect from me. I will not give any money that can go to Disney or Star Wars any more, they have had my last dollar."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,Such an amazing ending to the saga.
"Jan 7, 2020",neutral,"One wonders if the premise for this film was written by some half-witted nerfherders with ADHD. After my incredulity of this silly premise wore off, I found myself hoping there would be some twist in the story to make it not only believable but enjoyable. But alas, that was not written in these stars. Abrams filled it with so many shoot outs and action scenes (to distract from its sagging storyline?) that I couldn't tell if I was watching a movie or a video game. The pace was way too fast to be enjoyable. Hyperdrive is fun occasionally but not constantly. The scenes that were meant to evoke emotion and serious contemplation were rushed and unconvincing. 

This film was like that meal you had been looking forward to but had to scarf down when an emergency crouches in on you. You realize that you won't be able to enjoy it and will probably have heartburn afterward but there are more important things to attend to. 

I walked out of the theater thinking, ""Give me back the 2 and a half hours I just spent and I could have come up with a better story than this one."""
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"REVIEW: Star Wars: Episode IX—The Rise of Skywalker

Directed by: JJ Abrams, the concluding chapter of the Skywalker Saga is one not to be missed. The film follows Rey and Finn as they, along with Chewbacca, C-3PO, R2-D2, Poe Dameron, and BB-8, try to stop the First Order from destroying what is left of the Resistance. Rey must now use what she has learned from Leia, Luke, and Han Solo to help them along the way. Meanwhile, they must battle their enemies, including Kyle Ren, all while the threat of an old enemy looms. The story wraps everything up perfectly, the acting performances (especially those of Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, Adam Driver, Anthony Daniels, Billy Dee Williams, Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, and Ian McDiarmid) are perfect, the score by John Williams (his final score for the franchise) is one of the best of the year and of his career, the visuals beautiful and breathtaking, the action scenes are some of the best of the series and, once again, the year, and Abrams's direction is flawless. The idea that a forty-two year story has now come to a close is mind-boggling, and this film does it better than I ever would have thought. In all, this is a perfect film that is sure to satisfy all those who have stuck with the franchise from the beginning, as well as myself. (Rating: 10/10)"
"Jan 7, 2020",negative,"Pretty much as expected for Star Wars. I went with my teenage son, who enjoyed it more than I, but it's a standard mishmash of ridiculous chases, gaping plot holes, time- and logic-defying escapades, grand melodrama, and a ragtag bunch of rebels taking down an overwhelming force created by evil geniuses who happen to be incredibly stupid and slow to act. Meh. It's really starting to bother me how they humanize Stormtroopers without helmets (Finn for instance, and his new friends on yaks) yet mercilessly slaughter thousands along the way. That along the way with (once again) showing entire planets being destroyed without barely a notice and zero emotional impact. I saw the original Episode IV in first run, and have seen them all out of a sense of completism, but I pretty much regret having gone."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,I thought it was a fitting end to the saga. Great movie
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,Loved it!  Critics are stupid.
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,The best of the final three! Great human interaction and dialogue plus saber duels and aerial battles. Riveting and a stupendous conclusion to the Star Wars saga!!
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,Weak story line and highly disappointed for what is “supposedly” the last Star Wars to be produced.
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"It was very similar to how I felt of endgame but I liked it more it was a good end to the skywalker and made the characters less god-like, Jedis spend years working with there lightsabers and we see all that in this movie that comes true it is true to the lore and the previous movies. A must-see for all Starwars fans"
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"Everything about it was great, especially how they brought all the old characters back in some form or fashion."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"After what, 42 years (?), the nine part series is over. Thank goodness no Jar-jar in this one! A good movie, I doubt anyone would be disappointed, other than the fact that the series is over. I think I need to see it again to catch ALL the details."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,Honestly I thought it was a good end to the Skywalker saga but also it doesnt feel like the end of Reys story.
"Jan 7, 2020",negative,"I have no words for this. Although I do give props to the visuals and action sequence, the plot is literally all over."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,Good but not great. Kinda leaves a empty feeling inside you because it is the final Star wars movie but without the prestige of ending a 11 movie journey. The finale should have a special closing credts sequence giving credit to all the movies before it. This or just ends. Absolutely nothing to stick around for. That was very disappointing. 
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"First Off, There Is So Many Questions. So Many What The F*** Moments That We Will Never Get An Answer To Now That The Skywalker Saga Is Over. Anakin Was My Favorite Character Besides Darth Maul and It Just Seemed Anakin Was Not Really Anybody Special. He Wss Supposed To Be The Chosen One. Anakin Was Supposed To Bring Balance To The Force and Honestly It Seems As If His Life Didnt Really Matter Much In The End. 
This Movie Tries To Fix Reys Parents, Realize The Prophecy, Explain Palpatine's Voice From Trailer, Explain The New Enemy, Finalize Rey and Kylo's Story, Give New Characters, Flesh Out Older Characters, Undo The Controversy From The Past 2 Movies. Well Alot Can Be Summed Up By Either Not Answering Your Questions or Speed Through Stuff Without Explaining The Plot. 
They Added a New Thing Called ""Hyper Force Jumping"" Just Jumping Through Hyper Space Over and Over Like 8 Different Places In 2 Minutes and That Was Supposed To Be The Main Journey and Setup To This New Found Enemy. This Movie Desperately Needs Another Hour Added To This Just To Explain The Huh? Moments. 
These Scenes Goes By So Quickly but Other Parts Go On Slow. Action Scenes Are Over In Minutes While Talking Scenes Takes 10 or 15 Minutes. 
The Space Battle If You Can Call It That Is Going On In The Background, You Cant See What's Going On. I Want To See The Star Wars Space Battle In Star Wars. Rose Isnt Even In The Movie Barely, Finn Was Setup To Have Something Special With Rose In Previous Movie but Finn Says Like 2 Lines To Her amd Seems To Lust Over Rey. 
Someone Quoted This Movie As ""a Deeply Horny Movie For two and a half hours with Almost Every Lead Character Having Sexual Tension With Each Other"". 
There Are So Many Questions How Did Palpatine Come Back? No Real Answer. Who's Rey Parents? Hmm Interesting But WTF, How?... No Explanation. I Don't Understand What They Are Doing. Why Wasn't Hayden In The Movie? I Wanted Anakin In This Film. Rise of Skywalker. Anakin Skywalker, Luke Skywalker, who Was In This Film Named Skywalker? Kylo Ren? No He's Ben Solo. Rey? Well Last Jedi Said Her Parents Were Nobody So Not There. What The Hell? 
There Are So Many Plot Holes I Can Name 10 At Least But Cant Cause Spoilers. I Just Want A Satisfactory Ending To Skywalker, not Make Anakin Feel Like He Was Pointless, Not To Raise Questions About What I Was Watching.
Good Things... Good Things. Funny Smart ass Remarks, There Were A Few Good Jokes and Come Backs Made By Finn, C3P0 and Others That Were Laugh Out Loud Funny. The Visuals Are Amazing Which Is To Be Expected By Disney and Star Wars Franchise. The Action When There Was Action Was Pretty Cool. Leia Was Done Well With dignity and Respect However By Trying To Fix Stuff From The Last Jedi There Were More Questions Raised We Didn't Get Answers To. 
This Movie Did Feel Like a Star Wars Movie, Did This Movie Reach Levels of Revenge of The Sith? No. But Out of The New Trilogy This Movie Is The Best and It Was Very Entertaining. This Movie Is Good But Plot Holes Are What Is Holding This Down. I Hated Kylo Ren In The Last 2 Movies but In This One... He's One of My Favorite Characters Now. I Wish This Movie Went a Different Direction. This Movie Has Actual Lightsaber Battles. Not As Good As Anakin Vs Obi-Wan But Pretty Dang Great Nonetheless. This Movie Has Emotional Scenes, and The Scenes That Worked; Worked Great. 
Rating This Movie... Rating This Movie Is Hard To Do. I Only Watched This Movie Once and I Am Going To Watch A Second Time When I Get Paid and Maybe My Opinion Changes or Maybe It Wont. If You Liked Last Jedi, You May Not Like This As They Try Fixing Errors From That Movie, If You Like Anakin Then Youre Going To Be Kinda Pissed. If You Just Want To See Star Wars Action Youre Gonna Like This Movie at Least A Bit. If You dont Care About The Plot Then Youre Good You'll Love It. This Movie Is Not A Bad Movie. If You See The People Giving This Movie a 1 or a 2 out of 10, They Are Lying. This Movie Although May Piss You Off, It Is Not Bad. It Doesnt Make Much sense but It Isn't Bad. I Can See You Giving This Movie a 5/10 If You Are Just Completely Turned Off By The Plot Holes. I Am Torn On My Rating. I Want To Give This an 8 As I See The Previous Movie as a 7... However The Plot Holes Are Just So Bad. 
Can We Get An Extended Cut? Are They Gonna Release An Hour Longer Version On Blu-Ray? It Worked For Batman V Superman. We Need It Here. It Doesn't Matter If Its Just a Few Scenes of Fixing The Plot Holes. I Hope You Enjoyed The Review and Remember To Game, Like A God."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,I loved it. Was Sad but the action was great and it kept me on the edge of my seat down to the unexpected end.
"Jan 7, 2020",negative,Completely laughable movie with terrible acting. They should put a nail in the coffin of the series and Collett good good
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"It tied up the loose ends, but was a bit choppy and the battle screens were on repeat...there wasn't any mystery."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"Desperate attempt to fix TLJ horrible mistake.
Despite being too fast expecially in the first part, and having few plot holes, too little Luke Skywalker screentime and not showing the faces of the characters Rey hear (which for the international audience is terrribly confusing, guess why...), it feels like real Star Wars saga at least, unlike Episode VIII."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,Exciting and adventurous
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,Good movie.  Fitting ending.
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"This movie was a perfect ending to the saga of Star Wars, J.J. Abrams was the best choice to make this final episode. I recommend it and give it a 10/10!"
"Jan 7, 2020",negative,"Just terrible. Tried to recreate some iconic moments from the original films that just fell flat. Predictable, boring story-line and very poor acting"
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"It seems that this movie is very similar to the very first Star Wars movie. Only the characters have been changed, but the story line and meaning of the film are very similar to the first movie. I like that the sound wasn't so loud that it blasted you out of the theater. My grandsons liked the movie a lot."
"Jan 7, 2020",negative,Cheesy and predictable
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,Cheesy rehash of all the previous plots and storytelling elements from the old films. Fan-service without any creativity. I was still definitely entertained and I love Star Wars but this film was by far the worst of the trilogy.
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,Loved all the 'old' characters!
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,Its was what I expected. In my opinion they are all the same and pretty predictable. Some cheesy acting. Good action scenes. I was happy they did not introduce any weird characters and I think it wrapped up nicely.  Certainly nothing special.
"Jan 7, 2020",negative,"The entire movie was a video game fetch quest to get the thing to lead them to the other thing to lead them to the place to the final boss battle. Multiple planets visited in the span of 16 hours is laughable, the time table made no sense.  Palpatine announced he was still alive via a podcast broadcast to the galaxy in the opening text crawl.  You want to know how he came back? Don't ask its not important apparently.  If you want to get any explanation of key plot points you will need to read comics, the visual dictionary, and other source material to attempt to make sense.  The Knights of Ren were laughable and were only there to sell merchandise. There were no consequences to anything in the movie, multiple deaths instantly reversed, it was a mess."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"I loved it. I avoided any trailers, I wanted my own enjoyment of the movie to be uninfluenced. I loved the progress and transition. Yes, there were tears but like life, it was needed. Unexpected twists but so much more can be done to expand and explore in ""ST"" World. I love J.J.Abrahms directorship."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,I thought it was great. A few things felt rushed or unanswered but overall a great movie!
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"It was good, like episode 7. The story line was good but the trailer of the movie gave that away. I don’t understand how people riding on horses, can trot down the wing of a large space craft?  It’s space?  You can’t breathe in space."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"Pretty entertaining movie.  Feel good ending, which I love."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,I enjoyed throughly and got more out of it the second time.
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"I really liked JJ's final ending of the Saga. Had emotions, fan-based understanding and actions pace flow. Very good! Best in the latest trilogy."
"Jan 7, 2020",neutral,"Would you like to see a 90's video game in a movie format? Do you want to ignore everything that happened in the Last Jedi and act like this is all going according to plan? If so this movie is for you. Otherwise, if you have any sense, you will just be sad at what could have been. This trilogy is a big miss for Disney. They could have told a story that people remembered for decades. All it did for me was make the Prequel Trilogy seem ok."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,Nice capper to the Skywalker saga. A chance to say goodbye to old friends and hello to some new friends. Hopefully we’ll see more of the new ones in the future!
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,Awesome. worth seeing!! ive now seen it twice
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"This was a good end to an epic series. This was 40 years in the making. So many characters, an expanding universe, and a fan base full of opinions. LOL! This was a fun popcorn movie that took me back to a galaxy far far away one last time. C-3P0 said it best, we got one last look at our friends. Don't let the hate of ""fans"" and critics flow through you; watch and enjoy the Rise of Skywalker."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,Great ending to an even greater series.
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,Entertaining from start to finish!
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,Great Movie.  Great ending to the Skywalker saga.
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"As a lifetime fan, I felt like they respected the old stories and closed a saga with dignity."
"Jan 7, 2020",negative,"The CGI may be the only reason to watch the movie. The make up and costumes were sub-standard, especially noticeable flaws in the dancing alien festival scene (where the masks bounced up and down looking disjointed). The plot and story were a complete mess, more concern in getting nostalgia references than telling a reasonable tale. Most of the actors looked bored or uninspired, and just going through the motion and lines."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,It was great! Action all the way through!
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"It was a bit of a mess, jumped around too much without much plot to drive it home."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"I liked it insofar as it was Ana croon movie based on the Star Wars universe, but the longer I had to think about the plot afterward, the more I found it problematic and disappointing in direction.
Let me say, I dont think it was a bad movie, it just wasnt what I wanted from this series."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,Great action and story line. The only Star Wars movie that made me cry! Loved it!
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"loved how they started with a ""bang"", and I enjoyed the mix of old and new characters. great movie"
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"Action is great, movie felt too compact. They should have made it two separate movies.

Seeing in 4DX was well worth it for the experience."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,Great ending of an era..pulling everyone together made it relevant to everyone who has seen any or all of the prior movies.
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,Very satisfying conclusion to the series.
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"Much better than last Jedi. Don’t listen to haters, it was pretty solid. Not going to blow your mind but a decent addition to Star Wars."
"Jan 7, 2020",negative,Corny Corny Corny Everything for everybody and nothing for everybody. my friend was lucky half way through he dozed. The more think about it the worse it gets.
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,Its good but not the best.
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,Good movie. Left with a few scenes unanswered but overall a really good movie.
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,One of the best movies I've ever seen. Critics should be fired for doing this movie wrong.
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"Filled in missing family backgrounds, wondered why Harrison Ford was not listed in the credits"
"Jan 7, 2020",negative,if you want fanservice and 0 argument this movie it's for you
"Jan 7, 2020",negative,"Felt like I was watching a video game... going from one fetch-quest to another. Just curious as to why the RT score is superglued at 86%, I haven't seen it change even one percentage point up/down in ages."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,A few things were illogical withing canon or a bit cringy but all in all it was a very entertaining flick. Would recommend watching if you enjoyed the other two movies of the third trilogy.
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,A lot of loose ends tied up.
"Jan 7, 2020",negative,"It has some good action scenes, but the plot, the bad use of some characters, the humor and the tension part (or basically everything else) are lame."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,very good movie the last in a long line of movies
"Jan 7, 2020",negative,Bad acting with a terrible script. Totally rushed for the holidays! So much not explained in the FINAL chapter.
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,I took my 12yo son to see it at the IMAX theater & we wanted a good movie to see it on that huge screen. Disney didn't disappoint. I was surprised that they even brought back the Ewoks! Great job JJ Abrams
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,Excellent finish to the series. Hit all the right notes. Tied up loose ends but had a compelling storyline of its own.
"Jan 7, 2020",negative,"It was like watching someone you used to admire. Have a spastic seizure and die. It was a mess. It almost makes me yearn for the simplistic stupidity of the prequels. But I have to say the Mandolorian, is doing Star Wars better."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,I liked that it came full circle and left it to where it can be continued.
"Jan 7, 2020",negative,"Disappointing, the original casts and plots were vastly superior."
"Jan 7, 2020",negative,Super exciting for someone who don't care about story. If you like explosions and the films you wAtch to hold your hand and tell you how to feel this is for you. This movie was terrible
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,Thought it wrapped up the series well and it ended happy!
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"Didn't like the ending, iij wanted Ben to?"
"Jan 7, 2020",negative,Largely underwhelming.  Lots of punch with little substance.
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"Heavy on the action/fight scenes, it answers the big questions and ties up the lose ends. The purists will continue to hate it, but those of us who enjoy the story for what it is (not some greater meaning), will be perfectly happy with it."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,Seemed a little rushed but the people playing the characters did a good job getting it done.
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,Honestly this movie was an amazing movie!!
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,Somewhat slow in the beginning
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"The Star Wars franchise has run its course.  This movie was definitely better than the last but it just didn't measure up to some of the earlier episodes.  Still worth watching as it wraps up the series, but don't expect to be blown away."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"Loved the 3D and if you have watched all of the Star Wars movies, then it's awesome!  Great job!   

I only wish that we got the recliner seats as these seats were so close and a bit uncomfortable.  It was really loud too.  But I should have paid closer attention to the details on getting my tickets.  Movie was so good though!"
"Jan 7, 2020",negative,"No cool lightsaber fights, and palpatine survives everything.. bulshit story"
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,Darth Sidious looked insane!
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,Such a fulfilling end to the saga.
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,I loved the movie and the way it brought all the favorite characters back 1 last time. Thanks for leaving Ja Ja Binks out.
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,Great entertainment!
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"Cheesy and predictable, even more than other Star Wars movies."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"Loved all the characters. The personalities really came out in this one. There were so many side stories, I would have liked more. I wish the Jedi would return."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,It was a perfect Star Wars movie.
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,Great movie! Loved Kylo REN and Ray so much!!
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,What a fantastic conclusion to this trilogy. Really loved where the characters were. The Jedi are back!!!
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"There is no movie franchise like Star Wars.  A lot of fun, and great to see all the old characters in the movie.  Then of course they throw in new lovable droid.

If you like Star Wars, you will love this movie."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,Well written and brought all elements together in the end
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,Lots of nostalgia moments calling back to the last movies. Still leaves more questions than answers but overall enjoyable to watch.
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,Very good.  Liked how everything came together.
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"Coming into The Rise of Skywalker, I'd had very low expectations, so I ended up really liking the film, and finding it solid overall. There lies a great lesson for everyone – always hold your expectations on the lower end of the spectrum as otherwise the movie-going experience can turn out to be very disappointing. As a fan of its predecessor, the fact that they decided to retcon all of its great ideas really bothered me, but still I found its major twist solid, and all of the lightsaber battles in this movie are excellent too. The film's supporting characters are a total waste of time, but Palpatine is excellent, and all of Ray/Kylo scenes are scene-stealers how electrifying they are. It's a hugely entertaining film with some actually very strong humor and adventure elements, but it shrank the universe so badly with some very unfortunate, cheesy and stupid decisions to appeal to the dumbest SW fans out there."
"Jan 7, 2020",negative,"A gilded turd . . . very well crafted, beautiful ""shots"" and effects . . . all created in the service of a story/script that was painfully dumb, cliched, and predictable. This is the worst movie I've seen in a theater since Spider Man 3."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,Release the original cut!!!!
"Jan 7, 2020",neutral,"Average movie, however for a StarWars movie is not good."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"Not clear what Fins message to Rey was. Also, needed some better character development with Fin and Poe."
"Jan 7, 2020",negative,Bad really baaaaaaad
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"Tied everything up in a knot, made you laugh and cry.
Action packed from start to finish."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"The movie will entertain teen fanboys who have a crush on Rey, but if you are an adult I would recommend you that you should watch cats instead."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,too dark in places but it was ok
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"8.9/10. Very very good, infititely better than the last jedi. Still not perfect though."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"Good, just some of the scenes felt cut short for some reason."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,This was a movie for the ages!
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,Just riveting from the opening scene till the close of the entire saga!
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,JJ did a great job of getting the franchise back on track after the Last Jedi debacle while also crafting a satisfying ending to the Skywalker saga. I only wish JJ had written Episode 8 or was allowed to make Episode 9 a two parter so some story lines could breathe a little more. Still an excellent movie.
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"Story, character development, ending - all lived up to expectations!"
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"Very good, a couple of plot choices I didn't like."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,Great job wrapping up the story. I feel JJ Abrams did his best to salvage Rian Johnson’s mess.
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,Great fight and battle scenes!
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,It tied it all up and had a great ending !!
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"A lot of critics have slammed this movie for it's inconsistencies, and granted that it may not be what most fans would expect, but it did a pretty great job in concluding a saga that our parents grew up with, and our kids would grow up knowing. J.J. Abrams did a wonderful job. The cast and crew deserve all the praise."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"Some scenes were enjoyable, but overall the movie was too hard to follow and introduced characters that were hard to care about."
"Jan 7, 2020",negative,"Really bad, a waste of time, destroyed everything that was built in the previous films. Surely there was no planning on the part of Disney."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,Way better than that train wreck of a movie THE LAST JEDI
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,So much action that you will get dizzy.  You may need to see previous Star War films to keep track of all the characters.  Special effects are tremendous and often move too fast.  Nice to see some of the old characters from 1977-90s.
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"My opinion is that it was a little messy, a little rough around the edges, and a little rushed at the beginning, but overall I liked it.  I think it is the best of the new 3 movies but doesn't hold a candle to the original trilogy. The movie, I think, correctly aligns with how the force works, how it ought to work.  The nostalgia ride is worth it.  The emotional roller coaster is worth it.  It flies in the face of whatever Rian Johnson was trying to do with the trilogy, and I think that's a good thing.  I think you might want to give it a chance.  It does not leave me with a sour taste in my mouth like The Last Jedi did, not even close.  It's about as decent as Revenge of the Sith I think."
"Jan 7, 2020",negative,"I enjoyed all of the previous SW movies, including The Last Jedi, which I had mixed thoughts on. But this movie....nah"
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,They did their best to reverse that absolute garbage of the second movie. This one was basically two movies in one whilst dismissing the steaming pile of shit that was the second movie.
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"Excellent movie, full of action and story line.  Go see you will be glad you did."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,It was good action just didn't have any original thought
"Jan 7, 2020",neutral,"I cannot say I did not find any enjoyment in the movie, but it was so aggressively paced and did not take the time to dwell on anything. It tried to introduce way, way too many things at the end trilogy, and consequently it feels oversaturated. It feels like course correction after episode 8, going as far as to take jabs at the movie, and it suffers from it."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,I loved that the movie included so many of our favorite actors/characters from the original series of movies!
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"With engaging characters and dialogue, exceptional action sequences, and plenty of fun to be had, The Rise of Skywalker serves as an emotional and effective end to the Star Wars saga, even if it is consistently hindered by poor pacing and an overabundance of exposition."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"I really like the fight scenes, and the Kylo/Rey scenes were done really well. Kylo Ren definitely had the best story arc in this trilogy, and Adam Driver acted the hell out of this role. It has its holes and problems, but I enjoyed it and think it’s the best film in the newer trilogy."
"Jan 7, 2020",negative,It was an incomprehensible succession of fast clips.
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,Best 3-D/IMAX movie weve seen yet
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"After 42 years of expectation, it was a very satisfying conclusion."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,was an overall letdown. Very dissapointed in Kylo Ren
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"A lot of questions still need to be answered, and we needed Hayden Christensen, but the ending was good!"
"Jan 7, 2020",negative,"What there is to say... if you liked this trilogy since the beginning you'll be fine. However, if you were disappointed by the previous two movies, this episode is just more the same. Long live the mighty-virtuous-unshakeable-DoNothingWrongEver Rey."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"Though I enjoyed little pieces, here and there. Rise of skywalker as a whole was exhausting to watch. The plot, if one even existed to begin with, felt rushed and uncomfortable at times. Very uncharacterist for Star Wars, well not including the last Jedi or Attack of the clones. The acting, I have to admit, was fairly decent. It was apparent that the actors and actresses were giving it their all, I just wish the screen writers had gotten that memo."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,I loved it. Epic visuals from start to finish. I love how the story finished. I just loved everything about it. I might be biased because I love the series but it was super awesome to me! Must watch
"Jan 7, 2020",negative,"JJ Abrams massacred Star Trek, and now he was allowed to massacre Star Wars... good job Disney :P"
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"There was a lot happening and it was full on, but I enjoyed it overall. Finishing off a saga like this was never going to be an easy feat. My biggest fear was that it would be more about online fan theories and appeasing the online obsessive fans. I do like that there was a balance between nostalgia and new. Still processing a number of elements but overall yes I do really like."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"I really enjoyed the movie, it was a really good conclusion. Id recommend it to any Star Wars fan."
"Jan 7, 2020",negative,"Imagine that episode 5 had no surprise, and just in 6, the opening letters inform us that Vader is luke's father. A narrative disaster right? Well, that's episode 9."
"Jan 7, 2020",negative,it was ok not that great kinda boring to be honest only some parts were good.
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"I liked this one a lot. I think people are unfair with their criticisms of this. It's a fun adventure film, and if you watch it without baggage, it's hard not to like it."
"Jan 7, 2020",negative,Honestly I got more questions now than I did after TLJ.
"Jan 7, 2020",negative,Slightly better than the last one. The power scaling in this trilogy (especially this one and the last one) were crazy and made no sense.
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"Nice movie,  fun and touching."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"Wonderful. Even though we were 10 minutes late, lol.  It was freezing in the lobby though!"
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,Fanservice with some emotional highlights. But that is ok.
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,It was just a good movie I don't want to be a spoiler alert ER if that's a word lol
"Jan 7, 2020",negative,"It was watchable only because nothing else to do. Fight scene between Rey and Kilo was very good but characters were boring, story line was rehash of the previous movies. Pretty much Luke and Anakins story before was a irelevant to defeating Palpatine. Basically the movie was Rey had it all under control but Fin was worried running around yelling ""Rey!, Rey!"" Every 15 mins."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"I don't know if so many critics have ever been so wrong about a movie. Maybe with David Lynch's ""Fire Walk With Me"" when it came out? This one will fare well against the test of time. Easily the best of the new trilogy, quite possibly in the top 3 of all time. Full of heart, fun, real Star Wars magic, shocking surprises (my jaw dropped to the floor on at least 2 occasions; so glad I was able to stay away from any leaks or spoilers), just the right amount of humor that's classic Star Wars and fresh at the same time, amazing action, and plenty of emotional wallops. I don't know if I've ever cried so much in a movie theater. Such a fitting and beautiful end to the Skywalker saga."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,The show answered questions
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"Left with lots of unanswered  questions! Felt I should start with that but anyway the movie is alright. Finally some questions we've had since the force awakens are answered and I must say there was great twist with Rey's parents one that I personally didn't see coming. Unfortunately as much as it answered those questions, it raised new ones and left them unanswered, I guess for us to conclude for ourselves. You've already watched the first two you might as well watch this one but don't go in with your hopes too high. it give it a 5/10

Just watch it cause you know.... its Star wars 🤷"
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,better than ROS but not great.
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,A pretty good conclusion to the sequel trilogy and the entire nine episode saga.  J.J. Abrams did the best he could with what he was given and he has improved as a filmmaker.
"Jan 7, 2020",negative,this movie was ridiculous. not a good star wars movie
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,Amazing!!!!!!!! Best one yet!
"Jan 7, 2020",negative,so boring my friend was falling asleep
"Jan 7, 2020",negative,"Beautiful to watch, but frustrating to experience as a fan of the original movies. So many liberties were taken with the original canon that I left the theater feeling used, as if discovering the love of my life is only after my money. As if the filmmakers were simply checking off boxes. Sarcastic banter? Check. Bromance? Check. I had no concern for the characters most of the time, not that the actors were at fault (most performances were fine), but the story and script they had to work with were self-conscious, banal and paper-thin, full of cliches. I know you can't recreate the awe and wonder of the first films, any more than you can re-live your first kiss, but at least give me a little passion ...some inspiration. This movie had very little of that. It's just another pretty face, that happens to be blessed with a once-glorious family name."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,Crazy end to an amazing saga
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"Excellent show, excellent seating. I really enjoyed it"
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,Its was a masterpiece
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,Abrahams killed it!!!! Def owning this!!!!!!
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,the new star wars movie was honestly the best one out of all of them. like literally tied in all three sequels and brought in fans from three generations together. all the mysteries were explained there were no questions left at the end and the cgi although slightly overwhelming wasn’t as bad as other disney movies like marvel and it was tied in with actual practical effects. just the whole movie was brilliant and it had the best elements from all three sequels and explained so much backstory and didn’t leave any plot holes (except one) and was just all around pretty awesome movie. they did a good job ending star wars and brought out the geekiness in me which lots of new action sci fi movies lack when they make newer continuations which are targeted at a younger audience.
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,A great way to end the Skywalker saga...
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,Everything. All these years and it turns out just to be another love story!!!  But great!!
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"I liked the story and imagery, will b back to see a 2nd and hopefully 3rd time as well. Perfect wrap up to the sky walker saga"
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"This is a movie for the fans, not the critics. To really enjoy this, you have to love “Star Wars” for what it is — a great adventure story with unusual characters and heart. Is it perfect? Nope. But it’s ties up the narratives threads nicely and keeps the spirit of the original film intact. And if you have the opportunity, go see it at a 4DX theater. The motion seats and in-theater effects enhance the 3D in really cool ways that make you an active viewer in the adventure."
"Jan 7, 2020",negative,"Great special effect, terrible story line.  Extremely disappointed."
"Jan 7, 2020",negative,Anakin- you have to work really hard and train constantly to become a master                                                                                    Rey- yeah I started here
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,Although the JJ cut was not released I found this to be the best out of the last trilogy. JJ totally redeemed the final saga.
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"Loved it. A beautiful and fitting end to the saga, especially considering the narrative challenge of losing Carrie. I've seen it three times, and I will be back for more. I think the sequel trilogy is great -- fun, unexpected and soulful. I'm a huge Star Wars fan. That means I love Star Wars even when it is flawed, similar to how I love imperfect family members. Disney: please keep making Star Wars movies. And fans, let's be supportive!"
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"The latest film brings conclusion to a nine-part movie series. I am not quite sure how to describe the film. We did enjoy it and thought it to be a satisfying end to the series. To get there, however, meant sitting through some rather corny dialog, odd music, and a lot of visits with characters from previous episodes; the film seemed more interested in paying homage to the series than creating anything new and exciting. The story also felt rushed to me. I did like how it brought resolution to the question that started it regarding the power of good versus evil. I thought Adam Driver as Kylo Ren and Daisy Ridley as Ray were both very strong in their roles. Thumbs up for a film whose final quarter is much better than the rest of the film and, while not a perfect film, is still entertaining. It is not one of the better episodes, but for me, it was a decent way to end it all."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"I loved it. JJ Abrams basically had to save it for the fans after the Last Jedi, and you can see he really tried. It could never be a perfect movie, but it felt like a return to the Stars Wars I love."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,Honestly the movie was just ok a solid C. Same ole storyline absolutely no creativity very little to see new here folks. I would not see again on video nor would I purchase.
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"A nonstop, nostalgic trip down memory lane combined with some great new characters (Babu Frik, anyone???)  Only thing I didn't care for was the kiss toward the end - seemed out of character/out of place.  Other than that, really enjoyed it!"
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,Its Star Wars and George Lucas and John Williams for crise sakes!
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,Very good story line!
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"We thought that Daisy Ridleys performance was outstanding. She acted her tail off. Liked the special effects, the appearance of original characters and the little droid that looked like a dog. Love that Rey adopted the Skywalker surname. She wears it well. 
Also, enjoyed Keri Russells character, very hot. Need more of her."
"Jan 7, 2020",negative,"so much meh. I was bored the entire time. lifelong SW fan, leaving disappointed."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,I liked the story line and fantasric scenes.
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,better than I thought it was lots of action.
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,Great movie I enjoy it.
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"Star Wars the rise of the skywalkers es una muy buena película a pesar de no ser el final ""perfecto"" termina satisfactoriamente una saga de más de 40 años, es una película llena de emociones, a pesar de esto no es perfecta ya que tuvieron la oportunidad de acabar con esto ""mejor"" con el simple hecho de añadir una escena o cambiar el final de los personajes, mi calificación para Star Wars The Rise of the Skywalker es un 9.4"
"Jan 7, 2020",negative,"Boring--trite story line, hardly any dialog--perhaps 1 to 2 pages for whole movie, characters without any depth.....boring...boring...boring...."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"I enjoyed the movie. It tied everything together for me. For all you complainers, have a Coke and a smile and enjoy."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"action sequences and visual effects were great, plot and character development were a bit weak though."
"Jan 7, 2020",negative,"The movie was CGI at the forefront with poor acting built around the CGI.  The acting was laughable at times, the storyline cheesy for sure, and predictable.  There was no attention to detail, aside from ensuring the scenes were PC and millennial-friendly.  I vowed that this would be my last Star Wars that I will watch.  Hopefully no more will be produced."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,They stretched out some scenes that caused the story to drag.
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"I really enjoyed the movie! I was wary about it at first because of all the negatives things I was told prior. After watching it, I can see what other people were talking about, but I didn't think that it took away from the movie. I felt like it was a great wrap up to the trilogy."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"You know you have to see it no matter how good or bad it is, if you love Star Wars.  It’s not a total disappointment, but fails to delight as much as JJ’s first outing with the franchise.  In the end it will close the story satisfyingly on only a couple characters... and ultimately leave you wanting more answers and more Star Wars... so I guess that’s probably what Disney wants...  not all the characters get a satisfying end however..."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,Excellent movie! It ties everything up very nicely.
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"I love the way it drew everything together from all the generations together. 

I enjoyed most of the actors desperation in the last battle, which is at the end of each trilogy."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,A blast from the past... very entertaining.
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,The end left me with questions but it did bring in the old movies nicely and paid homage to hallmark characters and fan favorites.
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,Loved it with all the 4D packages
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"My boys went and they loved it. They are HUGE Star Wars fans anyway so they're happy to watch. The only thing I heard them discussing at length was the real Skywalker didn't show up. Idk what that means, but they had fun anyway"
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,A couple of slow spots but a really good movie
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,Loved it! It was a great finish to an Epic Saga! Sad to see it end!
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"It was amazing! If you hated what rian johnson did to starwars and loved the original trilogy this is a movie for you. JJ fixed starwars with this one. Only reason it isnt a full 5 stars is because it started off choppy but who could blame JJ. He had to fix the mess that rian johnson created. The ending was perfect and it was an action packed, very thrilling adventure from start to finish!"
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,This movie was INCREDIBLE!! Perfectly wrapped up the most amazing series
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,I mean what can I say that hasn't been said. It's Star Wars...if you like Star Wars movies you will like this one. Would have liked a little more closure with Kai Lo Ren in the end but that's just me being nit picky!
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,Enjoyed the wrap up after 40 years of excellent story telling. Enjoyed the Special effects as well.
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,Fun and exciting. A nice conclusion to the saga ... if you don't think too much about it afterwards.
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,Very slow start.  Saw people leave after around 30 minutes into the movie
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,The best non-original trilogy Star Wars movie.
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,It was a true emotional roller coaster of a movie. Over all I loved it. So much subject it should have been 2 movies but cleaning up after the last one they did a great job!
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"I liked the blend of action and emotion. Plenty of old and new characters. Some scenes completely blew me away. I was taken to the edge of my seat, and moments later I was holding back tears."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"Beautifully done.  Filled with all the action and surprises you'd expect from a Star Wars story.  Also, filled with a lot of emotion and wit.  A must see.  I can't wait to see it again."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,I thought it was really fantastic!! This movie was really emotional for me...I saw the very first movie..in the theater...way back when. I grew up with the characters  and just had all of the emotions!!!....well done JJ Abrams. What a ride! Will be seeing it again!
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"Dragged in places.  Liked having Luke, Leah, Han, landau etc make final appearances.effects were spectacular.   Ice closure"
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,Excellent - everything comes full circle - a lot of blanks to fill in bit a true fan won’t get lost - coils have made two movies with everything thy happened - but a satisfying movie
"Jan 7, 2020",negative,Scattered storyline. And bringing back old characters is no substitute for a good plot.
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,It stayed well within the Star Wars story lines and left it open for more.
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,Great ending to the storyline
"Jan 7, 2020",negative,"God awful pacing and completely bereft of interesting themes. Spends way too much of its time retconning the previous film, leaving this trilogy feeling like a jumble of ideas all trying to strangle one another. The final scene is embarrassing. I laughed."
"Jan 7, 2020",negative,I fell asleep during it. Wasnt enjoyable to me.
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"A theatrical space war action comedy! And a dab of romance. It had me cringing, crying, laughing and having a good time watching the end of the Saga. 
Were there a few coincidences sure, and a few things that probably would not have worked out like that...but it's a movie and things have to work out and flow. It has a lot in it to notice. If you don't remember all the other movies you might want to watch them and then go see it. 
Definitely worth see on the big screen. We enjoyed it."
"Jan 7, 2020",negative,Very disappointed.  Bad story line and bad acting.
"Jan 7, 2020",neutral,I did not like the ending and the fact that they brought back Palpateen.
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,it was really a full circle. perfect.
"Jan 7, 2020",negative,Consistent with the trash that they have been calling Star Wars since Rogue One.
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,Never bored me.  Action packed greatness
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"Good movie, not the best but pretty good. Some lame scenes."
"Jan 7, 2020",negative,"A four hour movie with a two hour run time.  It felt like a video game, get the thing to-get the thing-to get the thing.  Anakin, the chosen one, only provided a voice and never spoke to his grandson.  And the Palpatines win.  All Skywalkers are dead at the end because of Sheve.  Damn Disney."
"Jan 7, 2020",negative,Just an absolute train wreck of a movie
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"I think I was kinda lucky. I had heard so many bad reviews that I lowered my expectations, and I ended up liking it. My biggest beef is that JJ Abrams should have just accepted the events of The Last Jedi and just made the best movie he could. This isn't the best movie he could have done because he was so busy trying to undo The Last Jedi."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,Good conclusion to the series.
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,I think it was a good finish the series. It was redeem itself from the last one
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,I really like the way they tied it all together.
"Jan 7, 2020",negative,"Such a disappointment. After waiting a lifetime to see the third trilogy play out, it's all too clear that under Disney control, this last trilogy had no pre-planned story arc. Each of the three movies took its own path with no unified three-movie vision. No pay off in the end. And blasphemy in undercutting the importance of the original trilogy (undermining Darth Vader's act of killing the Emperor with Luke's guidance). I never wanted a fan-service movie either. Just something that did justice to the original nine-movie plan. I think this trilogy was worse than the prequel trilogy. The acting was far better in the last triology, but at least the prequel trilogy stuck to the original story line. As bad as the prequel scripts were, they still gave us Anakin Skywalker's story arc, cloners, Darth Maul, and General Grievous. Rey and Kylo Ren were fun, but it was hard to really care about them in the end."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,Awesome end to incredible story! Great job JJ!
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,It was one of the best Star Wars movies we’ve seen. Wow!
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"For a fan of 42 years, this was awesome and fitting ending to the series..."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,GOOD FEMALE LEAD STORYLINE CAMEO BY KYLO'S FATHER ADDED STAR POWER TO THE USUAL STORYLINE SPECIAL EFFECTS WERE GREAT EXCEPT FOR THE JEDI TRAINING FLASHBACK
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"I really loved the storyline of it all, but I really think they could of done the ending better. It is what it is."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,Excellent end to the saga. Much better than The Last Jedi.
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"Nowhere near as bad as critics are saying!  Any movie that's over 2.5 hours but doesn't feel like it is a win for me!  And as we learned from GoT finale, it's really hard to please everyone when concluding a multi-decade epic!  Pretty damn good IMO..."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"Story sagas as deep and extensive as Star Wars can only please so many fans with a run time of two and a half hours, but this has easily earned a spot as one of the best Star Wars installments of the franchise and with all things considered this climactic ending brought justice to a galaxy long awaited."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"Looked forward to seeing this segment, it had fantastic CIG, plot, action, & we were never bored."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,Good movie with a twist I wasn't expecting (no spoiler alert here). Going to see again.
"Jan 7, 2020",negative,They ruined the legacy of Anakin.
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,EXCELLENT! Just Excellent!  What an awesome end to the trilogy of trilogies. The 42 year wait was well worth this absolutely beautiful ending. No disappointment at all.
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"Spectacular many of the critics that get paid are wrong. Don’t miss this it’s like Return of the Jedi on steroids! If this is the last one it’s a great culmination to the series but leaves the door open of course you never know but it felt very satisfying and made me feel like a kid again.  I watched it in 3D and in a D-Box seat, first time ever in a D-Box seat for me and I highly recommend it. It made it into my favorite amusement park ride ever! Enjoy!"
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,Amazing on the edge action
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"Highs and lows... I laughed, I cried... I was even scared at times. Good end to the trilogy."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"Second viewing, still loved it 😊"
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"Judge for yourself, definitely a must see, some may say it’s just ok, but I enjoyed it and wasn’t disappointed, and my wife (not a fan) also enjoyed the movie. Don’t expect it to be the best movie ever, but definitely worth the night out!"
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"I have to say, I loved this movie. I thought it was a great end to the Skywalker Saga. I think Abrams did a beautiful job with the film."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"Reviewed 12.21.19  Perhaps the greatest Star Wars mystery of all is why Disney would approach the most cherished movie saga in history in such a haphazard manner. For 2015's 'The Force Awakens' they gave JJ Abrams complete creative control. He's a talented director but he made it clear he would only contribute to one installment. Can you imagine being responsible for a multi-billion dollar franchise and deciding 'meh, let JJ do one and we'll figure out the rest from there.' 

But amazingly enough, that was exactly their plan. Did it work? Fans will debate it till the end of this galaxy. But to critics (and fans of quality writing), it did not. One succinct and original story from the mind of one talented writer/director would have avoided this whole mess. Instead we're left with a 'trilogy pastiche,' sort of speak. Too many ideas, too many characters, and simply not enough time to cram it all in. But try they did.

Abrams got the whole affair off to an unimaginative start by inexplicably choosing to rehash major plot points from the original trilogy. From the ridiculous appearance of yet another death star (but this one is bigger!), to an almost identical antagonist (but this one is bigger!), to the repeated dialogue from earlier films, the whole thing reeked of a shameless nostalgia grab. 

To top it off, Abrams decided to introduce a new lead cast of characters as opposed to focusing on the original set fans were dying to revisit. In doing so he robbed fans of a deep dive into the franchise's most beloved characters and a chance to see them ride off into a double sunset one final time. I mean, isn't it called the Skywalker saga for a reason?  Call me crazy to think the guy the whole series is named after might actually be the focus.  Couldn't the new cast of characters have been introduced in a subsequent trilogy? 

To his credit though, once he made his fateful decision, he created some interesting characters. Rey is a hero for a new generation while Kylo Ren introduced a freshly nuanced spin on the dark side. But unfortunately, given the off the cuff writing process, they were never fully developed as the installments progressed.  The result is the loss of what could have been a deep emotional return to the original characters, or what could have been the next great trilogy.  As a result, it traded what could have been two great trilogies for one overstuffed version.  

For 2017's 'The Last Jedi,' the creative keys were turned over to a new writer/director, Rian Johnson. As talented as he is (see Looper, Breaking Bad, Knives Out), it is inconceivable that he was permitted to take the story wherever he wanted. But he was, and boy did he. No spoilers but suffice it to say, he made choices that completely derailed Abrams imagined plot line. Thankfully, he did so to exciting effect, injecting some desperately needed surprises and originality. But with his efforts also a one off, it left two men's visions to be stuffed into one final chapter.

That brings us to 'The Rise of Skywalker,' where JJ Abrams decided to return after all.  But get this, it was originally scheduled to be written and directed by a third director (Colin Treverrow)!  It's stunning that a company with Disney's pedigree could ever be so careless.  Three writer/directors with three different styles/visions is a recipe for disaster.  And some feel that was the result.  I am not one of them.  Although it's frustrating that the trilogy isn't what it could have been, credit must be given.  Despite their opposing visions, the Abrams/Johnson team managed to create three highly entertaining movies.  Highly flawed too, and that's the rub.  

That preamble complete, 'The Rise of Skywalker' is the hodge-podge you'd expect.  There is so much to work with, after 42 years of story development, but much time is wasted trying to tie up all the newly created loose ends.  And some questions are simply never answered.  Like what happened to the little boy that used 'the force' to move his broom at the end of The Last Jedi?  His existence had to be addressed since he represents either a completely new understanding of 'the force' as an ability that anyone can possess, a democratization of 'the force,' if you will.  Or he somehow has a bloodline to explain his ability.  Either way, it's a game changer.  It was a bold move by Rian Johnson and it's a major blunder to not revisit him in some fashion.

That said, the remaining big questions are indeed answered, to varying effect.  Rey's parentage is revealed, but leaves a whole new line of unanswered questions.  Kylo Ren makes his final choice, to heartening effect.  But for every emotional moment that hits home, there's another that falls flat, due to the aforementioned lack of development.  The end result is representative of the entire process.  A story for the ages, led by talented forces, battling Disney's hubris.  Do they prevail?  Well, it's a fun ride, but you're left wishing it all felt a bit more triumphant."
"Jan 7, 2020",negative,What a mess! Why did they bother making this slop?
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"Rushed plot, loop holes. Visually stunning though."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,I loved everything! I was taken away to the worlds of Star Wars!
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"I was afraid to go see the film that was marking the end of an era that began when I was 12. Would it disappoint me terribly, like The Last Jedi did after regaining my  Star Wars excitement watching The Force Awakens?  I managed my trepidation, bit the bullet and went. I could tell pretty early from the tone and cinematography that I would ay least like it...& I did. Was it perfect? No. But then, what is? It was good enough. Good enough that I laughed, cried, jumped in my skin, clutched my seat and felt all the nostalgia of 40 years of Star Wars. If I could commission the makers to tinker with it another 6 months to achieve that epic perfection few films attain, sure, I would but was I satisfied at the end. I was... a lil confused about some things, but satisfied, all the same. A 3-star Farewell to a legend of the industry."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"This is a movie made for a 2019 audience.... tons of action, tons of characters, almost too much going on. Its hard to pick a time to run for a refill. Finals chapters are always tough because there is so much to tie up. This did a pretty adequate job of addressing as much as one movie could while still bringing some fresh plot points. We all came out of the theater quoting different parts and reminding each other of new characters and aspects to the new worlds. If you are looking for something that doesn't exist, like a time machine, you won't find it (go back to the 80's brah). However, if you want a film consistent with the quality JJ Abrams brought to LOST then this is your flick! #starwarsforever"
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,Fantastic everything!
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"I liked it, it played out differently than I thought it would."
"Jan 7, 2020",negative,"Let's get this out of the way. Yes, I loved the original Star Wars movies, who didn't? I want to love these too. I was onboard after the first part of Rey's story from JJ Abrams, but this one was ab-so-lute GARBAGE!! They crammed so much crap into a meaningless story it was ridiculous. They completely forgot the reason people loved the originals...they developed the characters into ones we loved, and the story was unique, but not over the top. It was cast perfectly. This one was so crammed with so many holes and unfortunately bad characters, it just sucked. Nevermind that you have a stormtrooper that escaped from the Empire, let's just make him a meaningless background story. It had potential...right before they turned the lights out and those famous words scrolled on the screen."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,Wish it could’ve been longer and have a bit more action but other than that it was pretty good
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,Great plot and action!!
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,Very good movie and a good ending to Star Wars. Even though I love them
"Jan 7, 2020",negative,"Star Wars:Ascensão Skywalker é um filme que deveria ser descartado,um péssimo final para uma saga com mais de 40 anos,álias mais que uma saga é a familia Skywalker,parece até que o roteirista e o diretor (J.J Abrams) insultam os fãns a todo momento,um final incoerente e incompetente fazendo desta trilogia da Disney sem sentido algum e que  contribui com nada de bom na história,um filme de puro Fãservice que tenta agradar/emocionar a todos e a todo momento mas que no final acabou agradando ninguém."
"Jan 7, 2020",neutral,"Messy conclusion. This feels like a remake of Return of the Jedi. Safe filmmaking, with zero gambles. The first hour is tough, really tough to sit through. We're suppose to swallow a villain has been alive this whole time without any explanation. Things do ramp up towards the end, but Abrams and Disney have really nailed the coffin shut here. Uninspired and meaningless film, and it's a shame. The storyline is tedious and a stepping stone for the so called fanboy groups that called The Last Jedi a mess. This is a real mess. It's a shame Rian Johnson didn't write and direct this trilogy. This film has forced story beats, nothing flows. It's all for fan service, essentially box office glorification, Lucas never did this. Where's the risks? Disappointing conclusion after the great work done in The Last Jedi. What happened to the spark to ignite the rebels? What happened to the child at the end of the last film? Too many holes, and characters left to the side. Finn is here for no real reason. I wasn't a giant fan of the remake of Last Hope by  Abrams, but at least it had some originality with set pieces. Disney's influence was obviously too much here. 20/12/2019"
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"I like the fast paced action and that it didnt detract too much from the story which was well done and how I wish the last few Star Wars movies would have flowed.  A few characters were not key players as in past films, but they developed others better.  Worth the trip to the movie theatre to see it."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,Not great not terrible
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"I have, at my age, been lucky enough to see every single Star wars movie made since the very first. To keep this extremely simple, it follows the same exact pattern and formula of success, but unfortunately does absolutely nothing new at all. it's receiving negative reviews for that fact alone. I'm one of the few people who actually thinks the character of Rey is very disappointing. And even more so, not only her character, but most of the movie is just lacking. There are very few moments that seem real at all, and most are without emotion through the whole film. the thing that is missing in Norma SLI and instantly recognizable about this installment oh, is that it takes itself way, way, way too seriously and is not lighthearted fun. I have heard JJ Abrams filmed more than four and a half hours total, and I'll wait for the release so that because I would say the quality is laying on the floor.
This is not to say isn't entertaining, it isn't cool to go see the new Star wars movie oh, but it just really doesn't do anything different.
There are much better movies coming out soon thankfully."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,My kids and I loved this movie We are huge fans of Star Wars and it was a great ending to this trilogy. Im gonna miss seeing Rey and Finn and Poe. They are truly a great team and loved watching them on these last 3 movies.
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,Star Wars awesomeness!
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,I liked that the storyline was answered. I enjoyed that so many of the characters were included.
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"Poor character development, same fights with lasers and ships. 42 years later R2D2 still looks like a vacuum cleaner, C3Po is no closer to being a true android, Chew Bacca still only speaks....his language(?) and wardrobe is the same. Keyvword: All the same. I liked the music."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"My sister and I loved this film! It was well put together, and the cast and storytelling and visuals were astounding. It's definitely a must watch on the big screen!"
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,I found it convenient in a lot of places but overall I found it enjoyable.
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"Loved it, Star wars storytelling at its best."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,It was okay. It could be better though
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"Not a bad movie, it has a lot of emotion and provides a good ending for this trilogy. However  fails to capture the original story essence and seems to force some aspects of the plot."
"Jan 7, 2020",negative,Movie bogged down until about the last 20 minutes. Too many writers changing the overall story arc through three films.
"Jan 7, 2020",negative,"I was hesitant to go to see this one after the previous entry in the trilogy.
Although JJ Abrams did a fair job introducing the characters in the first installment.
I'm not sure where you should place the blame for how this movie turned out.
Unfortunately it was not even close to saving the series or the franchise.
The tatters of the saga were revived and stretched beyond breaking point as far as storytelling goes.
Inconsistent with it's own internal logic, treads all over Original movies arc and the sentiment of 'the force'. 
Overall, a terrible movie, but if I had to pick a couple of positive points...
It's better than Last Jedi and the Effects were great. 
Not exactly a high bar."
"Jan 7, 2020",neutral,"Bad Star Wars movie. Good on its own if you aren't a big SW fan. 
I liked the big dramatics and the fact that it made me sob buckets, but the ending was shoddy and the title of the movie makes little to no sense when you think about the plot."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,Nice finale to the series.
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"Good moments, but too many plot holes for me to really enjoy it. A viewer should not have to have a Star Wars movie explained to them by the internet. This means you’ve done a bad job with your movie."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,Sucker for happy endings...
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"True to the original trilogy with plenty of nods to Lucas. I hate that this story is ending,  but love, love,  love this film!"
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,It was much better than I expected since Rotten Tomatoes gave it such a bad rating.  I liked everything about it
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,Awesome conclusion!!!👍
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"The Rise of Skywalker is basically J.J. Abrams trying to salvage Star Wars from the disastrous Last Jedi. Though some of the it plot is forced upon you, I think J.J. did a pretty good Job all things considered."
"Jan 7, 2020",negative,"We could talk all day about all the bad parts of this movie from poor pacing to lack of developing its own plot points, but here's what makes this movie genuinely unforgivable:

1. Rey Palpatine and Rey Skywalker both. Rey was done so dirty in this movie from Kylo's ""they sold you to protect you line"" to the final shot of Rey alone on a desert that means nothing to her, claiming a surname of ghosts with less belonging and family then she started the movie with. A blatant middle finger to the only thing Rey has ever wanted and the whole trajectory of Rey's character arc. 

2. Rose Tico was cut out of the story. Rose Tico had barely any lines during this movie, rescinded to a character role equaling Snap Wexley's, Kaydel Connix's, and Wedge Antiles's. This was done, in spite of the fact that Rose Tico was set up as a main front and center character in the last movie. And this was done probably to appease the incredibly racist backlash against Rose Tico, which drove Kelly Marie Tran off social media.

3. Poe Dameron's pre-established backstory was erased to make the Latino character a drug dealer. The Rise of Skywalker includes a plot point of Poe Dameron seeking out Babu Frik, an old friend from Poe's newly invented background as a Spice Runner. The comics for Poe Dameron, made by Lucasfilm and Disney, leave absolutely no room for Poe to be a dug dealer and he was with the Resistence from the get-go. Just another instance of blatant racism in this movie.

4. Finn deserved better. Finn doesn't do much in this movie. He screams ""Rey"" a lot. He hints at being force sensitive, but this whacko movie apparently can't find the time to actually address this except to take the power of Finn's choice to leave the First Order and pin it on ""the force told me to do it"" and to sense Rey ""dying.""

5. This movie also blatantly retcons The Last Jedi in a sloppy and honestly petty way, but honestly that's really not important in the light of what this movie did to its characters.

So why even give it two stars? Because there were two good things I liked in this movie. 

Firstly, Kylo Ren was good. Kylo Ren's arc was definitely not superbly written, but it was a lot better done than literally every other character so beggars can't be choosers I guess. The ok writing combined with Adam Driver literally carrying Kylo Ren on his back makes Kylo Ren the shining diamond in the rough of this movie (though Kylo Ren retconning his own words from The Last Jedi and telling Rey her parents sold her to protect her fills me with more righteous rage than Kylo Ren has ever felt in his life). Also, the first scene in this movie was badass.

2. The trio dynamic was really fun and enjoyable. Yessss, give me a Rey and Poe that lowkey just do not like each other and do not get along, but love Finn so damn much, so they put up with each other while simultaneously being snotty.  I love it. Despite all the heart break this movie put me through, rest assured I would watch another trilogy of Finn, Rose, Rey, and Poe going on whacky fetch quests, but only if Rose is in them goddamnit."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,Was an Awsome tie up tie up to the trilogy
"Jan 7, 2020",negative,The only parts I enjoyed were the references to the original movies

"Jan 7, 2020",positive,Storyline rushed throughout.
"Jan 7, 2020",negative,Exhausting. Except for one or two technically beautiful scenes I came out of the movie with a blinding headache.
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,it was done very good and the end was well writing i think all the bad reviews are not really seeing what it took to make this movie as good as it was. i always say if you could do better lets see. love bobby lee 007 ps watch how many go and see it again and buy it when it comes to blu ray.

"Jan 7, 2020",positive,It dotted the Is and crossed the Ts!

"Jan 7, 2020",positive,A satisfying conclusion to the Skywalker Saga
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,It was OK.   The story is a parallel to Return of the Jedi unfortunately.   Same story with different characters.
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"SPOILER REVIEW
After learning that The Rise of Skywalker was a ""splat"" on rotten tomatoes, I was devastated and had extremely low expectations walking into the theatre. But by the end of the movie I was skeptical of the critics' interpretation… This movie was awesome! While I would have appreciated less CGI, the character development was excellent. Per the Disney standard, the movie's writers wove the new trilogy into the original trilogy intricately and fascinatingly. Leia's back story – however brief – enhanced her character and made us fall in love with her all over again. I also loved that the Rey and Ben learned to use their force connection intentionally, which allowed for one of the best transitions of the entire series when Rey holds Leia's lightsaber behind her back, and it appears in Ben's hand so he can take down the Knights of Ren. I didn't know it before The Rise of Skywalker, but the concept of the Sith home planet Exegol was missing from the series and truly demonstrated a balance in the force. We've seen Jedi temples, the Jedi counsel on Coruscant, and a sacred Jedi library tree thing on the island where Luke lived in exile. Why not a Sith equivalent? I was not so impressed by the expansive fleet of star-destroyers – all with planet-killing capabilities no less. While impressive, it was also a bit far-fetched. I appreciated the drama, but it strayed from the monstrous yet refined vibe of the original empire. The struggle between Palpatine and his GRANDAUGHTER (wow!!!!!) made me confident in the film again. A battle of wills between the spirits of all of the Sith and all of the Jedi is the perfect climactic point for the final installation in this trilogy of trilogies. The poetic final scene, when Rey buries Luke and Leia's lightsabers on Tatooine, is an unforgettable moment of nostalgia, and it seems fitting that Rey has a bright yellow lightsaber; a new Kyber Crystal for a new age of the Jedi."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,Wasnt my favorite Star Wars. Mediterranean Bowl was not edible.
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,It’s Star Wars stop thinking and enjoy
"Jan 7, 2020",negative,Hated it everything was so messy and bad explanations to everything!
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,Love the story unfolding for Rey
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"Amazing score, and I enjoyed the story, and appreciated the tie up of everything. My only real complaint is how they handled the Force ghosts.... not quite in keeping with the way I thought the thing worked.  But definitely worth watching."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,Sad that this was the last Star Wars movie and that I didn't get to see it with my dad.
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,I am not big onto star wars but this one was really good
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,Wish fin could have hooked up with Ren
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"Too busy, hard to focus, I actually fell asleep."
"Jan 7, 2020",negative,"A horrible conclusion to the Disney star wars trilogy. It spends so much time retconing things from the last jedi that they don't cohesively tie together at all. It's filled with plot holes, pointless emotionless character deaths, characters who serve no purpose other then selling merchandise and terrible humor. It spends so much time looking back on the older films that it does a horrible job of standing on its own. What should be an epic conclusion to a three movie narrative feels like an improvised disaster."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,Wrapped up the story line nicely
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,Rise of Skywalker did a good job wrapping up the Skywalker saga. Awesome action scenes and a very cool twist.
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"Ok ending. No emotion and zero plot. 
All CGI. It was time to end it."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,Loved it!  Better than we expected a sequel to be!  Cant wait for the next chapter!
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,Wonderful wrap up to the whole saga.
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,Wrapped up the saga very well. It was exciting and I thoroughly enjoyed it.
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,A little too long..typical Star Wars movie meh
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,Great action-Great casting-Great visuals Ties into the history of the story
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"I truly enjoyed Star Wars IX
A great conclusion of 42 years of Skywalker !
JJ Abram did a great job!"
"Jan 7, 2020",negative,Uninteresting movie.
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,Loved it. Ignore the haters. J.J. did a great job. Second time seeing it  just as good.
"Jan 7, 2020",negative,"It seemed like they packed way too much content/plot into this movie in an effort to make up for or undo the events of The Last Jedi.  Some of the concepts were actually really cool, but a lot seemed shoehorned in when it didnt need to be, and I found myself questioning a lot of things that didnt make much sense.  I could see how it was probably difficult for some people to keep up with what was happening (the older gentleman a few seats down was actually snoring at one point).

If you feel like you have to see it simply because its the last of the series, I would wait until its streaming."
"Jan 7, 2020",negative,"Visually very good, but a limp plot line with far-fetched crap-ola going on and complete ignorance of space and physics.  Recycled drama and everybody 'sacrificing their lives' for each other - including some old Jedi holograms to instill wisdom.  Been there, done that - give us something NEW."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"It was good. Not great, but good enough."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,I really loved this movie and would go see it many more times!! However I did not like when Ben Solo died he was the best character in the sequels and deserved a better ending :(
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,Beyond what I expected based on previous reviews
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"The to fast movement of the ships flying upset my vertigo, otherwise the movie was well done and exciting."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,Basically same story line minus the great actors from the old movies. Would have liked to seen a tribute to all the old characters who made this series so great.
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,Finally fixed the garbage worst Jedi movie.  It had great plot twists and completed the story respectfully.
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,Unlike many reviews out there.  I think this movie was absolutely excellent.  I was locked in from beginning to end.  Everything you want in a movie and more.  I feel the way they ended the story was great.
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"So, I've had a long time to think about this movie. I saw it on the 20th, and left the theatre happy, however a lot of my expectations were subverted so I left confused as well, I didn't know if I loved this movie. So I spent two weeks thinking about it, then I went to see it again with my family. I enjoyed it even more the second time. I noticed deeper meanings that the film was trying to convey, even more Easter eggs (a lot of fan service isn't always a bad thing, especially if it's Star Wars) and I had more fun knowing where the film was going and accepting the things that happened. The reason I don't give this a full five stars is because it should have been longer. The first half of this movie crams a lot of things into it really fast and reminds me of how Transformers 5 was cut; very quick where a scene didn't feel like it ended properly. There are rumours on how Disney is the reason behind most of the mistakes and elements left out of the film, and that it was supposed to be 3 hours long. All in all, it is a good movie whether you're a fan of the force awakens and even the last Jedi, a lot of people are overlooking elements of this film that make it truly wonderful."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,love it from the beginning to the end ! great job 👍
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"A bit maudlin in its dialogue and character conflicts, but a really fun action movie to be sure."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,I didn't hate it. It felt a bit clumsy at the start a bit forced in the middle and twisty at the end. The sound and visual FX were phenomenal. I will be watching again when it comes out on Bluray and see if a second viewing helps making the story stick together any better.
"Jan 7, 2020",negative,"A disappointing letdown to one of the biggest movie franchises of all time. Throughout the movie, it was clear that they didn't care about the last movie and practically retconned everything that happened."
"Jan 7, 2020",positive,"I enjoyed the movie, but I felt that the previous movie, THE LAST JEDI,  was better.  I feel like they could have developed the characters a bit more, however, that would have made the movie longer and it already quite long."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,The “last” movie in the Star Wars Skywalker canon is both a present and disappointment to both fans and new moviegoers. J.J. Abrams took the same idea of the Force Awakens and “tries” to incorporate a sensible plot after Rian Johnson’s last Star Wars movie the Last Jedi. After it was announced that J.J. Abrams was replacing the original director for Episode X we can see this was strictly a movie grab decision by Disney. All I can say is ....just enjoy the ending. Star War fans deserves better from Disney
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,I thoroughly enjoyed the movie ride that the Star Wars crew gave us. I want to go see this movie again!
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,An action filled end to the SW Saga.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"A fantastical ending to the Star Wars saga.  With all the spin off potentials, I hope that they continue to produce more Star Wars movies in the future!"
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Had a great experience fun ride
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Perfect ending to the 3 trilogy set of movies!
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"FANTASTIC!!!
Will see it many more times!!"
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Thoroughly enjoyable...!
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,It was a great finale to the most recent trilogy. Easily the best of the three movies.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,It was action packed and fun to watch and full of a few surprises.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"It was a little predictable, and it was hard to connect to it. I just felt like oh this is great and then i would be like nope its the same movie as last time."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,so much action it's hard to keep pace with it all.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Loved this movie best of the series
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Likes how they transitioned from old characters to the new characters
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,"A confounding, 2.5 hour blunder through exhaustingly predictable tropes (which are not bad by nature) that left a lifetime SW fan ready to leave the theater. The only reason I didn't was because this movie felt like witnessing a train derailment take place over 150 minutes: it was dreadful and inexorable, a bad thing to happen to the world, but I had to finish watching just to know how it ended."
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,"Huge disappointment.  I have always loved Star Wars movies and shows, including ""Solo,"" and ""Last Jedi,""  but this movie sucked all of the joy out of the newer characters during the first 90 minutes of the movie.  Unlike all of the other character driven movies of the past this was a mostly plot driven story that felt very rushed until the final parts of the story.  I hope this poorly written movie doesn't discourage Disney from making movies with these newer characters in the near future, because the definitely deserve a better final chapter to their stories."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Good continuation of storyline. Good ending. Space battles werent up to my expectations though. Still a must see!
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"Loved it. As a fan it it felt good. It helps knowing background from star wars universe such as SWTOR or Wikis. Lots of little easter eggs to pick up. The golden sabre, brilliant! Force chose her a sentinel crystal. For those confused by the Reylo relationship you're only seeing a snapshot of the constant connections to the force these two keep getting in the unshown story. Their diad is a very rare thing in Star Wars lore and it makes sense that these two had strong emotions going. The softer side of Rey wanted Ben, not Kylo. She was attracted to him and could see his wounded heart. She wanted to help him. Even though the dark side had control over him. Yeah its dramatic but so is the whole saga. 

Also the whole thing of Jedi not having relationships is out the window in this era. Old ways are dead, literally one trained Jedi left. The story becomes more about the will of the force (diad) than about organisations. (Lightning, trying to burn the books). I thought it was great that it went more this way. I'm surprised Finn has been kicking up a stink about that aspect but I do think there should be a side story movie to him since they showed he was a force sensitive adult. I think the chances of this will be lowered now :( I never got the feeling Finn and Rey would be an item. I'd have to watch 7 again :) Finn is a great actor and more should come of that."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"Great movie but it seemed rushed. Crammed so much in, that some story lines were not fleshed out completely."
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,It was boring and did not wrap any of the last 40 years up. It really was a bomb.
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,"Carbon Copy of Episode VI. Feels bad knowing they ruined the story of Vader by bringing palpatine back. Also both sides went from no ships to about 100,000 in a 2 minute span."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Excellent!!! I LOVED IT! Don’t listen to the a Negative Comments! Go See It!
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,We enjoyed it.  Didn't over analyze or criticize.
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,"A complete cinematic failure! This movie is plain trash, very hard to follow and in my opinion one of Disney's greatest failures if not its greatest. Star Wars movies 1 to 6 have nothing to do with this nightmare. A big thumbs down!!!!"
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Fixed all the errors from Last Jedi (which was awful)
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"As far as Star Wars Movies go, it was O.K.,  Certainly better than the disaster that was ""The Last Jedi"" . But there was too much crammed in, and some of the plot made little sense. Far too little was explained as to Palpatine's return/resurrection, for example."
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,"This movie was ASS, and it makes no sense in the continuity of the “trilogy”. I want my money back Disney!"
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Finally a good Star Wars movie... BUT! We need more Vader
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,"Pretty good photography, I can give that to it, but the number of plotholes way too important, the awful script, and the ending that just destroies everything that happened between episode 1 to 6 and make them irrelevant... this movie is just a treason to Star Wars and good cinema."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Still after seeing the movie three times the retcon of The Last Jedi is unforgivable. The Emperor is unnecessary. As JJ tries to satisfy The haters
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,It was a great way to end the saga ~ the action met expectations previous Star Wars movies
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,a little slow i think in the beginning but SUPER good plot twists and ending
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Perfect! A good ending for Skywalker.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,I liked the special effects as well as the acting and story line.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,I loved it. I can’t wait for the next one.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,While I love Star Wars I felt this flick was specifically aimed at males between the ages of 11 - 15 ... can not explain this family other then it was shared by my date to the movie
"Jan 6, 2020",neutral,"A disappointment yet still fun to watch. Very impressive visuals and enjoyable fan service but a story that, like The Force Awakens, leaned heavily on the original trilogy as a crutch to satisfy fans. I'm sure as time goes by, I'll learn to live with it, but for now it leaves a bad feeling in my stomach."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"The film is flawed and has issues with the flow of the film without a doubt it was a last minute finale throw together to hopefully satisfy the hardcore Star Wars fans.
I was entertained and found tons of enjoyment from the movie though i can completely understand why someone would be dissapointed."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"I would love to see an uncut version to see how it all fits together, but I enjoyed how they tied up all the loose ends.  The story was a little rushed, but over all I loved it. I loved all the “cameos” of people and critters through the years. Watching Carrie Fisher’s last film moments was a little surreal but I liked how that even turned out. Caught a few more things the second time around of watching it that I missed the first time. Glad I watched on the big screen before it came to video."
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,"Over stuffed plot this should have been all three of the movies. 
Then I have to Wish they would respect the old Star Wars and stop misrepresenting Fisher ( you can't OD on the force  Leaving her in the bed for half the movie ).
In True JJ fashion there are a lot of setups with no pay off( I need to tell you...., Storm Troopers rebel....., Horses one a Star Ship.....) 
It's Pretty and Rey trains (IN the Last Movie....) but really would like my time and money back on this one."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"Loved it !! Story line was good , lots of action and special effects."
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,It may be worse than Hudson Hawk.
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,La peor bazofia de star wars....un insulto a la inteligencia del espectador
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"Loved it!  It was long, but I never was bored.  It was well edited and told an interesting story.  Well worth going to on the big screen."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Great movie - I don’t know what those haters are saying but they can hate all they want - go out there and appreciate the movie. Landed all the marks. I left the theater with a big smile on my face!
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Nice little bow out on top of the Skywalker saga
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,Not much could be done after the mess that was The Last Jedi. This was a complete train wreck.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Not sure what the critics were hoping for.  Our whole family was cheering in their seats by the end.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,A good ending and final one at that to one of the longest running movie sagas in motion picture history. Well done!!! “The circle is now complete” Ben Kinobee
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,"You ruined my childhood, played outside of cannon, disgraced the entire cast of the original films, undermined Darth Vador's character arch, didn't even spell check the script... It goes on and on and on Disney who are you hiring!? I could have made a better trilogy by myself, I wish I had applied... not that you would have taken it seriously. I spit on Disney and reject everything they put out. You will never make it up to me even the Video games are trash. Mcguffin quest, contrived bs movie that isn't even Star Wars."
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,"Face it: Like every other Star Wars diehard fan, you've been used to disappointment. You knew this film will most likely be another disappointment after being let down from TLJ. Yet, like every other diehard fan, you still went out to Theater to see this film.

I know because I am one of those diehard fanboys. And I'm glad I'm now done with the (now) finale of the emotional rollercoaster we know was the Star Wars Saga.

Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker tries to maintain the magic of the original while salvaging what was left from the previous episode. There are many nods to the previous episodes and some attempts at genuine humor in this film. Expect a ton of nostalgia fanservice. Yet, all the goodwill Disney tries to impose on this film isn't enough to save it.

There are massive plotholes that I won't disclose -- I'll let the YouTubers do that. There are characters that don't resonate with the audience. Loose ends don't get wrapped up. Where there are scenes that could have a significant consequence, Disney continues to play it safe and continue to please fans wanting nostalgia.

If you are a Star Wars fan, this movie won't make much sense. If you are new to Star Wars, this film won't make much sense. As a standalone movie, this film cannot hold up by itself.

1/5. Better than TLJ, but not enough to save this sinking ship. Forgettable at best and a disservice to fans at its worst."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,There was a plot to follow. I didnt like the love scene between Rey and Ben
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Haters gonna hate! It was great!
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,it was great story line and had good action scenes
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,I thought it was a good end to an amazing story.
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,i think i can write something much better....
"Jan 6, 2020",neutral,"My initial reaction to this movie was something like exhaustion. I walked out of the theater breathless, as if stepping off a roller coaster. The rushed pace and little of actual substance is what makes this movie frustrating for me. Since the plot can basically be summed up as a bloated cast of characters trying find this McGuffin to find that McGuffin so they can find the place where things will finally happen, it really could have slowed down, stopped introducing new characters when the established characters already had little to do, and spent time exploring the interesting elements, particularly the Sith planet.

It was clear watching this there was never a plan for this trilogy. The original Star Wars trilogy can be forgiven for not having a plan since the first film was a sleeper hit (almost) everyone involved expected to go straight to late-night TV and be forgotten forever. There was no excuse this time. Disney decided to make three movies before they knew what they would be about. It is a shame so much talent and resources were squandered on this mess. They wrote themselves into a corner with the Last Jedi, and the Rise of Skywalker cleaned up the damage in the only way it could. But not entirely: we never learn how Luke's light saber ended up with Maz Kanata in the Force Awakens (although I had already given up on learning this when Luke tossed it away like a piece of garbage in the Last Jedi). Elements are set up at, such as Jannah's possible relation to Lando Calrissian, and something important Finn needs to tell Rey, but ultimately don't pay off. Supposedly this movie was being edited up to two days before the release, and it shows. I did like how this movie patched up the problems from the Last Jedi and avoided any ""woke"" social commentary (damage control?). At the same time though, this movie undid the significance of the original trilogy. Since this trilogy was basically a remake of the original, in effect the original trilogy, including Darth Vader's sacrifice, didn't amount to anything. In that sense, the sequel trilogy ruined the original. And we never even got a scene with Luke, Han and Leia together again! (Unforgivable missed opportunity.)

This movie also ruins the emotional elements within it. Without getting into spoilers, everything of emotional impact gets undone a few minutes later. It is reminiscent of the droid factory sequence in Attack of the Clones--once you realize nothing is really at stake, you just feel bored and frustrated. Another criticism in the same vein is the Force literally has no rules or limitations in these films. It took all of Luke's concentration to pull his light saber a few feet from the snow with the Force in the Empire Strikes Back. Here Rey can stop a spaceship mid-flight with little effort using the Force. Emperor Palpatine seemed to shock Luke for a few dozen seconds in Return of the Jedi without him suffering any lasting physical damage. Rey causes a spaceship to blow up with a brief spurt of Force lightning. In Empire when Luke was caught in the snowstorm, he nearly froze to death and had to spend the night in a snow camel's body cavity. I have a feeling if Rey were in a similar situation in one of these movies she would just conjure up a thermal Force bubble. The lack of limitations doesn't make much sense and constantly lowers the stakes, making these movies boring.

Ultimately, all I need to say about the movie is this: Every time I've described it to someone who hasn't seen it, giving away spoilers and recounting the still-born, awkward Millennial humor, it always elicited laughter at how ridiculous it sounds in the telling. Return of the Jedi had me in tears at the end, the Rise of Skywalker had me scoffing. That is certainly not the reaction you should have to Star Wars."
"Jan 6, 2020",neutral,"Rotten Tomatoes lies, cheats on the score, definitely paid by the corporate mouse and giving it an audience score of 86%... hmmm.

So in short, The Rise of Skywalker is a horribly written, illogical mess with some really cool scenes, sound design, fight scenes. Thanks to those, it was somewhat enjoyable but also really cringy at points. You don't write a trilogy on the go! They could have written it before making The Force Awakens. They had no idea what they want to do with this trilogy which is sad, because whole TFA was very convenient and safe, at least it gave the rest room to do something with it. We got some decent characters, new places, new story arc but... well The Last Jedi destroyed it and the The Rise of Skywalker couldn't save it... actually it made it even worse.

I'm heartbroken over this trilogy. It's a mess!"
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"loved it. Every generation is confronted with the struggle between light and darkness. My generation had the original trilogy, my kids will have this one. they both tell the story in their own way. I think this trilogy was a success."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,I really like the characters they have developed.  I felt the movie answered a lot of questions.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"It reminded me of early (4, 5 &6) Star Wars."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"I loved this movie. It made Episode 7 and Episode 8 make complete sense, tied the story together nicely. Lots of action, quips, and suspense, well written story, great acting, great effects... I was very happy with what JJ Abrams did with this. This trilogy is awesome."
"Jan 6, 2020",neutral,5 out of 10 - Very formulaic.  Glad it is finally over.  Not worth a second viewing.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,loved seeing original characters.  very entertaining.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,It was long. Ultimately worth it.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"an astounding , breath-taking and epinefrine-filled closure for the saga George Lucas started back in 1977. Coherent, visually amazing and with a compelling story. Loved it, as I loved the previous 8 episodes"
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"Excellent action scenes, liked that Rey a Woman saved the Galaxy and I enjoyed seeing characters who had died in past movies"
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,The force is strong with this one. Great movie from beginning to end. I saw on IMAX screen which was awesome.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Finally got to watch it. And the biggest lesson learned for me. It doesn’t matter how deep blood runs in you. You don’t have to become your parents! You always have a choice to become someone way better than why you were born into!!! Resist the wrongs your parents and their parents made and create/birth what’s right for you and your own future!
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Awesomeness Great add on to Star Wars legacy
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"I liked it. After considering the entire trilogy, I think it was hurt by the change of directors/writers at the midpoint, but apart from that, the story was solid, and the acting (especially on the part of the Driver/Ridley)) was great. It was long, but could have been longer. Lots of content to cover."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,IS GOOD LOVE THIS MOVIE
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"Like cotton candy...enjoyable, empty of nutrients, over quickly, doesnt really make sense. Lower your expectations and try to enjoy."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"There is a level of convenience of circumstance throughout the film, but overall they resolve almost all the plot points from this trilogy while still shouting out the classic Star Wars films. I enjoyed it more than I expected to. My two nieces, however, were bored out of their mind."
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,GoFundMe for Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley for carrying the entire franchise on their backs and for the cast for doing their best with a wonkass script. It's only a 2 because it was a wild ride (if you only go to turn off your brain) and the Ben/Rey relationship.
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,"No story, lacks character development, total fail imo"
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"For true fans of the Skywalker series, it was an emotional roller coaster in a good way."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Fitting end to a great series.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"It’s a good movie, the unfortunate thing is that there is no consistency with all 9 episodes this final episode was a disappointment it’s like they didn’t make any effort to create a new villain"
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,I always enjoy the special effects and yes the story of good vs. evil. It’s an evolving new story line I hope as actor/ actresses from the original series from the 70’s-age out or have passed.
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,A disappointing end to an unnecessary trilogy. Sad to see this happen to such a beloved franchise.
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,"story line was okay, not great acting and too many unnecessary additions to plot and characters to make it worth watching. Seems comedy aspect doesn't  quite work either. This movie is worth watching when streaming  free on live tv not worth paying theater prices for lack luster film."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"It's the best Star Wars film since Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back. JJA got handed a steaming pile by Rian Johnson. He also had to cope with a missing lead actress - Carrie Fisher. He navigated some difficult story elements and still managed to make a compelling, entertaining film with plenty of drama, action, and excellent dialog (which is a huge departure from any of the terrible Lucas dialog in Episodes I-III). It was a fitting end to the Skywalker saga...and I thought he ended it perfectly. Absolutely perfectly."
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,"Its pacing is a mess, lots of it makes no sence and has no direction. no good action."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Great way to wrap up the Skywalker storyline. Or did they...?
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,"This movie was slightly better than The Last Jedi, but that's not really saying anything. The Rise of Skywalker lightspeed skips its way along making this movie seem very rushed & it fails very badly in answering the many questions & plot absurities that come up. This movie would have been far better if it slowed the pacing &  spent time to develop the story."
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,This movie was all over the place. It felt like Disney chopped this film up and stitched it back together multiple times with out of place shots. Some scenes maybe lasted 2-3 seconds and jumped to a different shot. The story was painfully bad along with the pacing of this film. Fans hoped that after the disaster that was The Last Jedi we would finally get many burning questions answered but instead we left even more confused and upset. I've seen the original films countless times but I don't think I will ever re-watch this trilogy.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"Overall it was well acted, and entertaining. The pacing was very quick, which can be confusing, but also helps gloss over some big plot holes."
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,The end of Star Wars saga was a real Shame.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"i have seen it twice both in IMAX 3D and normal theatre. i got a great movie from star wars universe. this for me means great visuals, cool and weird creatures all around, new worlds, likeable characters, corny dialogues, fun, life wisdom and scenes which are super epic. i got it all so i cant give less than five. especially for the epic emotional duel scene on the death star. where you soon realize Kylo and Rey dont fight each other but they are beating their own rage and pity. till exhaustion. till something bad must happen so they realize how stupid they both are. this scene is one of my favourite from all star wars duels."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,I was just expecting a lot more - plot was not very exciting.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"I just enjoyed the movie for what is was and did not get critical, it was entertaining."
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,"We’ve seen this movie fine times now. This is a mess of a movie then again, how could it not be?  What Kennedy has done to Star Wars is unforgivable. How is she still employed?!"
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,I thought it was a great Star Wars movie. Would put it at the top of the list!
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,"Plot holes so large you could fly a Super Star Destroyer through them. But when you start a trilogy with no plan, and then hire someone to subvert your expectations as well as any idea of where you were going with the story, this is what happens. Sad pandering to fans in hopes that they not only ignore the aimlessness of the overall trilogy, but the nonsense slapped together in this movie as well. If you're a Star Wars fan, save your money and go stream the Mandelorian."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"If you liked Episodes IV through VI best, and don't have strict expectations, this is an awesome completion."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Perfect way to end the saga.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,not a fan of this one
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Was slightly predictable but it’s the last one so to be expected.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"Good Movie, even if you don't know the history still enjoyable."
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,Uninspired garbage. Boring. Ridiculous. Even if you don’t like Star Wars. Movie sucked. 
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,The best of the Rey Trilogy.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"full circle !! it all came together - Epic! 
worth the 2 & 1/2 hours! buy extra popcorn!"
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"Particularmente adorei o filme, foi uma história interessante , e gostei do fechamento da saga"
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,plot points were kind of dumb. Plot threads left unresolved
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Outstanding.  Full of adventure and excitement.  Its exactly what a Star Wars movie should be.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Was a great movie. Liked 3D effect.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Fantastic.  A fitting and satisfying ending to a 9’film 30’year saga.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Didn’t like it my first viewing. More enjoyable after watching it a second time
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Coming from the fan base that treats the EU/Legends as the holy grail of what should have happened in Star Wars I think this is an awesome movie and everyone should watch it with an open movie. I went in with a smile and left with one.
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,same movie over and over and over
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"I thought the movie was great.  I really liked all the stars (i.e. Harrison Ford, Billy Dee Williams, Mark Hamel and Carrie) that were brought back even though they had small parts.  I was really amazed with Carrie Fisher's part."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Time to put it to rest. Running out!!
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,It was everything I had hoped it would be.
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,"I tried really hard to stay awake for this new Star Wars movie, but I just gave in during the second half. The story is rudimentary and the dialogue is just boring and stupid. It is so obvious that a committee wrote and rewrote the script for the maximum safety. That's how DC movies got ruined and Disney just went to a new low with the Star Wars franchise. No amount of special effect can keep me up for two hours, if I cannot cheer for anyone in the movie. Definitely not recommended. George Lucas, where are you?"
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Stayed true to its Title. Great Movie
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"Wow!! my wife and I loved the story, characters, special effects and the cinematography. I'm so glad that Disney picked up the franchise and will continue to expand and improve with technology. I think its sad that some purists are giving this film a bad rating simply because it wasn't part of the book series. Its a movie for Petes sake,  go forth and be entertained."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"It was awesome, it did bring back the feel of original Star Wara seen as a teenager. It was a treat to share and pass the legacy on to my teen. We watched all the preceding films before seeing this one. My daughter and I loved it! It left you wanting more. Alas it is over... The force is strong with this one"
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"Loved the movie, wrapped everything up very well"
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Where to start! What a movie! Said to see it end
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"I enjoyed the film, but the pacing was incredibly fast as JJ tried to force in any and every way to undermine the previous film for no reason other than appeasing fans. With that aside, the film was incredibly emotional and will get your heart pumping."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"Tons of action. Some parts of the story seemed rushed and a little confusing, but it was fun. Its Star Wars after all."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,I waited 40 years for this?
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Great job on the final episode.  My son loved it as well!
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"Definitely the best of the sequel trilogy.  Obviously hard and high bar to make it the best with the original trilogy, but it's worth the price of a ticket.  While the crawl was a bit odd and the opening was a bit choppy in the cuts, the story and the characters were well developed and likeable, but still human.  And that's what makes a good movie."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"I thought the movie was really fun! The action scenes were quite actiony, the acting is pretty spot on and the fan service will really hit fans.

that said I can't disagree with a lot of the criticisms that the movie is getting. they're all pretty on point but if you're just going to be entertained and aren't expecting Shakespeare you won't be disappointed."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,This is a great movie. I have seen it 4 times in the theater and can't wait for 4K and 3D Blu-ray home release. It's really the best movie we could have gotten considering how the sequels were handled. Palpatine is by far the best part of this movie.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"Review: ""Rise of Skywalker""

I am a Sci Fi fan first and foremost, Star trek fan 2nd, Star Wars fan 3rd.....
Has anyone seen this old old 2 movies called.... uhhh let me think.... ""Empire Strikes Back""? ""Return Of The Jedi""?

""Rise of Skywalker""
Which should be named ""Reruns of Skywalker and Pals""

If you have seen those you will have already seen this... ""Rise of Skywalker"" - Same theme - ""I am your father"" - YES - I am related to you and YOU don't know it?
Different people, different characters - SAME STORY
So....DON't get your lightsabers out yet people.... I loved the movie..... I loved the Cameos . . but it was ALOT ALOT of Cameos . . . . Come On Disney.... get original.

4 out of 5 stars"
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"The movie is good. While it has many, many flaws and I can see why critics hate it, as a long time star wars fan who knows about Star Wars Legends it was amazing. I recomend it to anyone"
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Brought closure to the series and took care of 8 problems.
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,It was all that I expected and worse.
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,Poor character development. Weak dialog. The pacing was rushed. Movie felt like it was scripted to be a video game with just enough plot to get you to the next stage.
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,"In the biggest sign yet that Hollywood has lost all its creative genius, the franchise chooses for its finale to bring back the villain that it killed off SIX EPISODES AGO!  Now, theyve killed the whole franchise!"
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Loved that a lot of the characters from previous Star Wars movies were in this one. Hopefully there will be more and this will not be the last one.
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,"Shot for shot remake of return of the jedi and filled with scenes dedicated to fixing the massive errors and plot holes made by Rian Johnson in the last movie. Carrie Fisher is in a number of scenes and none of them feel right, in fact it takes away from the movie.  They should have just killed her character in the first scene."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Rose should have had a bigger role and some of the extreme close up shots were really grainy but otherwise good way to end an Epic series.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"It is way too fast-paced in its first two thirds, reutilizes many elements from previous films, comes up with new, uninspired subplots and supporting characters, and is marked by plot twists that are anything but breathtaking. The film is only saved from utter failure thanks to its ever-present nostalgia, ever-effective soundtrack, ever-engaging characters (with Adam Driver's Kylo Ren stealing the show) and an explosive final act, making it at least enjoyable and better than the poorly-conceived Episodes I and II. For these reasons, ""Star Wars Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker"" is a weak closure for the most influential trilogy of trilogies of all time."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Entertaining.  Not that much of a fan to get bogged down in details.  Star Wars officially over for me.
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,The story was all over the place.  Thinking back to the original back in the seventies this story just didn't seem to have a good flow.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Movie was awesome! It brought back past movies to tie them all together. Highly recommend!
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Just plane excellent!
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,The best Star Wars since the first!
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"The plot was excellent. The characters made sense, and didn't feel forced, unlike episode 8."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,I was actually overwellemed by the action in the movie. Perhaps people should not ask to many de't in what is basically an action movie.
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,"Pretty stupid, to be honest. No self consistency with the rest of the universe, contrived and base. Definitely better than the one before it, but just feels like a trashy cash grab."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"Great action film! Movie started a bit slower than I expected. However, it turned up the action and interest very quickly and the many glimpses and cameos from the past were very pleasing (probably especially for those that saw the early films as young adults).the action grew to the final battle and in the last scenes I could see other movie goers wiping their eyes (along with me). If you were a Star Wars fan or just like movies....this IS a must see!!"
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Not realistic compared to traditional Star Wars
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,"Rise of Skywalker lacked direction and appeared mindless in most of its direction. Once again very interesting characters are given bad development and writing that makes them overall unlikable. Uses nostalgia to manipulate the audience into a feeling of warmth towards it. Villain doesn’t feel well earned or built up after 2 movies and feels like a shoe in. Settings, scenery, alien beings and creatures all extremely beautiful and well done. Action was also well done, but appears at some points lazily choreographed. Very last scene on Tatoine was well done to wrap up the Skywalker storyline. Most of this movies problems stem from bad planning on previous movies parts and no direction within them either. Overall the only solution is to hand the franchise off to Kevin Feige."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,End of Skywalker saga Awesome!!! Good prevail against evil. Great message of Hope and Redemption. Your destiny is Not dictated from family u r from (Palpatine-Evil) but your choice to become a part of a better family (Skywalker-Good) who love u.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,The nostalgia and creativity remains with me as I recall in 1977 when I saw the first movie “ A New Hope” at 17 years old. Good movie. The finality will never come.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"This movie is incredible! A lot of fans and critics say that this isn't a good film at all. They're right. It's not a good film. It's an amazing Star Wars movie. The beginning may be choppy and rushed, but after a while, it makes sense. Honestly, after The Last Jedi, Star Wars fans needed this. They may not all realize it now, but hopefully they will eventually open up their hearts and minds to see that this is the ending we're looking for! P.S.. Ben Solo, Palpatine, and Rey were undeniably incredible in the movie! Saw it twice! Can't wait to see it again! May The Force Be With You!"
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,"""The Last Jedi"" done the damage and there was no way to prevent the disaster that came with ""The Rise of Skywalker""... Even if the visuals was pretty good, the weak story and contradictions between newest installment of Skywalker saga and it's predecessors was to disturbing to enjoy this movie."
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,"Ancient Sith dagger finds the way from death star 40 yr old wreckage. That's just foolish. Lightsaber choreography sub par. Rey & Kylo get together makes no lick of sense. JJ Abrams needs to knock it off with the flashs, he's trying to compensate for his lack of storytelling. Not great, incredibly rushed with the writing. & Pacing is like Sonic the Hedgehog on Koolaid."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Awesome conclusion to a saga full of hope.
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,The storyline wasn't much of anything new.  These characters have little to like about them.  The humor seems out of place.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,I love they paid homage to the original trilogy with mirrored scene shots between Rey and Ben (Kylo REN)
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,"Fast paced, but lazy story telling. Too much crammed into one movie means you're constantly having to suspend belief at the how easily the whole story wraps up. A real shame as the previous installment had some rich story telling and interesting leads for the continuation. This is just popcorn fodder garbage."
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,"Convoluted plot with major plot holes, this movie nearly ruins everything established in the star wars universe. Actors not take to their full potential, only Adam Driver was the redeeming quality, and with the bar this movie set it doesn't seem that hard to do."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"Exceptional acting, great action, fast paced, better than average storyline.  Answered a lot of questions."
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,Pretty disappointed overall. Many plot holes were presented and character arcs were given forced endings.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"Many may say it was somehow unfulfilling, but I waited 42 years to see how this story would end. I'm satisfied and it brought it all to an acceptable conclusion in my view. Time and lives have passed, people! Things change, and even our fantasies have to evolve with them! Thank you for the dreams, George, Steve, and JJ."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Wonderfully Outstanding World-class = WOW
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"The scenes with Leia seemed forced, for obvious reasons, and Adam Driver never really cut it as a bad guy for me.  Otherwise, it was a well done and satisfying finale.  And please, let it be the last one!"
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"Loved it!  Don’t let the critics scare you off, this is a fun Star Wars movie and completes the Skywalker Saga wonderfully."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,It was too predictable for me. The fact that Rey was a Palpatine and not just a force sensitive child was poorly written. However I didn’t exactly hate the film. I did love the chemistry between the characters and the fact the saga is over is sad. I’m hoping for separate arcs for Rey and even for Fin. Since Fin too has the force.
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,to long and confusing
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Loved the whole story
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Everything and the kitchen sink...horses on a star destroyer...um
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,BEAUTIFUL STAR WATS CLOSING !!!!!
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,"awful just awful contradics with TLJ story and ending, ""force healing"" and fakes deaths everywhere"
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,"3rd worst SW movie, it does nothing new, and fails to really explain any questions established by the prior two films. Completely shoehorns in Palpatine just so it can tie the 9 films together, but doesn't justify bringing the emperor back. It plays out like a National Treasure movie for the first half- jumping from macguffin to macguffin. Really dumb, but beautifully shot, well enough acted- better than the prequels anyway, and John Williams continues to do great work. Everything I would expect from a script written by the combined efforts responsible for Batman v. Superman and Star Trek Into Darkness."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,This movie did something very different from the many other movies I've seen. It brought a year to my eyes. And when I saw the giant fleet appear out of hyperspace a smile appeared on my lips just as fast. I loved the movie and I don't care what anyone else says. This was a masterpiece and a great ending to a franchise of many ups and downs. And this movie makes The Last Jedi look like Attack of the Clones. So with that I feel it earns it's title as the end to a great saga.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,It was better than expected. Didn’t seem rushed like the previous two in this series.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"I grew up with the original trilogy, was disappointed with the second trilogy, and have enjoyed the third trilogy. This is the best Star Wars movie ever. It has the best plot, best character development, and best acting of any of the nine main-series movies."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,My favorite movie. It closes the Star Wars saga in a fantastic way. I love it. Alllll
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,So many plot twists and it had a lot of action!
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,I just didn't get the ending... it doesn't fit AT ALL. But everything else was fine if we just ignore canon stuft.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"Go see it for yourself. We viewed it yesterday and it was a nice crowd. Pleasantly surprised just how good the movie was in fact. We are not Star Wars buffs, however, this is a first class movie. It was very good in all aspects."
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,Together with The Last Jedi the worst STAR WARS movie ever produced. I was swearing at the screen throughout the whole movie in cinema.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"Better than Star Wars 8 but not better than any other Star Wars.  Star Wars 8 was tied for worst Star Wars along side SW 1  Phantom Menace, so Star Wars 9 is only slightly better.  
The Good: A fight scenes are good, a lot less agenda.  
The Bad: Movie is rushed and crammed with too much half-baked story line.
The Ugly: Continues butchery of Force powers adding things that just don't make sense.  Includes all kinds of jumps in story that really are bad.  

Summary: While the names and characters still exist, SW 9 like SW 8 pretends that the other 7 movies didn't exist. Why they butcher a story world and replace it with nothing good or consistent is beyond me.  If SW 9 was the first in the series there never would have been a series."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Tons of special effects. Way out there for Star Wars. It was suspenseful the whole movie. Great for Star Wars fans
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,This was far better than the critics thought. The story held together but I had to wonder why the old timers looked so old as technology got so sophisticated. Surely they had figured how to slow down or reverse the aging process. Just saying.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,This is for the 4DX version. The movie itself was 4 stars.
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,Just the absolute worst. Complete waste of time.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,I loved it ALL! Thank you for a truly wonderful film.
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,"Absolutely terrible movie, good still shots not going to lie they nailed those camera shots. But the story is so bad and really doesn’t make any sense and nothing has any consequence or risk for the “good” guys. "
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,Just awful.  It didnt feel like Star Wars at all to me.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"I went in to watch this movie with hopes of getting a satisfying ending to the classic 40 year long saga and i got what i was looking for. But, as a movie alone, there are several flaws and nit picks that brought down this movie for me. Even though it was a divisive movie, I believe that Disney should have kept then story lines from the last Jedi, so we could have a more satisfying conclusion to the trilogy. This is a good ending to the saga but a flawed movie in whole."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"Overall I thought the movie was great! They did an amazing job on this film. The ewoks even made a cameo. The final scene between Rey and Kylo Ren/Ben was not my fav, but besides that, it was great."
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,Get the thing so we can get the thing then big space battle. What a wasted opportunity for the trilogy.
"Jan 6, 2020",neutral,"TOO MUCH LIFTING. This movie was trying to do way too much! Known characters were flat, new characters weren't developed. Logic was terribly flawed."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Jumped around way to much..
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,We love the movie wish it did not have to end . Have enjoyed Star Wars.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Good movie. Lots of action.
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,A sloppy mess of an ending to a mediocre new trilogy that also does poorly wrapping up Skywalker saga. Skip it
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"I liked the movie for the sake of Star Wars in general but it only passing quality was that it was eye candy, the script for the movie and just how the characters were played could’ve been more intriguing and actually gave them lines. In example Finn the force sensitive ex-stormtrooper, most of his lines only consist of “REY”"
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Viewing was awesome... sound was too LOUD
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,"If this were not a Star Wars movie, it would've been pretty good. Not great, by any means, but pretty good. I'll list my top thoughts of it:
They played the Luke Skywalker theme WAY too many times. It's a great piece, but overusing it takes away a bit from the spectacular moment near the end.

The movie should have been longer. I understand it is hard to keep an audience seated for three hours. Even Endgame got boring in parts. This movie; however, needed the extra time to tie up some loopholes, such as how Lando got so many supporters. Maybe more time spent on how Palpatine actually got so many followers and materials for 10K evil ships.

There's one thing I REALLY liked about this movie, and that is how they treated the death of Carrie Fisher through Princess Leia. Chewbacca's yells of sadness really brought the tears. 

Overall movie: Eh
Star Wars movie: Aweful"
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"Don’t listen to the hype, this is a great movie!"
"Jan 6, 2020",neutral,"just nothing special, was okay"
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Great ending to a great saga!!!
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"While I enjoyed myself watching The Rise of Skywalker, it is not a great movie. Most of the complaints I have heard have been about how ridiculous, fast-paced, and messy this movie is. But the more I consider these issues, none of them would have been an issue had Rian Johnson progressed J. J. Abrams's story. Instead, Johnson tried to make what a Star Wars movie was in his opinion instead of what the fans wanted. The Last Jedi did not progress anything, in fact the story is back at square one by the end; Rey has barely learned anything, Luke barely did anything except show that Johnson does not understand his character, the Casino planet was a waste of time, Holdo could have saved so much time and panic had she just told everyone they were going to seek refuge on the nearest base, and Snoke (the supposed new big villain) is killed without any story to his character. 

J. J. Abrams had almost nothing to work with, just the death of Luke and Rey & Kylo Ren's force connection. Who else would be the villain other than Palpatine? Who else could train Rey but Leia? The only things I found truly dumb were the dagger that perfectly aligned with the Death Star remains, and Rey & Kylo's ridiculous use of the force (i.e: grabbing a ship from the sky and magically making a lightsaber disappear into the other's hands).

This was a 4 hour movie crammed into 2. I hope that Disney will allow for a Director's Cut so we can see a more clear, but still fairly flawed movie."
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,"I was very disappointed - how do you have a light saber duel when you're light years apart???? too touchy/ feelly - I know - A Disney thing. 
plus - the dead were popping up all the time.
the worst movie of the series - they could have done better"
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,I throughly enjoyed it & it is definitely better than the Last Jedi. This film was well done and answered questions that the Star Wars fan base had on Rey.
"Jan 6, 2020",neutral,"All right movie to eat some popcorn. A terrible conclusion of what was thought to be ""The Skywalker Saga"". This became ""The Palpatine Saga"". What a waste."
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,"Special effects were really good and cinematography was good. Acting was good, but script and plot were disjointed, there was too much God mode force break abilities, and the fan service felt faked and forced. As part of a SW trilogy it was awful. As a stand alone sci-fi movie with glowing sticks it was ok."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"Two movies jammed into one trying to fix all the plot holes and omissions left by the trash fire that was The Last Jedi. Fast paced and full of action still a good popcorn movie with lots of fan service. And yes that is a good thing, you make movies for people that want to see them. At times you see some great interaction between the main cast and it is evident what the trilogy could have been had Disney and Rian Johnson no horrendously screwed up the second film. However some of the new force powers shown are terribly OP, force healing seems natural and realistic to me and similar to other force powers. But resurrection from the dead, force lightning that destroys entire fleets, transportation of material objects across the galaxy through a mind connection? Stupid."
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,"So many issues, horses riding on a destroyer? Story continuity that sees Rey become a super-powerful jedi with very few lessons (that we were exposed to seeing). Poor ol' Kylo and a super super short expose' to Palpatine. I mean - I kept away from spoilers for this movie and as soon as the start scrolling story lines appear they spoil what would have been a shocker for me, only to leave me thinking meh. Dont mention all the ships at the end that appear. It turned out to be laughable."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"It's a cool movie, with spectacular special effects, but it suffers from some script flaws, such as the unusual discovery of the Jedi's healing powers, and its plot twist is absurd (how did Emperor Palpatine have a child?)."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"A fun, overstuffed movie. Some great Star Wars moments. It walks back a lot of the choices made in TLJ, which is why I docked it a star. I loved TLJ, realize many didn’t."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Final Star Wars did not disappoint!
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Great movie & a fitting ending!
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,We loved it. My boys 12 & 14 and I found it to be entertaining start to finish. The closing scene in the jungle was a little corny but overall there movie was tons of fun.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Absolutely loved this movie!!!
"Jan 6, 2020",neutral,"Upsetting conclusion to the Skywalker saga. It's ashame that there was no cohesive plan for all 3 movies. I felt, even though TFA was a rehash or ANH it was still a good jumping off point that all went to heck when most of the villans & Luke were killed off in TLJ. This movie seems to not no what to do after TLJ but rehash Palpatine & bounce all over heck at light speed. You can tell that tons of footage was cut & spliced together ending in a hodge podge of tropes & poor fan service. I'm just saddened after TFA & Rogue One were such a great start for Disney Star Wars."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"It was a little long, however doesn't seem like couldn't have fit all the different layers of the story in shorter time. Anyhow good acting, lots of action, some sentimental stuff might pull a few tears. Good movie, Definitely worth matinee price of 6.50."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"An acceptable, if predictable, conclusion to the storied franchise."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,I've been a fan since I was little loved everyone.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Best Star Wars so far!
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Like Star Wars? As one of the people who waited in long lines to see the first movie 7 times in 3 weeks... It's a must see
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Awesome - action packed the entire movie
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"Hard to follow, too many computer graphic fight scenes strung together."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,The movie was great. Great effects and great acting
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Great action scenes and story line.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Loved how it brought things together.
"Jan 6, 2020",neutral,"As we walked out after the show my wife said ""well that was just a hot mess."" But we still had to see it."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Good references to the first trilogy. And it GS a fair ending not underwhelming. Cast did great
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,As a long time dedicated Star Wars fan I had hoped for a strong ending to the series.  Sadly this movie seemed more focused on backtracking on the Last Jedi than on developing a strong narrative ending.  Frantic pacing did not hide the plot holes.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Great movie great ending
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"Es la mejor película que el visto 
Un cierre fenomenal a esta saga"
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,Feels very unimaginative and boring. Doesnt conclude the trilogy well at all. Really disappointed as I was really looking forward to it
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,"Watched the first hour, then got bored and left in the middle of a fight scene in rough seas. I take it as a given that this is the end of the series; it sure felt like it. Dead and buried."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"J.J. Abrams fixed everything Ryan Johnson broke. Great sequel to Episode VII, just as if episode 8 never existed."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"Could this movie have been more? More catered to the professed fans? More perfect in every way? Sure. But, I am old enough to remember when The Empire Strikes Back was in theaters. I went to see it with my family and loved the experience! If I had instead seen The Rise of Skywalker, I would have been blown away even more. We tend to forget the shortcomings of the previous films which we have based all our fandom in the first place. Were we to judge New Hope as harshly, would it stand up to our scrutiny? I doubt it. We have been swept up in the collective tide of cultural mythology which exists now for Star Wars. We all need to relax and appreciate just how amazing our story-telling has become since 1977. The Rise of Skywalker was a great film. Flawed, yes. But, not enough to keep me from losing myself in the magic."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"If you are a fan of Star Wars you can't miss this, my sons felt it was the best movie of the series!"
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Brought everything together!
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Disney followed along with the original format.  Action were scenes were fun without going on too long.  It was silly fun!
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Thought it was well done and very entertaining.  A few weak spots but over all excellent!
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Absolutely a great watch
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,Wow this is the worst movie i've seen this year.  The dialogue  between actors is horrible.  Couldn't they find a better script writer for the final piece?   Everyone is over-acting but i think alot of it is because of the dialogue they are stuck with.  Seems like the producers were just looking to get this out and make a buck.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,The whole movie.  It closed many open ends and it was overall and awesome story.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Great ending to a great series
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"Thoroughly enjoyable ending to the films. If you go looking to be entertained, you will be."
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,Better than TLJ but bad movie
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Really enjoyed the movie! Husband found it slow at times.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,A few unanswered questions.   But fun to watch
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Great movie. I love it
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Fast paced action and motivated story line. Leaves lots of questions unanswered but the wrap up feels complete and purposeful.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"Best in the final trilogy, the themes of the saga were cohesive to the mythology and it really exceeded my expectations. I've seen it 3 times already and will probably return to see it again!"
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Very entertaining   Did not seem like a two and a half hour long movie. Really enjoyed it !
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,For once the story is well told
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Right on target with the story line and the end of the Skywalker saga. We look forward to a the new Jedi series. It was also amazing to see Carrie Fisher involved in this closure and memorializing  her persona.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,It was an alright finish to the series.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"Loved it, awesome way to close the series!"
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,"Not a single new idea, just bigger, louder and somehow cornier versions of every plot point, joke, and reference from the earlier films. An exercise in corporate cowardice."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,We are Star Wars fans so it was awesome
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Another action packed adventure!
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"Entertaining, but a bit cheesy this time."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,I love all of the Star Wars I have all of them at home and Ill be adding this one to my collection.
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,"Its was very bad for me, as a true star wars fan, things doesn't make any sense. The story, the characters and the plots doesn't go together at all."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,My kids loved it.  Im a bit Star Wars out.  I found it a bit cheesy but great for the kids
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"It was good, kind of disappointed that it received such negative reviews. It was a solid movie and I almost didnt see it due to the mixed reviews."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"The ending was ok. Movie was once again, nothing legendary."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"Emotional roller coaster!  Cinderella story!  Some quirky plot points, but anything that makes me feel that way has got to be doing something right!"
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,loved the action and the old characters who appeared...
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,One of the best Star Wars movies!!
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,We loved it. Great way to tie up the trilogy.
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,I am so disappointed in what JJ and Disney did to Star Wars.  This is easily the worst of of the 10 movies.
"Jan 6, 2020",neutral,Cheesy. I only gave it 2.5 rating because the saga is finally over.
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,The worst ending for a kinda decent trilogy.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Fantastic transition adding Carrie Fisher into the movie.
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,Don't waste your time or money. Just rewatch the originals instead
"Jan 6, 2020",neutral,"After my first time watching The Rise of Skywalker, I had prequel-level hatred for the film. It was such a massive disappointment. Now that I’ve seen it a second time, I found some minor enjoyment, so if there’s less vitriol in this review, it’s merely because I gave it a second shot, and was able to anticipate all the awful things so they wouldn’t be as annoying. I think the first thing that jumped to my mind when watching this film is that it felt like someone at the studio spent way too much time on Twitter/Reddit pages that were full of Last Jedi haters. Between the way they almost completely wrote Rose out of the film, to the way they changed Rey’s history, it was such an over-correction that you could almost watch this movie right after The Force Awakens and pretend The Last Jedi never existed. While I’m underwhelmed by The Last Jedi, and have some major problems with its story structure, this certainly wasn’t what I wanted them to do in follow-up. The biggest problem with The Rise of Skywalker is its script. This is a horribly-written film, and even when the dialogue works, what is happening on screen makes almost zero sense. But not all the blame can be placed at the feet of these writers (although whoever decided to hire the guy who wrote Batman v Superman and Justice League to work with J.J. Abrams on this movie should be fired.) The problems with this film didn’t start here, they actually started more than 10 years ago. A decade ago, as Disney began plans to create a new sequel trilogy they did not have the foresight to hire one writing team to plan out the entire trilogy. Instead they decided to make one movie and then hand the reins off to someone new for each subsequent film. For all their faults, the prequels at least have a consistent story arc, but this trilogy is a mess of mixed messages and disjointed theming. It’s infuriating how poorly these 3 movies hold together as a single narrative. I appreciate some of the action sequences in this film, and I think Adam Driver elevates every scene he’s in because he’s a truly great actor. There are also some excellent moments with C3PO that reminded me of the original trilogy. While I don’t like the ever-expanding power of the Force that seems to be nearly limitless now, I did like the way they used it a few times with Rey and Kylo’s continued Forcetime conversations. That’s about where the good stuff ends. I’ve heard several people talk about how much this film felt rushed, but I couldn’t help feeling that it was rushing to nowhere. The movie is like a scavenger hunt where they seek out one MacGuffin after the next, and then they arrive at the climax through a completely different way so everything before that was pointless. The Rise of Skywalker has some enjoyable elements, but it’s definitely the worst film of the sequels, and has convinced me that the Original Trilogy is probably all the Star Wars I need."
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,"They tried to wrap it all up and just failed to do it with the same humor and any originality.  The plot doesnt hold up, especially where they bring back the Emperor.  There are a couple of scenes where you might think youre watching a Harry Potter movie.  They need to seriously edit this movie, then run it again."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Classical Star Wars at its best.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"Took my eight year old grandson and he was mesmerized as was I great story line and effects, liked the people portrayed and the good over evil not enough of that would see it again"
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,I thought it was an excellent movie well put together answering all the unknown questions and tying everything together.
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,"This movie was such a waste of potential. The Last Jedi set up an excellent optimistic ending that could have rallied laymen and laywomen to the Resistance. Instead of continuing on that plot thread, Rise of Skywalker spends more time trying to undo The Last Jedi than build its own plot. 

Half the movie is spent trying to track down an object that turns out to not be necessary anyway. 

Huge character development moments are thrown out, then abandoned as quickly as the next scene.

Characters make choices that are contrary to their own desires or motivations up to that point. 

There are so many problems with this movie, I couldn't list them all. I literally lost count."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"This movie exceeded my expectations! I am a die hard Star Wars fan and I had watched my favorite youtubers talk about the movie for the past year or so and I went in expecting it to suck, but it was really good. There are a few plot issues in the movie, probably from all the editing that George Lucas had to do to save it, but it is very entertaining overall."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Was the best of 7 - 9. I would give it a 7.5 out of a possible 10.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Great movie!  Loved it!
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"The fight scenes were incredible, but the movie lacked a strong story. I mean rose the main character of last Jedi was just thrown in there for the shortest amount of time."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,The usual spectacular graphics and action packed thrills you expect!  The story line with its twists and surprises...great!   Cameos of the original was a bonus.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"Although it is the end of my childhood, I can appreciate the journey this movie hand the ones previous have brought me to. This movie laves a few open story lines to be considered. Rey is now ""Rey Skywalker"". Where will her story continue on the galaxy far, far away. The return of Lando flying with Chewie. The entire Sith legion destroyed. What does the new galaxy have to protect itself from now?"
"Jan 6, 2020",neutral,Not as bad as the last one but thank gawd it’s over. For now 
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"We took our daughter to this movie and she absolutely loved it, it had some Wow moments, to What the Heck moments , to Awesome moments. Great Movie!"
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"Liked that many  major cast members from the original Star Wars reprised their roles in this one. Good story, special effects and humor."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,I absolutely loved this movie. 5 stars all the way. Great way to end the greatest story in science fiction history
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"true star wars fashion, it did not disappoint."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Not much of a story line.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"It was awesome! After you see it, DONT share with others who havent. Sad to see the Star Wars saga end. I saw the first Star Wars in 1977 and the last in 2020. Enjoy the movie!"
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Better than The Last Jedi. Some huge surprises in it.
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,"This film was a waste of two hours I will never get back. It created more questions then it answered, which normally is a great thing! But with this movie, that isn't the case. It almost felt like watching a child's play, everybody hold hands and sing kumbaya type of deal. Without stating any spoilers, this franchise has made the prequels absolutely irrelevant. The only thing ROS has over the other two titles is that you arent being force fed SJW content near as much."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"Let me start off by saying I am not a Star Wars fan boy.  I enjoy the movies but the comparisons to the originals and not viewing the newest trilogy on it's own merit is not how I go into these movies.  I felt the first movie in this trilogy, Force Awakens was good while The Last Jedi had some serious pacing issues.  Now that we have a basis of opinion to build off of, here is my review:  This movie is what I want out of a 2 1/2 hour movie.  It's a strong mix of action then story, action then story.  I never felt the lulls that came with the second movie, The Last Jedi.  The story was entertaining but surface level.  This movie wrapped up storylines rather than expand on anything new.  Overall, it's a Star Wars movie.  You know what you are getting yourself into.  Though they are not all created equal, this one is definitely worth seeing."
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,"The movie seems like a collage of ideas with unrelated scenes weakly connected by a wholly unbelievable plot.  

On the positive side, the special effects were stunning, I had no issues with the acting, Daisy Ridley (Rey) finally got a character arc- all those things were positive.  But the story was so silly that I felt completely disconnected from the film.

These characters deserved better."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Liked the story. But expected more advanced technical effects.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,this movie saved the trilogy
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"It could be much better but, it could be much worse! Kylo is the best character of this generation and had a pretty decent end. Ben Solo forever! Other saber calors warmed my heart! Missed more SW Rebels lead references!"
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Enjoyed every minute of it.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"this movie was perfect, almost as good as episode 1"
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"Way better than VII and VIII.
It totally redeemed the entire 9 movie saga. 
I loved it. Great storytelling techniques!"
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,I loved how the movie tied in to the first trilogy and the story came full circle. It was action packed throughout with emotions jumping back and forth between hope and disappointment. Truly a great way to finish off the third trilogy!
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,The movie flowed well! Loved the story line! Great action! I was sad when it was over!
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,it was nice a good ending to the saga.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,I am a Star Trek fan did not think I would enjoy this movie. Even though the plot maybe different from Star Trek I enjoyed this movie full of action and the story line kept you wanting the next scene!
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Not thrilled with the way it handled the resolution.  Too much Disney influence.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,That it had a twist at the end
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"Great ending to the Skywalker saga. Look bed the special,efffects as always. And as did a wonderful job inserting footage of Carrie Fisher to tie up the story with Leia. Cant wait to see the next adventures of Rey, Finn, and Poe."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"The movie took us back to the original 3 SWs, which we liked. We have not seen one for years, so this was a nice trip down memories past."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"They did a great job of wrapping up the Skywalker saga with this movie.  Great story, amazing cinematography, and seamless special effects!  I cant wait to see it again."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,They saved the best for last (of the latest three.)
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Amazing! Best star wars ever made in my opinion!
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Wonderful ending to a series that spanned decades.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"While lacking in character growth for some of the main cast minus Rey and Kylo episode 9 was a fun and action packed conclusion to the saga, wasn't a fan of the text crawl and its never explained why Palpatine is back, that being said Ian McDiarmid is fun as always on screen. a lot of fan service but only a couple of moments I wasn't a fan of SPOILERS Chewy getting his medal was egregious but I digress. The films comedic beats land more than they did in The Last Jedi and some of the action was better executed in this film, even though The Last Jedi was better shot than this film, at times the film feels like its in a rush to get to the conclusion as there is barely any time to breath in the film. C3-PO was actually used well in this film and he had some of the better comedic moments. overall I feel this film and trilogy as a whole could have been handled better and would have been if Disney planned out the story in its entirety but despite that they have delivered some solid star wars films and concluded the saga with a solid action adventure 7.5/10 not as good as TLJ but more entertaining then TFA"
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Too long.  Not enough left on the cutting floor.  Way too much magic for a scifi movie.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"Action packed. It kept moving not too many slow times. 
Felt like they condensed two movies into one. It was a bit too fast."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,It is my favourite Star Wars movie so far.
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,"Just simply terrible, very schizophrenic."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"JJ Abrams brings a fun and exciting energy to this movie. Since I`m a fan of The Last Jedi , I was not too big of a fan of this movie mostly beacuse, JJ just kind of forgot about episode 8 and retconed alot from it. Altough the movie brings a somewhat satisfying ending to the Skywalker saga."
"Jan 6, 2020",neutral,Too crazy :  little suspension of disbelief.   You transport yourself mentally  to battle but not know where the battle is occurring?   It was kinda of lame and didn’t hold my attention .   I wanted to leave early but my wife would not let me .This was last hope for a great Star Wars movie I’ll not pay for another.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"Great action, great storyline, great special effects. Awesome ending to a great series."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Great action with plot twist. Sad to happy moments kept you wondering whats next.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"Although too rampant and with buts, it seems like a dignified and elegant conclusion to the saga, and fans know it."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,We love all the Star Wars movies keeps you on your edge
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Loved everything! I actually had tears in my eyes several times! Ive watched Star Wars from the beginning and this was a perfect way to end the series!
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"Too loud, too violent."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"Fun and fast-paced, a great conclusion!"
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,This was a fitting way to end the Skywalker saga. I think they did well to answer questions and button things up.
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,"Hated it.  Contrived, predictable, boring, poor acting, too long.  If like that 2.5 hours of my life back please"
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,"This only has star wars name on it, hope disney goes bankrupt over this ^^"
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"Great way to end the saga, even though in the books, Ben and Rey were actually Han and Leia's twins.  Great to see Lando one last time.  Only downer, Finn never got to tell Rey he loved her."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Awesome film for true star wars fans!
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Great way to end the series. Everything came together!!
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"All the components of the best Star Wars: lovable droids, kitcky dialogue, good vs. evil, action packed, impressive stunts, great acting"
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"Thought it was a fair end to a great series, took you back"
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,"This is the end of a failed endeavour to continue the legacy of the Jedi Saga. Unfortunately, this attempt is still far, far away from what the public wants. But it's ok, as it brought more merchandise to sell, so Disney must be happy. I am not."
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,"Had quite a bit of potential, however, too much political agenda. Too much reliance on Mcguffins and not on proper story telling or character development. Stop introducing new people and give us decent character arcs."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Everything is perfect!!!
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Forget critics. Very fun and entertaining
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"Was epic in many ways, especially the final battle. Was saddened my all the deaths, but I knew eventually those characters were going to die somehow. Overall, very good conclusion to the Skywalker Saga!"
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,like the movie from star to end
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"Although this movie was convoluted and, at times, confusing, the special effects were again top notch. J.J. Abrams really should have considered that the younger fans of Star Wars like the series, period. No thinking about sub-plots, or why this and why that. KISS it."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"It’s quite sad to think that a series that began just before I was born has finally closed its doors for the final time - At least I hope it’s the final time, as I wouldn’t want such a legendary franchise to start losing any creditability. You feel with a movie like this that critics are just waiting for something, or anything to go wrong, but I felt it ended the saga positively, and emotionally, with several references and cameos from iconic characters from the past. It was a fitting ending and tribute to what has to be the most infamous film series of all time. "
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,What a lousy movie! finally this trilogy is over with!
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,I thought that the movie was great
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"I enjoyed the movie as a whole, and they do a lot of good to repair the mistake Episode 8 was. This being said it's star wars. There will be cheesy and ridiculous moments. 4/5 I would recommend and would watch again."
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,"Not a Stat Wars fan so I looked at it like any other movie. I have seen all of them and other then then first one , they are all the same. Good wins, evil wins, good wins. Predictable story line"
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"L'ultimo film della saga di Star Wars, nonostante alcune perplessità, si dimostra essere un notevole passo avanti rispetto ai primi due film della Trilogia Sequel.
Bellissimi gli effetti speciali e la trama è ben strutturata, con una conclusione degna di un film della serie, ma non ho gradito particolarmente la battaglia finale, che ho visto come un'imitazione di quella de Il Ritorno Dello Jedi, al punto da rasentare il plagio!"
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"A fun ride and fitting end to the ""trilogy"". Rise of Skywalker had to do 2 films worth of work to carry on from the Last Jedi, creating a fast paced and exciting adventure full of classic Star Wars fandom. I left with hope for the franchise, something I was not expecting."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"Predictable, and a few jump the shark end moments. Pulled it off well"
"Jan 6, 2020",neutral,It was really interesting but overall is just pew pew laser flying everywhere with a poor story telling.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Fantastic movie! Action packed and so much fun!
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"Watch it on tv, not even 3D makes it better."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Great ending to the Skywalker Saga.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"A satisfying end to a very messy trilogy. 3 films that are individually good to watch but together are just incoherent. The fact there was no plan for all 3 from the outset is very blatant.  

The Rise of Skywalker does it's best to mend issues from The Last Jedi and answer some of the questions in Force Awakens and is certainly a fun yet messy ride. Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley are magnetic, Kylo Ren is far and above the best character from this Trilogy and again is the best thing about this film. Finn could have been so much more with such an interesting story but he was completely misused in the trilogy and Poe as like-able as he is was ruined in The Last Jedi. 

The trilogy as a whole could have been so much more but i believe we still got 3 good individual films in the end."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,great ending to a trilogy!
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,It was good but the first one  was best of them all
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,The plot was good despite the negative reviews by the critics.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"An end to a saga, a trilogy, and a beautiful part of my childhood. I couldn't ask for a better conclusion. It was extremely satisfying to watch. They ended with the same sunset from the beginning. Can't get better than that if you ask me. Sure the film wasn't perfect but I'm ok with that. What was perfect to me outweighs what isn't. The score is astonishing as ever with tweaks here and there that are subtle but beautiful. The special effects were truly prodigious. The acting was very schmaltzy in a good way. I enjoy a good nostalgia trip every now and then. I felt so many emotions watching this and I was intrigued almost every second. It's more or less the subtle things that the film doesn't shove in your face that are truly moving. I'm excited to see what else the great minds at Disney studios and Lucasfilm have in store for us in the future. Because this is the happiest I've been in a theatre in a long time."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Good movie. A bit too much special effects and explosions which got in the way of the plot lines.  Seemed like some plot lines like the Snake had been cut to get it down to what was a long movie. Spoiled by Theater not showing in 3D IMAX as ticketed.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"Perfect- no. Probably number 5 star wars film (after original trilogy and Rogue One) if you don't count the mandalorian. After the mess of The Last Jedi, no way it could be perfect. JJ Abrams should have just had the entire trilogy - some magic in this movie evocative of New Hope or Empire. But not perfect."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"Being a Star Wars fan for the last forty-two (42) years, I was highly impressed by this movie. It was exciting and entertaining. Nothing at all like the bad reviews I read online. It was AMAZING!"
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,It was Starwars always good
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"It was fine and not as bad as you might believe, as long as you don't think about it too much and enjoy the movie and atmosphere. Once you do start thinking about it though, most is this movie is just a load of bullshit (although I understand how it came to this).

As a standalone movie: yeah it was nice
As a Star Wars trilogy ender: Should have been (much) better"
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"Was lacking in some areas but over all I think they did an ok job. Must see the JJ cut though, because there so much more they could have and probably did do but Disney did what they do best, and out then San Francisco’s slippers and cleared their throat for their share holders. But the actors did well and I think JJ tried but unfortunately Disney is the English word for SITH EMPIRE. Check the movie out....Do it!......"
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"Epic and emotionally absorbing, with lots of chemistry and a character-driven story, this is a great ending for a series that spans three generations of viewers."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,It was an enjoyable movie and a fitting ending to the series.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"Great movie! Screw the critics. JJ salvaged the shitshow that was left after TLJ. Starts off a bit too rushed at the beginning, but once it picks up steam it is really enjoyable."
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,"A mess who tries to compensate so hard for all that episode VIII lacked. At least it is packed with action that maintains you distracted. The main characters remain with no appeal, though Kylo Ren had a somewhat satisfactory end of his arch.
A fitting end to a trilogy who was never planned as a coherent story, but a nostalgia-appealing money-making."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Loved it just saw it for the second time. Gripping from the opening scene.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,It was good. The ending could have been better though
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Great movie if your a Star Wars fan. I loved it!!!!!
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,THE BEST FILM I HAVE EVER SEEN!!!!! ✨✨✨✨✨ 5 STAR!!!!!!! SO GOOD!
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Awesome conclusion to the series!
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,An exercise of nostalgia in a desperate attempt to save the plot disaster of TLJ
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,I love it the story all of it was perfect
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Loved it I have seen all of them and this one in real 3d was like being in the movie or like a long ride I enjoyed it very much and plan to go again with my kids
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"Id like to know how George Lucas envisioned the saga ending. JJ Abrams is great, and the movie was great, but it didnt feel like it really went along the Star Wars line"
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"I found this movie to be just okay and entertaining, but I dislike the fact that Disney wanted to kill off all of the original Star Wars main characters we grew up with. It was a nice surprise to see Harrison Ford return and Billy Dee Williams come back into action. I was satisfied with the ending with the cast celebrating in the Land of the Ewoks. I hope it is not the end for our new Star Wars cast of Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac and I hope we see them again in a new trilogy adventure in the 2030's or sooner."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,People who hate this movie are nuts.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,It was entertaining enough and felt more like Star Wars than the rest of the sequel trilogy. The only redeeming factor for TROS was that it was worlds better than the steaming pile of sh*t Rian Johnson gave us in the form of TLJ.
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,So the movie was overall pretty bland and pointless. And random too tbh. Like this whole bringing in palpatine out of nowhere. I didn't feel much of an attachment to most of the characters so most of it was pretty boring. The Rey and Ben parts were amazing and there was so much wasted potential. Their chemistry was hit only soul in this movie. The worst movie of the ST in my opinion.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,It was anything but a hopeful and satisfying end.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,It's a Disney movie not star wars.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,How can you NOT watch this movie??
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"LOVED IT! We had a blast! From beginning to end my 9 yr old inner child was happy with droids, creatures, ships, battles and lightsabers. Especially loved the darkness of this one. We had a great time."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"Excellent special effects as always. I just wish the story had circled around back to the prophecy like expected. But no mater what you have heard about the movie or the controversy  surrounding it, it is still worth seeing in the theater at least once. May the force be with us all."
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,"A simple example of why writing is more important than visual effects. The writing makes this movie a boring mess of crippling plot conveniences. The only reason there is to watch this movie is for The Emperor. Rey is a constant annoyance, a complete Mary Sue, with little training of any kind with a light saber, and the force, yet she knows how to do both quickly. Not only that, but she trains with a light saber, not a blaster, or a ship, yet she can shoot and pilot anything that she sees. This film, and its trilogy, is a complete disgrace to all of the Star Wars movies before it (nit including the two disney prequels)"
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Great action great actors
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Like the story and action scenes!
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"AWESOME, I loved it all cried, laughed, and cried some more. I was 10 in 77 and went to see the first matinee and stayed till they closed one show after the next. Been a fan ever since. I am sad that the Skywalker story is over . But, they is always Hope. May the Force be with you, always."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"While the movie did seem squished with plot points, it was satisfying to see the story coming to the conclusion Abrams chose to show. Hopefully there’s a directors full length cut out there that shows the full story development someday."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Excellent all end in the end thanks Disney.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Got to a point it put me to sleep!
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Great story and visuals. True to the saga.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Great end to a saga. Wonderful characters and surprising
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Such a great movie. I am glad that J. J.. Adams directed it.
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,Not a typical star war movie
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Some parts were a little slow.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Great picture but it cod be Vedder
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,I love imax movies and I love Star Wars movies on imax. So much fun
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,It is strange in some parts but watch it a second time and you'll love it!
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"It definitely was a lot better than I thought it was gonna be. Had a few unexpected parts, but was still a tad cliche."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"The movie bring a felling that you can fell with the oldest movies, it's for Star Wars lovers."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,it was really enjoyable a lot better than ep 8
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"As a huge starwars fan. I think this was a great and emotional ending to the saga, good job J.J!"
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,I don’t know why the critics were saying that people shouldn’t watch it. I thought it was overall a great movie and potentially the best in the trilogy.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,This movie was an absolute blast.  It ends the trilogy perfectly!  I highly disagree with the critics!  I give this movie a 100% for audience score!
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"Beginning was a bit mashed together. As the story progressed the groove of the movie was amazing to get into. The ability to see the final bow on the Star Wars universe be tied together by J.J. Abrams perfectly gave me chills! It is worth a watch, but one thing I will say before going into this film. Is that, you will need to brush up on how much you know about the Star Wars universe from the expanded universe to all 9 of the films. The more you know the easier it will be to understand."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,It was great! Loved the end!
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,So much potential but a rushed mess and a sad conclusion to a legendary franchise.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,I loved all of it u should go see it......
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,I thought it was great!
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Perfect. I couldn't have asked for more. ❤️
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Good movie would recommend if you like Star Wars!!!
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,Sucked. What a mess! Why couldn't they just leave the original three alone?  Angers me as a child of the eighties.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"Liked the movie generally, and there were extremely good moments. I feel like there should have been more to the ending and feel like Ben did not get his justice. But I loved the development of ray."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"Awesome, action-packed wrap up that brings the audience full circle in a moving closure of the saga told over the past 40 years. I was a teenager when the first Star Wars came out and this was a fitting ending that took me back to those early days when we first met our beloved characters..."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"Satisfying conclusion to this most recent trilogy.
Not a dull moment!"
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,I don't know how I feel about this movie. First it feels like it should have been split into two movies. The plot is way too convoluted and strait up ignores most of The Last Jedi's decisions. The Last Jedi had some bad parts but I don't think the way to correct them was to undo a majority of them. This sequel trilogy as a whole was all over the place. As far as I'm concerned Return of the Jedi wrapped up the Skywalker story well enough.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,For the last Star Wars it was really good
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,What is there to even like?
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Ranks up there with IV New Hope
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,entertaining and wraps the storylines
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"I loved it. Action. Emotion , and a huge space battle. Awesome!"
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Good action and story. TY
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Great ending to the story. Only a few small things left to the imagination. ( Plot holes) but all in all it was really good.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,I like the action and adventure aspect of the movie. It's entertaining. But that's all it is. I dislike the story. I felt almost no emotional weight in scenes where there should be some.
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,I have been a lifelong fan of Star Wars . Disney completely ruined the Skywalker saga
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"Episode 9 Brings closure to 3 final set of 3 the way Disney as changed the story line, My son and I enjoyed it."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"Loved it!!  Not perfect, but pretty darn good!"
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,I enjoyed it. Wasnt the best of the 11 main movies but I thought it was good. Wrapped up the main story left some questions open but those could be answered in a Disney plus show.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Great effects.  Some surprises. Too many fights. Worth seeing
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,I was so disappointed in this movie a movie I had high hopes for next to cats a movie that I had low expectations with I will take cats any day than rewatch this movie like I said cats was way better and needs more appreciation one thing for sure people are going to tell me where were you when star wars came out I would say I was enjoying cats and I highly recommend it Don't listen to other people's opinion that's why you have your own go see it you might like it you never know
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,JJ Abrams proves once again that he has no imagination of his own.
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,Bad movie.  Miss the old Star Wars movies.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,It was very predictable. Made it kind of boring.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Fantastic completion to a 43 year story.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"Loved it. JJ Abrams really did justice to the story arc, and the film had lots of great surprises."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"On a comparative scale from episode 1 to episode 8, I give episode 9 a middle rating. The story was week, repetitive & discombobulated but the CGI stuff, especially with the resurrection of Carrie Fisher, was fantastic. If you are a Star Wars fan, it doesn’t matter how good or bad it is, it is a must see."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,The reviews for this movie should all A+! Nostalgic and Action all in one. 
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Perfect way to end series
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,Too many new concepts with the force
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,I think that is not the best movie of star wars but is a good end to the saga :)
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Loved it. Great ending to a legacy!
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,"I for one thought that this movie would be awesome when I went to see it about thirty minutes in you could not only tell the difference but they have butchered this saga this movie rise of Skywalker is left with so many questions and honestly the feel is nothing like the rest honestly I've given every other movie a five star. This movie being a huge fan of DC comic, marvel, start wars, Star Trek and many more Disney is clearly destroying not just what George Lucas built and Stan Lee but they have destroyed each of these sagas. The brilliant art work their predecessors worked so hard to create it. This movie was a huge let down honestly it sadness me that soon every super hero saga etc will be not even worth watching due to the fact Disney will completely and already has destroyed the ending movie of Star Wars. They should keep to what they are good at and let those who still are here today finish their art regardless of weather they own it or not. It's bad enough they want to monopolize and make billions off just owning the rights but they have to destroy the legacy and story line."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,I thought it was great. Nice way to wrap up the series and always takes me back to childhood. I was happy with it!
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Liked bringing old characters back for a quick look.  No complaints at all!
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"It was better than expected.  I tested up 4 times and full on cried once... I know Im not the only one. JJ did fantastic and I honestly wouldnt chance anything about it except maybe the horses which played out a bit cheesy but I still enjoyed it. My husband, my 7 year old daughter who went to the movies as Rey), and myself loved every second of it!"
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Loved the movie. The theater was disgustingly dirty from the concessions to the bathrooms!
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,That it was incosistan not just with the trilogy but the it self it destroys all the universe that george lucas created it does not connect with nothing
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,This movie is fine on its own but placing in a trilogy thats supposed to wrap up an entire saga felt out of place and kind of a mess. It was well acted and well shot but the writing wasnt there. Still would recommend seeing if youre a Star Wars fan like myself.
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,"One of the ten worst movies ever. Every time I woke up I saw the same scene again, space ships shooting. So phoney. There were even horses galloping on space ships. Really? Let's bury this franchise forever."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,great continuance of a 32 year old franchise
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,Horrible movie. Tried to bring back everything from before. Cast just sucks. The overt effort to make women the stars is just pathetic.  The original trilogy with Harrison Ford and Carie Fisher were some of the greatest movies of all times. These just try way too hard to be overtly politically correct. 300 destroyers. Yet Finn just knows which one to go for. So so dumb - we were all rooting for the good guys to die too. Thanks Disney for ruining Star Wars!
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,This was the beat Star Wars movie to date. This was amazing and to discover who Rey is the grand daughter of was shocking. The Sith are done forever.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Didn't like how loud the movie was but the movie itself was excellent
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,I loved the story and the action !
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"*contains spoilers*

I'm sorry to all the folks unhappy, but I for one am STOKED about the return of Palpatine. He is my favorite character- I love how erratic he has always been. The story line of Ben Solo is so rich, and the cheesey references to classic Star Wars films were delightful, and in my opinion, very much in the Star Wars spirit. Star Wars, since day one, has been a cheese fest. This is by far my favorite of the Disney Star Wars Films, and I walked into it thinking this one would be garbage."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Amazing end to a trilogy.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"Fun, exciting and as always, entertaining!"
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Watch it before it leaves the theater!
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,"to many loose ends being tied up, and no real flow to the move. Also very predictable"
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Great ending to such an amazing storyline!!
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Overall this was a decent finish to the Star Wars movies.  A fair amount was predictable and thus a little anticlimactic at the end.  It was great to have the original cast show up and provide wisdom to this generation.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,The storyline was great!
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,"Terrible Star Wars movie. While the music was absolutely gorgeous, there were a couple sad moments, and a couple funny moments most of the movie was just a mess. A nonsensical plot, new stuff added for the hell of it, and old characters brought back because the new ones suck. It was more fun to make fun of than it was to actually watch hopefully they scrap J.J. Abrams with someone who can write a coherent plot."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,This movie was an emotional rollercoaster!
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"Wow !!!  Loved every second of it. The reviews did not do it justice. Number one, it's a movie. Lighten up already.  Number two, the CGI was incredible. Number three, who saw Kilo Ren turning coming ??? I sure didn't. WOW !!!  Loved this movie."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,It's was not great but not horrible. There was some easy prediction of what was happening next. But still enjoyable to a point and an end to an era of storyline.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"I have been in all star wars movies for 50 years.
This one is a classic"
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Loved this!!  All the feels
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,It was an Asboultly Amazing Movie... I would Definitely go see this again
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Great conclusion to the Skywalker Saga Trilogy/Trilogy!!
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"There were some great scenes and moments, but the film overall was just okay."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,felt like it paid homage to George Lucas . I love the droids and the characters were funny and more of them.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,I'm not sure what movie the critics watched. This was the best of the new trilogy by far. I felt like Star Wars 8 worked harder than a sith at destroying The Star Wars universe. Lucky for us Abrams and his genius Team brought order to the galaxy. Thanks for making a show worthy of 40 years of devotion.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"Forget the critics. This is the fun, campy adventure we have all come to love from this franchise."
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,The male leads are have no charisma. The movie was too long. The movie was too loud.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,One of the best Star Wars movies.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,I am not a big Star Wars fan. I loved the last two Stars Wars movies though.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Loved the movie. Sad to think the story is over!
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Movie was not as good as I expected it to be. Ending was not good.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,good way to end the series!
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Turned a bit dark towards the end
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Such a GREAT movie. Makes you think about it for days!!!
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,"The movie jumped all around there was actually no development of the plot in s logical chronological Format. Whoever directed this movie should really go back to school. Because my guess is they probably flunked out in the first semester.  The actors are never given a chance to develop his characters, simply because of the lack of quality script and dialogue. Feel like stupid Mundane in action Spend your money and go see it"
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,I liked that it felt more like Star Wars again! I did not like the last 2
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,For sure fun! Great graphics but storyline confusing at times. Not the best release but definitely worth it.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,It's a decent movie. All though it felt really crowded and alot happens because the movie needs it to happen not always because it makes sence.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Finally over! Nice resolution to the whole epic.
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,Horrible story plot and character development.  One of the worst movies ever made.   Shocked Disney would release such a tragedy.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,I really enjoyed the movie. This way a great way to end the Skywalker saga. A big movie with lots to love!!
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"The acting, storyline, pacing, editing, humanitarian connections drew me into the movie.  I felt a part of it.
Excellent!"
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,It ended very well. I loved it.
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,"There was so little humor in this movie. The George Lucas era had a way of telling a heroic, big story with humor. "
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,I loved it! Really a great ending to something I've been watching since I was a kid!
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Thank you J.J. Abrams for saving Star Wars! My family and I loved this movie so much! You made Star Wars Great Again. It was an epic and fantastic story and worth every penny.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,I hated that it had to end!!
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Exactly what I wanted to see as a follow-up to a force awakens and a rebuke of last Jedi. I think Luke admitting he was wrong was a wink to fans that last Jedi was a mistake and rise was a return to form. Loved it!
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,like it a lot.. the message was really good
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,"No script continuity, full of fanservice and a ""Grand Finale"" that looks like an Marvel´s Endgame Meme"
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"The first half is fast paced, and I mean 2-3 minute scenes. 
The start feels like its already 30 minutes in and playing catch-up.
Carrie Fishers scenes were always going to be lifted from last Jedi outtakes (due to her death), but theyre really obvious, if you get what Im saying.
I did like the movie. It was fun.
But it felt like they shouldve made it a 2-parter,
And it wouldve been good if theyd given more time to foreshadowing a certain OG characters storyline.
All-in-all, 
Id rate it 3-3.5 out of 5.
If I were rating the trilogies given that theyre all done now,
Id give the original trilogy 4.5 out of 5,
The prequels 2-3.5 out of 5,
And the sequel trilogy 3 out of 5."
"Jan 6, 2020",neutral,"The final installment of the most unnecessary sequel trilogy has finally come, yet it doesn't deliver the one satisfying star wars story that we used to have 40 something years ago, I can see mr. Abrams trying to mend the broken The lAst Jedi left for us, thank you very much sir, but The Rise of Skywalker seem to prove that fixing the franchise with only just one movie is proven to be more destructive than constructive. Following the will of the fanbase is the secret recipe of success, only when it was done from the beginning. Now instead, what we got is one big of a convoluted mess, with little to no good result of the character development aspect that has been built up since Force Awakens, some parts just don't make any fucking sense, too much going on that no time for us to realize what the fuck is going on, too many inconsistencies, and all other stupid things happening that I personally can summarize in few words: It doesn't feel like Star Wars at all. No matter how many TIE Fighters, X-Wing, Star Destroyers, and planet-decimating superweapons you put in front of the camera, no matter how many times you see the Millenium Falcon flees the bad guys in one sitting, it is not Star Wars when you are forced to see a 2-3 movies cramped into one two-and-a-half-something-hour movie, it's something else, and it's not good, let alone remarkable."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Luved every minute of it...teared toward the end..
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,No plot line with the same old tired formula and new made up powers.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Best job that Disney could do to finish the amazing story of Star Wars
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,had a decent at best beginning and middle but ended better than I thought it would
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"I saw the 1st star wars movie, yes I am that old.  As always attended another Star Wars with wife and teenage sons.  Love the new and respectful reference to old memories.  Must see."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"SPOILER ALERT: This movie felt like Season 8 of Game of Thrones. All that setup in the previous seasons that leads up to a half-assed attempt to wrap up the story. Although TROS is not as bad as GOT Season 8, it feels sloppy and lazy as if to wrap up the story of Rey and Kylo Ren. The movie has a lot of tell but no show. In the movie when Palpatine has Rey pinned down with the force lightning, and all of jedi speak to Rey as if to encourage her, this would have been a great time to utilize the Fan Service that this movie likes to throw out at random times and show all of the Jedi helping Rey to repel the lighting. (Similar to Dragonball Z when Goku’s ghost helps Gohan with a Kamehameha). The movie is entertaining though. My biggest gripe with the movie though is that how is this movie going to be called RISE OF THE SKYWALKER when the the original Skywalker ANAKIN “DARTH VADER” SKYWALKER does not even show up in the film. Such a missed opportunity. I understand that Rey never met him and why Luke and Leia’s ghost show up at the end but for a movie that has so much fan service, you would think they would do it here. This also brings me to my next point. DISNEY hates the prequels 1-3 and it shows in this movie through the fan service."
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,"What, in the world, was all of that about?"
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"Great Film! Lots of fun! JJAbrams has his work cut out cleaning up the mess that was Episode 8. My wife, who isn’t a massive SW loved it. I am a massive SW fan, I loved it. The critics were wrong, the movie goers are right."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,It was a nice way to conclude the saga. I enjoyed and felt the force !
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,tons of action! it's in the mold of the originals. awesome!
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"I grew up on Star Wars and liked this one too. To me, not as good as the originals but still great."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Absolutely loved it. The visuals were incredible and the acting was flawless.
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,"So in the end the villains bloodline wins. The classic heroes are all dead. So much for ""They lived happily ever after"" huh Disney"
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,"Cinema is dead, and we killed it."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"Good finish to the story, loved rey's journey"
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Great storyline with lots of action.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Read a lot of negative reviews before going to see the movie with three of my kids. We all very much enjoyed it. I've grown up with Star Wars and have liked this new trilogy quite a lot.
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,"Can't believe it's been 42 years, additionally I can't believe this is how it ends.  Ummm, probably won't ever watch this or any of the other  6 ""new"" star wars movies. The original three and rogue one. I'm all good with those 4, end of story."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,I'm not really into any of the Star Wars movies but this one I really really liked!!!
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Better the third time
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"The fact that critics are panning this because ""it caters to the fan base"" is absolutely ridiculous. Why on Earth would you want to make a movie that the fans, which have kept the franchise alive all these years, wouldn't like? I appreciate the fan service and wish that JJ would have just done the whole trilogy"
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,The flashing lights! It's really hard for people like me to have epilepsy to go to the movies because of flashing lights. it's a chance we have to take if we want to see the movie. but this was me and my husband second wedding anniversary and he is a Star Wars mega fan so I got us tickets for our anniversary! otherwise the movie was very good.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"'Rise of Skywalker' is an enjoyable movie and a decent end to the sequel trilogy, but it's held back by a lack of creativity and cohesiveness with the overall narrative of the trilogy. There are a myriad of plotholes when you look at it as a sequel to 'The Last Jedi', and it feels like Disney wanted to distance themselves as far as possible from the direction that Rian Johnson was trying to take the franchise due to the backlash that Episode VIII received. In that regard, it's as if Episode IX tries to 'correct' the issues that fans had with TLJ, but by doing so, it makes the narrative of the movie feel a bit sloppy, like it was all thrown together at the last minute with an incredible amount of fan service added. However, it's still an enjoyable film; the adventure does feel fun, the characters have great chemistry with one another, and Ian McDiarmid's performance as Emperor Palpatine is fantastic. I'm sure this movie will remain extremely divisive with the fanbase as time goes by, but despite it's issues, I did enjoy it."
"Jan 6, 2020",neutral,"Lovely production, terrific action scenes, but a cookie-cutter script that echoed RotJ. It’s a must-see if you’re a fan of the series but I would have preferred something darker. It’s not without it’s charm, I saw it in 3D and it looked and sounded awesome but lacked any decent story line to the saga."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,it was a good ending to a saga i began watching as a child. Almost a love letter from past generations to present and future generations.
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,"it was tired, trite, and plodding. Followed the worst sins of the series. you could tell Abrams was crippled by the studio."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"moved quickly but still was great to watch, especially in 3D!"
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"I consider myself a fan of Star Wars, having seen the premier of the series back in the 70's.   Abrams tied up the series neatly, bringing all the storylines to their conclusions, and it all felt just right to me.  I thought Ridley did a really fine performance as a more mature Rey, and gave the final journey of the story a greater depth of emotion.  The 
 comradarie of Rey, Finn and Poe fit right in with the original cast.  The technical job of fiting in Carrie Fisher with old footage was astounding, you would never know it was pieced together.  (As for the ""professional"" reviews I read before seeing it, I have a hard time believing they actually saw the movie or cared for the series, they were so off.)  This is a really satisfying series finale for me and for all the people I know who saw the movie.  All of them said what I did...I can't wait to see it again!!"
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,It's a tall order to make the final episode of Skywalker saga after what happened in The Last Jedi. I don't like The Last Jedi because it's so contradicting with other Star Wars movies and basically destroys everything in Star Wars. People may complain about The Rise of Skywalker doing too much fan service but hey wouldn't it already be a fan service when they started to make the sequels? All in all The Rise of Skywalker is a good ending to the Skywalker saga to fans.
"Jan 6, 2020",neutral,"Those characters are so un-relatable.   Finn is pointless, just runs around yelling “Rae!”....”Rae!”"
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,The story was great!
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Loved  the whole movie 💕 Started watching Star Wars in 1977 with my son  and Ended it with my Granddaughter in 2020!! Fabulous Journey..
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"Would I have done a few things differently... maybe, but they would be so minimal they wouldn't change much. This was a FANTASTIC Star Wars movie. Felt like Star Wars with a new intensity. Finding that balance between doing something new, making it feel like the same Star Wars galaxy, and serving the entirety of the story is a difficult thing to do. I think JJ Abrams nailed it with what he had to work off of. Personally, I think Last Jedi was an atrocious portrayal of Luke Skywalker, barely moved the story forward, wasted good, intriguing characters, etc. etc. It wasn't all bad, but it was pretty bad. Abrams was able to make something very, very good out of that mess (I don't mean to rag on Last Jedi that much, but I kind of have to because of how much better Rise of Skywalker was in comparison). 

Some people criticized Rise of Skywalker because it was too much jammed into one movie, and catered to fans too much with too much leveraging of nostalgia. I could feel it being a bit rushed a couple times, but I actually enjoyed the pacing overall and the slightly rushed moments were not bad at all. Catering to fans is a good thing in my eyes. Especially when you're talking Star Wars. Add some twists and turns and you've got the recipe for a great, entertaining, film. And nostalgia... it's STAR WARS! The last of 9 films (at least for now). Why would you not want a good amount of nostalgia. I thought it was good balance honestly. And it all fits into the story.

Anyway, that's my take. If you're a Star Wars fan, go see it!"
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,I thought it was super loved every minute of it
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,That was the most convoluted annoying mess of a movie ... glad it’s over now 😡
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,"While some people heavily criticize the first two in the series for various reasons I actually  enjoyed the first two movies as they built up a little something. Maybe not go see it in the theater something but it had some potential to have a remarkable ending. However, this was not the case with Star Wars IX. There was a lot of junk just thrown together to create some form of nostalgic feeling for fanatics. The problem is, none of it made any sense. Literally I sat there trying to understand why certain characters were built up in previous movies only to be made miniscule. Why abilities never before seen were now amazingly available. The phrase,  Somehow... Magically serves as an explanation for some ridiculousness. Very poor writing. I felt cheated, like the director or producer or whoever is in charge just wanted to have a grand finale but forgot pay a team to design the fireworks layout and timing... So they went to the fireworks store and just threw a little of everything together."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Impressive...just as enjoyable as all the other Star War movies. Awesome for the 9th version.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Excellent made continuation of the Star War story. I enjoyed it and would see it again.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,love it  would  see it  again
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"I enjoyed it, not perfection but, it was good!"
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Loved the humor action mash up amongst the characters made the movie very entertaining
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,The movie was great 👌. You have to know the story line from the other movie. it connects
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,I loved all of the nods to the past movies and how it brought it all together.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Anyone age 45 or older who doesnt like this film is not a genuine Star Wars fan who attended New Hope in 1977.
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,Half the things in the movie didn't make sense.  The story was poorly executed and it was all action with no substance.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,great movie.  nice way to finish the series.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,I mean it’s Star Wars.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,It was totally a Star Wars film - better than the last one.  I think that J J Abrams saved the franchise and recovered from the previous debacle the best way possible.  I only wish there was more Skywalker to see.  Not sure what the future holds.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Loved it!!!!  I cried at the end! I cannot believe the saga that started when I was 9 is now complete!?!?  Well paced movie with lots of turns.. enjoyed it completely and will see again!
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,If you love Star wars then then this is the worst Star War movie ever made( of the 9) Lots of pointless trick and events that add nothing to the story. It's a clumsy Retcon of the previous movies. It was pretty looking movie but the plot and Storyline was a hot mess
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,#BenSoloDeservesBetter
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"The Rise of Skywalker was an entertaining film that lacked depth. It created compelling characters out of Ben Solo (Kylo Ren) and Rey, but it failed to create a compelling antagonist.

The film relied heavily on nostalgia and gimmicks. However, it comes as the ninth movie of an extremely popular series, so this was expected."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Speechless. Thats it.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Wonderful ending to a great series.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,I good conclusion to the store.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,It had a great ending
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Great ending to a great saga. Very entertaining
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"Fantastic!  Best one yet, perhaps."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"movie feel a little compressed.  they had to undo some of the crap that Ryan Johnson did in Ep8. if it had more time in the film, it would have been better."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Much better flow of story and characters over the last two films.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Amazing movie!! I am just upset that this one was ended. 😭
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"Overall, the movie was great. There were some parts I didn’t like and the cinematography wasn’t the best in some scenes."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,I think all in all it was the best Star Wars yet
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,I loved it and Rey is awesome. 
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,A solid ending to the trilogy. I will miss these characters.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,JJ did the best job he could have done.  It was enjoyable and had gave a proper good bye to the Skywalker saga.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"It has been an incredible journey from the beginning in 1977 to the end in 2019, thank you!!"
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,I enjoyed it. It did fill in one big hole in the story for me. Some things I would have done different but is the best of the Disney versions
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"I felt it drew the current arc to a satisfying conclusion. Loose ends were tied up (and there were a lot of these!), and we saw what we all came to see: lightsaber battles, light speed travel, X-wings. None of the action was disappointing. On the downside, I felt a lot of characters were introduced without leading anywhere, and a cynical part of me kept wondering whether this was a commercial decision."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,I thought the movie flowed well and answered a lot of questions that were outstanding.  The ending was great - the story ended where it all began.  A whole new franchise could be started from where the movie ended if they wanted to go that way.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"A hard thing to do to put the franchise to rest.
There are some amazing scenes, and no real ""stinker"" moments."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,I liked it all!! very clever at how Leia dies. the connection of Rey and Kylo Ren is perfect!
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,i loved it. so fun and fresh
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"If you knew that Darth Maul was alive before watching ""Solo"" you will be shocked how good this movie is."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Omg! I’ve only become a Star Wars fan recently (the last 2 weeks I watched all 9 movies in that time) and I absolutely loved it!! I highly recommend it!
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,GREAT RIDE!!  AWESOME CLIMAX!! SATISFYING FINISH!!
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,I enjoyed the story and tying up some of the story lines!
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Great ending to a great saga
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"*Spoiler Free*

So, that's it. The story of the Skywalker Saga draws to an end. 

Would the Sequel Trilogy ever live up to the magic of George Lucas' imagination? Certainly not. I had these expectations going into The Force Awakens, and each film in this trilogy proves why he never should have sold it, and never should have listened to cry baby fans (if it was my story, I sure would not, and WILL not when I release my own). 

That being said, The Rise of Skywalker is a fast-paced, recklessly moving film that demands a fan's attention to detail to appreciate it all. Is it perfect? Anybody expecting 'perfect' has their expectations too high. But, I had the opportunity to watch all 8 currently released movies before going into The Rise of Skywalker, and I can appreciate J.J Abrams and company's efforts. 

The Prequel Trilogy deserves more credit for its ability to not only provide a dark and moving origin story for Anakin, but for its ability to link to the Original Trilogy. It is stunning to hear Luke and Obi Wan talk about the Clone Wars many years before those films were even made: it is THIS detailed writing that the Sequel Trilogy lacks, due to the changing of hands between films. But, where The Rise of Skywalker succeeds is where the Prequel Trilogy succeeds as well: connectivity. Relevance to the rest of the story. As a writer, closing off the saga that another person created, with so many hands involved, would be a tremendous task. 

Perhaps that is the attractive part of The Rise of Skywalker: it knows its not perfect. It has a very human and emotional element to it, filled with nostalgia and questions being answered. I felt the space battles were underwhelming, but the lightsaber battles and the battle between the Jedi and Sith has never been more exhilarating. For all that The Rise of Skywalker has to juggle, it accomplishes its task with all the spirit of the previous 8 films rolled into one. Ridley and Driver steal the show in the final installment, as they have the entire Sequel Trilogy, but the flashback segments and tribute to Leia were incredible as well. 

I know the reviews have been negative, but I do believe people need to 'let go' and just enjoy the art for what it is. Flaws can be found in the entire saga of movies, and The Rise of Skywalker is certainly flawed. But, it is also a human, emotional, and thrilling roller coaster that will leave you wondering if we will ever see the Skywalkers again."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,The whole movie is very action packed. The first half is a little too fast paced and is the weaker half in my opinion. But the last hour is straight Star Wars and is great. The music hits as usual for a Star Wars film. If you like Star Wars action and Star Wars in general I think you'll probably like it.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,I have watched all the Star Wars Movies this was good but not great.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,C3PO at his best. Great stand-alone movie.
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,Over the top storyline. Movie was basically one light saber fight after another with multiple scenes where characters are killed only to re-appear. Enjoyed episodes 4 through 7 rest of films are waste of time.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,plenty of fan service but a really fun movie. Enjoy the ride!
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,The movie has very emotional moments and the ending brings the series back around to the beginning. I wasn't pleased with the last two movies so I was pleasantly surprised.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Loved! Please don’t be the last one!!!
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Kylo really hot that sassy shoulder shrug. King. 10/10
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"Considering that ""Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker"" is the third (or fourth?) time the franchise has used the same plot, the movie could have been worse. In the movie's favor: the closing out of this simplistic story of good (Jedi) v evil (Sith), seeing some old familiar faces (even those that are literally dead!), an overall enjoyable experience carried mainly by the two stars (Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver) and, best of all, the awesome ending battle with the Emperor (Ian McDiarmid is fantastic!). Against the film: as already stated - a re-tread, seizure inducing special effects, ludicrous battle scenes where the good guys beat the bad guys in the same ratio as their outnumbered (like 1 to 100!) and, most damning, requires a completer suspension of belief regarding all matters of science and mechanics even for the future. If you're a ""Star Wars"" fan, definitely a must see."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"WOW, this is a MOVIE 👏WELL👏 DONE👏"
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Action packed with lots of surprises
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,Not worth watching. Luke saving his father is insulted and thrown away. Wouldn't waste my time
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,"1 Star to counteract Disneys attempts of buying a better score. 

The movie was more like a 2/5, but still not very good.

Let me preface this with an experience in the cinema (Spoilers!)
At the end of the movie, we see Rey die, Kylo offers his life force to her and it ends in a ""romantic"" scene where Kylo dies after kissing Rey. Arguably, this was supposed to be the most dramatic moment of the movie - the entire cinema laughed. Like actualy laughed out loud. And that wasn't the only time they did. 
Because honestly, the film is laughable. 
Rey is a total Mary Sue.
The film is riddled with Deus Ex Machina. 
It breaks previously established lore and generally makes no damn sense. 

The one good part of the movie was the production quality - VFX, SFX etc. was as good as ever. A truly spectacular show. 
But if you're wondering whether you should be watching this film, or whether you'd rather watch the Showreel of Industrial Light & Magic, I would wholeheartedly recommend to watch the showreel.

Cheers and out!"
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Very good film. Help tie the old Star Wars films together. Highly recommend!
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,I new it was going to be bad but I think that I might've ruined a great childhood memory by waisting my time with this horrible movie.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Great Movie! Plenty of action!
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,A bit hard to follow in the middle. Music was perfect. Action was great. Great surprise appearances bit ending was just ok.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Amazing as always. #starwarsfans
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,"Hated the Last Jedi for its treatment of Luke. This one redeemed that slightly and was actually good up until the 1/2 way point. The multiple twists at the end with the Emperor made the story feel forced (no pun intended). The nonsensical stuff in the final battle (horses running on a flying Star Destroyer?) just made the movie non-dramatic. 
Lazy writing to close the plot-lines and sometimes shameless nods to previous movies trying to play to the long term fans, but in the end felt insulting. Its like someone said, we have to show Jawas and Ewoks somehow."
"Jan 6, 2020",neutral,"The music and special effects are terrific. If you have seen all the prior SW flicks, you can put up with the mind numbing stupidity of the plot and enjoy the resurrection of your favorite characters.  Much better final chapter than Godfather III, but that's not saying much since GDF III may have been the worst final chapter ever screened."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"Great visuals, sound and story. Yes, Im a life long Star Wars fan!!"
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"This film does a great job of redeeming a struggling trilogy and undoing the disaster of The Last Jedi. Fun, with plenty of action scenes, moving moments and easter eggs, Daisy Ridley made Rey likeable and tough. Don't let cynicism put you off, this is well worth a watch!"
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Action packed and great ending to the saga.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,I enjoyed all of the movie and the new characters. I missed a few points in the dialog that didn't make sense to me.Maybe see it again soon!
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"A few major plot holes, okayish lightsaber duels, and repetitively corny dialogues."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Loved the action! Could have a little more plot to it! Tried to cover 8  movies to conclude in one.
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,THIS IS FRICKED THIS IS MESSED UP
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,One of the best out of all of them
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,It was a classy ending to a classic franchise
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Loved the Death Star scene! Haunting
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"Loved it. True to the Star Wars genre action-packed, suspenseful, and perfect for new and old fans."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Excellent movie! Great acting and story. The Start Wars sequel and the legend of Skywalker continues in fine fashion.
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,"Just when you thought there was nowhere to go but up after The Last Jedi. This film can't decide what it wants or what to focus on - except for grasping at shocking callbacks that further undo the previous two trilogies of work. It looks pretty, so if it can keep you distracted, I guess you'll enjoy it."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Liked the action and the special effects. The story was choppy and I would have liked to see all the Jeti ghosts at the end.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"Great ending, cute humor!"
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Love Star Wars movies
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Non stop action and mystery
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,"visually the movie was great. the score was decent, and the acting was decent. but that doesn't draw away from the poor plot. much of it didn't make sense. poor planning and rushing to reshoot caused this movie to be a fail. most true fans of star wars will agree this was a bust, casual moviegoers would think this is a good movie. take it as you will. I only watched this movie because of discounted tickets, I wouldn't pay full price to watch this garbage."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"Lotta legit criticisms, but the thing still ended up a fun roller coaster ride. To be fair, this series should've stopped long ago [like after the original], so I can't get too worked up about the hinky bits in RoS. The humor was better than I thought, the story was almost laughably the same as at least three previous episodes but the spectacle of it was effective, the action was nonstop and the ending was kinda nice. Big laugh out of C3PO re-introducing himself after amnesia to Babu [""my oldest friend""]."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,I loved it!  Kept the action going the whole time!
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"My boyfriend and I are major Star Wars fans, we loved the movie from beginning to end!!"
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"My kid liked it, and that was the point of going, so there’s that."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,For me this episode tied up all loose ends from all movies. Fantastic 9 movie series. Loved every second!!
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Decent wrap up to the saga
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Lots of action and I thought they tied up the storylines well.  Ending was superb.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"It was fun in the way A New Hope, and Empire were. I would have like a good space battle more than the finale, but otherwise enjoyed it fully."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Enjoyed every minute of it. Star Wars at its best.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"I've been a fan of Star Wars since I was eight, and I've been fortunate enough to enjoy the Skywalker saga theatrically. The Rise of Skywalker was full of surprises and kept me smiling from ear to ear."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"Ok if you're a purest, I'm sure there are elements those of us just going for entertainment value might not catch.  Our family old & young loved it - great story, great action, CGI could be a bit tighter around Princess Leia but otherwise some nice surprises and we'd like to see it again"
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Don’t listen to the critics this movie was awesome. A new hope came out when I was a kid and now my son has seen all the movies an led thought this one was epic.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Very good movie overall
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"This was great, just wonderful. An amazing recovery from the conflicting second act. From the character relationships, the flow, the comedy, all of it was a great end to this series."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"Action, special effects  - it's a Star Wars movie"
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Story was a bit of a stretch.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,It was the best of this new trilogy and closed it great. Excellent fight scenes and dialogue. Lots of surprises.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"Really good movie
..can't believe it's over"
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,To much drama and the saga is ended.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Best Movie I’ve seen in a long time!!
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"Very respectful end to the Skywalker storyline. Plays it a little too safe, but in the end a very good movie."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Im old enough to have seen all 9 movies in the theater. It was a hard series to wrap up but they did a decent job. Better than any of the prequels for sure.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"I appreciate how the story ended. We all know that the stories have the same plot as #4, but it is enjoyable and worth seeing multiple times. Can’t wait for more Sagas!"
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"Great movie, specially for the star wars followers"
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,I loved this movie! Kept you on the edge of your seat and had lots of plot twist!!!
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,This is a disgrace to everything Star Wars. Disney ruined Star Wars and everything everyone loved from GL.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"I loved it. The special effects were awesome. The storyline was great, and the ending was perfect!"
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,Meh!  This whole new trilogy has been unoriginal and full of missed opportunities. None of the characters were well developed. Dont make any more movies until you have an interesting plot please.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,The movie was awesome from beginning to end!! A awesome addition to series!
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,it was okay. it definitely felt rushed and incomplete. Last Jedi had a good message that they kind of abandoned in this one. You can see they gave up with all the drama behind the camera and just decided to go for the fan service instead.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,The movie had the unenviable task of wrapping up an iconic series that spanned generations. While it won't win best picture Oscar it was a worthy final chapter and the average non die-hard fan should be content with how it wraps up. 
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Spoiler!! Disliked that kiss.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"Very satisfying, I saw the first Star Wars back in the 70's and like that one the story ends with the good guys winning, the bad guys losing.
That's how it's supost to be!"
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"Entertaining, fast paced movie. While it does have some fan service, it is a fitting end to the Star Wars saga."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,amazing amazing amazing
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Really good Star Wars movie! Worth checking out!
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"Love the movie, love the theater!"
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"Thought they did a great job. As always, there was some good surprises."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"For all that had to be done in this movie, I fell like it was accomplished incredibly well. It was clearly done with great care and thought. Ill see it again."
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,Disappointed by every thing overall
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"Lots of action, good acting, entertaining, great makeup and wardrobe"
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Answered and Closed all!
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"the best thing about it was that after all it was Star Wars.  However, the acting was poor and the story felt contrived. I almost felt like I watching a 1950’s B movie science fiction thriller.  But, it was Star Wars."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,I LOVED it. Cried through most of it. So dang emotional and triumphant
"Jan 6, 2020",neutral,"CAN be entertaining with some cool ideas but plagued by lack of development for anything, plot contrivances, and massive pacing issues."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"Typical Star Wars action.  Kept me entertained. Time flew by, so to me a sign of a good movie especially when its long."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Pleasantly surprised at how this epic adventure has come together.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"It was a very full and fun experience, despite some retcons and a bit of playing fast and loose with rules at times. Definitely a spectacle though, would watch again if nothing else to see the ships as shown in the trailer again."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Lots of action but way to many faces and facial expressions.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,not a fan of the series ending.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Best Star Wars movie in decades
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,I loved every min of this movie. felt like a throwback to the original star wars. DONT LISTEN TO CRITICS
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"Enjoyed the storyline, the cameo appearances, and of course the music."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Fantastic film. Exceeded expectations. Would recommend to everyone teenage and above.
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,Disney ruins this franchise
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,I loved every part of this movie. I dont want to give it away and tell details.
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,A rehash of old plots that made the film very predictable.
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,"Beautiful visually, but a piss poor story that was made to make people happy, not advance a story. The canon suffers for it"
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,Not that great of a movie. Predictable
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,For us Star Wars fans it was a nice bow on the series.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"Great visuals, awesome characters, a fitting end to to the Skywalker saga."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Amazing conclusion to an amazing series!
"Jan 6, 2020",neutral,"Meh, it passed the time for sure.  This movie is all over the place. Not exactly sure what to make of this movie."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"I liked the movie in general, just not the storyline."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"This movie had to rise to meet great expectations.  It ties off some loose ends, cauterized others. I felt the Jedi of Oz pulling strings behind the curtain,  which was disappointing.  The pacing felt off and the characterization, forced. It was pretty, and was still better than the first sequel."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"After feeling the Disney Star Wars films were massive letdowns, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  The characters finally hit a point of relatability that the last two films lacked and the intertwining of the legacy characters into the narrative was effective."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,I found the movie to be very enjoyable.   It brought the Starwars story to an end.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Despite the toxicity of the fanbases opinion of this movie I found it well done with a super satisfying ending to the trilogy well done jj
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,"This movie clearly shows that LucasFilm had never a road map to this saga. The whole story seems inconsistent with the previous movies. It seems they had no other choice to bring palpatine back just because snoke was gone (as well to be a crowd pleaser). Finn's character throughout this saga had no porpoise at all, being teamed up with characters like Rose (which was completely forgotten) and the new one which I don't even remember the name. The final battle had no enthusiasm and seemed like something we have seen a thousand times before. BTW, Lando comes back for no apparent reason as well. The only things I think they did okay was the way Ben and Leia were handled. I'm very sad, as I'm a great star wars fan, and this whole saga was very weird and disappointing."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Was not sure whether to see this one since I am not a good follower of the series and heard not so good things from followers. I just broke down and saw it today even though it is gorgeous out and would have loved a hike. It was worth missing the hike.I had a little disappointment that I cannot say and ruin it for others but the scenes were great.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Very well done. Tied all the movies together.  Great finish.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Enjoyed every minute!
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Absolutely the very best since the classic movies. It is an absolute must see!!!!!!
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Great movie!!! It was well done and was a great resolution to the franchise.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,I liked the whole thing. very action packed
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Poor production and editing. Very choppy and some bad presence at times.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Great finale to the 9 film series. J.J. Abrams manages to fix the mess The Last Jedi created.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Action packed. Suspenseful. Bringing back of previous characters.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,The movie was a good wrap up to the new Star Wars movies. I enjoyed it.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"LOVED this movie!!! Exceeded all of my expectations!! Laughed, cried and cheered!!"
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"Loved the action along with humor and touching scenes. It had a little bit of everything. If you can let yourself imagine and explore, you should enjoy this movie!"
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,The action was excellent. The story was a little hard to follow at times.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Visuals were incredible. Very satisfying ending to  the sequel trilogy. I felt that this movie did a good job of resolving open questions from the previous two films. Very entertaining. Maybe a bit long and some of the humor fell short.
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,Another bad shot at doing a Star Wars. Just really bad!
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Good not great......liked the ending
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,I liked where this movie wrapped up some story lines and the action sequences were gorgeous. A couple things felt a little disjointed and thrown in for this movie however the rest of the story and action. more than made up for that.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,There's not one thing I disliked about this movie. What an ending to an epic series.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"Absolutely loved this murder mystery, Especially  the fresh perspective used in this movie."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Its Star Wars   We loves it.  Starwalks rule
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,2nd time with the kids well worth it!
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,"Fun to watch, gives fans what they want, and it makes no sense as a movie."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"I thoroughly enjoyed it. While I get the criticizers, I felt it covered all the bases. I really don't think this is the end of the saga though."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"You can nickel and dime this movie for missing certain things and not answering questions you had, but it is amazing the way it is, and was entertaining throughout. The fan service was lovely and transparent. A fitting send off to the Skywalker Saga. "
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"I enjoyed the film, it did a good Job tying up the series.  I wished it fleshed out a couple of the characters' relationships,  but the movie was 2 1/2 hours long. In order to tie up everything it would have had to be 2 parts."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,The movie was okay. There were very predictable moments and still the cgi Leia was as weird in this movie as it was in Rogue One. There were unexplored character moments but overall it was passable movie fare.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Liked that the bad guy was good guy in the end.
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,"Dialogue was terrible. Save your money, don't see it. Tell your children there are only 3 Star Wars movies."
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,What a disaster of a movie
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,loved how they wrapped everything up!
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Old crotchety Palpatine finally gets eliminated... Again.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,The movie tied up loose ends of the saga. It has a mixed ending of good and bad.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Too many repetitions from themes & plots of the earlier movies.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"Not perfect, but still really good!!!"
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,As a standalone movie it was good. lots of action. as part of the trilogy confusing and disjointed from the other stories.
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"Great movie! My first Star Wars experience, thoroughly enjoyed it."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,Wish Disney would have just let JJ Abrams do the whole trilogy! This movie was the perfect ending to a storied franchise!
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Loved it all Star Wars can’t wait till they come up next
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,the movie was awesome!! filled in a lot of blanks for me. can't wait to see it in Blu-ray!
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,I thought it was a good movie. I liked the action and the fighting scenes.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"Great movie, great episode"
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Loved it the movie was great
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Fitting conclusion to the Saga.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"The film is enjoyable, but has many plot holes and it has massive pacing issues."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,I thoroughly enjoyed it. A great final chapter to the Skywalker saga.
"Jan 5, 2020",negative,the story doesn’t make sense
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Pretty good. Did its best to salvage the horror that was Last Jedi. Finn and the wanna be Han Solo guy (whatever his name is) are both still non-characters for the most part which is a shame but you can only pack so many fixes into one film.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"If you consider the almost impossible task that JJ Abrams faced on how to close out this epic saga that spanned over 30 years, he did a really great job! I personally liked the movie a lot. My one complaint (spoiler-alert) is when Rey asked for past Jedi knights to ""be with me"", when she heard all the voices speaking to her they should've flashed pictures of everyone that was talking. It would've been nice to see all of the former greats one last time (except for young & teenage Anikan)."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"Not exactly what I expected, but alot of good stuff in there. could have used a 4th movie though."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,I liked it. Lots of action.  Easy to follow from the prior Star Wars.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Don't over think it. Just go along for the ride like we did as kids and have fun.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Very good movie and ending to the trilogy.  Ok if there is more movies to come
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,So much fun to watch!!! Amazing ending to Star Wars.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"This is the movie that is made FOR THE FANS!! No, I don't mean casual fans who barely watch the movies. I'm talking about the people who play the games, read the books, watch the shows, etc. 

This feels like everything the LAST movie should have been and MORE! Honestly, if Disney did another Star Wars like this, perhaps prequels to the prequels like the Jedi vs Sith Empire or  Jedi vs Dark Jedi, THAT would be AMAZING!! <3

The ONE thing I had a serious problem with, was how the Asian woman got the short end of the stick in this movie. The consolation prize was seeing a badass African American lady who as amazing as Phasma SHOULD have been!"
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"It was a great movie. Plot isn't perfect but in no way is it bad. Wonderful effects and beautiful scenes. I really appreciated the nostalgic nods to the previous films, a great way to wrap up the saga. :)"
"Jan 5, 2020",neutral,Same storyline as return of the Jedi
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,A fantastic conclusion to the trilogy.  It was just a fun ride one last time through the Galaxy and nicely recovers from the travesty of TLJ.  J.J. truly is a great filmmaker as now this movie makes episode 8 unnecessary to the story.  You can watch episode 7 and jump straight to 9 with very little missing.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,I think The Rise of Skywalker is a fun enjoyable film with a few problems the biggest being that this sequel trilogy had no plan.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,A decent movie. Worth seeing once. I still think Disney dropped the ball overall with the Star Wars universe. Too many things were changed that makes you scratch your head about previous movies. Still this one is much better that that dreck that was Episode 8.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Special effects were well done and great cast.
"Jan 5, 2020",negative,The only Star Wars film I felt like leaving half way through. Should have gone straight to daytime kids TV.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Questions were answered!
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,A very satisfying story.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,It was amazing and super intense. Acting was wonderful and I was filled with emotion. Must see.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"Nothing to dislike , Beautiful movie and a great way to end the Star Wars  Saga. 
May the Force be with you!"
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,The best!! So intriguing and inspiring!! Evil never ultimately wins. Good always ultimately wins!!
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,This movie was so good for me and my family! We all loved it. Everything fit together so well and had the most amazing story line. Definitely one of the best star wars movies i've seen.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"I liked the action and how the movie used the extra footage of Carrie Fisher/Princess Leia, and I also liked how the movie wrapped up the loose ends.  I would have given it 5 stars but I never felt a connection to the characters and their plight like I did in the previous two movies and the original SW movies.  There was just too much going on over the entire movie, it kept switching from one crisis to the next and it felt like sitting next to someone constantly changing the channels on a TV."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,A solid finale to a story that started long ago in my childhood
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,you'll like it as a fan. critics suck
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"If I tell what I liked about it, I would give away the plot.  I loved it.  Others I went with, not so much."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,I loved it!!! the especial effects and the performance of all the actors was great!
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,I LOVED LOVED LOVED IT!!!! It is a LONG movie.... but I didn’t want it to end!
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Enjoyed the whole movie. The creativity is awesome!
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"Some parts seemed not to splice together well, both with the story and the movie’s cadence."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,I loved it - satisfying.  Much better than the last one and I think best of the movies. on par with rogue 1.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Movie was great! Kinda predictable but otherwise a good rap up.
"Jan 5, 2020",negative,"Mediocre ending to the Saga. Boo Disney!!!

Ruined it!"
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"I freakin loved it. Im absolutely flabbergasted as you how this movie got mixed reviews. I am 20, I understand long time fans but this movie and trilogy has been fantastic to me. Ignore negative and positive reviews, please watch the movie for yourself"
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Pew! Pew! Nice wrap up to the series. Don’t expect a great work of literature - just buckle in and enjoy the ride.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,An awesome ending to an incredible saga.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Loved everything about it!! Glad I saw it in the theater!! Thank you it was a great run!!!
"Jan 5, 2020",negative,"Nothing new. If you seen one Star Wars film, you have seen them all."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"I thought it was great. I hate to admit that I’ve been watching these movies for 45 years now (ouch)!  So, for me it was just a fun “ride” through the past movies—-tying up loose ends and seeing characters from previous movies."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,It was fast paced and had a great ending.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,it wrapped up the last 3 movies nicely. Palpatine was Awesome! sure they dudnt make our favorite books but they are great stories. A great ending to the Skywalker story.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Best of the new movies!
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"I almost didn't see this movie because The Last Jedi was an abomination, but I went anyway with low expectations. What I liked about the film was that it brought back Luke Skywalker and Han Solo and gave them honorable ""goodbye"". The artistic design and graphics were beautiful and exciting. The minimization of Rose Tico's character (the equivalent of Jar Jar Binks). Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver's acting was stellar. But the rest of the movie was too rushed, unexplained, confusing, and too short. There were SO MANY throw away characters. The character I connected most with, emotionally, was Chewy, when he fell to his knees sobbing when Princess Leia died. That's how I felt about the the trilogy. But it was definitely better than The Last Jedi and I would willingly watch it again if I had to."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,It was an okay end to the trilogy. Some good fights scenes but not very original.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"With clear evidence that there was no plan at the start of this trilogy, Disney and Lucasfilm do everything they can to please the most difficult fanbase of all time. The finished product is meant to be a tribute to one of the biggest franchises ever, and if you can turn off your brain, you may enjoy the ride."
"Jan 5, 2020",negative,The characters and context of the first two movies in this trilogy are totally lost in this nonsensical mcguffin chase hodge-podge.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Great movie!!  Loved it!!
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,It was a great movie that was fun to watch!
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Best of the new trilogy. Made up for the disappointing 2nd part.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Great movie.  Loved it all.  Great acting and directing across the board.  A wonderful ending to an amazing saga!
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Wrapped up the whole thing. But left it open for more.
"Jan 5, 2020",neutral,"It was ok.  Some really cliche parts, like the end.  And the middle.  And the reveal.  Mostly entertaining."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,The issues people have with this movie stem from issues with the last Jedi. If the last Jedi were a better movie this one would be received better. That’s the only reason it feels out of place or that things don’t connect. 
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Loved everything about it!!!
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Great story and end!
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Best Star Wars since the first three. It’s a great ending
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"Love it!! It’s a wonderful movie like all the ones before. But, it was sad to see Leía. Ready eyes. Just a reminder she’s really gone. Luke and Leia are the true stars of why I keep watching these movies. Ray had big shoes to fill in and she did it wonderfully."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"It’s Star Wars meets Harry Potter. New powers for Jedi, living and dead abound. The emperor returns ala Voldemort. Disney’s commercial fingerprints are all over this thing. Carrie Fisher in a major role is kind of creepy. On the plus side Rey is a good choice for the new Jedi and the main characters are all pretty good."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Love it I have waited for 44 years to watch all 9 episodes
"Jan 5, 2020",neutral,"Boring, emotionless mess. It displays the poor planning on Disney's part."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,What a way to end the trilogy. So many emotions flow through you if you love Star Wars! A must see!
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,I loved this movie!! Great storyline and the action scenes were so thrilling!!
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"Loved it, and thought it was one of the best in the series."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"J.J. Abrams did what he could to salvage the mess that was Star Wars: The Last Jedi. As a die hard star wars fan and expanded universe nut, I would have taken the film in a couple different directions but it was an overall good film. Poe and Finn are still worthless characters with no arc or purpose, but i'll take what I can get."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Not the best but def not the worst
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Great action sad ending
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Nice ending to the saga.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,An awesome send off for the Skywalker saga. I believe long time Star Wars fans will find tons to like about this movie.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"Great start. Plodding midsection with one of the worst lightsaber duels, ever. Decent ending. Answering Maximus, yes - I was entertained! Was I satisfied? Not fully, to say the least."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"Very nice ending to this amazing saga, that I have enjoyed since 1977 when Star Wars was released. No serious dislikes about this film, which was the most crucial being the ending film in the saga."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"I really enjoyed this latest SW saga.  It was way too long, but it was true to the SW movies."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Incredible movie. Loved the action and wrapping of the story.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"some twists I didn't see coming 
good movie action from the start"
"Jan 5, 2020",negative,"This film backpedals on almost everything established beforehand.  Undoes most of the themes from the original trilogy and recots a lot of the best moments.  Every example on how NOT to make a film.  

None of the motivations make any sense and there are literal plot holes that no one has been able to adequately answer.  Yet nostalgia has people enjoying it."
"Jan 5, 2020",negative,"the plot was a bit convuluted and the movie never settled... it was also extremely loud in IMAX, enough to be a distraction. not a satisfying conclusion to a great saga."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"Felt like a star wars amusement park ride. Space chases, light saber battles, incredible CGI."
"Jan 5, 2020",neutral,"I'm a big fan of Star Wars and unlike many enjoyed the two newer trilogy films, however even my love for Star Wars didn't go as far for me to like this movie, the references felt forced and the movie felt rushed. There were so many plots and storylines that weren't followed up i.e. Finn and Rey, the whole movie felt like it was trying to clasp the strings of the old movie; if not this whole third trilogy felt like a remake. They are worth a watch but are nothing like the originals ( a lot to live up by tbf)"
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"Forget the pros who probably weren't even born when the first Star Wars was filmed. This is a tail of adventure, humor and thrills, just like the first one. I'm still smiling two hours later! What an outstanding finale... or is it?"
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"First Star Wars movie I have ever seen , I’m a fan now"
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"Little slow, but overall great movie!"
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Great star wars movie. My daughter and I loved it.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,IT'S A GOOD MOVIE!!!!!!
"Jan 5, 2020",negative,"Better than the first two films in this trilogy, but thats not a high bar to hit. Disjointed story that once again revived around wrapping I s that can destroy a planet. There are a couple of heavily contrived plot devices that make no sense and just left me shaking my head. Lots of attempts to evoke past glories. Im so glad this convoluted, Ill conceived mess of a story is finally over."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"An excellent way to spend a couple of hours.  The critics who panned it were wrong, in my opinion"
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"I enjoyed watching the movie a great deal. Apply your own force power of suspending disbelief to get the most out of watching this finale. Then just sit back and let the experience sweep over you & enjoy the emotive high points. Remember that Star Wars has been Space Fantasy from the very beginning. It was never intended to be science fiction. Granted, they keep adding new Force Powers whenever it is convenient to the story telling (which if used in the earlier episodes would have changed everything). 
To paraphrase Omar Khayyam:
The screenwriter writes and, having writ,
Moves on: nor all thy Piety nor Wit
Shall lure it back to cancel half a Line,
Nor all thy Tears wash out a Word of it."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,very good conclusion to the saga
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Good Star Wars story. Held to the history of the force.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Great wrap up to the end of an era.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Oh look convenient new force powers followed by nostalgia and more nostalgia oh and here's some humor. I'm not sure what I was looking for but it wasn't this... I am conveniced that this movie was just a third installment of series of money grabbing movies.
"Jan 5, 2020",negative,This movie does not explore Star Wars law. It does not extend the Star Wars mythology. It's not a Star Wars movie. Far too many coincidences and messy / rushed scenes to even be a compelling or fun movie. What a wast of talented actors and a great composer.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,A truly excellent film. I admit I can see why the critics don’t like it and why the public generally do. A rather satisfying end to a 42-year-old story! Glad I saw it at the cinema and I really enjoyed it
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Thank goodness they finally kissed!!!
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"Great film. Honestly, a great film. The closing it all deserved."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,This was a great movie!!! It answered a lot of questions.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Answered a lot of questions! Now time for new story lines!
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"It gave me a good ending to the saga. there were a few things I didn't like, but overall a fun movie."
"Jan 5, 2020",neutral,"Weak transitions, impossible physics, too many character loose ends tied up too quickly and an unnecessarily long final battle with a gazillion too many spaceships."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Good movie but odd pacing. Wrapped up some loose ends and left others. A Star Wars fan must see.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,I peed a little! Such a good movie! 👍🏾💯✊🏾
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"Was good, loved the cringey kiss"
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,The story is basically a remake of ROTJ. Not much new other than Disney trying to unravel the storyline of the first 6 movies done under George Lucas.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"Great way to end the Skywalker saga. there were some nice twists too. Some you saw coming, others that you might not have. The very end has a nice surprise that hints at where they might go next. Sure there moments that they borrowed from other movies in the series, but I feel it was more of a homage than being lazy or unoriginal. Enjoyed the movie and excited to see where they go next."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Don’t listen to the critics.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Better than the reviews I read. A lot.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Great ending. Enjoy.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"Really well done ending to Star wars saga., second time going to see it!!"
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"It's not a terrible movie, but it's certainly not the way to end a story. Way too much focus on fan service and not enough attention on making a good story. "
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"Makes the trilogy worth watching. Episode VII was a failed pseudo-remake and episode VIII suffers from having to deal with the mistakes made in VII while trying to set the ground for IX. This one makes it all not only bareable, but actually enjoyable. Fast paced, action packed, full of cameos and overall a worthy ending of the Skywalker saga. Highly recommended."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Loved everything about it!
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,A little rushed but overall good movie
"Jan 5, 2020",negative,"I've always used this website to see what movies are good and never really set up an account until now to just say how terrible this movie is. Visually, it's good. CG is good, cinematography is good, but the writing is what annihilated this movie. It destroys continuity in so many ways not just from Last Jedi (it absolutely erases it) but almost the entire franchise. That includes the prequel trilogy. Another way of how the writing is terrible is broken down into four parts: subverting expectations trope was done abysmally, there is very little time to breathe and take in what happened (Lightsaber or gun fights at almost all times until about the second half when things start to slow down), lazy/rushed dialogue and character development, and broken logic/strategy (if no one came to help on Krait why does an entire galaxy show up to help). This movie is basically a career destroyer for JJ and unfortunately possible for some actors (Rose's actor had to shut down social media at one point)."
"Jan 5, 2020",negative,It was practically Return Of The Jedi reboot.  This was no good.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Tied up the story lines. Good action.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"Like the rest of the sequel trilogy, this movie is gorgeous. Anybody that tries to deny that clearly hasn't watched the movies. That being said I had some issues with this movie; The plot was weak, and the story arcs of some of the main characters remained incomplete at the conclusion. I am however getting tired of people saying these movies are bad, because they are not. All OG trilogy actors bring their best to their characters, and the actors and characters of this trilogy too are great. The weakest part of these movies are their structure and plot. I will give this movie a slight pass as they had to deal with the passing of Carrie Fisher and handle her story in a different way, but it still could have been done better than this. All in all, an enjoyable movie that any Star Wars fan could like. Not love, but like."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,I am satisfied with the ending of this saga. Never perfect but this was not The Last Jedi.  👍🙃
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,loved the story line and great graphics
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,LOVED the nostalgic feel!
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Captured a lot of the flavor of the original.  Definitely improvement on predecessor (which is only one that I've watched only once).  Good end to saga.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Movie was a little slow but turned out to be a really good movie!! Some tear jerkers though!!
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"Great effects, family movie!"
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,I as a star wars fan must say that this movie is beyond amazing!!!! Director pulled it!! thank you so much for great film.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"I think that to the disaster given to us by TLJ, JJ makes miracles and really gives us a ""New Hope"" for the series... so to speak, welcome back Emperor, even though a Lightsaber battle with the emperor was missing... good job!"
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"fast pace ,lots of action stil there is something missing.   Have anyone taken notice about the robots  r2 d2 and c3po the story's is about their journey."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Loved it! Put closure together!
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,The best Star Wars movie that has been released in many years!  This is a must see for any true Star Wars fan!  I really loved how the entire story was brought closure and little things from the original movies which could be easily missed.  I could watch this over and over just like I have the originals.
"Jan 5, 2020",negative,"Yet another franticly paced Abrams film where the plot is always convenient predictable and deus machina random solutions and MacGuffins constantly push the roller coaster plot through green room CGI sets. Most of the dialogue is cringe one liners typical of most every B rate action film. Star Wars movies are typically cheese movies, but this is the new low."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Another epic Star Wars movie!
"Jan 5, 2020",negative,more of the same poorly contrived deck
"Jan 5, 2020",negative,"So glad this SW saga is over. It was required viewing, but got so stupid and politically correct, it was tough to stomach. The Ewoks were tolerable, but Jar-Jar was ridiculous, purple-haired Adm Holdo was too much, ending Luke and Leia the way they did was just stupid.  Han's death at least served some purpose.  They had access to any writer, and cast, and any script they could have possibly imagined, and THIS is what we got?  I suspect there will be some spin-offs and maybe even some other prequels, and as much as I loved the original trilogy, I doubt I'll see it at the theater, maybe on cable, but it has certainly fallen from must-see territory forever.
The wheels fell off a long long time ago in a movie studio not so far far away.."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,A fitting end to the new trilogy.  Brings the saga full circle and leaves the audience with a warm fuzzy feeling as Return of the Jedi did for the original trilogy.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,If you come in with no expectations and love star wars it will be a great film however the film does fell packed and rushed with decisions and may have been better longer and some choices changed
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,The movie it's amazing❤️❤️
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Amazing! I don’t mind that a lot of it was to “please the fans” there was so many great moments. Great job!
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Terrific took grandson and daughter and husband all thought it was great!
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"Great movie , the acting of Daisy Ridley was absolutely amazing!"
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,I liked the way it tied the saga up.  Tears rolled down my cheeks when Carrie Fisher was on screen.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"Was a spectacular watch, effects and characters are great. The cohesive story line and the overall culmination of a series this prolific left a bit to be sought after, but I know die hard Star Wars fans that liked it and others than disliked.  I’m somewhere in the middle"
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Doesn't deserve as negative the ratings that it has gotten. pretty good.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Loved it!  Loved seeing all the characters!!!
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Same Star Ears excitement. Yeah to the good guys!
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,The tomatometer is so inaccurate and I never trust it. This movie was solid from start to finish and didn't a great job concluding the journey. I didn't even like Rey or Kylo until this movie and I will say this is perhaps my favorite one. Definitely go see on the big screen. 
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,It was good much better than the last one and finally answered some questions.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"A couple plot holes, but overall a fantastic way to end the saga!! Bringing back some of the memories and props from the original trilogy!!! I called so many things out that would happen and they did!!!!"
"Jan 5, 2020",negative,"Sloppy filmmaking and messy, unimaginative story."
"Jan 5, 2020",negative,This movie was no bueno. Ruined Anakin's legacy.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,It was an amazing movie and I can’t wait to watch it again.  There just wasn’t a single thing about the film I didn’t absolutely love!  Well done JJ and crew on bringing it all home in the most satisfying film since the first Trilogy.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Brought the good points and action of the Star Wars saga without being redundant. Good action and storyline left one wanting more
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,I was just so happy and sad to see the conclusion of the entire saga that began 42 years ago
"Jan 5, 2020",neutral,Just fair. Tired plot line with no new surprises. Time to go.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,In all honesty this is by far my favorite of the sequel trilogy and I really enjoyed it.  I've like every Star Wars movie and this one doesn't fail me.  I have a few issues regarding pacing and the ending but overall if you enjoy Star Wars this is worth a watch.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Absolutely fantastic ending to this story!
"Jan 5, 2020",negative,This movie attempts to revive a dead franchise by trotting out all of the once loved characters of the past.  It failed miserably.  What a waste.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"I am a sci-fi lover.  But Ive never put on a costume or attended a convention.  Ive also loved the Star Wars series because of its cutting edge approach in story line as well as filming techniques.  It used to be fearless... a kind of us against them attitude that said if you like this film youre cool, if you dont youre an idiot.  So, watching this latest offering smacked of just how far the mighty have fallen.  It was as if the P.C. Culture police had an office on the film set.  There wasnt a pet cultural icon missing.  It was as if the makers thought that checking off the list of expected P.C. inclusions would earn them favor with the powerful.  

And the script had moments where I could have written better.  At one time someone said something like the galaxy is watching... oh please.   I do however give points for attempting to bring all the dangling story lines from past efforts into some kind of closure.  And the use of cutting edge technology was as wonderful as ever.  Having a major star present in the film long after her passing was beyond simply being impressive.  And placing vintage footage of faces in modern costumes really passed the thats cool test.  

But the star of the project in my opinion was John Williams.  The final battle sequence and subsequent victory party was Mr. Williams at his best.  The iconic use of musical themes for various characters or emotions was expected.  But I was impressed in the fact that John Williams could have just coasted past the finish line with a good enough score.  But this was a new level of excellence... even for him.  Absolutely breathtakingly delicious.  

In all... without taking all this too seriously... if the objective was to entertain... they succeeded fully.  Could it have been better in my opinion... yes.  But when all is said and done, it continued the series objective in one word...  FUN."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Great way to end the series ❤️
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"Good movie. Die hard fans will nitpick small details about the storyline, but it is an entertaining movie."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Was ok but not what I was expecting
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Ties the whole story together!!
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Great ending to 9 films. Great movie by itself.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,It was everything I was hoping it would be for the end of the Skywalker Saga!
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,I’m definitely going to watch it again. MASTERPIECE 👊🏽🔥
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,I have been a fan since a little kid when A New Hope came out.  I am sad to see it end but I was a bit disappointed in how it does. The name of the movie is very misleading. There is action from start to finish which is awesome. If you’re fan it is a must see. I don’t expect any academy awards but it is entertaining.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"It was good, not great. Much better than The Last Jedi. I'm happy to see this trilogy end and excited to see what they do next."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Star Wars. Always amazing!
"Jan 5, 2020",neutral,I do like fast paced movie. But this Star Wars is too fast. No character developments at all. I was expecting more of it. Disappointed.
"Jan 5, 2020",neutral,"Formulaic,  well done but predictable.  Like the last book of a long series being written by a stand in author."
"Jan 5, 2020",negative,"Just didn’t do anything right at all and I already had low expectations. I tried to give it a shoot but damn the story makes no sense, DISNEY is messing everything up. The fight scenes didn’t even do anything for me they were boring. In all honesty, C3PO was the only thing keeping it together."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Absolutely loved it! Great ending to the saga. So many loose ends tied up and amazing battle scenes!
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Great end to the Star Wars story.  Action packed with compelling characters
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"I viewed the Rise of Skywalker and enjoyed it so much, I went a few days later and saw it again.  It's clear from professional and fan reviews that many wanted something totally new instead of properly closing out the existing story-line. That's sad because the missed opportunity was their problem, not the film's.

Yes, there some issues that concerned me, the biggest two of which were how Rey progressed in her Jedi training so quickly and later why Luke would raise the X-Wing fighter instead of Rey.  In my mind, these are of no real concern to the completeness and enjoyment of the movie.  In fact, in this new installment, I thought it was pure genius to make Rey the granddaughter of Palpatine.  This gave credibility to her level of giftedness and more importantly (spoiler alert), it made it credible how she could successfully fight and win against Palpatine himself.

One additional outcome was that it brought a new emphasis to the fact that, even if you give yourself to the dark side of the Force, you are not necessarily lost.  Kylo may have thought that was the right course, but it was clear that Rey truly did detect conflict in him.  Kylo was not lost in the end and Rey's faith in him also was not lost.

Many felt that this trilogy was a wasted, but the development of Rey as a new Jedi figure was the natural transition of life, wasn't it?  Someone new was needed to carry on this legacy and the granddaughter of Palpatine was the perfect choice.  Where does it go from here?  Is this the actual end of Star Wars?  The film seemed to suggest that a new saga could be in the offing, but it will be critical in my mind that any new films have to provide a new direction for the fans.  All I know is that I will be there to watch them when and if they do arrive."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,emotional rollercoaster!
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,a good blend of new and old
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"A very entertaining movie, great action and winning performances from Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley. The best of this final trilogy. "
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,I am not what you call a huge Star Wars fan but I liked the movies that came from George Lucas than the ones coming from Disney. The Rise of Skywalker was alright but after watching it I realized that I could have waited for it to come out on blu ray.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"It answered questions and made me laugh, cry and cheer. I will miss the saga of my youth."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"The Rise of the Skywalker finished the saga with a ton of action. While there are familiar themes and scenes, it sticks with the overall concept of the original trilogy. The only negative is that it could have been slightly longer and wrapped up a few loose ends. Overall it was enjoyable and met the desired action and adventure required for a Star Wars movie."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Skywalker saga is over...
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"This movie was a great end to the Skywalker saga.  It is a ride from beginning to end.  You're amazed, you cheer, you cry, and it was an amazing movie.  If you hated the The Last Jedi or we're disappointed by it, you'll love this movie.  If you loved TLJ, then you'll hate it.  It's that simple.  This movie is everything a Star Wars Movie is all about. 

All things considered, it could have been a lot worse with what JJ had to work with.  The Last Jedi catastrophe nearly wrecked the franchise.  It's nice to have things back on track."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Can't wait to see it again 😍
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"Enjoyable. Suffered some pacing issues and writing flaws, but I liked it."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,I enjoyed emeancley. There were lots of surprises.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"I went into this with low expectations after the dumpster fire of The Last Jedi. He had a lot of work after Rian Johnson’s train wreck. Overall JJ did a good job trying to wrap up loose ends, answer questions, and do fan service with the original characters. This film much more like an original Star Wars film. I walked out satisfied and really enjoyed the movie. Nice work JJ."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Excellent special effects Top notch.  story line was ok.  Acting was well done.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"Wrapped the saga nicely.  Thrilling, entertaining and very enjoyable."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Excellent movie for the diehard Star War fans
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,I loved it. I thought it was a perfect ending!!!
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,loved the movie and would go see it again!
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,The script was predictable and similar to past movies. Not much changed but the kids enjoyed the special effects.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Love Star Wars!!! Great ending but dab at the same time!
"Jan 5, 2020",negative,"A film with wonderful acting and a brilliant score that is undermined by an underdeveloped plot filled with inconsistencies and plot holes. For a series conclusion, it leaves many questions unanswered and raises many more along the way - without answering some of those either. You could probably get a better plot from 3 fans in the span of 2 hours of development. Not that the plot doesn't have potential - it just fails to reach it. To distract you from this, Abrams whisks you from scene to scene without much time to process. Until, when you finally do process it, you realize that many of the scenes in this movie are pointless and un-thought out. Rise of Skywalker was clearly written in response to audience reviews of movies 7 and 8, and incidentally there is no coherent plot throughout them all. Despite all this, it was worth seeing exactly once, just to see how bad it was for myself. I have no need to buy the movie or see it again."
"Jan 5, 2020",negative,It’s Star Wars so it’s worth watching but what a weak and disjointed plot these last films delivered.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"The best Star Wars movie since the original trilogy, everything a fan could want wrapped up in a tidy two-hour package.  Even if you didn't like the first two of this trilogy, give this movie a try."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"Loved it, sad it’s the last Star Wars movie."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"It was very good fan service and a fine way to end the Skywalker Saga. There are a lot of holes and fleets of fancy, and JJ Abrams/Kathleen Kennedy should both stop doing anything related to Star Wars. That being said I found it to be enjoyable, however implausible it may be, and the interaction between Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver was easily the best part of the movie."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,I loved it. I cried a few times.
"Jan 5, 2020",negative,All over the place no real story
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Great ending to the Saga. Good bye Skywalkers.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"Another example that the “critics” don’t get the whole sci-fi category: awesome movie, well writing, and I great way to finish the “new batch” of start wars, HIGHLY recommended!"
"Jan 5, 2020",negative,"This movie doesn't doesn't do justice to either the old characters or the new. This last trilogy was unecessary and ended up being shockingly cruel for all the beloved OT characters. 
No more Skywalkers, no more Solo's, so I'm not interested in SW any more despite being a fan for years. 
The lack of consistency when you consider the three movies should have worked together as a whole and flown into each other seamlessly is so frustrating. They should have worked together as a whole but the don't.
I wonder whose idea It was to 'gift' us all, especially the children,with such a depressing hopeless ending. Wasn't SW supposed to be a series of movies for all the family? Who thought It was good idea? Really JJ?"
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Great acting. Story line was good. Fun watch
"Jan 5, 2020",negative,3/4 of the movie were irrelevant and uneeded and alot of it did not make sense if you think about things
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Definitely better than what Ryan Johnson did for TLJ.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Not bad. I’m not the biggest Star Wars fan but I enjoyed this movie.
"Jan 5, 2020",negative,I kept falling asleep. Directionless mess. Wasnt funny or engaging. Sad
"Jan 5, 2020",neutral,"Just as the the last two movies to concude this saga this movie is not really good and the last movie that skywalker deserved. It is let down by bad storytelling, bad casting (with the exception of Daisy Ridley as Rey), to much copying of the old trilogyplot, even some bad visual effects (blowing up of Kijimi), a feeling of a lack of passion and the much focus on fan and crowdpleasing.

It is ok for a evening of entertainment and some moments are gorgeous and make you feel the excitement you had when you watched the orignal trilogy but on the overall it dosen't even come close to a happy closure of the skywalkersaga! The original trilogy deserved a better closure anno 2020!"
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,I liked how all the movies tied back to this new installment. The special effects were great. Only wished Yoda was involved in Rey's training and Finn finally told her what he wanted to tell her.......
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,As a fan of Star Wars I was obligated to watch. Liked it more than previous 2 movies but still not the same atmosphere as in prequel which I consider as a model.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"Great movie! It was more like the original 1st 3 movies and the last one movie. Had several of the original cast was enjoyable to see but not to much of them. The effects were outstanding! If you like Star Wars, you’ve got to see in in the theaters"
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Thank you JJ Abrams for undoing what Rian Johnson did!!
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Rey and Kylo had an excellent journey as characters Finn was used fantastically in this film. A lot of heart. A lot of humor. A fitting end to this saga!
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"I got such a warm Star Wars feeling by the end! Sure, I felt like the start was a bit disjointed and some of the ending was a bit far-fetched, but they did the best job I think it was possible to do, given the massive expectations I and other fans had!"
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,By far my favorite Star Wars movie of the sequel trilogy and the best Star Wars movie since ROTS. I expected to hate this movie like I did with TLJ but I was pleasantly surprised
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"I loved how they brought the original characters back for this movie , if only for a brief moment ."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Great action packed movie@
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,The best Star Wars movie ever
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"I couldn't disagree with half the critics more.  I don't think giving me everything I wanted to see is a bad thing and this movie certainly does not disappoint! Save the unexpected for another franchise, and give me my nostalgia please & thank you! Well done J.J. Abrams... I had chills during the movie, and I left the theater with a smile... bravo."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"Average. Didn't really enjoy the first two, so to be completed honest, I'm just happy it's over. If there's more to come, I really do hope they start fresh. These new additions just don't cut it for me. Great animation and all, but story is just lacking, and if you don't have a good story, I could care less for the animation."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"Super entertaining! I didn't totally follow the plot, and a lot of moments were definitely contrived to pluck those nostalgia heartstrings, but even with no real ""surprises"" in the story, I was entertained."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,The ending scene where all the media speak to Rey.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"Despite some rather questionable plot points, The Rise of Skywalker lives up to the task of dishing up the thrilling ride we ask from a Star Wars adventure.  Wonderful characters, emotional confrontations, nail-biting situations.  And the nostalgic nods appreciated and not overdone."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"thanks i loved it, even the obvious parts."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Enjoyed the special effects and how the story unfolds.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"I dont get the negative reviews - I loved it and thought it was exciting, emotional, and a perfect ending. Seeing ALL the characters come back was a real treat. Best thing to ever happen to Star Wars was getting rid of George Lucas."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"I liked how most things were resolved.  We finally know who Rey is.  She was wonderful.  It was nice to see Han Solo again, that was a nice surprise.  Cool that Rey had even more power than realized with being able to heal and shoot lightening from her fingers."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,it was a good conclusion to the saga
"Jan 5, 2020",negative,"Absolute garbage pile  that spits on the grave of classic Star Wars. It's a bit better than the previous flaming garbage fire that is The Last Jedi but that is hardly a high bar. 

If you want a shallow, pathetic nostalgia trip and are able to completely shut off your brain in order to ""consume media"" then feel free to waste your money in theaters"
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,A nice but sad conclusion. Kinda left it open for more of them if they decide to continue with Rae though.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"Great action, great acting, phenomenal special effects, cool plot twist... only downside was a ton of story crammed together."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Loved all the closure and full circle ending of it! Thanks for the ride.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,They saved the best for last. I was kinda getting bored with the same or similar track of all the Star Wars movies with some character continuity but the last this particular movie ended properly for me.  DONE!
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Great ending to a great story! It was an amazing movie. 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
"Jan 5, 2020",negative,Style over substance.
"Jan 5, 2020",negative,No new gizmos in this.. Using a dead woman very unsettling  Carrie Fisher is GONE
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Mediocre at best. By far the better of the three current films but this latest trilogy are basically standard sci-fi films. I feel too much damage has now been done to the Star Wars legacy.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Loved the special effects in the movie.  Didnt like that Ben died in the end.  It was a great movie.  My grandson and I are great fans of the Star Wars movies.
"Jan 5, 2020",negative,"seen it just to confirm what i had read/seen on the internet. first half of the film is damage control, fixing the issues the last film caused. last half is really a race to the finish.  thank god its finally over."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"This was one of the best Star Wars movies ever!  I loved how Abrams wrapped up the saga and there were so many great moments in this film that I was in tears and so happy by the end of it.  I cannot believe that this movie would have anything less the 90% in Rotten Tomatoes, which actually was the reason my boyfriend and I waited so long to see it.  But seriously, this was a fantastic movie, with lots of shocking reveals and twists on the saga, but also great storytelling, acting, action, and pace.  Definitely a Must See!"
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Story and visual effects.
"Jan 5, 2020",negative,Just OK. Another missed opportunity to tell a different jedi's story that expands our knowledge and history of this star wars mythology.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"If you have ever seen the other Star War movies, played the video games, or known someone who loves Star Wars-GO SEE THIS!  Loose ends are tied.  Little snippets Mande me tear up, I must admit.  I went to the theater in 1977 to see the first one.....been to all of them.....at a theater.  You need that experience, the smell of popcorn.......get into your happy place and enjoy!"
"Jan 5, 2020",negative,"I thought it was horrible. There was way too much action. And, it lacked terribly with storyline and human element. The fact that finally Ben is turned around and falls in love with Rae and they kiss was wonderful but that was short lived when he was killed off.  It ruined the movie.  And, the end was confusing.  I was not able to figure out why she is now a Skywalker.  This movie was the worst of the series.  Ashame for what George Lucas accomplished."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"Solid film I had a few minor gripes with. Overall, I had a lot of fun!"
"Jan 5, 2020",negative,Formulaic and shoddy writing.  JJ and crew should not be proud of what they have done to the franchise.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"Great film, definitely go and see it. There are a few things I could critique about what decisions they made but overall, a must watch. Awesome action too."
"Jan 5, 2020",negative,this was shit compared to the other ones
"Jan 5, 2020",negative,"An unsatisfactory end to a directionless trilogy with no real story, vision or plot which makes me feel sorry for the waste of this talented use of actors."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"Brother and I had the same reaction - this is objectively not a good movie, and we enjoyed it so much.

Thoughts with some SPOILERS:
- I actually thought they did a good job redeeming Kylo - wasn't expecting them to, given the magnitude of what he did and how so many people seemed to love him anyway, but the end felt satisfying, and I didn't expect that.
- So very many plot holes. How did several characters survive? How did they leave a planet without a ship? Who actually made that dagger? What actually is time and/or space? What can the force NOT do at this point? WHAT DID FINN WANT TO TELL REY???
- Everything was Too Much.
- Every time Carrie Fisher was on screen, I wanted to cry. I don't think they did a great job incorporating her already-filmed scenes into the movie, but it's hard to complain about it.
- Merry!
- Did we really need another droid?
- I also kind of loved the new droid.
- Wedge!
- Poor Kelly Marie Tran.
- Poe and Finn are absolutely in love and there is nothing you can do to convince me otherwise.
- It would have been nice to have more than two seconds to absorb finding out who the spy was before killing him off, but kay.
- I kind of want to watch it again immediately."
"Jan 5, 2020",negative,"They simply ruin everything about Star wars, sooo disappointed"
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"Palpatine is back and was building Sith Eternal behind the scenes likely with his trusted Imperial Dignitaries we saw in Return of the Jedi. Now his plan has come to fruition. Loved everything about this, the aliens, the planet settings, the epic battles, this is the Star Wars we know and love!"
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"Amazing soundtrack, great camera work, beautiful and exciting visual.
However, the plot was meh, and seemed very close to the original trilogy.  I would have personally like to see them take more risks in this trilogy to break the cookie cutter ""Star Wars Plot"" of god find the bad guys base, turn the bad guy good, and with the power of the combined force take out the base and save the day, blah, blah, blah.  The prequels tried to create their own story (but weren't great).  But I feel it could have worked if they just did it a little better.
Another thing of note is that the dialog came of as cheesy quite a bit and almost felt like there was too many moments of trying to get cheep laughs in moments that didn't need it or where it just didn't flow with the story."
"Jan 5, 2020",negative,"Entertaining but has several plot holes. I  think with killing off Han Solo and Luke Skywalker in the previous movies that the plan was to focus of princess Leia, which of course went up in flames due to Carrie  Fishers death .  Yes the plot was rushed with many WTF moments but I think they did the best they could though with what they had and ended it in a decent way .  Super fun movie , but fans of the saga will notice the plot holes"
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,This movie is a blast.  It's not perfect by any means but it was definitely a fun and emotional movie.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,I thought it was a great ending to a great series!
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"neat,it felt a little like the movie was pandering to the fans there were also too many characters but apart from that 4 stars"
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Action from start to finish! I enjoyed the movie a lot
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,I think that this movie ended of the skywalker saga in an amazing way.
"Jan 5, 2020",negative,"Garbage, Disney ruined Star Wars, thank you Disney"
"Jan 5, 2020",negative,not a good movie and a very bad ending.luke and leia personality is not the same at all they must be sad to see this.the sword fight is stupid.they scream more when attacking as if they are not even a jedi. not a lot of alien than before. a lightsaber that cant cut people like before.a lightsaber that can be used by everyone.hahahahaha. revenge of the sith is the best and the old ending is much better than this.stop doing something stupid just to get money atleast read the comic.
"Jan 5, 2020",negative,"If I were to write the entire reason why this movie is dissappointing, it will come out as an essay and this movie doesn't worth that much attention. 

The simple reason is that TRoS suffers from a heavy case of bad writing and it wastes TOO much potential that I can't forgive it no matter how flashy the actions or how cute the creatures are. At least the actors are all great and bring their best despite the messy story."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Lots of excitement and really ties the whole series together.  Fun!
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Loved it! I think the critics need to rewatch it - I think many opinions could change as they absorbed more of the heavy plot lines.
"Jan 5, 2020",neutral,Disappointing end to an amazing saga.  Plot disjointed with poor explanation.  Too much homage to prior episodes.
"Jan 5, 2020",neutral,"It was a movie full of fetch quests. Get this dagger, get this translated, get chewie, get this triangle, destroy this...oops wait what now, never mind now destroy this one. It was full of plot holes and filled with garbage characters. Plots of previous movies were destroyed by this one. Its just messy"
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,We felt that it followed the first movies story line and production. Loved it!!
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Well made/produced still giving me goosebumps since the first episode I saw 33 years ago.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Like how all characters were brought out to a point to show how it was all connected. Loved my last Star Wats movie
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"It was amazing! The storyline, the character development and the emotional connections were perfectly written. The effects were of course amazing as well. The closing scene was genius and leaves you wanting to know what’s next! Loved it!"
"Jan 5, 2020",negative,"The best that could be done with the trianwreck of The Last Jedi weighing it down. This movie still suffers from plot holes dizzyingly unnecessary plot twists and a frenetic pace from start to finish. Its entertaining, but ensures that this Star Wars trilogy will forever be a black mark for the franchise."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"As a Star Wars fan, I was very dissapointed. The way this movie uses the force is as if you could take on a god."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,i really enjoyed the movie. especia
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"Choppy cinematography at the beginning had me wishing for more continuity in the flow of story, but the rest of the movie was superb. Have a few questions still even with all the closure."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"Special effects were amazing! It was intense, funny and good storyline."
"Jan 5, 2020",negative,Least appealing of all Star Wars movies. Lack of excitement. We fell asleep in 3 D movie.
"Jan 5, 2020",negative,"Took itself too seriously! No chemistry between the characters.  Same old tired Star Wars themes: my relative is evil, will I be good? and WAR. Some of the landscape shots were cool but the general trajectory of the movie was meh. Too scary for my 10 yo child, left 90 mins in."
"Jan 5, 2020",negative,"This film was pretty bad in a lot of ways. I would need to see it again to have better perspective, but I don't really have a desire to — as opposed to the The Force Awakens, which I saw three times in theaters. 

It felt like the first half of the movie was running from scene to scene trying to tie loose ends from previous films (or in some cases reframe them) and that the choices didn't always work. The scene cuts were often so fast, that before I had a chance to feel the affect of a scene, the film had moved onto the next scene. The result was I didn't feel much of anything for the characters or their storylines. 

With this trilogy, I feel Disney mishandled Rey. I've watched three movies where she was the focus, and by the end, I didn't really feel any attachment or connection to her character or story — which sucks, because I wanted to. I don't want to spoil the movie, so I'll tread lightly, but there is a scene where she really accesses her anger for the first time, and the consequence felt like it had real impact on another character, and her —  until it didn't. I also don't feel much for Finn or Poe, or really any new character in this trilogy. 

In the best dramatic storytelling, we care about characters, no character feels safe, we mourn their loses, and we celebrate their wins as of they're our own. This movie struggles to do these things well. I did start to feel some emotion towards the climax, but it was more out nostalgia because I've been watching these films since I was a kid, and I care about the Star Wars world. But honestly, I felt more emotion in the first ten minutes of Pixar's up than this entire trilogy. 

I read that after Carrie Fisher passed, key scenes had to be rethought, that muddled the plan for the trilogy, including a scene in the second film where she would have emerged as a Jedi master wielding a lightsaber. This would have been a cool transition into the third film. I'm sure Carrie's death had an impact on the choices made for both The Rise of Skywalker and The Last Jedi, but the filmmakers really failed to step up to that challenge. This actually makes me sad as a fan. This might be the worst of the nine films.  

With all of this said, I loved the Mandalorian. If you're a Star Wars fan — watch it.  I hope Disney  takes what they've learned from that project, and that they apply it to future Star Wars movies. I want to see simple emotionally driven stories about characters I care about."
"Jan 5, 2020",negative,Spends an aweful lot of time to shit on it's predecessors. Senceless unemotional Story with an unearned finale.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,I think the movie is fine.  I don't understand what the critics are looking for.  There is a lot more of character development in this one than TLJ.  It's unfortunate the Star Wars saga ended when we have finally gotten to know all the new characters.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Good movie. I enjoyed it but there were too many plot holes.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,The best móvil of the Last trilogy
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"Great overall, I would give it 5 stars if the ending had been better."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,I thought this movie was fun and a great closing to the story!
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"44 years old and have always loved Star Wars. If you are like me then you will really enjoy the finale, very well done. I've now seen it twice and it is packed with new adventures, the right amount of humor, and an ending fitting of the franchise."
"Jan 5, 2020",negative,The plot of this movie was a complete 180 to the prior movie.
"Jan 5, 2020",negative,Boring and predictable
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"Great movie, definitely worth watching I’m theaters. The only negative is it feels a bit rushed and honestly could have been broken into two movies with greater detail"
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"That feeling of good against bad, and the power of simple people making a difference, came through loud and clear."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"I can’t go into details without spoiling the movie (there’s plenty of spoiler moments), but I will say that I was disappointed with the direction of the story and some of the reveals. I think the biggest challenge for J.J. Abrahams was trying to undo the storyline mess that Johnson created in the “Last Jedi.” Visually, the movie looks awesome. The special effects are some of the best you are going to see."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,I think there where some things missed in the making. If Jedi’s can levitate why are they always climbing things?  I enjoyed it and loved the ending just wish they had payed attention to some of the small things like reactions matching the situation.
"Jan 5, 2020",negative,"I’m not sure what I watched but it was not Star Wars. Droids having human emotion? The dead using the force? So much aweful content crammed into 2.5 hours. I literally almost walked out several times. I can’t, I might actually be done with Star Wars all together if this is how Disney Christmas closed off the Skywalker saga. No class."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"Fast-paced, fun, and a little heart-wrenching for fans of the Skywalker Saga. Definitely requires multiple viewings to take it all in."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Great ending for series. Lots of cool fight choreography and of course amazing special effects.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,it was a fun tale the end of which was predictable as is Disney.. Still enjoyed it very much.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,My grandson loved the movie and was thrilled to have watched it!
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Storyline was good and tied the trilogy together unlike the second movie.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,I thought it was a great movie and fitting end to the saga.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Saw it twice already
"Jan 5, 2020",negative,Too much hype to see this. This movie was a remake of episodes 5 and 6
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,I liked the movie and would recommend it to anyone that has seen the others!
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Wraps up 40+ yrs of storylines. Well done
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"Action, storyline, characters, actors, past and present make this an enjoyable story. See in 3D with motion seats. Motion seats alone just doesn’t cut it."
"Jan 5, 2020",neutral,It was to long & it still left it open for more storylines. I wasnt impressed with the latest chapter in the Star Wars story.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,I like it its entertaining
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Overall it did what the fans wanted and that's more important than what critics think and makes me question what need there are for critics when what really matters to most people is if other people liked it witch clearly they did. It should be audience score first then critics not other way around.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Action-packed! Emotionally charged and visually stunning! Thoroughly enjoyed this movie.
"Jan 5, 2020",negative,"Really bad installment, like the other two in the sequel trilogy, it lacks Anakin Skywalker as The Chosen One. Anakin is the backbone of the Skywalker Saga. 
What's supposed to be ""the finale"" of Skywalker Saga without Anakin Skywalker himself can not be a decent finale. The fact that the Emperor returned ruined Anakin's legacy as the one who destroyed the Sith and brought balance to the Force, and it's even worse to leave the role to Rey - a newly introduced character who's technically not a Skywalker at all. The title itself ""Rise of Skywalker"" is a misleading one."
"Jan 5, 2020",negative,"Better than episode 8, but still a complete failure to live by the legacy of Star Wars."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Overall disappointing
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,I was disappointed.  The movie is lacking something.  I’m not sure if it’s the acting or the storyline or the editing but just did not measure up to many of its prequels.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"Great movie. It has a lot of things packed into a small time frame so be aware. Unlike the last JJ Star Wars film, it doesn’t feel like a remake of another film. Some of the comedy was corny and a bit cringe but overall the movie was fantastic."
"Jan 5, 2020",neutral,"My opinion is that they tried to put way too much information and ""in your face"" action scenes, especially at the beginning. It looked like it lacked in direction contrary to the first one from JJ Abrahams. It's like it needed to be finished ""quick""."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"Good moments and concepts. Story is an utter mess, especially when considered among the other movies and content."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"Loved it, best STAR WARS film ever!! Tied all the story lines up really well, please make another!!!"
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"Hit all the right notes. Answered questions, and said goodbye. All I needed."
"Jan 5, 2020",negative,"Not good guys... it looks like 2 movies in one, the first one trying to excuse himself for the Episode VIII, the second one trying to finish this trilogy. Unfortunately as none of the new characters have been well established with goals and personnality, we don't care about what happens to them. Everything goes way too fast and adding new characters was a bad choice as we can't care less of them.

The saddest thing is watching all those old characters and feeling nothing for them neither. Thanks Disney, JJ and Kathleen for this 1 billion fan trilogy. May Star Wars rest in peace now cause it finished 36 years ago, in galaxy far far away."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"Not sure what the complaining was about.  Tied the old worlds and new together nicely.  Well made, dramatic.  Loved it."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,If you have been a fan since the 1977 release of the first Star Wars Movie you will like this movie. Go see it!
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"It does a great job of continuing and tying up the Jedi/Sith mythology. It’s FUN, it has surprises that make sense and terrific adventure."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Great ending for the saga down to the last minute.
"Jan 5, 2020",negative,"I know it's a Star Wars film so total plotting is not always needed. But how did the Emperor return? Like any clue at all?  In the original trilogy (and even the prequels) you get drawn in by looking up answers for these things and finding out depths to the films. Here you just go ""huh?"". Threw away all the interesting world building in the previous film too."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Great action with an almost perfect story .
"Jan 5, 2020",negative,"Terrible ending. It was messy, all over the place and you can tell it’s a very rush script. If you turn off you brain, you can enjoy just the Star Wars visual, otherwise the story is not coherent with saga. It’s not about the Skywalkers saga. Don’t waste your money. Wait till it goes on cable which is always free."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Thank you for sticking to the classic formula.  We saw it in 3D IMAX and that made it all the more special.  It was everything we have come to expect in the series.  We found the many homages to those passed very heart-warming.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Not sure how this movie got any bad publicity. It was amazing. I left wanting to buy another ticket and watch it again.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,It was awesome and so perfectly tied everything together.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Predictable but entertaining
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Classic Star Wars fun
"Jan 5, 2020",neutral,"Action was great, but storyline had holes."
"Jan 5, 2020",negative,"Sophomoric dialogue, predictable plot"
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"The Star Wars saga finally ended in silence, just as it began. I was hopeful that JJ Abrams could bring us a memorable ending, but he fell short of that goal. Seems that all of the sequels and prequels had the same plot, just with different characters. They had to resort to bringing back long-dead Jedi to remind us this movie was somehow connected to the original George Lucas masterpiece. Some cute, new characters but many were just human bodies with some animal or fish-type head on top. Strange? And the storm troopers! They must be the worst army in history as they never hit anybody in the main cast and get killed like toy soldiers. Same goes for the New Order fleet, which looked so imposing yet was easily destroyed by a small fleet of junked star fighters. All in all, very disappointing and have to admit I nodded out a few times during the way too long debacle."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Can JJ Abrams somehow erase “Force Awakens” and “Last Jedi” and remake them? “Rise of Skywalker” actually felt like you were watching a Star Wars movie instead of wasting time and money on garbage.
"Jan 5, 2020",negative,"It is safe to say that Disney burned the entire movie fanbase. No continuation of the ""main"" story of Star Wars will be coming for a while. With the success of the Mandolorian, there will be more spin-offs. A predictable downfall for sure."
"Jan 5, 2020",neutral,If you don’t really know the lore of StarWars then the action will be amazing. But for those that know the lore will not like the plot and you’ll have a lot of questions.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Anyone that tells you they didn't like it is either a liar or just not a movie fan of Star wars.
"Jan 5, 2020",negative,"Rey killed Chewie. ""Sike!""

Rey killed Kylo!  ""Sike!""

Ben fell into a bottomless pit and died!  ""Sike!""

Rey died!  ""Sike!""

Rey's gone into exile.  ""Sike!""

C-3PO has lost his memory forever!  ""Sike!"""
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,It was big and loud with lots of things blowing up.  True to the Star Wars brand.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Excellent conclusion to the saga
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Great overall liked bringing back original characters
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"Brilliant, magnificent, overwhelmingly satisfying and the best film in the saga. I don't understand how anyone could dislike this film"
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Great movie with super special effects
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"Enjoyed it a lot, but a lot of really strange lines and very predictable big picture moments. Regardless, definitely worth seeing and overall a fun movie. Stays true to the originals in some good ways."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"Loved it. Without question, best one of the series. Didn't hesitate, it is fantastic!"
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Such a great way to wrap up everything! ... and I mean EVERYTHING!!!
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Great movie. Action pack with a twist of humor and romance.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"Has a few flaws but puts a beautiful end to many storylines, especially from the last jedi. The only thing I'm sad about is the storyline of Rose, just because some fans didn't like her"
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"A typical Star Wars extravaganza- fun, loud, crazy characters, lots of action. As usual, the plot was the same as all- evil vs good. Good job tying up loose ends. Nice to see some of the early characters. I would watch it again to look for the minutiae which is always interesting."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Great installment to the saga. very good ending.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Special effects and story line.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"A beautiful ending to a beautiful saga. An unpopular opinion, maybe but I personally enjoyed it more than the previous two (TFA &TLJ)."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"The movie ran too long. It was drawn out at times. The ending was not rewarding enough to justify the long time spent in the seat. The special effects were good, but I think we have already seen too many aerial battles in aircraft and too many swordfights with light sabers. I don't want to sound like a hater. It was mostly pretty good."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Too much chaos at the beginning.... overkill on the action before getting into the story
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Aside from a few plot holes the movie was brilliant - it had a great emotional heart and delivered far stronger characterization than we have seen in Star Wars for a long time. Ridley and Driver blew it out of the park and anyone hating on this movie is just being contrarian for the sake of it.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Nothing to write home about.....
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Not bad but a bit rushed.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"Loved all the action! Shed a few tears. However, I was slightly disappointed about the ending. Just give the people what they want for a change! And some of the ending didnt make total sense."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Liked that they brought back the original characters.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Its a great movie and a end of  an era!!!
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Great resolution of stories.
"Jan 5, 2020",negative,"The movie was totally rushed and basically crammed damage control in to fix the mess of episode 8. This trilogy has been anything but good, and definitely inconsistent in the plot."
"Jan 5, 2020",negative,"I guess they did the best they could after the last Jedi. So many horrible little things, like Ray is sailing a boat in huge seas and rain and her cloths are dry. Fin is a total disrespectful twat to Po, suddenly Ray can heal things, the bad guy is a spy. Ah they just make it up as they go. Thank goodness it's all over."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"Awesome movie, no clue why it received all the negative reviews. Saw it twice, second time was even better.  Very satisfied."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"Excellent! Best of the last 3 and as good as the very first.
Great job JJ!"
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,It tied up a lot of loose ends. I just really enjoyed it.
"Jan 5, 2020",negative,"I enjoyed it when it was over, but after a short while, I began to think about what I had just watched and gradually felt disappointed. Wasted potential throughout."
"Jan 5, 2020",negative,"Great visuals, fast paced action.  Nothing makes any sense, there's force healing now being thrown around (Anakin missed that class), and I guess the Emperor is back but we never hear why or how."
"Jan 5, 2020",negative,I have two words to describe this movie: unbelievably dumb.
"Jan 5, 2020",negative,"the whole plot , caracter development, ending doesn't make any sense"
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"If u love character on Skywalker saga, it no reason not to watch"
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"Not as bad as the general consensus makes it out to be - perhaps there is just too many feelings around the Skywalkers/Jedi history & canon that Disney would do well to continue with non-connected characters like in ‘Rogue One’ and ‘The Mandelorean’.  It’s time to finally leave the classic character behind and safe.  If this movie serves to help the audience appreciate the underrated ‘The Last Jedi’ a little more - another movie trying to focus more on our new characters of Rey, Finn, Poe, & Kylo - I’ll appreciate it.  ‘The Rise of Skywalker’ proves a fitting transitional/“ending” chapter, but does not cross into the higher tier of ‘Star Wars’ films like ‘Empire’, ‘Revenge’, ‘Rogue’,  (‘Last Jedi’, IMO), and the original ‘New Hope’.  ‘Skywalker’ will rank somewhere amongst the middling films: ‘Return’, ‘Attack’, & ‘Force Awakens’."
"Jan 5, 2020",negative,A Rushed movie that jumps all over the place.
"Jan 5, 2020",negative,"Dreadful patchwork movie with copy paste content, both literally in terms of special effects and plot line. Spends more time retconning than building a plot and begs the question of why make this trilogy to begin with? The answer is that as a standalone story it would be a bland mess, whereas shoe horning old cast members makes money. I'm relieved this trilogy is over and hope that I don't need to watch anymore Star Wars in the future. The half star is to also represent my disappointment in the cast themselves. Daisey rarely ever closes her mouth, Adam is over hyped as an actor and looks gormless throughout and John lacks the charisma that he desperately tries to bring to the role. This is so bad that my appreciation for the original content has even weakened. No longer a fan and will give these a miss in the future."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"Movie wasn't bad but it wasn't good either. It has many plot holes and its so fast you don't have time to process what you see. It has good visuals and music, performance was good too. Some story arcs were wasted and the movie wastes so much time ""fixing"" the ""mistakes"" of TLJ. The fan servise was also too much and kinda turned me off while i enjoyed the fact that some of the plot was inspired by the Dark Empire Trillogy."
"Jan 5, 2020",negative,"No plot, mini quests, a lot of lore is just trown away. I did not enjoy the movie. I wanted my money back... it makes me sad, Star wars is dead. It was close enough to GoT ending."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,I liked it. My sister loved it. She follows StarWars closer than I and would robanly give it 5 Stars. If I saw all of them like she has I am sure i would be giving it 5 stars as well. It was very good.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"FANTASTIC !  Great action, special effects, and a ending that did not disappoint."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"great graphic, new story, myth, just bad directed"
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,J.J. Abrams did a fantastic job salvaging the franchise for it's final entry. The story flowed well and although structurally very similar to the Return of the Jedi it has its own flavour
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,A trully star war story. O could not loved it more. It feels the same as old star wars.
"Jan 5, 2020",neutral,It lacked excitement
"Jan 5, 2020",negative,Movie fucking sucks dude
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Good could be better rylo ken
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"While it has many flaws and tries to be all movies at once, it is a great damage control to the monstrosity and failure that TLJ was and tries to undo many mistakes, this movie steers the ship in the right direction but it doesnt save the trilogy, Mary Sue is still invincible and the potential for some crazy plottwist turns to sand while playing it safe"
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,It's a good star wars movie tainted by the last jedi
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"It just feels like Disney took a scrap book and shoved in anything for fan buzz. Poor George Lucas, he must be regretting the sell now."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"Dont know what all the negativity toward the film is about, it was pretty entertaining, worth it just to see chewie get his medal. Empire was destroyed, emporer palpatine died....again....All good."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,A solid end to a.mediocre trilogy
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"I was tired and didn't have my grandchildren to kick my light head in when I fell asleep but that's what I did, for approximately 15 minutes, mid point, not a foggy what happened in that time. 

In my defence, I'm 55, was an ‘original' SW kid: lightsaber, Vader voice honed to perfection in gruelling school competitions, hating/lusting/wet dreaming over Leia, yes I was defo there. Yes, this does past muster but nothing more."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"First let me say I love the originals, I love the new Fin, Rey, Po, BB8, Kylo- but Im sick of The the poor story writing and power inconsistency. Its just bad  writing and directing to have character who can fly and leap huge distances to then struggle to climb a tower (Face palm). The movie is long places where it should short, sappy about losing someone who we theoretically dont know is dead, and why can some Jedi be powerful ghosts while others just die??? But there are some true amazing visuals and cgi, some gem one liners and a couple feels."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"Pretty hardcore fan who hated TLJ, this Movie clearly went out to right wrongs and tick boxes. Which it did.
I loved it, I cried tears of joy way too much.
Just makes the TLJ pointless which is a good thing."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,I’m not the biggest fan of the sequels but I absolutely loved rise of skywalker. I can’t decide if I loved it more than revenge of the sith after a week of thinking. Fantastic movie
"Jan 5, 2020",negative,"This movie is some how worse than the last.  They spend so much time trying to correct the sins of the last movie that nothing actually takes place.  To make matters worse it's the same as the last.  Empire has guns, we have only a few hours, let's go to 5 generic planets, fight sith, looks like hero dies, hero doesn't die, good guy wins.  Terrible terrible terrible"
"Jan 5, 2020",negative,For me a very bad film. It feels like J.J.A. went through the craziest fan theories on reddit and put ist together to a ‚story‘. 1 Star for the great actors of Ren and Ben.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,It was good movie made me remind 40 years ago the first movie of Star Wars!!!
"Jan 5, 2020",negative,"Convoluted, rushed, poorly paced and stupid. Just awful."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,It was great a little of all the first ones
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,If you are a star wars fan you will not be disappointed. Very happy to have watched it.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Loved the ending to this amazing saga.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"Absolutely loved this movie, our grandkids 11 and 15) loved it and all the other star a wars movies also ) A must see           I tell all ! 😀"
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Amazing the whole thing
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,I thought that it ended the saga well.  I loved the lore that it kept and parts of the story that it closed.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"Did the absolute best they could with what The Last Jedi left them. It's a shame that they didn't plan a cohesive story from the beginning. 

I could forgive all the flaws in this trilogu if they hadn't of shown such disrespect to Luke Skywalker and Mark Hamill."
"Jan 5, 2020",neutral,Acting seemed forced. Came off like a made for TV movie. Special effects average. Very disappointed.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"They tried to fit a lot into one episode, but still all in all a good ending to the series."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"I was excited but sad because this is the final chapter of the Skywalker saga after 42 years & 4 decades in the making by George Lucas. Also the 3rd & final film in the sequel trilogy, I was very concerned of the entire plot will turn out of each of the characters in the Star Wars universe. Glad Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Billy Dee Williams came back for one final time, including Carrie Fisher in spirit. The original characters meet the new generation. I saw it at the El Capitan Theatre on a late night show & I knew the staff gave us a photo opportunity with the stormtroopers. Before they displayed an amazing laser & show. It was magnificent. I want everyone to respect the film & the legacies of Carrie Fisher, Peter Mayhew & Kenny Baker. The film was amazing & emotional as well, I felt a tiny bit of tears in my eyes when Leia dies & now one with Force with Luke. Even surprised of Kylo Ren / Ben Solo's redemption & sacrifice for his family & Rey. I thank George Lucas & everyone who are part of the Star Wars franchise."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"Enjoyable, not a bad way to finish the saga, if it is :)"
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Me and my entire family love the show.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Very excellent movie. Great closure to the Star Wars saga.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"It was total redemption from the first two. The film filled in story plot holes, catered to the fans, and delivered a fantastic StarWars movie as it should be."
"Jan 5, 2020",negative,"Whiplash, the movie."
"Jan 5, 2020",negative,"This movie's tag line might as well have been ""we don't care who wins we just want TLJ and Rian Johnson to lose"""
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"Pretty good, kinda disappointing."
"Jan 5, 2020",negative,"arguably the worst movie of all time, and unanimously the worst star wars film ever created."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"It's no secret that although being the longest running Star Wars film at over 2 and a half hours, J. J. Abrams had to make do with as much storytelling being crammed into one movie as possible. Although many fans of the new trilogy find the film to have lost its track of direction, many fans of the original Star Wars have found as a standout favorite in the new trilogy. This film manages to touch home for the true Star Wars fans at heart, who yearned for nostalgia. While not the best film, it is definitely not the worst. (They ought to even it out with a #10 and then call it good.. why do we need a trilogy, we can just end it all a positive note).."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,The movie was overall pretty good. I liked that they rent conned half of the bad stuff out of force awakens and last Jedi. It was a good attempt to wrap the Star Wars saga together nicely
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"Great movie!! Kept you on the edge of your seat in typical Star Wars fashion. Loved the character arcs, still lots of questions left unanswered which is not a bad thing at all! Let’s the audience decide for themselves what happens next for these beloved characters!"
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"Really good, idc what anyone else says about it."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,The special effects were very well done.  I did enjoy the story line.  It kept you in suspense and showed not all is as it seems which we all should do in real life.  It also showed that you keep going no matter what happens which many people.forget.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"WOW! Just wow, amazing movie!"
"Jan 5, 2020",negative,This movies sucked balls
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"Little rushed, probably would have been better as a two-part like infinity war I think JJ did a great job and the cinematography was absolutely gorgeous."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Keep you interested.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"Ok JJ, I respect that. Good movie. Felt like what the second should have been and the third. It probably crammed all that info into one movie. In all I left the theater feeling better than the second one."
"Jan 5, 2020",negative,"After SW8 it only gotten worse.

Badly tries to connect previous  story plots, but lacks overal story line.

Tried to compensate by remaking all that gone before, but this time bigger and worse: where a death stat or large planet facility was needed to destroy a world before now they are going to destroy multiple worlds with only small space vessel mounted guns. Where space battles were fought by a handful of ships, thousands and thousands are now needed to blacken the skies and create a laser show Where you could attack a person with force lightning now Palpatine can shoot thousands of ships selectively out of the sky with one forse lightning...."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Story was a bit cliche and felt too familiar.  Nothing special in this one.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,This was the best of the latest saga. It was heartwarming and funny and hit all the right notes. I loved the hug at the end. Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley were superb. Oscar Isaac and John Boyega we’re equal parts serious and funny. I would watch it again.
"Jan 5, 2020",negative,"My wife is angry that we even watched this movie. Boring, predictable, so much lore-destroying plot choices. Should have waited for it to be available on Disney+. They tried to course-correct from TLJ, and they made it even worse. This new trilogy ended up being just bad fanfic with an absurd budget."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,wrapped it up nicely
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"I loved seeing Carrie Fisher again. Sadly it was like losing her all over again. I did wish a couple of sequences were a bit more fleshed out, but overall, it was tremendous. It grabbed a lot more feeling of the original trilogy for me. Things came about full circle and wrapped up most of the loose ends. I was pleased with the whole experience."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Totally better than I expected! Must see on the big screen
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,liked the progression of finally freeing the universe of the evil.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Nothing to dislike about this movie... go see it you won’t be disappointed
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,was excellent. enjoyed it  very much
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"Lots of people complaining about how this movie is tons of fan service and is just trying to undo what Rian did. So, what's wrong with that? I thought this was great. I thought they wrapped it up nicely. I felt like some things were predictable, and others were a surprise. Definitely worth a watch."
"Jan 5, 2020",negative,I don't know why I liked it the least of all the star wars.  Maybe because it was just non-stop war without a chance to catch your breath.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Everything I could have wanted from the last Star Wars! Very good tie ins and representation. Story line was good and representative of previous stories.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Best of the 3 out of the new trilogy. Incorporates parts from the prequels and the original trilogy and is definitely a step up from The last Jedi.  Will satisfy any Star Wars fan that's for sure.
"Jan 5, 2020",neutral,Not happy with the movie at all. it was well kindof predicted especially the ending. couldn't they think of a more punchy unexpected ending? sth such as ray and kylo join forces together? indeed the very boring ending...
"Jan 5, 2020",negative,I just didnt feel the force with this episode.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"Fantastic! The story, the acting, the picture!!! 4dx was fun too!"
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,It was a great movie and I would Recommend her to anybody over the age of 13 to watch.
"Jan 5, 2020",negative,It closed the saga but it is as bad as the last episode of lost!
"Jan 5, 2020",neutral,Disney has ruined the entire series for me.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Ties in all of the newest trilogy!
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"The Ewoks.
Enough said."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"Not great, but not terrible neither; there were plot holes that you can drive an articulated truck into. But all in all, if you just switch off your brain you'll find that it ties up some loose ends rather nicely.  Oh, I know I'll probably get lynched for this; but I for one am so glad there was less Rose Tico! Definitely a more satisfying movie than Last Jedi."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"I saw the 7:15pm. The movie was so good, my fiancé and I immediately bought tickets to the 10:30pm and saw it again."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"Many scenes felt rushed, didn’t like how Leia felt unnatural in the way she spoke"
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"Fun plot, happy ending.   Too much preoccupation with political correctness."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Loved all the twists and just enjoyed it
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,The movie fixed many of the issues with episode 8 but at the same time makes me sad that even with the long play time so much of the story had to be rushed to fix problems caused by the previous film.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,it was a good movie just not sure if it was good enough to be the last one
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"Amazing movie! My entire family loved it! The best ""new"" Star Wars ever made (notice I said ""new"" because nothing beats the original three Star Wars movies). I highly recommend seeing this in the theater for the special effects!"
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"I loved that it was so like mind blowing .. I was bamboozled the whole time like dammmmmmmnnnnn! So good, I just didnt like that you know who died because I wouldve loved to see a happy ending with him and Rey."
"Jan 5, 2020",neutral,too many plot holes for a single movie...
"Jan 5, 2020",negative,"I wanted Kylo Ren to be the sky walker not Rey, the story doesn’t even make any sense."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,We were definitely surprised by the ending. It was a great ending to the Star Wars legacy.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"I loved it!  Fast paced, and what you want to see in the name Skywalker!"
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,awesome action and great to see all the old gang back!
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,THE best Star Wars movie ever....nuff said.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,I don’t like that he died.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Probably should have been two movies.  An exceptional ending.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,sound  seats could be better.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"The Rise of Skywalker is a solid Star Wars movie with plenty of action, great character moments, and some truly great moments for the franchise.  While this film was probably my least favorite of the three Sequel films, it is still extremely solid in my opinion.

That being said, it has some major flaws.  I think not releasing the 3 hour version to the public meant that a lot of important details were lost, and thus made for some extremely confusing points during the film, which basically means the viewer is unexpectedly dragged along for the ride instead of knowing exactly what's going on.  I'd consider myself a Star Wars fanatic, and even after watching it and reading dozens of articles...I'm still confused about everything that happened.  I also think the ending is a bit overdone ~ we could have had said epic battle at the end the same way with fewer ships.

I'd highly recommend watching this film, and even recommend watching it twice."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Great special effects and some surprises. I gave 4 stars only because the ending satisfies but not much more.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"Absolutely amazing! Great plot, great acting and great storyline. The first really good Star Wars in decades! Some twists and turns, but worth every minute! LOVED it!"
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,From start to finish it was great!
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,a great end and new beginning
"Jan 5, 2020",negative,"thank God they're trilogy is over, finally..."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Finn never got to tell Rey he loved her.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"Movie was outstanding, I've never been a Star Wars fan. It was emotional, and exciting, and left me feeling like somehow the world outside the theater should have been changed when I left."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Maybe the best one yet
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,End’s the Skywalker Saga in a nice way
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"Visually stunning. Full credit due for the editing and cinematography. Lots of fan pleasing in the movie (which at times - was complete overkill), but I guess that's completely expected when you're watching the finale of a movie that has entertained for generations. Can't help but point out the holes and questions it leaves in the the aftermath - that's a big concern for me. I feel like I've been to an expensive restaurant for a dinner date, the food was great, and I'm content, but just expected something with a more powerful kick. But, I'm content...."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"Good production quality, a bit over edited... loose script.  Great actors."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,The movie is quite kinematic and its plot wraps up the whole saga splendidly
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"I liked it.  I'm sure there are flaws, but the movie had the closest Star Wars magic to what I remember as a child."
"Jan 5, 2020",negative,"40 years of fandom ends with a whimper.  the final installment made so little sense, had so many useless twists and side quests that it honestly made me sad.  I remember going to the drive in as a child to see Start Wars... I remember being captivated by the story, the characters, and the wonderment it created.   This last installment had none of that."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Answered a lot of questions
"Jan 5, 2020",negative,"No interest in watching....  Lucas Disney and star wars can bugger off.

I loved New Hope, Empire and Return of the Jedi....   I shall enjoy those over the years and even watch Rogue for fun as a good lead in to New Hope.  

Seriously how can you mess up a story this badly???"
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"Without spoilers, overall I really enjoyed all of it. there is only 2 things I thought should've been different. however, still amazing!"
"Jan 5, 2020",negative,"The plot was scattered and it seemed like they tried to fit in a bunch of disconnected themes . Honestly, it made no sense and I would recommend you not waste your money.  Instead, wait for it to show up on TV.  Believe me, you won't have missed a thing waiting and will feel loads better that you didn't waist your money in the theater."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,plot holes but still good
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,One of the best movies I have ever watched. I thought it tied up the series really well.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Best Star Wars Movie
"Jan 5, 2020",negative,The writers ran out of new material. There were no memorable moments like in previous episodes.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Amazing!!! JJ came through and saved it!
"Jan 5, 2020",negative,Very confusing story. Also just threw everything fans would remember from the old movies just to try to play off the nostalgia
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,A good movie but made me dislike the the last one even more. I feel as if the past one could have been skipped. There was little to no setup from the previous one. Also why was Palpatine alive? No story on that either. Not bad but not great.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,I loved it. Beginning to end.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,It's a fun movie that fixes all the mistakes of the Last Jedi.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Good end to a long saga
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"Battles were way too long.  Rose/Finn relationship was completely sidelined. There seemed no real reason why Ben made the sacrifice he did.
Basically, the script needed a doctor."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"I liked it but I was expecting more. Palpatine was great though, he made the movie for me!"
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"A very random movie, didn’t like the spontaneous adding of non important characters, great cinematic moments tho, loved Lando"
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"A good use of the money the ticket cost, but—much like the other films in the third trilogy—it lacks the intangibles to contend with the other two in terms of engagement and storytelling.

Kylo Ren still never receives proper villain treatment and Rey is once again a foolproof hero consisting of one infallible dimension. The story is missing convincing explanations of key plot elements and is haughty in its expectation of the audience to let so much of it slide. 

Despite this, it's still a very watchable film on a visual level with amazing special effects and battle sequences. The story is very straightforward and easy to follow with good dialogue and wonderful performances from the cast. It would be the best picture of the final trilogy if it weren't plagued by the same issues of hero worship that ruined Force Awakens and Last  Jedi. 

The main problem of these movies revolves around Rey's absolute godlike levels of perfection and the films' refusal to give any power or depth to its villains, making all three a total study in eye-rolling predictability that Rise of Skywalker caps off in all too similar fashion."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,There has to a Rey Skywalker story
"Jan 5, 2020",negative,"I would have preferred something with more developed dialog, less plot threads, tighter character focus and less pandering. This is a fine film for the kiddos though"
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Super fast and really confusing.
"Jan 5, 2020",neutral,Trying too hard but would recommend it for the special FX
"Jan 5, 2020",negative,The movie was great. But an audience member kept flashing lights during important parts of the movie and all but ruined the moment at least 7 times!
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"had all the fire power and emotion the final story of the Skywalker  clan should have, including the proper respect a Princess deserves."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Not a good story line of finishing the Decades of Saga! Felt like hurry up and close it by a Christmas opening...!
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,I loved the movie and the dbox seats were both worth the money spent.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"Pure fun! My mom says that her and I stood in line for two hours in the summer of ‘77 to see Star Wars when I was 9. . I’ve been with this series for 42 years and the finale gave me everything I wanted or at least needed.  If you’re a fan, you will enjoy it."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"Liked it up until the end when all the story lines were tied up a little too neatly. Good action, enjoyed seeing familiar creatures from previous movies."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"I enjoyed it much more than I thought it was a good movie. Enjoyable but had its fair share of flaws. The villain wasn't a particularly interesting character. The only characters who get any relevant screen time are Rey and Kylo, who get a great amount of character development and complete their character arcs. The third act wasn't especially strong and it's altogether a very forgettable movie. The world building it had was interesting but it was too focused on the plot to get very far with that. The pacing was fairly slow and unproductive, although the screen time still serves some purpose. It's altogether a pretty big mess, although it can still be enjoyed. 6/10 seems accurate, not worth watching if you aren't attached to Star Wars in any way."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"Although there's an incredible lack of explanations this final chapter is full of cameos and lots of action that any fan should enjoy, could have been two movies to really clarify the story,  but we'll have to do with this one"
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"Fun movie, there are some plot holes but all together it's a good fun Blockbuster."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,I saw Star Wars The Rise of Skywalker twice in 2D before seeing it in 3D and I think it was much better in 3D.  I thought many of the scenes looked amazing in 3D and was very pleasantly surprised at how good it was in 3D.  I highly recommend if you like Star Wars to go back and see it in 3D while you still can.
"Jan 5, 2020",neutral,"satisfying enough story ending. too many little cliffhangers that were obviosuly left in case the story continues on. but it felt forced. 
generally it didnt reach any emotional hieights. good story, but mediocre storytelling."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"The movie started out with a measured pace that felt in step with the early Star Wars movies, which was great. However, most of the movie felt like they tried to cram as much fan service into the film as they possibly could. By the end, the movie had so many cloying or melodramatic plot turns and overblown effects scenes that it felt more like a Michael Bay Transformers film than Star Wars. However, after a few hours, I was left with the memories of the interactions between Kylo and Rey, which were by far the best parts of the film. They almost make up for the rest of the two hours of being force-fed Star Wars-flavored cotton candy. Almost."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Fantastic movie. Lots of action. A blast to watch.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,I saw with low spectations as view from internet but I was surprised to find that I really enjoy watching it.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,obvious  ending but still a good movie.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Easy story line to follow ... for once.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,It was fun and entertaining! Regardless if you wanted to see certain outcomes and didn’t get them... OR maybe this movie wrapped up the franchise nicely - it was a fun ride and enjoyed it. Sad to see the saga end.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,The best of the rest in the last few years! Looking for more please!
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"Hokum, but better than the previous installment and Solo. "
"Jan 5, 2020",negative,Grew up loving Star Wars and now I utterly hate it.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,a non stop thrill ride that concludes the Rey Skywalker trilogy  awesome
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,It was a good date night
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"I marathoned the saga to make sure I was going into this movie with clear eyes. After hearing so many bad reviews regarding this sequel trilogy I was bummed to say the least and waited to watch it. It was awesome, like I can’t say anything bad about it. They tied a lot of loose ends and left some open ended questions (spoiler alert: it’s not supposed to stop here!) I’m happy with the resolution. Do I still have a lot of questions? Yeah but that’s because I obsess over these things. Go watch this movie as just that. A movie goer. Def recommend."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Interesting plot twists but editting was jumpy. Poor character development detracted from storyline.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Way better than the GARBAGE LAST MOVIE
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Action thru the whole movie.A great movie!
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Not as powerful of a final chapter as anticipated. Lots of stunning visuals. A few solid plot points.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,It was just plain fun! Ive enjoyed Star Wars since I was in college in the 1970s. Pay no attention to the so called critics and geeks. Just let yourself enjoy the magic
"Jan 5, 2020",negative,"better than ep 8, but still horrible"
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Great ending to the saga ! Exciting along the way !!!
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"As always, it hits the top due to CGI and amazing affects."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"Just GREAT, all in all! Great story, visual effects, and wrap up to a nine story run."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"I saw Star Wars in 1977 as a teenager. 42 years later, this was a very satisfying end to the saga.  Lots of Easter Eggs for faithful fans."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"We all loved the movie, people a being way to critical. We plan to go see it again. "
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Loved that it covered everything! Good movie will see it again.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Not much conversation or interaction amoung the characters. Hard to remember why they are suppose to be good friends. Rey spends much of the movie looking angst and telling people to leave her alone. Good action sequences though.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"I loved the action, imagination, and plot twist. Star Wars never disappoints!"
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,This would be like my very first episode
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,best one of the sequels
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"A few great nostalgic and fan service moments.  Completes the saga with respect and hints army new possibilities. Redemption, adventure, lore seeks must scifi fan must yes?"
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,This movie was amazing I felt like I was in a different world watching!
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Connects the old and new movies together. If you are a die hard Star Wars fan it's a must see movie
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"A fitting end to the saga. Whether youre a newcomer or a longtime fan, youll find something here: characters, special effects, moral choices, family drama, the eternal struggle between the light and the dark. Its all here. Abrams & Co had an impossible task—they succeeded beyond expectations."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Great movie and awesome plot
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"Great Movie, but could have been a little bit better."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Predictable and cliche.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Fantastic! Great conclusion to the Skywalker saga.
"Jan 5, 2020",negative,Horrible movie. I am so upset at what Disney did to Star Wars. This movies does not deserve the title Rise of Skywalker. What a joke...
"Jan 5, 2020",neutral,"Predictable, unoriginal story line but cinematography was exceptional"
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"I thought that what JJ did with the scrap heap that Rian left him was pretty remarkable. Started a little shaky, but once the viewer gets their bearings they are able to buy into the narrative rather quickly. Great film and great way to not only cap the trilogy, but the entire skywalker saga"
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"Movie was great, film quality was the worst EVER. DO NOT see the 3D version. Version was SO blurry with or without glasses. Luckily the film itself was great fun."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Special effects.  Storyline.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Way too much over-powered force stuff to move the plot forward. Timelines super rushed
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Great movie! Great seats! The extra  for dream pounder well worth it!
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"Good conclusion, ties it all up. A little cheesy at times but more moving."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,I thought it was good
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,A fitting close to the sequel trilogy.  Go see it.
"Jan 5, 2020",negative,"Really disappointing. I know they are not the best, but this was lazy. Felt like i had seen it over and over again. I liked the previous ones, but this one was uninspired and tired."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,The best of the final trilogy!!!
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Another great Star Wars movie. Lots of twists and turns in this one made it especially fun!
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"It was a good movie to see in 3D IMAX. Although I'm not a Star Wars fanatic, the movie lived up to its namesake. It was very entertaining and not too drawn out. Definitely worth seeing."
"Jan 5, 2020",neutral,I disliked how quick the scenes were
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Have to judge yourself.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Best of the recent trilogy by far
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Not as bad as the reviews. Worth watching.
"Jan 5, 2020",negative,"Just for fun. Terrible script, tough"
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Brought the entire series to an end. Answered lots of questions.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Kept me guessing and was not disappointed in the least!! Would pay to see again and again!
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Amazing conclusion to a phenomenal era
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"Thank you JJ for not ruining the finale!  Loved it.  Rian Johnson made a mess of what what could have be great final trilogy.  Two out of three ain't bad thanks to JJ. Now let's see how Disney goes about making some good backstory films about Obi-Wan, Rey, Chewbacca, Lando, etc.  Rogue One and the Mandalorian are excellent.  Solo should have been great but fell short.  Here's to hoping we get more great films that connect back to the original Star Wars."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Amazing movie answered several questions
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"I really enjoyed the film, though there was so much packed into it it could have been longer! Glad I saw it in theaters!"
"Jan 5, 2020",negative,Barf. I was expecting more from JJ considering this was the last chance at saving this sequel trilogy.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"Equal to the original trilogy. Spectacular story full of mythology for our time.  Where the light wins and the dark is dispersed. Yes, when we come together, we can overcome all!"
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"I'm not an avid Star Wars fan, but went with someone that is. I thought the movie was decent, a little long and drug out...but overall not bad."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"Soooo good , dont listen to anyone ... just go, never stops moving ."
"Jan 5, 2020",negative,This is what happens when a movie is made by a committee.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Amazing!! An amazing ending to one of the most incredible story ever told and such a journey for every generation.
"Jan 5, 2020",neutral,"This feels like a kids movie, no drama. I've been spoiled with Game of Thrones."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Watched all the movies in preparation to watch this one and all I can say is that it ties up everything nicely. Great movie and the special effects were fantastic.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,A fitting finale to an EPIC trilogy.  Intense at times may be too much for little Jedi.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"I read some bad reviews, but had to see it myself. It was great. I'm not sure why it got such bad reviews. Maybe they're all Star Wars' purists."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Loved the wrap up of the Star Wars 40+ year saga.  I think the movie is really geared toward true fans and those who are fans will be happy with the character development and how the story plays out.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"A good olde time was had, it is was awesome!!"
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,One of the best in the series. Always wondering what was going to happen next.  Not really any slow parts.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"Loved it, sad to see the end😢"
"Jan 5, 2020",negative,"I'm glad that chapter is over,  the hype was for not.   I hope they go another route with Star Wars or leave it as is."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Perfect ending to a phenomenal SAGA
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"I thought it was Great Escapism, and very Entertaining.  People should not take it So Serious. It's Not  REAL .. ,And you know  the kind of people  I'm  talking about.. JJ ABRAMS and crew did a Great JOB ...!!!"
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,watch it if you want to feel the story completed.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"same old thing . also, they die but keep coming back. wth?"
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Excellent movie with amazing special effects. I highly recommend it.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Best Star Wars Movie EVER!
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"Absolutely entertaining, it is a must watch for STAR WARS fans, too difficult to experience if you have not seen all the movies. Of course this Epic story will carry unreasonable expectations for the finally. There are some many opinions about how it should end. I liked the film thoroughly and believe it is a solid 8.5 out of 10. Yes, there are a few aspects that do not live up to the originals or Rogue One, but this moving is anything but boring. Great character arcs, classic blend of comedy, spirituality, hope and suffering. Incredible end yo a beautiful creation that explains life in a futuristic/altered galaxy, thank you Lucas, Jj and all those that contributed.  Appreciated your work!"
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Sooooooooo good!!! 💪 I loved how they tied up a lot of loose ends from the original 3 Star Wars movies!
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,great movie only disappointed abought not much 3D action.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Man great story and ending wow
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,This movie had lots of great plot-twists in it and lots of sad moments in it. At the end of the movie it recapped the first episode of Star Wars.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Great movie! An awesome ending to the saga!
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"The movie was good but it just seemed as if everything was squeezed together and the scenes went by at a rapid pace almost as if they tried to put a 4hour movie in the 2 and 22 mins the bad parts were bad such as the horse that didn't really need to be there,and well the good parts were good i liked the movie but it seemed rush I'll give it 4 stars because it was awesome and food satisfy my fandom for star wars next time don't fudge up the previous movie so jj can work his magic."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"it was a good movie. However, for a Star Wars fan since the beginning of the saga. it was a missed opportunity!"
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,enjoyed it very much
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"Incredible recovery from ""The Last Jedi,"" which was awful and really made no sense. I mean did the director of ""Last Jedi"" even watch the other Star Wars episodes? Also, does he really not even know about zero gravity in the vacuum of space, since you can really drop bombs in space? The 9th episode bitch slapped the 8th episode."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"Good movie, not great but still enjoyable. The Last Jedi suck, so this was a major improvement."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"Solid end to the saga. Its impossible to give everyone everything they want, but its a good effort at wrapping up the story."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"It was going so well for about half the film and then fell off the path. However, I did still enjoy the film. Best of the new movies."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Even better the second time
"Jan 5, 2020",negative,I watched it opening day and I have already forgotten everything about it.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Fitting end to the saga
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Awesome family movie
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,A fitting end to the trilogy. Never surprised or overly amazed but consistently entertained and invested sufficiently in the characters.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,If failed the wow test...
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,great overall fight scenes and the story wrap up was good
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"Mostly good, but I feel they devoted too much of the movie to undoing some of the things the previous film established. They did their job with the film, but it could have been more."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"It's a lot better than the Last Jedi. However that's not saying much..So much of this movie trilogy has broken previous canon. The force powers are too insane/convenient, to the point the protagonist never really has any challenge to overcome. Kylo Ren is the only real character that has any development."
"Jan 5, 2020",negative,"A corny, campy disappointment. Only value this movie holds is as a parody to a beloved franchise."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,They did a great job. Good finale!
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,This was a great ending to a very long series! I loved seeing all the original characters. It was jam packed and kept us glued to the screen.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Very fun and enjoyable movie! The second act feels a little unneeded but the epic 3rd act makes up for it and it is everything I could hope for!
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,great story great ending
"Jan 5, 2020",negative,Do I even need to say it?
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,You will not regret going to watch this! I absolutely loved this movie.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Lots of action... Wraps up a lot of loose ends.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"The movie is great, it is a modern Star Wars movie at its finest. While there are come moments that could have been changed to have a more meaningful or impactful plot, the movie does well to tell an end to the franchise and the New Trilogy. JJ did a decent job fusing elements of what makes a Star Wars movie and merge with elements of the Expanded Universe prominently Dark Empire."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Excellent!!! Enjoyed every second of the movie!
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Lasers! Spaceships! Distant galaxies. THE FORCE! Redemption! Closure. What’s not to like!?
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,good movie and good atmosphere
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"It was a fair ending with lots of fan service. Good guys won, bad guys are no more and everyone goes home ha.. content."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"Loved so much of it being a huge Star Wars fan! Definitely not Empire Strikes Back, but still a good ending to the best saga ever!"
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Definite will be watching again
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,I really liked it!!!
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Awesome end to the series
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Its a satisfying end to the new trilogy. Not a perfect movie but an enjoyable one that Id definitely recommend.
"Jan 5, 2020",negative,"With Rise of Skywalker there's no need to watch ANY of the previous Star Wars, because none of it matters! All previous plots from the previous movies are meaningless...all of it...meaningless...Anakin, Darth Vader, Luke, the prophecy, - all of the original ideas, plot, and story - gone. When I say gone...I mean none of what we have watched for 6 movies means ANYTHING for this movie or the other two of the trilogy. Disney and J.J. decided to make three stand a lone movies that rewrites ALL of the Star Wars Series and Canon. One more thing - If I told you Disney would created 3 more Star Wars Movies...to continue the story of the previous cast and NONE of the MAJOR characters would share ANY screen time together throughout the three movies and all what we learned from the first six movies meant NOTHING - you would of said I must be joking...well that's what we got, this and the two before this - Nothing but a BIG JOKE of a Trilogy that destroyed 40 years of previous work!"
"Jan 5, 2020",negative,"The movies plot had more holes than a warehouse of Swiss cheese.  How did Palpatine survive getting tossed by Vader or the destruction of the death star in ROTJ?  How did Ben speak to is father if Han wasn't a Jedi? What did Finn have to tell Ray? They never got back to it.  Why have we never heard of Palpatine having a son till now?  Sounds like someone ran out of Ideas and said ""to hell with it lets go with that"". There are a bunch more but it isn't worth the time.  Save your money and wait for it on Disney +."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"Bitter sweet. Good story, good finish, but there were several things I would've liked to see. Amazed to see Keri Fisher in so much knowing she died. A lot I could say, but I don't want to spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen it yet."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,An okay finish. It was a finish but nothing groundbreaking.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,It was so awesome and love it!!!!
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Good story .. good rhythm
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,JJ Abrahams did a nice job closing some of the story lines. It was entertaining and kept true to the characters we have grown to love or hate.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"JJ leu uma fanfic e adaptou
não me leve a mal, a fanfic é boa
mas ainda assim é uma fanfic"
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,follows the star wars tradition.   great movie
"Jan 5, 2020",negative,Terrible movie. Bad acting bad plot for me.  Harrison Ford did. great and looked great
"Jan 5, 2020",negative,"Plot was a mess, how many recycled plot devices does one movie neeed?"
"Jan 5, 2020",negative,The movie was a mess. It was pieces together like a plot was an after thought. It crapped all over the original trilogy and prequels. Disney should have never made the last three movies and this one process it.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Loved it.  Everything I wanted to see from the end of the saga.  Would go see it again.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"Don’t understand why it’s been getting negative representation, it’s better than all the new sequels and prequels. Not better than the OGS"
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Despite the mixed reviews I loved it
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Really damn GOOD! Fuck the haters!
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Absolutely awesome end to an era of an iconic franchise
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"It was Star Wars for sure. Decent movie, but wasn’t floored."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,My girlfriend Rey did amazing!
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,If you are a Star Wars Fan you will enjoy it. I watched it in 3D excellent!
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"Great way to end the Saga of the Skywalker's. 
I wish it wasn't so hurried and had better spacing. I could wish that we could had 30 more minutes added to the movie to aid better flow and time to enjoy the transitions...
However, Rise of Skywalker really tied Episode 1 through 8 together very well. 
Thank you."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"Loved the Reylo kiss, hated that they robbed us of a true happy ending to Star Wars. Should have been a third movie with a part one and a part two instead."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"If there is a complaint it is that the move crams SO much in! It should have been longer, but it was great and the decisions made it in are EXACTLY how Star Wars is supposed to go. The critics of this film follow a check list style grading scheme that no film in an established series should need to appease. 

If you are someone who watch films (especially Star Wars) with the intent on being entertained and not on grading it then you will have a good time. 

Even if your grading it you will likely have a good time as long as the grading is based on Star Wars and not film school."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"Great mix of all the movies, flowed well very enjoyable . A must see for Star Wars fans"
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Ive seen this movie 4 times now and it just gets better and better. Absolutely perfect in every way!
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Enjoyed the movie very much
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"Thought it was great, satisfying. I would've liked to see where Leia's character would've gone, had she lived. "
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,much better than last jedi. i thought it ended the saga pretty well. looking forward to watching it on my couch!
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Love the story and the beautiful values it portraits
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Great end to the saga. I don’t think the fan service was as bad as what critics made it out to be. I went and saw it twice.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Great Story. Forever Star Wars
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,linked both the old and new Star Wars films in an action packed and delightful way. the title led me to believe something totally different which led to a pleasant surprise
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,It was better the Last Jedi. It’s was a good film. It felt like Star Wars movie.
"Jan 5, 2020",negative,Predictable political and outright ridiculous.
"Jan 5, 2020",negative,Why does Rotten tomatoes give an almost perfect score 91%to Last Jedi and give this one 50% when this movie was clearly better?
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,it was a good movie.  surprised by the ending.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,I liked everything about it. I hope that more movies are still to come in the future.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Good ending to the series. Not great. Glad it's over!
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"Lots of action and never dull, but it felt like 2 movies in 1."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Awesome movie. Probably best of the year. Despite what critics said. The critics don’t know what a good movie is.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,I liked the action but I disliked the massive amount of plot holes and the ending.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Awesome movie. For all the haters who mislead people...the movie rocked. The story was engaging. My 6 year old watched the entire movie practically without blinking. For all families - go and enjoy this movie.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,I loved the drama and heart wrench although the ending wasn't what I expected it was still nice
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,So much better than the last two. I enjoyed it.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,all of it! will deff go see again!
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"I can see why fans are so divided on this movie. However, I  learned after TFA to suspend my expectations and desires for the storyline. Doing this I have throughly enjoyed J.J.'s attempt to wrap up the Skywalker saga. I  have already seen it twice and will be seeing it at least one more time with my wife who has not been able to see it yet. My only major gripe is the lack of relationship development that was, for me, the hallmark of Star Wars. I can live with most of the other shortcomings."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"This movie was incredible! I hated The Last Jedi, and had mixed feelings about The Force Awakens. But The Rise of Skywalker redeems the final trilogy, harkening back to the roots of the original trilogy which episodes 7 and 8 sadly forgot. The use of the canon lore-based material, the struggle focusing on light versus dark, the return to the true essences of historic characters, and the intricacy of the story all serve to make this a movie worthy of the Star Wars legacy. A strong 5 out of 5, and a must-see!"
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"it was good. it felt like a good homage to Leia and I was happy with it. 

people gotta stop setting themselves up to be disappointed. let go of your expectations and just enjoy the story."
"Jan 5, 2020",negative,"Boring, weak story that made no sense. As bad as the last jedi."
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,It was a great Star Wars movie!
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Too much forced nostalgia and not enough development of new characters. Better than The Last Jedi but not as good as The Force Awakens.
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,What a terrific ending to an adventure that I’ve enjoyed for 40+ years. Thank you!!
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Very entertaining for a real star wars fan!
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,GREAT Movie and ending
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,"The story is simple with great special effects, a most see. "
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Satisfying end to the 3 trilogies
"Jan 5, 2020",positive,Return to form for star wars
