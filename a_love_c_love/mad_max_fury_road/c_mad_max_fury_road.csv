"Oct 6, 2023",positive," Mad Max: Fury Road wasn’t the biggest hit film of the summer of 2015 (that honor belongs to Jurassic World) but it is easily the most visceral and the most intelligent action film of that year. Decades in the making, there’s nothing else like this out there. Directed by George Miller (who made the first three Mad Max movies, most famously The Road Warrior), this installment falls somewhere between the original Mad Max and Thunderdome and stars Tom Hardy as Max, the character originally played by Mel Gibson and reimagined as a loner haunted by the memory of the daughter he failed to save. Fury Road sweeps you up in its stunning stunt work and action set pieces and the sheer momentum of its drive while sneaking in observations on power and patriarchy and control and even sneaking in an unexpected hero: Charlize Theron’s Imperator Furiosa. A warrior big rig driver with a prosthetic arm, she flees the despot Immortan Joe with the “property” he most values, his concubines (sex slaves by any other name). Furiosa vows to bring the women (who looks like runway models in desert chic rags) to “the green place,” the promised land of freedom of her youth, while every vehicle in running order takes off in hot pursuit through the badlands of the ruined world. Max, literally dragged into the chase, ends up joining the escape team out of opportunity, reluctantly at first, and then inspired by the passion and hope that drives Furiosa. The first half of the film is a seemingly non-stop chase, though Miller is so adept at conducting the rise and fall of the action that you forget it often stops to cool the engines before revving back up. The second half is a race, with Max and Furiosa taking the fight back to Citadel to offer an alternative to Joe’s warrior religion, designed to keep his soldiers not merely loyal but eager for glory in battle, and a bloodline that has slid to the decidedly deformed and subhuman end of the spectrum. The film is best experienced on the big screen, where its size and scale can be appreciated, so even home viewings should be on as big a screen as possible in a situation that minimizes distractions. You want to give yourself the opportunity to be pulled into the momentum of this film and drawn into the vividly imagined tribal world with its rituals and totems and scavenged cars mixed and matched into weaponized vehicles. Details matter here. You don’t get exposition, you get illustration and then put the puzzle pieces together to understand how this world works. That’s another reason I love this film so much. What appears to be a simple chase film lets you discover an entire culture by the time its over. Nicholas Hoult plays Nux, the boy solder who becomes an unexpected ally, Hugh Keays-Byrne is the tyrannical Immortan Joe, and Zoë Kravitz, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Riley Keough, and Abbey Lee  are the young “brides” who are forged into warriors through the course of their odyssey. It won six Academy Awards, including best editing, production design, and other “technical” awards, and four BAFTA awards, and was picked as the best film of 2015 by the Los Angeles Film Critics, Boston Film Critics, Online Film Critics Society, and dozens of other organizations and film critics.

"Aug 3, 2023",positive," Thirty-six years ago, George Miller’s Mad Max roared into theaters with its own brand of sadistic brutality and blind vengeance while utterly captivating generations of action buffs. Through two additional and increasingly bizarre sequels, Miller and his Mad Max franchise inspired a global following of die-hard fans. Rarely does a sequel capture the magic of its predecessor (The Godfather: Part II is the foremost exception that proves the rule), and a “reboot” doing so is almost entirely unheard of. Mad Max: Fury Road shows no mercy in its destruction of such a concept and countless other filmmaking conventions. Somewhat formulaic in its presentation of Mad Max staples, Miller’s Fury Road utilizes these franchise hallmarks as a means of transporting the audience right back into the post-apocalyptic world it abandoned in 1985. Newsreel footage of nuclear tests behind an introductory narration (similar to Harold Baigent’s in Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior) set the tone for a movie placed squarely in the heart of a barren, radioactive hellscape. Max Rocktansky, the iconic hero now portrayed by the capable Tom Hardy, is still on the run from bands of War Boys and the ghosts of his past, consumed by a creeping insanity and a distain for all living things. A pursuit is brought to a close when Max’s trusty Interceptor V8 breathes its last; our hero delivered into the bowels of Immortan Joe’s Citadel (an incredible return for Hugh Keays-Byrne). The narrative leaves Max to his fate in order to follow Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) behind the wheel of her monstrous “war machine” on a run to collect gasoline. Discovering Furiosa has deceived him, Immortan Joe calls upon his war parties to retrieve his stolen property at all costs, and the lucky Max accompanies the marauding hoard as a “blood bag” for the battle-weakened War Boy Nux (Nicholas Hoult). A film divided into several breathtaking acts, Mad Max: Fury Road relentlessly endeavors for “pure action.” Each segment becomes an escalating series of audacious stunts and blood-pumping orchestration on a grand scale. Miller concerns himself not with the trivialities of world building, but with the individual character motivations as they pertain to the story. Strong female characters as essential to the plot, as their male counterparts proliferate and are an appreciated addition to a genre long ignorant of women. Each character has their individual arc (along with a ridiculous full name), and each weaves seamlessly into the overall narrative. Superfluity is washed away to pay homage to the all powerful adrenaline rush. A prior understanding of the three previous Mad Max entries is not required to enjoy the fourth installment, only a love for action splendor, and a desire for more. As outstanding as the direction and script may be, Fury Road‘s monumental vision does not rely on Miller’s talents alone. Striking cinematography from John Seale stresses the bitter extremes of life in Max’s fantastic world, while sun-drenched reds and yellows dominate the daytime palate in dramatic opposition to the cool, vibrant blues that prevail after the sun goes down. Tight, inventive editing from Margaret Sixel and Jason Ballantine capture the immediacy of the endless desert chases without disorientating the audience, and perhaps the most valuable contributions to Miller’s vision are from Junkie XL’s thumping score, matched with some of the most invariably perfect stunts in recent memory. Going so far as to give pieces of the composition a physical presence in the film (a large tympani and flame-spewing electric guitar speaker mobile), the writers are acutely aware of how influential music can be on the audience. Elevating the vehicular carnage from a beautiful motocross circus to a life or death struggle between good and evil, Junkie XL’s score infuses untold alarm into every action set piece. Inconceivable work from Keir Beck (Stunt/Rigging Coordinator), Marius Botha (Stunt Department Coordinator), Guy Norris (Supervising Stunt Coordinator) and Anna Wood (Stunt Department Coordinator) give Fury Road an entrancing realness through action sequences that are above and beyond anything ever before. Miller’s refreshing sense of gender equality contrasts an apocalyptic world in stark opposition by promoting an immensely powerful cinematic and real world message. Surpassing expectations and delivering a heaping dose of electrifying visuals, Mad Max: Fury Road is what all blockbuster action movies should strive to be.

"Apr 19, 2023",positive," If you've run out of new movies to watch during an evening in lockdown, there's an easy solution. Simply look back at the last decade in movies and pluck out any gems you may have missed (you might surprise yourself). And we can help you with this undertaking -- an assembly of CNET staffers voted on the best movies of the 2010s, a time in cinema that provided big, bright and colorful spectacles, as well as smaller-scale indies that open windows into the lives of others and change us for the better.  We start at the top with a movie that did not win the Best Picture Oscar like many thought it would in 2016. But listen, George Miller's fourth in the Mad Max series careens on as one of the best action movies of all time. Tom Hardy replaces Mel Gibson as the enigmatic Max, alongside the clear standout and heart of the film: Charlize Theron as the one-armed Imperator Furiosa. In Miller's visionary post-apocalyptic Oz, they attempt to save ""the wives,"" women selected for breeding, from the tyrannical Immortan Joe. The entire movie takes place over one absolutely bonkers chase sequence. Its cinematic stats are jaw-dropping: Miller used 3,500 storyboards and took 480 hours of raw footage. He overcame a decade of roadblocks -- recasting, location changes and creative resets (he explored the possibility of a 3D live-action version) -- before achieving high-octane imaginative insanity.  There was no question what movie would win the Best Animated Feature category at the 2018 Oscars. Into the Spider-Verse stole our hearts by boldly ignoring the fact we've had three cinematic Peter Parkers and introducing five more. They stem from 
  Marvel's
 multiverse, wisely made less complicated by producers Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, who focus on the Miles Morales (Shameik Moore) graffiti artist, hip hop-appreciating version of Spidey. Morales teams up with the versions from other universes -- including a bizarre and completely hilarious cartoon pig known as Peter Porker -- to fight supervillain Kingpin. Over 140 animators combined computer animation with a hand-drawn style to mimic a comic book look. Inventive visuals, fresh storytelling and embracing the comic books' wackiness helped make the first non-white Spider-Man one of the best.  Boyhood is, logistically speaking, a bit of a miracle. In order to tell a story about growing up, Richard Linklater sporadically filmed a young Ellar Coltrane every year for 12 years, from ages 6 to 18. His character, Mason, lived between his divorced parents (Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette) in Texas. The project flirted with potential film-ending pitfalls: For one, what if a teenage Coltrane strayed from acting? But Linklater delivered his best ever film. It won BAFTAs, Golden Globes and a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for Arquette in 2014. Yet some still feel a little salty about Boyhood's award season. Boyhood lost the Best Picture Oscar to Birdman, a less warm, familiarly wholesome tale, more a technical and existential tour de force. On this occasion, the people have spoken.  Get Out is the modern horror movie. It's the perfect coming together of horror, comedy and satire on racism. The setup to the punch line -- or in horror's case, the jump scare -- takes exact timing. As one half of comedy duo Key & Peele, Jordan Peele is extremely well-equipped to achieve both. His directorial debut has a scarily loaded setup: a young black man (Daniel Kaluuya) meets his white girlfriend's (Alison Williams) middle-class liberal parents. Their comments about how fine they are with their daughter's boyfriend are comedy gold... with a delayed squirm. Peele's exciting new voice brought horror, laughs and deeply unsettling self-reflection.  On paper, Lady Bird reads like a conventional coming-of-age story. It covers the usual milestones: losing virginity, going to prom, graduation. But in between those lines is a raw, specific relationship between 17-year-old Christine McPherson (Saoirse Ronan), who insists everyone calls her Lady Bird, and her hard working and barely appreciated mother Marion (Laurie Metcalf). First-time solo director Greta Gerwig writes a love letter to her hometown, Sacramento, infusing it with brilliantly layered comedy. ""I wish I could live through something,"" Lady Bird says with the narcissism of a 17-year-old. She's self-titled, as in, she says Lady Bird is the name ""given to me by me."" The warmth, hilarity and at times confronting revelations of teenagehood flood through Gerwig's singular lens.  Olivia Coleman, Rachel Weisz and Emma Stone bring the kind of acting calibre you expect to this Yorgos Lanthimos misadventure. The Greek director well and truly established his distinctive weird, experimental style with The Lobster and The Killing of a Sacred Deer. He loves to cross a line and does so multiple times in The Favourite, a period piece turned cat-and-mouse psychological thriller featuring characters named Wanking Man and Nude Pomegranate Tory. Underneath the politics and the corsets, you'll even find a melancholy love story.  Watching Alfonso Cuaron's Roma is almost like flipping through a beautifully-shot album of 1970s Mexico. Cuaron tells a semi-autobiographical story about a middle class family through the lens of a young housekeeper. It's a story about people living, brought to life by Cuaron's deft magic.  Marvel movies proved they could keep on evolving with Ryan Coogler's Black Panther. The 2018 film bucked the superhero formula with its Afro-futurist setting, family saga and James Bond gadgetry. The bold claws of an auteur are all over this comic book blockbuster.  The walls meticulously close in on the programmer, his boss and the iRobot they interact with in Alex Garland's Ex Machina. The tense, thoughtful sci-fi set in a remote cutting-edge cabin raises big questions and upgraded Alicia Vikander to even greater star status.  The Master was not the deep-dive into Scientology's origins many might have expected. Paul Thomas Anderson sews together the fictional life of Lancaster Dodd (Philip Seymour Hoffman), leader of a religious movement known as ""The Cause,"" and his tension with the yin to his yang, Freddie Quell (Joaquin Phoenix). The 2012 character drama, dealing with a world recovering from World War II, is a poetic epic.  Spike Jonze's 2013 romance between a lonely man and his Siri-like AI is even more frighteningly relevant today. Samantha (Scarlet Johansson) is the soothing, intimate voice in Theodore Twombly's (Joaquin Phoenix) ear, but the bounds of her programming soon go beyond sprucely organizing his life. Jonze's future is both vividly-realized and always rooted in the complexities of the human heart.  Barry Jenkins' three-part story about a physically and emotionally abused black man has been described as genre-defying. From childhood to adulthood, three actors (Trevante Rhodes, Ashton Sanders and Alex Hibbert) play Chiron with soulful naturalness. In covering difficult subject matter, from the drug underworld to sexual identity, Moonlight runs deep. The 2016 Best Picture Oscar winner is gorgeous to look at and accompanied by an exquisite soundtrack.  David Fincher and Aaron Sorkin friended each other to make a powerfully nerdy, talky movie about 
  Mark Zuckerberg
 and the inception of 
  Facebook
. Equally absorbing are its themes of friendship and loyalty in a playground of petty politics. A superb Jesse Eisenberg as the insensitive, conflicted genius was a revelatory match for Fincher's technical talent.  Ryan Gosling's strong, silent Hollywood stunt driver moonlights as a getaway driver. So Drive is basically the coolest movie ever. Its dreamlike, electronic soundtrack -- perfect for travel at night -- layers meaningful messages into a violent fairy tale about an unconventional hero.  Guillermo del Toro's 2017 Best Picture Oscar winner is a more than unconventional horror-romance between a mute woman and a dead-eyed fish-man. It balances a harsh 1960s setting with fairy tale magic painted into its big, beautifully-detailed sets. Only del Toro could pull this madness off.  The sheer size of this blockbuster, with its sky-high budget, A-listers and ravenous fandom, make Anthony and Joe Russo's film all the more impressive. To culminate 20 Marvel films in a two-part showstopper is experimental madness on its own. But to end (spoiler) the first of those parts with almost all your heroes losing... who says all superhero films are predictable?  This is Christopher Nolan's insane, original concept: a professional thief, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, steals information by infiltrating the subconscious. Sorry, Mr. Nolan, how are you going to do this? The answer is incredibly engrossingly. Somehow Nolan made a film about dreams both substantial and visceral, with a thrilling dose of physics-defying action.  Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) uses one mind-boggling continuous shot to literally follow a deluded movie star in the lead up to his latest role on a Broadway show. As you can imagine, sanity, narcissism and basically everything to do with the human condition bleeds through this showbiz satire. The 2014 Best Picture Oscar winner was a creative tour de force for Alejandro González Iñárritu and some comeback for Michael Keaton.  Spotlight shines a light on the real-life investigative team of journalists called ""Spotlight"" from the Boston Globe. In the early 2000s, they helped expose the child abuse committed by Catholic priests in the Boston area. The 2015 Best Picture Oscar winner wound gripping tension into the unglamorous legwork of journalists, played by a perfectly-balanced ensemble including Mark Ruffalo, Michael Keaton and Rachel McAdams.  The third in Pixar's Toy Story series seemingly wrapped up the stories of Woody, Buzz and their owner, Andy, in the most poignant, heartbreaking way possible -- until a fourth film followed 10 years later. Still, Toy Story 3 stands as the example of how to blend family wholesomeness with plaything torture horror. One of the best kids movies for grownups out there.  When your grandma dies, cult-related ordeal after ordeal doesn't tend to ensue. But in Hereditary, it does! That's not to mention the slowly sickening insecurity Annie Graham (a better than ever Toni Collette) feels in her relationship with her children. Ari Aster's directorial debut constructs its shock-horror moments with the delicate hand of someone building a miniature house. He treats his characters with the same attention to detail, and when it all comes crashing, the impact is traumatic. One of the horror genre's greats.  A mockumentary about idiotic vampires who share a flat in Wellington, New Zealand, is the kind of content we came to expect from director-writer-actor Taika Waititi. After delivering the best ever vampire comedy as well as the brilliant Hunt for the Wilderpeople, he was ingeniously snapped up by Marvel to direct Thor: Ragnarok.  Steve McQueen doesn't let up in telling the incredible, brutal true story of Solomon Northup, a gifted violinist who had the rug pulled out from under him when he was sold into slavery. His 12 years of hardship is detailed here in a story that delves into the darkest recesses of Louisiana in the 1840s. More than just a prestige, period film, it's a difficult but necessary viewing experience.  What is essentially a thriller about jazz introduced the world to the rare talents of Damien Chazelle, who would go on to make La La Land and First Man. Whiplash pit Andrew (Miles Teller), an ambitious drumming student, against the abusive Fletcher (J.K. Simmons). This tense, exhaustive journey into the perils of percussion deserves a standing ovation.  Alex Garland's followup to Ex Machina takes us into a mysterious, body horror-inducing quarantined zone of mutating plants and animals. With five female leads including Natalie Portman, this intelligent story featuring a bear scene as memorable as The Revenant's is unique in more ways than one.  Based on André Aciman's novel, this deeply affecting romance between 17-year-old Elio (Timothée Chalamet) and 24-year-old Oliver (Armie Hammer) is, unsurprisingly, beautiful to look at. From the 1980s idyllic Italian countryside to the slow-burn romance, Luca Guadagnino directs a mesmerizingly dreamy summer experience.  Robert Eggers' directorial debut is an exercise in restraint. That's his most terrifying asset and it pays off when the religious family at the heart of The Witch descends into madness. In 1630s New England, a bleak, far-back world where you deserve an award for understanding the accents, supernatural horrors brew to terrifying ends. You'll never look at the outskirts of a wood in the same way.  The movie before Taika Waititi took on Thor: Ragnarok follows the oddball mismatch of troublesome Ricky Baker (Julian Dennison) and the grizzled Uncle Hec (Sam Neill). Through a series of sad, absurd and touching events, they find themselves the subjects of a national manhunt. The balance between humanity and comedy is what Taika Waititi does best.  J.J. Abrams relaunched one of the biggest franchises of all time by affectionately pairing familiar parts with fresh new faces and even cuter helpful droids. Starring Daisy Ridley and John Boyega, this welcome shot of fun space adventure took us back into the operatic war between dark versus light.  A turning point in the DC Extended Universe came when Patty Jenkins' Wonder Woman climbed out of the trenches. The World War I-set origin story introduced the world to Gal Gadot in a role she was born to play. Her shining beacon of hope fills this earnest, good old-fashioned tale of heroine versus Greek god of war. "
"Jan 23, 2023",positive," Many on-set, behind the scenes videos alternate extremely mundane footage of the business of getting coverage with actors rotely reciting how amazing and wonderful everybody involved in this production is. Not so this casually intense assemblage of work on Mad Max: Fury Road, which begins with a car flipping over. What follows is not quite as routinely life-threatening, but it’s still incredibly physical filmmaking. $150 million, it seems, will buy you the budget to stand in the desert, sling a camera around on a very flexible boom, and have some guys swing around on poles."
"Aug 23, 2022",positive," Has it really been 30 years since Mel Gibson last drove across George Miller’s dystopian desert wasteland in “Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome”? My how time flies. Between 1979 and 1985 visionary filmmaker Miller gave us three films: the intriguing but lethargic “Mad Max”, the fabulous cult classic “The Road Warrior”, and the fun but commercial “Beyond Thunderdome”. While the second film was the real standout, I have always had a natural soft spot for the entire franchise. So of course I would be enthusiastic when it was announced that a fourth installment was finally seeing the light of day. For years Miller has toyed with the idea of bringing Max back to the big screen but there were always obstacles that hindered him. Mel Gibson was set to reprise his role and at several points the project seemed good to go. Several years have passed, Tom Hardy replaces the aged Gibson, and “Fury Road” is a reality. What’s truly amazing is that this is the wildest, craziest, and most visually arresting installment yet and all from the mind of its now 70-year old creator. The first three films had a combined budget of less than $20 million. For “Fury Road” Miller was given $150 million and you will instantly see the benefits. The visuals are an essential component to this film. This is an unapologetic, full-throttle thrill ride, and a textbook lesson on how to make an action movie. Make no mistake, the action in “Fury Road”  is intense and relentless. The vehicular carnage is unlike anything most people have seen before. The story is a bit lightweight and clearly intended to serve the plot’s madness. This all may be enough to scare away some people. For me, it was the film’s unflinching, fuel-injected focus that made it the best movie experience I’ve had this year so far. The film opens with a gruff Hardy saying “My name is Max. My world is fire and blood”. His world is an energy-starved, post-apocalyptic desert wasteland where he is haunted by his past and driven only by survival. Within the first few minutes, the nomadic Max is captured by the army of a savage and wickedly grotesque tyrant named Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne). Max’s capture leads him to cross paths with Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) who attempts to smuggle Joe’s five enslaved childbearing wives to safety. This invokes the wrath of the maniacal leader who brings his entire army after them. And guess what, Max is caught right in the middle. I can’t think of a more fitting actor to take on the role of Mad Max than Tom Hardy. His dialogue is sparse and he mainly tells his story through grunts, expressions, and outright physicality. And he does it all to sheer perfection. It’s a very unorthodox role. He’s not asked to say much and he spends a good third of the movie with his face partially obscured by a metal contraption. But he masterfully sells us this tough, surly, and untrusting Max character. But the real surprise was watching Charlize Theron match his toughness punch for punch and bullet for bullet. She is so good here. But of course the true star and the main attraction is George Miller and his insanely energetic action and presentation. “Fury Road” is a visual delight – a movie filled with “wow” moments, unbelievable stunts, and mind-blowing vehicle action sequences. Miller shoots his action with a chaotic precision and cinematic fluidity. Many modern action directors should take notes. But equally impressive are the stunning amount of practical effects used. When mixed with the top-notch CGI, it makes this one amazing looking film. And going along with the stellar visuals is Junkie XL’s vibrant and invigorating score. Some of us had given up on Mad Max ever returning to the big screen. After 30 years it was a reasonable conclusion. But after seeing “Fury Road” I can boldly say it was worth the wait. George Miller has given us an installment that stands right there with (and probably an inch or two above) his phenomenal “The Road Warrior”. This is pure action cinema – a beautiful mixture of old-school style and modern movie technology. And after this taste of Miller’s vision, I can only hope he has more Mad Max movies plan for the future. My favorite film of the year so far. This is how an action film ought to work. I am not disappointed in Hardy, I just don’t think he jumps off the screen the way Mel did, and as the character is almost a secondary foil in the conflict here. that made Max less the focus than I thought  he would be. The sequences and visualizations are terrific. I know Hollywood is ageist (at least against anyone not named Marty or Clint) but this shows why visionaries are more important than fresh faces. Sometimes you have to invent a world and inhabit it to be able to get it right. My favorite too. I left on such a high. Good straightforward story that sets up some of the coolest action sequences I have seen in a while. I really liked Hardy but I do get what you’re saying about him. Also loved this and gave it the same score. To be honest I think I might head to the cinema again to watch this one….amazing experience. Great work here Keith! I am so amped to see this and your review gets me even more excited. Lots of good reviews. I hope it doesn’t disappoint! I enjoyed this movie way more than I expected to. It’s exciting and extremely rare to see a big budget summer blockbuster with such a personal vision (and executed so well) brought the big screen. Definitely my favorite of the year so far. Same here! Honestly, I expected to like it a lot but I didn’t expect to love it the way I did. This was good, crazy fun. I left the theater on such a high. Excellent review! It goes without saying that action cinema this singular in scale and scope is rare, and Miller’s conviction in bringing this fourth installment of his brainchild to life has yielded quite the exceptional result. Thanks so much. I agree with you. There is a lot of conviction behind Miller and his vision for this film. And man what a ride. I went and saw it today.  Absolutely nuts.  I loved every minute of it.  It’s probably my favorite action movie of the year.  I certainly think it’s better than Ultron in every single way.  It’s a shame they don’t make movies like this very often, and certainly not the way that George Miller does it.  But I will be seeing it again, that’s for sure.  The soundtrack is amazing too.  With Tom Hardy signed on for three more movies, I can’t wait to see where they go from here. Yes!!!! So fun. I think Miller is such a visionary and his eye for action is superb. This thing was crazy and I loved how he never dialed back the madness. Can’t wait to watch it again. Oh, I’m definitely going to see it again as well.  I also loved the fact that they didn’t use the shaky-cam technique unless it was inside the vehicles.  As far as action movies go, Mad Max: Fury Road has set the bar very high this year.  I don’t see anything else that’s going to top it in terms of sheer adrenaline. You bring up a great point that I meant to mention in the review. The lack of the annoying shaky-cam was so refreshing. I get annoyed at the technique. So many directors should take note. Unashamed relentless action and I are it up!!! There is such a wild style on display and I just couldn’t get enough. Bravo George Miller! never ending action in this movie. really u can get tired while watching but i didnt see very well our max u know. Mel Gibson is better crazy, i think he’s in life crazy. Tom Hardy is just silent cool guy. I love that! I was so proud the Academy recognized the movie the way it did. There was a time when it would have never gotten the consideration it deserved.  I have to say it’s now one of my favorite movies.  So much to love about it.  The details are meticulous and inventive.  The “kid” who decides to help them is one of my favorite characters.  Can’t remember his name."
"Jun 21, 2022",positive," A marvelous degree of craziness and discipline was required to make Mad Max: Fury Road, Australian director George Miller’s reimagining of, or perhaps a belated sequel to, his original Ozploitation trilogy. Three decades after taking down Blaster in Thunderdome, Mad Max returns for the fourth, most inventive and bombastic entry in this series of post-apocalyptic vehicle wars, a completely bonkers and titillating piece of entertainment that has no recent equal. Indeed, the Fast and Furious series looks populated by slogging pacifists in comparison. Tom Hardy now occupies Mel Gibson’s well-worn leather duds as the titular Max Rockatansky, a former cop turned reluctant road warrior on Miller’s unforgiving, barren, but beautifully conceived highways of carnage. This desolate world comes fuelled by adrenaline, soiled with gruesome ultra-violence, and propelled by unbelievably outrageous high-speed chases, unlike anything you’ve ever seen. After defining the post-apocalyptic subgenre in 1979 with the original Mad Max, and its two sequels, Miller, now in his seventies, shows no signs of slowing based on this decadent display of practical effects, impressive pyrotechnics, and exhilarating showmanship. In recent years, Miller’s name has been associated with more child-friendly material, such as Babe: Pig in the City (1998), Happy Feet (2006), Happy Feet Two (2011), and some development on Warner Bros.’ abandoned 2008 production of a “Justice League” superhero film. But in the years after Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome (1985), Miller fed rumors of another Mad Max sequel. News of countless setbacks, false starts, delays, budgetary quarrels, and casting rumors have filled Hollywood insider trades for more than a decade—going back to when Gibson was still set to reprise the role that made him a star. As time went on and Gibson got older, as early as 2009, Miller recast the role with Hardy, hired Charlize Theron as Hardy’s costar, and began scouting locations. Filming didn’t begin until 2012, and lasted upwards of 120 days in Namibia, plus reshoots the following year, with a reported budget of $150 million, a far deal greater than the paltry budgets used to make the original three. And despite Fury Road looking and feeling more expensive, more over-the-top, and more kick-ass than its predecessors, it still feels like a part of the same universe Miller created all those years ago. To be sure, Mad Max: Fury Road is a far more complex experience visually than the rather trim Mad Max, yet its narrative heft feels more grandiose and adult than the family-friendly outing Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome. Unavoidably and quite complementarily, the film earns its close association to the second and best in the series, The Road Warrior (1981), which, like this latest entry, occupies its runtime with what amounts to a single, film-long chase sequence. However conceptually simple Fury Road’s actionized chase scenario may seem on the surface, Miller and his cowriters (Nico Lathouris and comic author Brendan McCarthy) layer the material with heavy themes of redemption, revolution, and buried memories. Each of Miller’s Mad Max films have had their own unique pitch and themes: the first concerned tragedy and revenge, the stripping-down of Max’s humanity; the second displayed a glimmer of hope in our anti-hero within his otherwise thankless world; and the third found him regaining his human sympathy by rescuing a group of children. Mad Max: Fury Road finds the anti-hero more animal-like, a mad dog survivor realized by Hardy with paranoid eyes and convulsive jolts into his tragic past. “My world is reduced to a single instinct: survive,” he says in the opening narration, which recalls a more personalized version of the prologue in The Road Warrior. Max moves with a kinetic ferocity, almost on autopilot, especially early on when Hardy’s considerable physical presence is enhanced by Miller running the film speed at a higher rate, as if Max has been electrified. During the fracas, Max, who remains nameless for much of the picture, receives flashes from his past, and images of his daughter’s death haunt him at key moments. He seems to have buried these images so deep that he no longer understands their meaning, to the extent that he even looks confused by their appearance in his mind. “As the world fell it was hard to know who was more crazy. Me, or everyone else,” he observes. Only as the story progresses, and Max finds someone to fight alongside, do those images become clearer. Although, refreshingly, Miller never explains their origin through clumsy expositional dialogue or a flashback; Max’s understanding comes by way of a calmer, more gathered expression behind Hardy’s piercing blue eyes. But let’s not get ahead of ourselves. In the distant post-apocalypse of Miller’s vision, human beings are the new precious commodity. Forget fuel and ammunition; Gas Town and the Bullet Farm have that covered. Only sand-swept roads and dunes flourish in the Wasteland, leaving humans with no chance unless they suffer under the Citadel—a pair of buttes standing alone in the desert, inhabited by the cultish ruler on high, the fearsome Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne, who played the marauding Toecutter, presumably no relation, in the original Mad Max). His body serves as a metaphor for the entire landscape, scorched and harsh, patched together by body plates, pieces of old hardware, breathing tubes, and a toothy mask. What a horrific kingdom he has made, where he controls his slaves by regulating the water supply, and where his beautiful wives are branded as property and locked in a vault. Elsewhere in the Citadel, he keeps rotund mothers strapped to pumps to deliver valuable breastmilk for trade, and their human babies, his sires, provide the capital for an army of devoted subjects. Should an unlucky Wasteland survivor find himself captured by the ruler’s personal army of War Boys, he’d be tattooed with his blood type and organ status, and hanged upside-down as a human blood bag for Immortan Joe’s weak or dying devotees. One such “blood bag” is Max himself, interned in the first scene and hung to fuel Nux (Nicholas Hoult), one of Immortan Joe’s shaved, branded, white-painted, and skeleton-faced fanatical soldiers. Following his leader’s abstract religion, Nux has been promised glory and another life in Valhalla should he faithfully serve Immortan Joe (and spray his mouth silver before the moment of death). Enter the noblewoman-badass Imperator Furiosa (Theron), who’s entrusted to drive a War Rig on a fuel run, but instead detours with Immortan Joe’s escaped wives to liberate them from captivity. Miller’s flair for wild names carries on with the wives: Splendid, Capable, Cheedo the Fragile, and Toast the Knowing. These wives look like a gaggle of super-models and first appear in a wet fantasy scene. However, they’re gradually empowered throughout the chase. In response, Nux straps a metal-masked Max onto the front grille of his car and, along with a small army of souped-up vehicles, pursues glory to recoup Immortan Joe’s “property”. For the next two hours, the ensuing chase sequence, driven by Miller’s breakneck pace, offers only a few fleeting seconds of reprieve from the mayhem. And oh, what mayhem—what glorious, delightfully orchestrated mayhem. Supposedly, ninety percent of the effects and stunts were achieved without CGI, and based on the result, it looks to be true. A staggering level of pyrotechnics and car wrecks appear to have been achieved with practical effects and stuntmen, something of a rarity in today’s market of computer-generated aerobatics in Fast and Furious. Ever the tactile tactician, Miller captures every angle imaginable and at varying film speeds thanks to the feverish work of cinematographer John Seale, whose frame vibrates with the speed of his car-mounted cameras. Still, never is there a moment where the clarity of the situation or shot-by-shot logic is questioned; rather, the impossibly fast-paced momentum proceeds with a shocking and almost unheard-of degree of precision, all of it given an incredible dose of aural energy thanks to Dutch musician Junkie XL’s score. Throughout, Miller’s editor and wife, Margaret Sixelour, allows us to briefly appreciate Colin Gibson’s intricate production design and Jenny Beavan’s imaginative costumes. With every new shot, there are more details to savor that require repeated viewings to fully appreciate: the slave ship whose sole purpose is to provide the chase with drums and riffing from a heavy metal, flame-spewing guitar; the pole-riding daredevils who swing from one vehicle to another, performed by members of Cirque du Soleil; the grotesque growths, piercings, and body markings displayed by post-apocalyptical mutants; and the believable robotic forearm attached to Furiosa. In fact, Furiosa may just steal the film from under Max’s nose after their characters meet and join forces on the road. A ferocious driver and brutal fighter, Furiosa represents a rare thing in the Mad Max franchise: a strong female character. She doesn’t trust Max at first, having experienced first-hand the savagery of men in the post-apocalypse. Theron’s troubled, glassy eyes contain all the emotional charge needed in this vicious film, and they remind us of Renee Falconetti’s sorrowful expressions in The Passion of Joan of Ark (1928). Her quest to transport the child-bearing female captors to salvation is immediately empathetic, while Max’s hardened exterior seems as pitiless as the world he inhabits. Hardy, meanwhile, is perfect in his role; it’s impossible to imagine another modern actor recreating Mad Max so effectively. He’s capable of rendering both Max’s animalistic and nobler scenes with careful calibration of his face. “You know hope is a mistake,” he tells Furiosa in one of their few audible exchanges. Dialogue is a luxury in a film like this, and Miller has said he intended the film to be such a visual experience that it could play in foreign countries without subtitles. Fortunately, actors of Hardy and Theron’s caliber need only brief glances to communicate a wealth of understanding between the two characters during the film’s never-ending pursuit."

"Feb 11, 2022",positive," In fact, there hasn’t been a movie to come along like this in quite some time. The fourth post-apocalyptic Max Rockatansky film from multi-talented director George Miller, “Mad Max: Fury Road” showcases a level of craft and kinetic energy that feels transported from a simpler time in blockbuster filmmaking. Instead of installing a franchise building block, introducing 500 plot lines for future films or encumbering the pace with heavy exposition, “Fury Road” charges right at you from the start and refuses to let up. It’s a relentless adventure saddled with enough original action and gripping chase sequences to wrap around as many dystopian deserts you can find. Miller last forayed into the action genre with his third Max film, 1985’s “Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome,” so this is the first time the auteur has had the visual treasure chest of the 21st century with which to work. Having spent plenty of time with practical effects in his heyday, Miller fuses the rust and dust of personally-crafted sets and effects with the otherworldly possibilities of computer generated visuals to create some of the more striking sequences put on screen in a while. He also helped write the screenplay with Brendan McCarthy and Nico Lathouris. “Fury Road” takes a page from Screenwriting 101 and lets the movie do the talking, not the characters. Instead of a 15-minute introduction into how this apocalyptic world became to be, the film jumps right into Max’s now. A loner bothered by a dark past, Max (Tom Hardy) is captured by an army of pale soldiers and is taken to the Citadel, a refuge for survivors governed by King Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne). The impressively-designed Joe is a hulking creation, complete with beaming red-and-yellow eyes, pro-wrestler’s hair and physique and a mask that looks like a cross between Bane’s from “The Dark Knight Rises” and the intimidation art that goes on the headgear of a hockey goalie. Max’s capture eventually crosses over into a plot to save Joe’s many “wives” from bondage – an effort led by government high-up Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron). Hauling a large tanker across an unforgiving desert on the infamous Fury Road, Furiosa botches a gas trip and breaks for freedom with her passengers. But, Joes’ army – an assortment of his brainwashed followers driving terrifying mix-and-match Hot Wheels – isn’t too far behind. So, with Max placed as a hood ornament on one of the soldier’s (the eager Nux, played by Nicolas Hoult) cars , the race begins, leading into two hours of dusty-pedal-to-the-rusty-metal insanity. The chase scenes in the film are one-of-a-kind – special scenes that haven’t been done before and likely won’t be replicated in the future. Miller keeps them snapping along with great precision, mixing in thrill after thrill and close call after close call. The real-and-unreal effects and soaring stunt work help make the zooming chases, at times, feel almost iconic. Junkie XL adds in an operatic score that backs the action in a way that feels legitimately epic. One sequence in particular – a chase through a Technicolor sandstorm of tornados, lighting and blinding gusts – has to be seen on the biggest screens possible (as does the rest of this movie, for that matter). It’s a scene of premiere VFX work and perhaps the most impressive visual scene to ever hit a movie screen in years. John Seale’s gorgeous cinematography gets a bulk of the credit for the film’s visual presentation. Seale plays around with the color scheme in certain situations to great effect and brings forth a sharp presentation for the entire film. Hardy and Theron make for solid leads, with the physically-demanding role requirements met by each with ease. As the film progresses, both Max and Furiosa begin to develop a silent friendship, which must become possible through various glances in strenuous situations. Both actors do a splendid job of being able to get affection across in the midst of all the chaos. Hoult also makes a solid mark as the spiny Nux. With “Mad Max: Fury Road,” Miller is able to make a nearly-flawless popcorn film with ingredients that most studios would shy away from. This is weird, lived-in material that puts a great deal of trust in its audience to read between the lines into how the mechanics of this world work. The payments are as rich as they are rewarding. No other studio film this year will feature a guitar-playing battle musician with flames shooting out of the instrument’s head, a baby-man with a beard and a two-headed lizard that slithers across the barren dirt. “Mad Max: Fury Road” is a slobbernocking achievement that also happens to be a singular experience, best seen on the most gargantuan screen possible with friends, soda, candy and a jaw that can be dropped at will."
"Oct 9, 2021",positive," It’s been over thirty years since the last film in the Mad Max series, and man, did it come back in a big way. There is no other way to describe Mad Max: Fury Road as anything other than over-the-top high-octane fun. If you can watch it in IMAX 3D, if you can watch it in a Dolby Atmos theater, do it. Fury Road is every inch the combination of post-apocalyptic exaggeration mixed with some hilarious insights into human nature. If there was ever a film detailing the often foolish choices of man, it’s Fury Road. The story is a simple one, but while that might inhibit most films, for something as boisterously loud and active as Fury Road it only serves as the frame to the sensory overload. [Warner Bros.]Sustained on nothing more than revenge, redemption, and gasoline, Fury Road brings Tom Hardy’s Mad Max and Charlize Theron’s Imperator Furiosa together as two avenging angels in a world that has thrown morals and human dignity into the wind. For a film that includes a consistent heavy metal guitarist on a jury rigged mountain of speakers that drives around as the hilarious but totally unnecessary mood music, Fury Road manages to still deliver a punch through the storytelling that stands somewhere between environmental political commentary and straight up hard-lined feminism. But, trust me, almost all of that takes a back seat to the absolutely breathtaking visual palette of Fury Road. Splashed in tones of yellow, orange, and red, and later deep midnight blue, it’s a gorgeous piece of art. From the yellow-gold sandstorms that swallow the outback to the neon flares that explode like fireworks in the sky, it is unforgiving in painting the world with explosive color. [Warner Bros.]If the visuals don’t keep you on the edge of your seat then the roar of the engines sure will, not to mention that killer soundtrack. Visual effects dominate your eyes while the sound of roaring engines, firing bullets, and pounding drums will fill your ears. There are no pulled punches here, and it works out perfectly. You’ll be cheering and howling with Furiosa and Max in no time, there is no other alternative. Final Thoughts: The definition of a wholly unapologetically action-packed film, Mad Max: Fury Road breathes new life into an old series and throws you right back into a world that is hyperbolic and addictive all at once."
"Aug 29, 2021",positive,"It's hard to see another movie equalling this one's grand ambition, deep ideas and awe-inspiring action."

"Aug 12, 2021",positive," Yo, mutha flowers, a bunch of us went to go see Mad Max Fury Road this past weekend. Had we known how incredible it was going to be, we would have organized a caravan of all you beautiful queers across the country to come together and watch it as a pack; a sexy, renegade pack of unapologetic feminists ready to blow shit up in the name of freedom and solidarity. But even on our own, in our own hometowns, in separate movie theaters, we watched and fell in love with the delicious, delirium-inducing, debauchery that is Mad Max Fury Road. One of my favorite things about this movie was that it not only had its Hard Butch heroine in Furiosa, but that the Five Wives, who were presented as being these beautiful, feminine, helpless girls who were coddled and pampered (but also sex slaves), also got their chances to shine and have some really cool action moments. All of the women in this movie were capable, not just the one named Capable. Toast the Knowing, Cheedo the Fragile, The Splendid Angharad, Capable and The Dag (has there ever been a movie with cooler character names???) all did things that helped ensure their survival. None of them were helpless damsels in distress. And let’s not forget the Vuvalini, who give us even more diverse kickass women. There were just so many awesome women in this movie! Charlize Theron delivers a captivating, challenging performance as Furiosa, arguably her best since Monster, as she barrels across the desert in a souped-up war rig to carry five angelic, badass women to a search for hope. Those women each embody their own strength and grace, overcoming fear and internalized misogyny to create a vision for a new life. Instead of forming a chorus of interchangeable former sex slaves, they are five women with their own goals, struggles and connections to each other and other characters. I want to watch the movie again and focus only on their experiences with and reactions to the horror unfolding around them, because there is immense texture within their stories. We only spend real time with two male characters in the film: Max, whose struggle with PTSD is one of the most honest portrayals of mental illness I’ve ever seen on film, and who seems perfectly happy to play backup to Furiosa’s commandership; and Nux, whose transformation from mindless, frothing henchman to a helper who finds his beating heart through the kindness of freed slave Capable speaks deep truth about allyship and sacrificing our own privilege to pursue liberation for all. Charlize Theron carried the weight of the film’s emotional journey, and managed to do so even though pretty much the whole entire film was a high speed car chase. Tom Hardy as Max, though the title character, was pretty much eye candy. I actually fucking love Tom Hardy. He’s crazy talented and not sore on the eyes either. But I felt like his Mad Max was a little… introverted. Okay, but those sister wives are what confuse me. In a film with such a strong female lead, how could George Miller write such thoroughly forgettable supporting characters? Zoë Kravitz and Abbey Lee stood out against the rest of the damsels in distress as genuinely talented, but the others weren’t really given the opportunity. Also – not that I expect anything more from a big budget Hollywood action film – but how in the hell is Zoë Kravitz the sole black person in this future earth?! Am I to infer that when hell broke loose the people of color were the first to go? Because that’s actually how I’ve been making sense of it. Also, not that I expect anything more from a big budget Hollywood action film, but how in the hell is Zoe Kravitz the sole black person in this future earth?! Am I to infer that when hell broke loose the people of color were the first to go? Charlize Theron’s Furiosa is the HBIC in this movie. I had my palm raised to the universe the second she took control of that big rig and led the charge across the desert. She’s tough, like hella-fucken tough, and I wanted to be in the rig with her. She’s over dealing with some patriarchal, violent goon, dude-monster. He’s a rapist, a slave owner and he’s hoarding all the natural resources, like the CEO of Nestle. And Charlize’s Furiosa, is ready to snatch his post-apocalyptic reign of terror and take her enslaved homegirls with her. And she does: Furiosa fights like a UFC champ and did we mention that’s she’s an amputee? All praise our homegirls that are disabled ‘cuz they can and will fuck shit up and lead us into the promised land. Hallelu. Mad Max: Fury Road feels revolutionary. The film is essentially a two-hour chase scene, complete with infinite gunshots and explosions, a few desolate wastelands, and a fantastical rig where half-living goons beat the drums — and shred the flaming guitars — of war. Inside these trappings, Mad Max tells the stories of powerful women fighting furiously for liberation. Holy cow I loved this movie. Like, who woulda thought that a Mel Gibson movie franchise would have turned into an awesome movie about a bunch of ladies looking badass and powerful and beautiful and then acting even more badass and powerful and beautiful?! I also loved that while the movie is called Mad Max Max is, at best, an ancillary character; the movie could have easily happened without him. It was anti-rape, anti-military, anti-totalitarianism and strongly pro-women. I mean, it was pretty much just a group of women fighting against toxic masculinity, and doing it in a movie genre that’s normally reserved for celebrating toxic masculinity. This movie was so straight up anti-patriarchy, it was amazing. The whole plot was about them trying to escape or defeat the evil hyper-masculine world of the Citadel and the men who run it. It was anti-rape, anti-military, anti-totalitarianism and strongly pro-women. I mean, it was pretty much just a group of women fighting against toxic masculinity, and doing it in a movie genre that’s normally reserved for celebrating toxic masculinity. It was all about these Wives who were sex slaves to the Immortan Joe, but as Kate Leth pointed out on twitter, there wasn’t actually any sexual violence in the movie, which is pretty amazing for a post-apocalyptic action movie about sex slaves. I liked Mad Max because it shows us what will happen if men continue to be in charge: they will destroy everything and develop a weird obsession with breast milk. Though this movie’s plot is literally, “Oh, we have to go to this one place, oops no, let’s go back” and it explains SO LITTLE of what you’re expected to just accept as the reality of the situation, I still enjoyed it. At one point men are only allowed to stay with a group of badass women because they are competent, which is a pretty low bar but still not the standard men are held to today. I also like that the Baby Man Army is nursed back to health via blood because it’s furr shurr a shout out to PERIODS. Other favorite moments include finding which men could not keep a beat in any scene with drums. Overall, it is one of those movies where like no one cares that you can barely understand what the characters are saying because it’s not going to make anything make more sense. Also, for it to be a movie that is just non-stop violence, it doesn’t delight in it and isn’t terribly gruesome (which was my concern going in). I know that there’s so much misandry and feminism, but by far the best part of the movie is that fucking guitar situation and if you do not laugh every time it comes on screen, you don’t have joy in your life and I feel sorry for you. At one point men are only allowed to stay with a group of badass women because they are competent, which is a pretty low bar but still not the standard men are held to today. This movie kicked ass. I was forced to watch it in 3D because everybody I was with wanted to, but I grinned through the nausea because there is not a moment in this film where really hot people aren’t kicking so much butt. I fucking love action movies. I love high-speed car chases, tough A.F. one-liners, and explosions. Unfortunately, I don’t enjoy watching men do stuff, unless they’re helping old ladies cross the street or carrying newborns in Baby Bjorns. I’m so completely over the whole “Watch Men Blow Things Up To Save People + Here Are Some Titties” movie genre, so I’m not ever trying to pay money to see male-dominated actions movies that often get their kicks from exploiting women and praising the brutality of men. I really, really didn’t want to see Mad Max. But then Gabby told me that MRAs were protesting it and would I please go see it with her and I did a 180 and was like, “Heck yes!” So obviously I loved this movie; pretty much the only thing I didn’t like was the soundtrack. Since talking about movies isn’t really my forte, I thought I’d rewrite the soundtrack. With a little help from Ms. Rivera herself, I made an alternate soundtrack full of songs that fit Mad Max’s feminista vibe. What songs would you want to hear chicks smashing cars (and the patriarchy) to? So there you have it, gorgeous warriors of the desert. Now, if you haven’t seen it, round up all your best homies and make a trek to the nearest theater. Have a few drinks beforehand or afterwards and make a night of it. Go with your fists raised high and salute big, stupid, glorious, Hollywood blockbusters and what it looks like when stories aren’t tailored to men and their fragile egos. Go see what it looks like when we’re driving the smoking tractor-trailers into the unknown and fighting for our sisters to live free.

Gabrielle is currently working on her first novel while bouncing around NYC performing spoken word and trying to stick it to the man. I saw this on Sunday with friends, and went into the theater with pretty much no idea (other than general knowledge of the Mad Max movies) of what it was about.  It was pretty much the greatest thing ever. Epic car chases, epic feminism, and the psychotically epic Doof Warrior (the name of the guitar character. His truck is the Doof Wagon). One warning: if you are driving home after the movie, be aware that the urge to start running people off the road is pretty damn strong. yo oh my god, i got into my car with my girlfriend and my mom after the movie and all i wanted to do was race us all into the desert. navigating 95 south was thrilling and I just laughed bc I couldn’t get over how juiced I felt after this ridiculous ass amazing movie. DOIN IT! Anyone get the name of the pretty lady whom they first come upon when she’s acting as bait in the tower? She’s gotta be in there. Y’all we were in a movie theater, with line of men wrapped around the building, to see a feminist action movie in america! Never did I expect to see this day.  I have every intention of seeing this film since it’s getting such good reviews from pretty much everyone. I have yet to come across any review that hated the film. And I have always loved the Mad Max franchise in general. Yes, even Beyond Thunderdome. I will not apologize. Yeah, I was also bothered by the lack of woc, but like Lilian says, it was australia, and there were two maori actresses, so that’s good. I was basically obsessed with this entire movie. But the part that got me the most, when I was like ‘yes, this is the feminist action movie I have been waiting my whole life for,’ was when the one Vuvalini was naked bait in the tower and yet you never saw any gratuitous nudity, even in this part that had nudity that was actually useful to the story line. It was glorious. I will be purchasing this movie the day it comes out and then rewatching it forever. My mom dragged me (almost literally) to see this, and not knowing anything about it, I hated the first five minutes. As soon as Charlize Theron showed up, passed the Bechdel Test, and kicked ass, it won me over. I gushed the whole way home.  Saw this movie with a fellow feminist. We were literally surrounded by men in the movie theatre. This movie was so kickass, and loved that the leading woman was disabled. Also, a lot of ppl have said furiosa is queer. Is that cannon or more just they never mentioned it so we can read it as we want? There was defs a lack of people of colour in the movie which is super not okay. I like that mad max was basically not necessary to the movie, and how furiosa was leading this women but in a empowering I’ll help you if you want vs savioury way. I liked that there was a fair few disabled folks in the movie. I still can’t believe that this movie has actually been made.
If there was ever a list of things Hollywood executives don’t want to have in their movies, I think Mad Max has almost all of them. This movie wasn’t originally on my radar at all, but people all over the internet (okay, really just Cleolinda and Noelle Stevenson and now you guys) have been telling me how good it is! I’m so close to the end of this semester (one take-home final and one lab writeup to go), and have made my partner promise that we’ll see this as soon as all my work is in. Are there any sexual assault scenes in this movie? I’m seeing it in a couple of days and I’m trying to figure out if it’s gonna be too full on. I think this response may be too late but no, there weren’t. I think the article above mentions this but it’s fantastic that a movie wherein sex slaves play a crucial role in the narrative was produced without gratuitous scenes of sexual violence. This film felt like such a revelation, like that movie we had been asking for when asking for a female led action movie. Our prayers were answered and answered awesomely. It’s not perfect, yes. But it’s a huuuuuuuge step forward, steps I hope other people will follow in. The epitome of feminism, for me, was when one of the wives (The Dag) comments to an elderly Vuvalini (Keeper of the Seeds) about how she thought “they were above that”, referring to the violence. And then the Keeper of the Seeds goes on to say that because of the circumstances and the people that fuck everything up they needed to adapt and use violence. But she still carried the seeds and hoped for more. Sorry, I didn’t like it.
You know how there is PWP, Porn without Plot in fanfiction?
This movie was AWP Action without plot.
I went to see it because of the aforementioned feminism, which was there and great and such a relief, but there were so many logical loopholes (What do these people eat? How do they survive? How do they produce gas??) that I had a hard time tuning out and whenever I managed to tune out the absurdity, the guy with the guitar threw me.
It was amazingly beautifully shot and I was super happy about the representation of disabled folks, but not my cuppa tea. I need more story.More world building and myth.
I’m happy so many people liked it, though, because it’s got its heart in the right place and is very unHollywood. I loved that they didn’t spoon-feed us the world-building. It’s so rare to see an American movie or tv show where they don’t explain everything in words, and instead use visual or plot-based clues and references to show us that they have done plenty of world-building, and they trust us to pick up on it. (And one of the people in Max’s flashbacks was an indigenous man, but since those people were all people who Max let die, it probably doesn’t count). To me Fury Road is one of the best “show, don’t tell” mainstream films and I actually like that it doesn’t go on lengthy expositions and lets you connect the dots via visual cues or implications and thus also allows for a quiet complexity that unveils itself in further viewings. Totes saw this today just so I could read this. I didn’t want to see the movie in the first place because I didn’t even see the original one. The movie was wayyyyy cool and the girls took it to the patriarchy!!! Down with the patriarchy!!!!!! excellent movie. yea it’s not perfect but it’s on the right path. i wanted more women of color and i wanted the Wives to have more lines, but the movie did deliver on major fronts. I was so, so happy mad max and furiosa didn’t kiss. a romance would have been so absurd and infuriating, given the circumstance. you know wat’s funny, when the naked bait lady climbed down and all the vuvalini approached the rig and the bait lady pulled furiosa’s head to hers, i literally thought “HELL YEA THEYRE GONNA KISS IM SO HERE FOR THIS” lol but either way, im fine with it. some people were complaining that the Wives were nothing but objects in this film- precious cargo if you will. like i said, maybe a few more lines of dialogue wouldve shown us more personality. I wish there was Furiosa merchandise, like any Marvel character lol. I didn’t think I’d like a 2 hour car-chase-and-things-blow-up movie, but I was strangely invested. When I got home, my arms were sore cause I was clenching my fists the ENTIRE TIME without realizing it. Laura, I totally second the “WAIT THAT IS TONY FROM SKINS” sentiment. We just started watching that show, and we were confused as to why douchebag Tony was everywhere in our lives. Stop it, Tony.  Anyway, I normally don’t love the genre, but I enjoyed this movie for many of the reasons already mentioned: strong women characters holding their own, it passes the Bechdel test, it doesn’t exploit depictions of sexual violence. I still didn’t know any of the wives’ names, though, and I couldn’t watch any of the Vulvani getting hurt (NOOOO, JUST LET HER PLANT THOSE SEEDS IN PEACE Y’ALL). ”But how in the hell is Zoë Kravitz the sole black person in this future earth?! Am I to infer that when hell broke loose the people of color were the first to go?” That’s pretty much exactly how I inferred it, especially since some of the earliest scenes of the film included forced head shaving, forced tattooing, and an eerie salute. Plus neo-nazis are all about their Norse mythology, so when everyone started shouting about Valhalla, the white supremacy behind this nondescript society seemed pretty clear. I also found it historically appropriate that the only black character had been cast as a sex slave, since slavery is wrought with a history of rape for the purpose of producing more slaves. These points gave me a lot of ecofeminist feels, which were especially compounded by the mother’s milk scene. I’m transitioning back to a vegetarian diet this week, as a result."

Charlize Theron carried the weight of the film’s emotional journey, and managed to do so even though pretty much the whole entire film was a high speed car chase. Tom Hardy as Max, though the title character, was pretty much eye candy. I actually fucking love Tom Hardy. He’s crazy talented and not sore on the eyes either. But I felt like his Mad Max was a little… introverted. Okay, but those sister wives are what confuse me. In a film with such a strong female lead, how could George Miller write such thoroughly forgettable supporting characters? Zoë Kravitz and Abbey Lee stood out against the rest of the damsels in distress as genuinely talented, but the others weren’t really given the opportunity. Also – not that I expect anything more from a big budget Hollywood action film – but how in the hell is Zoë Kravitz the sole black person in this future earth?! Am I to infer that when hell broke loose the people of color were the first to go? Because that’s actually how I’ve been making sense of it. Also, not that I expect anything more from a big budget Hollywood action film, but how in the hell is Zoe Kravitz the sole black person in this future earth?! Am I to infer that when hell broke loose the people of color were the first to go? Charlize Theron’s Furiosa is the HBIC in this movie. I had my palm raised to the universe the second she took control of that big rig and led the charge across the desert. She’s tough, like hella-fucken tough, and I wanted to be in the rig with her. She’s over dealing with some patriarchal, violent goon, dude-monster. He’s a rapist, a slave owner and he’s hoarding all the natural resources, like the CEO of Nestle. And Charlize’s Furiosa, is ready to snatch his post-apocalyptic reign of terror and take her enslaved homegirls with her. And she does: Furiosa fights like a UFC champ and did we mention that’s she’s an amputee? All praise our homegirls that are disabled ‘cuz they can and will fuck shit up and lead us into the promised land. Hallelu. Mad Max: Fury Road feels revolutionary. The film is essentially a two-hour chase scene, complete with infinite gunshots and explosions, a few desolate wastelands, and a fantastical rig where half-living goons beat the drums — and shred the flaming guitars — of war. Inside these trappings, Mad Max tells the stories of powerful women fighting furiously for liberation. Holy cow I loved this movie. Like, who woulda thought that a Mel Gibson movie franchise would have turned into an awesome movie about a bunch of ladies looking badass and powerful and beautiful and then acting even more badass and powerful and beautiful?! I also loved that while the movie is called Mad Max Max is, at best, an ancillary character; the movie could have easily happened without him. It was anti-rape, anti-military, anti-totalitarianism and strongly pro-women. I mean, it was pretty much just a group of women fighting against toxic masculinity, and doing it in a movie genre that’s normally reserved for celebrating toxic masculinity. This movie was so straight up anti-patriarchy, it was amazing. The whole plot was about them trying to escape or defeat the evil hyper-masculine world of the Citadel and the men who run it. It was anti-rape, anti-military, anti-totalitarianism and strongly pro-women. I mean, it was pretty much just a group of women fighting against toxic masculinity, and doing it in a movie genre that’s normally reserved for celebrating toxic masculinity. It was all about these Wives who were sex slaves to the Immortan Joe, but as Kate Leth pointed out on twitter, there wasn’t actually any sexual violence in the movie, which is pretty amazing for a post-apocalyptic action movie about sex slaves. I liked Mad Max because it shows us what will happen if men continue to be in charge: they will destroy everything and develop a weird obsession with breast milk. Though this movie’s plot is literally, “Oh, we have to go to this one place, oops no, let’s go back” and it explains SO LITTLE of what you’re expected to just accept as the reality of the situation, I still enjoyed it. At one point men are only allowed to stay with a group of badass women because they are competent, which is a pretty low bar but still not the standard men are held to today. I also like that the Baby Man Army is nursed back to health via blood because it’s furr shurr a shout out to PERIODS. Other favorite moments include finding which men could not keep a beat in any scene with drums. Overall, it is one of those movies where like no one cares that you can barely understand what the characters are saying because it’s not going to make anything make more sense. Also, for it to be a movie that is just non-stop violence, it doesn’t delight in it and isn’t terribly gruesome (which was my concern going in). I know that there’s so much misandry and feminism, but by far the best part of the movie is that fucking guitar situation and if you do not laugh every time it comes on screen, you don’t have joy in your life and I feel sorry for you. At one point men are only allowed to stay with a group of badass women because they are competent, which is a pretty low bar but still not the standard men are held to today. This movie kicked ass. I was forced to watch it in 3D because everybody I was with wanted to, but I grinned through the nausea because there is not a moment in this film where really hot people aren’t kicking so much butt. I fucking love action movies. I love high-speed car chases, tough A.F. one-liners, and explosions. Unfortunately, I don’t enjoy watching men do stuff, unless they’re helping old ladies cross the street or carrying newborns in Baby Bjorns. I’m so completely over the whole “Watch Men Blow Things Up To Save People + Here Are Some Titties” movie genre, so I’m not ever trying to pay money to see male-dominated actions movies that often get their kicks from exploiting women and praising the brutality of men. I really, really didn’t want to see Mad Max. But then Gabby told me that MRAs were protesting it and would I please go see it with her and I did a 180 and was like, “Heck yes!” So obviously I loved this movie; pretty much the only thing I didn’t like was the soundtrack. Since talking about movies isn’t really my forte, I thought I’d rewrite the soundtrack. With a little help from Ms. Rivera herself, I made an alternate soundtrack full of songs that fit Mad Max’s feminista vibe. What songs would you want to hear chicks smashing cars (and the patriarchy) to? So there you have it, gorgeous warriors of the desert. Now, if you haven’t seen it, round up all your best homies and make a trek to the nearest theater. Have a few drinks beforehand or afterwards and make a night of it. Go with your fists raised high and salute big, stupid, glorious, Hollywood blockbusters and what it looks like when stories aren’t tailored to men and their fragile egos.

Gabrielle is currently working on her first novel while bouncing around NYC performing spoken word and trying to stick it to the man. I saw this on Sunday with friends, and went into the theater with pretty much no idea (other than general knowledge of the Mad Max movies) of what it was about.  It was pretty much the greatest thing ever. Epic car chases, epic feminism, and the psychotically epic Doof Warrior (the name of the guitar character. His truck is the Doof Wagon). One warning: if you are driving home after the movie, be aware that the urge to start running people off the road is pretty damn strong. yo oh my god, i got into my car with my girlfriend and my mom after the movie and all i wanted to do was race us all into the desert. navigating 95 south was thrilling and I just laughed bc I couldn’t get over how juiced I felt after this ridiculous ass amazing movie. DOIN IT! Anyone get the name of the pretty lady whom they first come upon when she’s acting as bait in the tower? She’s gotta be in there. Y’all we were in a movie theater, with line of men wrapped around the building, to see a feminist action movie in america! Never did I expect to see this day.  I have every intention of seeing this film since it’s getting such good reviews from pretty much everyone. I have yet to come across any review that hated the film. And I have always loved the Mad Max franchise in general. Yes, even Beyond Thunderdome. I will not apologize. Yeah, I was also bothered by the lack of woc, but like Lilian says, it was australia, and there were two maori actresses, so that’s good. I was basically obsessed with this entire movie. But the part that got me the most, when I was like ‘yes, this is the feminist action movie I have been waiting my whole life for,’ was when the one Vuvalini was naked bait in the tower and yet you never saw any gratuitous nudity, even in this part that had nudity that was actually useful to the story line. It was glorious. I will be purchasing this movie the day it comes out and then rewatching it forever. My mom dragged me (almost literally) to see this, and not knowing anything about it, I hated the first five minutes. As soon as Charlize Theron showed up, passed the Bechdel Test, and kicked ass, it won me over. I gushed the whole way home.  Saw this movie with a fellow feminist. We were literally surrounded by men in the movie theatre. This movie was so kickass, and loved that the leading woman was disabled. Also, a lot of ppl have said furiosa is queer. Is that cannon or more just they never mentioned it so we can read it as we want? There was defs a lack of people of colour in the movie which is super not okay. I like that mad max was basically not necessary to the movie, and how furiosa was leading this women but in a empowering I’ll help you if you want vs savioury way. I liked that there was a fair few disabled folks in the movie. I still can’t believe that this movie has actually been made.
If there was ever a list of things Hollywood executives don’t want to have in their movies, I think Mad Max has almost all of them. This movie wasn’t originally on my radar at all, but people all over the internet (okay, really just Cleolinda and Noelle Stevenson and now you guys) have been telling me how good it is! I’m so close to the end of this semester (one take-home final and one lab writeup to go), and have made my partner promise that we’ll see this as soon as all my work is in. Are there any sexual assault scenes in this movie? I’m seeing it in a couple of days and I’m trying to figure out if it’s gonna be too full on. I think this response may be too late but no, there weren’t. I think the article above mentions this but it’s fantastic that a movie wherein sex slaves play a crucial role in the narrative was produced without gratuitous scenes of sexual violence. This film felt like such a revelation, like that movie we had been asking for when asking for a female led action movie. Our prayers were answered and answered awesomely. It’s not perfect, yes. But it’s a huuuuuuuge step forward, steps I hope other people will follow in. The epitome of feminism, for me, was when one of the wives (The Dag) comments to an elderly Vuvalini (Keeper of the Seeds) about how she thought “they were above that”, referring to the violence. And then the Keeper of the Seeds goes on to say that because of the circumstances and the people that fuck everything up they needed to adapt and use violence. But she still carried the seeds and hoped for more. Sorry, I didn’t like it.
You know how there is PWP, Porn without Plot in fanfiction?
This movie was AWP Action without plot.
I went to see it because of the aforementioned feminism, which was there and great and such a relief, but there were so many logical loopholes (What do these people eat? How do they survive? How do they produce gas??) that I had a hard time tuning out and whenever I managed to tune out the absurdity, the guy with the guitar threw me.
It was amazingly beautifully shot and I was super happy about the representation of disabled folks, but not my cuppa tea. I need more story.More world building and myth.
I’m happy so many people liked it, though, because it’s got its heart in the right place and is very unHollywood. I loved that they didn’t spoon-feed us the world-building. It’s so rare to see an American movie or tv show where they don’t explain everything in words, and instead use visual or plot-based clues and references to show us that they have done plenty of world-building, and they trust us to pick up on it. (And one of the people in Max’s flashbacks was an indigenous man, but since those people were all people who Max let die, it probably doesn’t count). To me Fury Road is one of the best “show, don’t tell” mainstream films and I actually like that it doesn’t go on lengthy expositions and lets you connect the dots via visual cues or implications and thus also allows for a quiet complexity that unveils itself in further viewings. Totes saw this today just so I could read this. I didn’t want to see the movie in the first place because I didn’t even see the original one. The movie was wayyyyy cool and the girls took it to the patriarchy!!! Down with the patriarchy!!!!!! excellent movie. yea it’s not perfect but it’s on the right path. i wanted more women of color and i wanted the Wives to have more lines, but the movie did deliver on major fronts. I was so, so happy mad max and furiosa didn’t kiss. a romance would have been so absurd and infuriating, given the circumstance. you know wat’s funny, when the naked bait lady climbed down and all the vuvalini approached the rig and the bait lady pulled furiosa’s head to hers, i literally thought “HELL YEA THEYRE GONNA KISS IM SO HERE FOR THIS” lol but either way, im fine with it. some people were complaining that the Wives were nothing but objects in this film- precious cargo if you will. like i said, maybe a few more lines of dialogue wouldve shown us more personality. I wish there was Furiosa merchandise, like any Marvel character lol. I didn’t think I’d like a 2 hour car-chase-and-things-blow-up movie, but I was strangely invested. When I got home, my arms were sore cause I was clenching my fists the ENTIRE TIME without realizing it. Laura, I totally second the “WAIT THAT IS TONY FROM SKINS” sentiment. We just started watching that show, and we were confused as to why douchebag Tony was everywhere in our lives. Stop it, Tony.  Anyway, I normally don’t love the genre, but I enjoyed this movie for many of the reasons already mentioned: strong women characters holding their own, it passes the Bechdel test, it doesn’t exploit depictions of sexual violence. I still didn’t know any of the wives’ names, though, and I couldn’t watch any of the Vulvani getting hurt (NOOOO, JUST LET HER PLANT THOSE SEEDS IN PEACE Y’ALL). ”But how in the hell is Zoë Kravitz the sole black person in this future earth?! Am I to infer that when hell broke loose the people of color were the first to go?” That’s pretty much exactly how I inferred it, especially since some of the earliest scenes of the film included forced head shaving, forced tattooing, and an eerie salute. Plus neo-nazis are all about their Norse mythology, so when everyone started shouting about Valhalla, the white supremacy behind this nondescript society seemed pretty clear. I also found it historically appropriate that the only black character had been cast as a sex slave, since slavery is wrought with a history of rape for the purpose of producing more slaves. These points gave me a lot of ecofeminist feels, which were especially compounded by the mother’s milk scene. I’m transitioning back to a vegetarian diet this week, as a result."
"Aug 12, 2021",positive," Yo, mutha flowers, a bunch of us went to go see Mad Max Fury Road this past weekend. Had we known how incredible it was going to be, we would have organized a caravan of all you beautiful queers across the country to come together and watch it as a pack; a sexy, renegade pack of unapologetic feminists ready to blow shit up in the name of freedom and solidarity. But even on our own, in our own hometowns, in separate movie theaters, we watched and fell in love with the delicious, delirium-inducing, debauchery that is Mad Max Fury Road. One of my favorite things about this movie was that it not only had its Hard Butch heroine in Furiosa, but that the Five Wives, who were presented as being these beautiful, feminine, helpless girls who were coddled and pampered (but also sex slaves), also got their chances to shine and have some really cool action moments. All of the women in this movie were capable, not just the one named Capable. Toast the Knowing, Cheedo the Fragile, The Splendid Angharad, Capable and The Dag (has there ever been a movie with cooler character names???) all did things that helped ensure their survival. None of them were helpless damsels in distress. And let’s not forget the Vuvalini, who give us even more diverse kickass women. There were just so many awesome women in this movie! Charlize Theron delivers a captivating, challenging performance as Furiosa, arguably her best since Monster, as she barrels across the desert in a souped-up war rig to carry five angelic, badass women to a search for hope. Those women each embody their own strength and grace, overcoming fear and internalized misogyny to create a vision for a new life. Instead of forming a chorus of interchangeable former sex slaves, they are five women with their own goals, struggles and connections to each other and other characters. I want to watch the movie again and focus only on their experiences with and reactions to the horror unfolding around them, because there is immense texture within their stories. We only spend real time with two male characters in the film: Max, whose struggle with PTSD is one of the most honest portrayals of mental illness I’ve ever seen on film, and who seems perfectly happy to play backup to Furiosa’s commandership; and Nux, whose transformation from mindless, frothing henchman to a helper who finds his beating heart through the kindness of freed slave Capable speaks deep truth about allyship and sacrificing our own privilege to pursue liberation for all. Charlize Theron carried the weight of the film’s emotional journey, and managed to do so even though pretty much the whole entire film was a high speed car chase. Tom Hardy as Max, though the title character, was pretty much eye candy. I actually fucking love Tom Hardy. He’s crazy talented and not sore on the eyes either.

Anyway, I normally don’t love the genre, but I enjoyed this movie for many of the reasons already mentioned: strong women characters holding their own, it passes the Bechdel test, it doesn’t exploit depictions of sexual violence. I still didn’t know any of the wives’ names, though, and I couldn’t watch any of the Vulvani getting hurt (NOOOO, JUST LET HER PLANT THOSE SEEDS IN PEACE Y’ALL). ”But how in the hell is Zoë Kravitz the sole black person in this future earth?! Am I to infer that when hell broke loose the people of color were the first to go?” That’s pretty much exactly how I inferred it, especially since some of the earliest scenes of the film included forced head shaving, forced tattooing, and an eerie salute. Plus neo-nazis are all about their Norse mythology, so when everyone started shouting about Valhalla, the white supremacy behind this nondescript society seemed pretty clear. I also found it historically appropriate that the only black character had been cast as a sex slave, since slavery is wrought with a history of rape for the purpose of producing more slaves. These points gave me a lot of ecofeminist feels, which were especially compounded by the mother’s milk scene. I’m transitioning back to a vegetarian diet this week, as a result."
"Aug 12, 2021",positive," Yo, mutha flowers, a bunch of us went to go see Mad Max Fury Road this past weekend. Had we known how incredible it was going to be, we would have organized a caravan of all you beautiful queers across the country to come together and watch it as a pack; a sexy, renegade pack of unapologetic feminists ready to blow shit up in the name of freedom and solidarity. But even on our own, in our own hometowns, in separate movie theaters, we watched and fell in love with the delicious, delirium-inducing, debauchery that is Mad Max Fury Road. One of my favorite things about this movie was that it not only had its Hard Butch heroine in Furiosa, but that the Five Wives, who were presented as being these beautiful, feminine, helpless girls who were coddled and pampered (but also sex slaves), also got their chances to shine and have some really cool action moments. All of the women in this movie were capable, not just the one named Capable. Toast the Knowing, Cheedo the Fragile, The Splendid Angharad, Capable and The Dag (has there ever been a movie with cooler character names???) all did things that helped ensure their survival. None of them were helpless damsels in distress. And let’s not forget the Vuvalini, who give us even more diverse kickass women. There were just so many awesome women in this movie! Charlize Theron delivers a captivating, challenging performance as Furiosa, arguably her best since Monster, as she barrels across the desert in a souped-up war rig to carry five angelic, badass women to a search for hope. Those women each embody their own strength and grace, overcoming fear and internalized misogyny to create a vision for a new life. Instead of forming a chorus of interchangeable former sex slaves, they are five women with their own goals, struggles and connections to each other and other characters. I want to watch the movie again and focus only on their experiences with and reactions to the horror unfolding around them, because there is immense texture within their stories. We only spend real time with two male characters in the film: Max, whose struggle with PTSD is one of the most honest portrayals of mental illness I’ve ever seen on film, and who seems perfectly happy to play backup to Furiosa’s commandership; and Nux, whose transformation from mindless, frothing henchman to a helper who finds his beating heart through the kindness of freed slave Capable speaks deep truth about allyship and sacrificing our own privilege to pursue liberation for all. Charlize Theron carried the weight of the film’s emotional journey, and managed to do so even though pretty much the whole entire film was a high speed car chase. Tom Hardy as Max, though the title character, was pretty much eye candy. I actually fucking love Tom Hardy. He’s crazy talented and not sore on the eyes either. But I felt like his Mad Max was a little… introverted. Okay, but those sister wives are what confuse me. In a film with such a strong female lead, how could George Miller write such thoroughly forgettable supporting characters? Zoë Kravitz and Abbey Lee stood out against the rest of the damsels in distress as genuinely talented, but the others weren’t really given the opportunity. Also – not that I expect anything more from a big budget Hollywood action film – but how in the hell is Zoë Kravitz the sole black person in this future earth?! Am I to infer that when hell broke loose the people of color were the first to go? Because that’s actually how I’ve been making sense of it. Also, not that I expect anything more from a big budget Hollywood action film, but how in the hell is Zoe Kravitz the sole black person in this future earth?! Am I to infer that when hell broke loose the people of color were the first to go? Charlize Theron’s Furiosa is the HBIC in this movie. I had my palm raised to the universe the second she took control of that big rig and led the charge across the desert. She’s tough, like hella-fucken tough, and I wanted to be in the rig with her. She’s over dealing with some patriarchal, violent goon, dude-monster. He’s a rapist, a slave owner and he’s hoarding all the natural resources, like the CEO of Nestle. And Charlize’s Furiosa, is ready to snatch his post-apocalyptic reign of terror and take her enslaved homegirls with her. And she does: Furiosa fights like a UFC champ and did we mention that’s she’s an amputee? All praise our homegirls that are disabled ‘cuz they can and will fuck shit up and lead us into the promised land. Hallelu. Mad Max: Fury Road feels revolutionary. The film is essentially a two-hour chase scene, complete with infinite gunshots and explosions, a few desolate wastelands, and a fantastical rig where half-living goons beat the drums — and shred the flaming guitars — of war. Inside these trappings, Mad Max tells the stories of powerful women fighting furiously for liberation. Holy cow I loved this movie. Like, who woulda thought that a Mel Gibson movie franchise would have turned into an awesome movie about a bunch of ladies looking badass and powerful and beautiful and then acting even more badass and powerful and beautiful?! I also loved that while the movie is called Mad Max Max is, at best, an ancillary character; the movie could have easily happened without him. It was anti-rape, anti-military, anti-totalitarianism and strongly pro-women. I mean, it was pretty much just a group of women fighting against toxic masculinity, and doing it in a movie genre that’s normally reserved for celebrating toxic masculinity. This movie was so straight up anti-patriarchy, it was amazing. The whole plot was about them trying to escape or defeat the evil hyper-masculine world of the Citadel and the men who run it. It was anti-rape, anti-military, anti-totalitarianism and strongly pro-women. I mean, it was pretty much just a group of women fighting against toxic masculinity, and doing it in a movie genre that’s normally reserved for celebrating toxic masculinity. It was all about these Wives who were sex slaves to the Immortan Joe, but as Kate Leth pointed out on twitter, there wasn’t actually any sexual violence in the movie, which is pretty amazing for a post-apocalyptic action movie about sex slaves. I liked Mad Max because it shows us what will happen if men continue to be in charge: they will destroy everything and develop a weird obsession with breast milk. Though this movie’s plot is literally, “Oh, we have to go to this one place, oops no, let’s go back” and it explains SO LITTLE of what you’re expected to just accept as the reality of the situation, I still enjoyed it. At one point men are only allowed to stay with a group of badass women because they are competent, which is a pretty low bar but still not the standard men are held to today. I also like that the Baby Man Army is nursed back to health via blood because it’s furr shurr a shout out to PERIODS. Other favorite moments include finding which men could not keep a beat in any scene with drums. Overall, it is one of those movies where like no one cares that you can barely understand what the characters are saying because it’s not going to make anything make more sense. Also, for it to be a movie that is just non-stop violence, it doesn’t delight in it and isn’t terribly gruesome (which was my concern going in). I know that there’s so much misandry and feminism, but by far the best part of the movie is that fucking guitar situation and if you do not laugh every time it comes on screen, you don’t have joy in your life and I feel sorry for you. At one point men are only allowed to stay with a group of badass women because they are competent, which is a pretty low bar but still not the standard men are held to today. This movie kicked ass. I was forced to watch it in 3D because everybody I was with wanted to, but I grinned through the nausea because there is not a moment in this film where really hot people aren’t kicking so much butt. I fucking love action movies. I love high-speed car chases, tough A.F. one-liners, and explosions. Unfortunately, I don’t enjoy watching men do stuff, unless they’re helping old ladies cross the street or carrying newborns in Baby Bjorns. I’m so completely over the whole “Watch Men Blow Things Up To Save People + Here Are Some Titties” movie genre, so I’m not ever trying to pay money to see male-dominated actions movies that often get their kicks from exploiting women and praising the brutality of men. I really, really didn’t want to see Mad Max. But then Gabby told me that MRAs were protesting it and would I please go see it with her and I did a 180 and was like, “Heck yes!” So obviously I loved this movie; pretty much the only thing I didn’t like was the soundtrack. Since talking about movies isn’t really my forte, I thought I’d rewrite the soundtrack. With a little help from Ms. Rivera herself, I made an alternate soundtrack full of songs that fit Mad Max’s feminista vibe. What songs would you want to hear chicks smashing cars (and the patriarchy) to? So there you have it, gorgeous warriors of the desert. Now, if you haven’t seen it, round up all your best homies and make a trek to the nearest theater. Have a few drinks beforehand or afterwards and make a night of it. Go with your fists raised high and salute big, stupid, glorious, Hollywood blockbusters and what it looks like when stories aren’t tailored to men and their fragile egos. Go see what it looks like when we’re driving the smoking tractor-trailers into the unknown and fighting for our sisters to live free. Gabrielle Rivera is an awesomely queer Bronx bred, writer, spoken word artist and director.
Her short stories and poems have been published in various anthologies such as the Lambda Award winning Portland Queer: Tales from the Rose City and The Best of Panic! En Vivo from the East Village.
Her short film ""Spanish Girls are Beautiful"" follows a group of young Latina and Caucasian girls who like girls as they hook up, smoke up and try to figure sh*t out.
She also freelances for Autostraddle.com while working in the film and television industry.
Gabrielle is currently working on her first novel while bouncing around NYC performing spoken word and trying to stick it to the man. I saw this on Sunday with friends, and went into the theater with pretty much no idea (other than general knowledge of the Mad Max movies) of what it was about.  It was pretty much the greatest thing ever. Epic car chases, epic feminism, and the psychotically epic Doof Warrior (the name of the guitar character. His truck is the Doof Wagon). One warning: if you are driving home after the movie, be aware that the urge to start running people off the road is pretty damn strong. yo oh my god, i got into my car with my girlfriend and my mom after the movie and all i wanted to do was race us all into the desert. navigating 95 south was thrilling and I just laughed bc I couldn’t get over how juiced I felt after this ridiculous ass amazing movie. DOIN IT! Anyone get the name of the pretty lady whom they first come upon when she’s acting as bait in the tower? She’s gotta be in there. Y’all we were in a movie theater, with line of men wrapped around the building, to see a feminist action movie in america! Never did I expect to see this day.  I have every intention of seeing this film since it’s getting such good reviews from pretty much everyone. I have yet to come across any review that hated the film. And I have always loved the Mad Max franchise in general. Yes, even Beyond Thunderdome. I will not apologize. Yeah, I was also bothered by the lack of woc, but like Lilian says, it was australia, and there were two maori actresses, so that’s good. I was basically obsessed with this entire movie. But the part that got me the most, when I was like ‘yes, this is the feminist action movie I have been waiting my whole life for,’ was when the one Vuvalini was naked bait in the tower and yet you never saw any gratuitous nudity, even in this part that had nudity that was actually useful to the story line. It was glorious. I will be purchasing this movie the day it comes out and then rewatching it forever. My mom dragged me (almost literally) to see this, and not knowing anything about it, I hated the first five minutes. As soon as Charlize Theron showed up, passed the Bechdel Test, and kicked ass, it won me over. I gushed the whole way home.  Saw this movie with a fellow feminist. We were literally surrounded by men in the movie theatre. This movie was so kickass, and loved that the leading woman was disabled. Also, a lot of ppl have said furiosa is queer. Is that cannon or more just they never mentioned it so we can read it as we want? There was defs a lack of people of colour in the movie which is super not okay. I like that mad max was basically not necessary to the movie, and how furiosa was leading this women but in a empowering I’ll help you if you want vs savioury way. I liked that there was a fair few disabled folks in the movie. I still can’t believe that this movie has actually been made.
If there was ever a list of things Hollywood executives don’t want to have in their movies, I think Mad Max has almost all of them. This movie wasn’t originally on my radar at all, but people all over the internet (okay, really just Cleolinda and Noelle Stevenson and now you guys) have been telling me how good it is! I’m so close to the end of this semester (one take-home final and one lab writeup to go), and have made my partner promise that we’ll see this as soon as all my work is in. Are there any sexual assault scenes in this movie? I’m seeing it in a couple of days and I’m trying to figure out if it’s gonna be too full on. I think this response may be too late but no, there weren’t. I think the article above mentions this but it’s fantastic that a movie wherein sex slaves play a crucial role in the narrative was produced without gratuitous scenes of sexual violence. This film felt like such a revelation, like that movie we had been asking for when asking for a female led action movie. Our prayers were answered and answered awesomely. It’s not perfect, yes. But it’s a huuuuuuuge step forward, steps I hope other people will follow in. The epitome of feminism, for me, was when one of the wives (The Dag) comments to an elderly Vuvalini (Keeper of the Seeds) about how she thought “they were above that”, referring to the violence. And then the Keeper of the Seeds goes on to say that because of the circumstances and the people that fuck everything up they needed to adapt and use violence. But she still carried the seeds and hoped for more. Sorry, I didn’t like it.
You know how there is PWP, Porn without Plot in fanfiction?
This movie was AWP Action without plot.
I went to see it because of the aforementioned feminism, which was there and great and such a relief, but there were so many logical loopholes (What do these people eat? How do they survive? How do they produce gas??) that I had a hard time tuning out and whenever I managed to tune out the absurdity, the guy with the guitar threw me.
It was amazingly beautifully shot and I was super happy about the representation of disabled folks, but not my cuppa tea. I need more story.More world building and myth.
I’m happy so many people liked it, though, because it’s got its heart in the right place and is very unHollywood. I loved that they didn’t spoon-feed us the world-building. It’s so rare to see an American movie or tv show where they don’t explain everything in words, and instead use visual or plot-based clues and references to show us that they have done plenty of world-building, and they trust us to pick up on it. (And one of the people in Max’s flashbacks was an indigenous man, but since those people were all people who Max let die, it probably doesn’t count). To me Fury Road is one of the best “show, don’t tell” mainstream films and I actually like that it doesn’t go on lengthy expositions and lets you connect the dots via visual cues or implications and thus also allows for a quiet complexity that unveils itself in further viewings. Totes saw this today just so I could read this. I didn’t want to see the movie in the first place because I didn’t even see the original one. The movie was wayyyyy cool and the girls took it to the patriarchy!!! Down with the patriarchy!!!!!! excellent movie. yea it’s not perfect but it’s on the right path. i wanted more women of color and i wanted the Wives to have more lines, but the movie did deliver on major fronts. I was so, so happy mad max and furiosa didn’t kiss. a romance would have been so absurd and infuriating, given the circumstance. you know wat’s funny, when the naked bait lady climbed down and all the vuvalini approached the rig and the bait lady pulled furiosa’s head to hers, i literally thought “HELL YEA THEYRE GONNA KISS IM SO HERE FOR THIS” lol but either way, im fine with it. some people were complaining that the Wives were nothing but objects in this film- precious cargo if you will. like i said, maybe a few more lines of dialogue wouldve shown us more personality. I wish there was Furiosa merchandise, like any Marvel character lol. I didn’t think I’d like a 2 hour car-chase-and-things-blow-up movie, but I was strangely invested. When I got home, my arms were sore cause I was clenching my fists the ENTIRE TIME without realizing it. Laura, I totally second the “WAIT THAT IS TONY FROM SKINS” sentiment. We just started watching that show, and we were confused as to why douchebag Tony was everywhere in our lives. Stop it, Tony.  Anyway, I normally don’t love the genre, but I enjoyed this movie for many of the reasons already mentioned: strong women characters holding their own, it passes the Bechdel test, it doesn’t exploit depictions of sexual violence. I still didn’t know any of the wives’ names, though, and I couldn’t watch any of the Vulvani getting hurt (NOOOO, JUST LET HER PLANT THOSE SEEDS IN PEACE Y’ALL). ”But how in the hell is Zoë Kravitz the sole black person in this future earth?! Am I to infer that when hell broke loose the people of color were the first to go?” That’s pretty much exactly how I inferred it, especially since some of the earliest scenes of the film included forced head shaving, forced tattooing, and an eerie salute. Plus neo-nazis are all about their Norse mythology, so when everyone started shouting about Valhalla, the white supremacy behind this nondescript society seemed pretty clear. I also found it historically appropriate that the only black character had been cast as a sex slave, since slavery is wrought with a history of rape for the purpose of producing more slaves. These points gave me a lot of ecofeminist feels, which were especially compounded by the mother’s milk scene. I’m transitioning back to a vegetarian diet this week, as a result."
"Jul 28, 2021",positive," EnlargePeter OpaskarArs Technica turns 21 at the end of this year, but film coverage on site can't exactly purchase synthehol at the liquor store yet. Quietly, we've been reviewing movies on the Internet for 11 years now—a baker's dozen years if reviews of 3D experiences count—starting with this Max Payne piece that certainly qualifies as criticism. But beginning in 2014, we made film a regular topic on site. And these days we annually bounce from SXSW to Fantastic Fest with plenty of regional film events in between. Now, this ain't Variety, and we do not write about everything (though we have covered Beauty and The Beast and The Jungle Book somehow). But Ars has quite a few highlights in the 2010s beyond just starting a dedicated culture section. We failed at Vulcan salutes with Jake Gyllenhall and Ryan Reynolds. We caught the premiere of a Academy Award-nominated movie at NASA's Johnson Space Center. Somehow, we even helped save a Star Wars-adjacent movie from obscurity (earning an IMDb credit and inspiring a full-length remake in the process).

So with the end of the decade rapidly approaching, we felt it was OK to indulge our film list-making impulses. This is not necessarily a Best Films of the decade list—undeniably great things like Lady Bird, Moonlight, The Master, Bridesmaids, et al. are fantastic films that do not really fall within our narrow wheelhouse of science, technology, and genre fare. It is not a list of the Most Important films, either, as this decade of streaming's rise, female directors taking the reins, continued globalization of cinema, and a golden era for documentaries can likely be better explained elsewhere in the cinema-centric press. But the following is definitely a list of the stuff from the last decade that continues to come up in conversation around the Orbital HQ years later, and presumably these films will be forever fixtures of our streaming queues going forward. It's probably not a coincidence that during a decade when the most important and impactful technological change may prove to be the rise of the private space industry, audiences were treated to a renaissance of space cinema, too. It turns out a great space movie does not have to involve intergalactic war or precise period piece drama (though we all underrated First Man, folks). If you want utter spectacle in the most realistic way possible, Alfonso Cuarón's Gravity may have been the in-theater experience of the decade. The vastness of space has never been more vivid, even if some of the details may have irked our resident space purists. The Matt Damon-led The Martian somehow made the intricacies of growing crops in space exciting, continuing the trend of excellent science fiction that leaned heavily into the science. No one knew linguistics was this fascinating back in 2016, but Arrival just might be the overall best movie of the decade with the way it cleverly examines what we believe while simultaneously delivering a tense, gripping sci-fi story. And Hidden Figures puts the familiar period-piece lens on an overlooked part of space history without glossing over the ugly bits while still feeling hopeful for what science and technology can achieve when the best and brightest can participate. Add any number of other fine space movies to this lot—Interstellar, Ad Astra, etc.—but this quartet revived a cinematic subset Ars will always have a fondness for. The 2010s will undeniably go down as the decade of superheroes. By no means did it start here (the Nolan Batman trilogy began in the 2000s, as did the MCU with Iron Man in 2008), but it became an expanded universe, cinematic event these last 10 years. The first Avengers hit in 2012, and box offices haven't looked back since. Picking favorites among the standard superhero fare feels impossible. Your preferences of memorable Spider-Man (Into the Spider-Verse), Iron-Man (Iron Man 2), Captain America (Winter Soldier), or other regulation superhero flicks (Ragnarok ever-so-slightly over the original Deadpool?) may just depend on which hero your childhood allegiances line up toward. The true superteam event releases marked something slightly different and spectacular (Avengers: End Game over the original Guardians by a hair). But the caped crusades we'll remember a decade or two from now all busted out of the familiar formula to some degree. Black Panther showed not only was there audience appetite for a big-budget black superhero flick, but there was appetite for one that grappled with modern societal challenges like isolationism, oppression, and technological disparity. Logan took a hero long familiar to film-goers and turned the tropes of a superhero film into a Western that comments on universal themes like aging and the human condition in the process. And while Wonder Woman may be the most straightforward super-hero-y of the three, it showed a female-led comic book conquest was worth doing, especially when it leveraged well-executed period-piece elements with delightful sidekick chemistry. For the future of the then-beleaguered DC Comics entertainment arm, Wonder Woman also proved everything didn't have to be dark and brooding in order to reach an audience (all the fun being had in HBO's Watchmen seems to indicate DC took the hint). And, OK, it's not a traditional superhero movie, but we couldn't make an of-the-decade film list and exclude Mad Max: Fury Road entirely. Like more traditional caped-crusader flicks, this is an existing IP with an established hero that got a reimagining decades after the original. It starts with a very super villain-y evil plot (our titular hero is being sucked for blood to heal the bad-team War Boys; another hero has to help a group of women known as the Five Wives escape forced procreations). The film also offers extremely satisfying set pieces and action, plus ultimately some reveals that change how we previously understood our main character. Finally, perhaps most like the trio above, this newest Mad Max film took a decidedly different approach to its familiar post-apocalyptic world. Max Rockatansky may be back (invigorated by Tom Hardy), but the star of the show is Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron), the post-apocalyptic female hero sci-fi action fans deserve."
"Mar 29, 2021",positive," It almost goes without saying, and yet we should say it more often, that being a cinephile is a bit of an ironic designation. Anyone who loves cinema (or even television, which is just as cinematic) is a cinephile! That being said, there are still plenty of films whose names are thrown around under illustrious categories such as 'canon' and 'classic'. We're going to take a look at films within and beyond these, to create the beginnings of our very own, alternate canon: Clout Films. This is not to say, in any way, that these aren't fantastic films. What separates them from other fantastic films is that, today, they have – or should have – just as much clout as anything from your usual canon– your Gone With The Winds,  Sunset Boulevards, and Citizen Kanes. A lot of these films have also been included in alternate canons but are far too often expected to just stay there. The ultimate triviality of this 'clout' is what makes it so potent in influencing conversations about film, and what calls us to redefine it.  A moving, gentle film that any fan of cinema or filmmaker will surely fall in love with. The film is a documentary, directed by Singapore born filmmaker Sandi Tan, about an independent film she made when she was just 19. The less you know about this film, the better, but do be prepared for the story to go to unexpected places. The film is nostalgic, vulnerable, and personal, and in being so, makes you attach yourself to it like almost nothing else.  Gary Gray's 1996 crime film, featuring Queen Latifah, Vivica A. Fox, and Jada Pinkett Smith, used the heist genre to tell complex, inner-city stories of Black women. The friends-turned-bank-robbers are compelling, detailed characters, and the film's freshness carries it past any missteps.  This black-and-white, fantasy drama film from Iceland happens to be the debut of genre-bending, experimental pop music artist, Björk, and whilst that is enough of a hook for many, especially considering her wonderful performance, the last thing this film should be remembered as is trivia. Written and directed by Nietzchka Keene, based on the fairy tale ""The Juniper Tree"" collected by the Brothers Grimm, this small production tells the story of two sisters, in a medieval setting, who are forced to escape their home.  Brilliantly animated, highly acclaimed, and an innovative adaptation, Persepolis, a coming-of-age story, set against the Iranion revolution, is a gripping, feminist tale. Co-director Marjane Satrapi, author of the graphic novel the film is based on, chooses to style her autobiographical narrative as if the source material itself had come to life, leaving us with a breathtaking piece of cinema.  Seijun Suzuki, prominent B-film director, channels all his quirks and influences with cool effectiveness into this gem of a yakuza film. The story follows a reformed hitman who is forced to wander around Japan to escape being killed by various gangs. A unique and significant voice in the history of cinema that deserves much more love. One might not expect an adaptation of Jane Austen's Emma to be just so… pop. Clueless is exuberant, funny, loving, and delights in the possibilities of its title. The film is very much a time capsule of a very particular 1990s America, and writer-director, Amy Heckerling, makes a rom-com that's hard not to like. What makes the film truly special is its commitment to characters that it both ridicules and celebrates, ultimately embodying a confidence that very few other films have. A landmark in the queer film canon, Cheryl Dunye's rom-com drama is a heavily self-reflexive, lively, and dizzyingly charismatic. Along with being the film's writer, director, and editor, Dunye also plays the protagonist – named Cheryl – and owns every moment on screen.  It's a special film, and you won't regret giving it a watch. A poignant children's film, which injected American animation with a surge of energy, style, and confidence, The LEGO Movie took the most surprising stances, and went in the most surprising direction. Charming characters, voiced by a talented, cast of fan favourites like Chris Pratt, Will Ferrell, Elizabeth Banks, Alison Brie, Will Arnett, Chris Offerman, Liam Nesson and Morgan Freeman, are just a bonus (albeit, a big one). Chaitanya Tamhane's directorial feature debut (which he wrote too), proved to be a silent, observational, and devastating film. The multilingual, legal drama dances between the real and the absurd, using the spaces between them to interrogate law and life in India. This 'National Award for Best Feature Film' winner is a gem which will undoubtedly be seen as a classic in the future. Djibril Diop Mambéty's fantasy-drama is beautiful, magical, and prophetic. It depicts a 1970s Senegal playing host to two lovers who plan to leave Dakar for France. Do they ever make it? Touki Bouki, with its vivid imagery and fresh rhythm, is not just one of the most important African films but one of the most important films ever. Anand Gandhi's art film, told through three stories that explore the paradox of the same title as the film, interprets the question on several levels, relating it to humanity and the nature of being. It's a delicate, powerful film that belongs up there. George Miller, at age 71, returned to deliver another instalment of his iconic Mad Max franchise, and ended up doing something we've never seen before. The film, despite being a soft reboot, turned out to be one of the greatest action films of all time, with many trying to praise it by calling it an 'art' action film. And the film was not short of praise: it won 6 awards at the 88th Academy Awards. Despite all the buzz, everyone knew it would never win Best Picture. This remarkable film, led by an instantly iconic Charlize Theron, with Tom Hardy's titular character taking a backseat, almost sounds too simple on paper. You'll have to watch it to see how it took us to new heights of energetic, ambitious, emotionally resonant, intelligent, exhilarating, and political filmmaking. Situated in the broad Japanese New Wave movement, Toshio Matsumoto's nonlinear film about a young, trans woman, is an experimental look at queer culture in 1960s Tokyo. The striking originality of the film's voice, which dips into documentary as and when it feels like, produces an absolutely captivating experience. It might be hard to watch at times but if you can, you should. Though Possession has developed a massive cult following, and is a highly regarded horror film, Andrzej Żuławski's psychological drama about a wife who asks her husband for a divorce – an intentionally reductive description – is disturbing, enchanting, thrilling, and opens itself up to multiple readings. Whilst it doesn't have to be viewed as anything more than an engaging piece of work, many continue to view it as only a genre film (with the typical condescension towards 'genre' films attached). If you have a bug for horror, give it a go! Whilst this might have been a surprising pick a decade ago, recent critical reevaluation has shone a light on this classic, teen horror film, now viewing it as us fans always  have. The film, written by Academy Award winner Diablo Cody (Best Original Screenplay for Juno), directed by Karyn Kusama, starred Megan Fox and Amanda Seyfried, and one can't help but suspect that the general public was ready to dismiss it before it came out. It was marketed with the most heteronormative, male gaze possible, which Cody has spoken out about later. An example would be how the kissing scene between the leads was heavily pushed to appeal to adolescent boys. This scene actually embodied some of the best themes of the film: confusion between friendship and love, the relationship between desire and fear, and bold, feminist strides. All of this was wrapped up in a fun, tense, and poignant story. Often touted as the spiritual successor to the iconic, cult film The Rocky Horror Picture Show, this film carved its own niche, cult following, largely thanks to writer-director-star John Mitchell. He plays Hedwig, a genderqueer East German rock singer, and their backing band, the Angry Inch. It's a lovable film with plenty of personality, humour, and heart. A masterpiece of Hindi cinema, Dibakar Banerjee's anthology film started the 2010s off with a bang. It's an original story, coming from an original voice. The subject matter itself – including 'honour killings', non-consensual recording and selling of sex tapes, and sting operations – makes the fact that this film even exists, a little bit of a miracle. Fun fact: this was also Rajkummar Rao's film debut. Anurag Kashyap cemented his name in the history of Hindi cinema with this 5 hour long, multi-generational, family, revenge saga. It breathes with the ferocity and depth of a classic like 'The Godfather', or a more recent film like 'Gangs of New York', but tells its own, very singular story. Darkly comic, brutal, and impactful, the film also features one of the greatest casts seen in a Hindi film: Manoj Bajpayee, Richa Chadha, Nawazuddin Siddiqui, Piyush Mishra, Pankaj Tripathi, Reema Sen, Huma Qureshi, Rajkummar Rao and many, many more. Amongst the many Studio Ghibli classics, Isao Takahata's anime, fantasy film, based on a 10th century Japanese story, is the only one which stands shoulder to shoulder with Spirited Away. The film holds a timeless, magical quality, along with being thematically heavy and looking absolutely marvelous. Go in blank, let it unfold. To be perfectly honest, one could make the case for most of Charlie Kaufman's filmography – as either writer or director – being remembered as exceptional, and deserving of all the praise in the world. The visually unique, stop motion animation, Anomalisa, rooted firmly in the 'Kaufmanesque' genre, is about Michael Stone, a lonely (duh) customer service expert's one-night stay at a hotel. The film features just three voices: David Thewlis as Michael, Tom Noonan as the voice Michael hears out of everybody else in the film, and Jennifer Jason Leigh as Lisa, whom Michael meets at the hotel, and is the only voice he hears as different to all the others."

"Jan 27, 2021",positive,Mad Max: Fury Road is a movie with the kind of reach most people - and even most movies - can only aspire to.
"Dec 4, 2020",positive," hile much of the minimalist plot bears resemblance to his earlier “Mad Max” films, George Miller’s “Fury Road” is less remake and more reinvention of his own postapocalyptic action movie genre. Blending elements of “The Road Warrior” and “Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome,” the visionary director dials up the sun-scorched atmosphere to a deafening degree – rusty behemoths collide with damaged flesh and punishingly hostile terrain while heavy metal guitar chords and booming drums bang out a rhythmic dirge. Both the pacing and intensity are relentless, with only snippets of humor thrust into the scanty dialogue, yet Miller knows exactly how much chaos to douse upon his wildly inventive action sequences without losing the quirky fun. The gorgeously demonic designs appear freshly unhinged, while still retaining an air of nostalgia, as the ever-escalating demolition of man, machine, and mise en scene prove endlessly entertaining in this lovingly demented ode to mayhem. Haunted by the ghosts of those he couldn’t save, Max Rockatansky (Tom Hardy) wanders the savage wastelands of a world crumbling under the weight of misery, despair, and diabolical despots preying upon the weak. Captured and assigned as sustenance (a.k.a. a blood bag) for the unhealthy minions of vicious tyrant Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), Max spies an opportunity to escape his cruel fate when he encounters the resolute driver Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron). Fleeing from Joe’s “Citadel” city with the mad king’s precious cargo and a massive war rig tanker, Furiosa enlists Max’s help to traverse hundreds of miles of barren desert in a perilous mission of redemption. Expectedly, it all begins with a car chase. Then, it segues into a pursuit on foot, before giving way to yet another race of vehicles. It’s no secret that “Mad Max: Fury Road” is essentially a two-hour car chase, but credit is due to writer/director George Miller for taking his one idea and attacking it with such unwavering energy that the movie can survive on basically nothing else. The filmmaker certainly knows how to do fast and furious; if ever there were a film that deserved those words in its title, it’s this. And yet, though the project is named after Max, it’s really Theron’s Furiosa who owns the film, bringing a more sympathetic, humanistic character into the fold (especially considering that Rockatansky barely has any lines of dialogue). Miller, realizing that fans crave more of what he gave them in “Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior,” reimagines many of the same elements, but with far more verve. Miraculously, he pays homage or grandly embellishes more often than he merely rips off his former concepts – which, of course, he would be entitled to do, since he practically invented the postapocalyptic wasteland setting and epic vehicular skirmishes with cannibalized, re-outfitted, hodgepodge conveyances. Motorcycles, big rigs, monster trucks, tanks, and more are gloriously welded and melded together into gargantuan juggernauts of metal and fuel. This eye-popping style carries over with equal eccentricity to the costuming, makeup, and prosthetics, manifesting some splendidly fitting grotesqueries and oddities and villains – as audiences have come to anticipate from Miller’s works. The denizens become ever stranger as the locations shift and the picture progresses. Like a twist on “Birdman’s” percussionist, who regularly appeared in shots with the actors as his beats permeated the soundtrack, Miller employs literal drummers and an electric guitarist (perched atop – or rather dangling from – one of the trucks) to supplement the background sounds with thunderous thumps and twanging riffs, respectively. It ramps up the momentum (if such a thing is possible) for the colossal action sequences that assault the viewer with such force that the 120-minute runtime feel like 30. So much stuff goes on in every frame (except, perhaps, for a plot) that it’s unachievable to take it all in the first time through. The stunts are likely the only piece of the film that could be better appreciated; unfortunately, thanks to the extreme advancements in computer graphics (it’s been over three decades since “The Road Warrior”), it’s no longer necessary to choreograph exacting realism from such scenes. Before, there was something undeniably awe-inspiring about the stuntmen getting thrown from cars and careening about in the dirt, since every moment involved actual humans. But now, CG bodies and vehicles frequently replace real and realistic stunts, allowing for gravity-defying and farfetched maneuvers that lose a bit of their impressiveness in their sheer outlandishness (though practical effects do make up a large percentage of the screen). Still, the calm before the storm of a finale is utterly exhilarating as high-octane recklessness and physical abandon replace sensibility and cinematic caution – it’s an absolute thrill ride.

"Nov 20, 2020",positive," I certainly was looking forward to the release of this movie … and was in desperate need for some chill time at the cinemas. (It was well deserved).  Mad Max surely isn’t that popular as I thought it would be considering that I shared the cinema hall with just about eight other people. Maybe because there wasn’t much hype or fuss about it here in Ghana. Nonetheless I would doubt if anyone who has seen the pre-release trailers would dare say “I am not interested in watching this movie”. Trust me… those teaser trailers were enough to grab my attention months ago. Mad Max : Fury Road is a futuristic apocalyptic story set in a stark desert landscape where humanity is broken, and almost everyone is crazed fighting for the simple necessities of life. Following the story of two rebels on the run, who just might be able to help restore order. There’s Max, who seeks peace of mind following the loss of his wife and child in the aftermath of the chaos. And Furiosa, a strong willed woman trying to find her way back to her childhood homeland. Tom Hardy beat Jeremy Renner and host of likable stars to land this lead role as Max alongside Charlize Theron (Furiosa), Nicolas Hoult and Hugh Keays-Byrn. It’s easier for me to understand why this movie is a big deal because I have seen the earlier titles so I kind of see the need for this reboot. And that gives me more appreciation for this movie. For starters, unlike most apocalyptic movies you might have seen instead of the usual dry, dusty deserts this one has a lot of color and depth. The directors did well to capture certain level of beauty in a dry waste land. I loved every bit of the cinematography. Compared to the previous movies you immediately feel the midas touch of technology in the making of this movie. For the story line itself… I would describe it as, high octane, full throttle action packed and chaotic. Yes right from the start to the very end the entire story line keeps an action sequence that doesn’t slow down or dull you enough to change the vibe of the movie. The chaotic madness can in no way be classified as humorous at all. If you are thinking of going to laugh at this movie expecting some “Madness” that would crack you up … forget it. It’s all seriousness with a lot of explosions and daring stunts. Insane action that would literally blow you away and have you at the edge of you seat for the entire run time.  This is a huge step up from the earlier movies… exactly what it was meant to be…equally chaotic and horrific yet more intense and breathtakingly exciting. In fact at some point it becomes even difficult to keep up with the thrill and you can’t afford to blink all for the fear for losing sight of any of the action. Oh.. there is also the hard rock fused score that just keeps your pulse rushing with adrenaline. (If there is anything else that I love next to movies, it would be rock music and or Waakye .. lol)  Although it’s cold, violent and visceral you can also feel the underlying elements of hope, loyalty, reverence and redemption.  I am confident to say all those trailers and featurettes did promise and deliver for me. Besides the almost unnoticeable holes in the actual plot and backdrop of the movie, there also wasn’t too much dialogue in the story line, especially for the Max character. I feel this was all part of the makers attempt at making him seem darker, confused and mysterious. I guess it worked even though I didn’t like that. At some point I felt I like the movie should have been titled Mad Furiosa instead.  I was also expecting that the reboot would have started from before the apocalypse era like the first Mad Max (1979) movie did. Maybe the makers would consider doing that as this revamped franchise kicks off and progresses. My only fear is that some people might get lost in all the chaos and confusion and may not give this title the appreciation it fully deserves. It’s always refreshing for me to watch a movie as thrilling and entertaining as this was. Especially one that has come back from thirty years.  I am now more interested in seeing how the follow up sequels do as well. This is certainly time well spent.. my chill time wasn’t wasted at all going to see this movie. And I can’t wait to see it again. I am scoring this  8/10. Max Rockatansky: [Narrating] My name is Max. My world is reduced to a single instinct: Survive. As the world fell it was hard to know who was more crazy. Me… Or everyone else. Second on my list of addictions is Movies.. the only thing I could possibly love more is my Dearest Waakye lol. Nothing else does a better job of reminding me that ANYTHING is possible with the right amount of effort. I have great eye for details and flaws in scripts. Shallow scripts bore me. I am an avid reader.

"Oct 27, 2020",positive," Amazon Prime Video has developed a sizeable bank of movies over the years, and remains arguably the best streaming platform to offer a cross section of Indian cinema. But endless scrolling to find the gems can be tiresome. That's why we're bringing you our list of 60 of the best movies currently streaming on Amazon Prime Video India (as of October 2020). Let the bingeing begin. The Adam Driver-led riveting investigative thriller chronicles the Senate's investigation into the CIA's use of torture following the 9/11 attacks. The Report is both engrossing and infuriating, and serves as the perfect counter piece to Kathryn Bigelow's Zero Dark Thirty. Lijo Jose Pellissery's kinetic spectacle, based on S Hareesh's short story Maoist, explores masculinity like few films before it. At a basic level, the film is about retrieving a lost buffalo. But, that one-line summary doesn't do justice to the surreal energy and spectacular chaos of the film. People have been picking it apart for its 'meaning' ever since it released. We invite you to do the same. A gangster-esque saga set in the world of politics, Prithviraj Sukumaran's impressive directorial debut is the larger-than-life masala film done right. The Mohanlal-starrer is bursting with swag, has a genuinely gripping plot and is full of delicious twists and turns resulting in a strong political drama and delicious revenge saga in equal measure. Nag Ashwin's Mahanati is an ode to one of Telugu cinema's greatest actors—Savitri. Nag Ashwin's take on the Saviritri story successfully explores a complex woman and her turbulent journey, brought to life by an unforgettable performance from Keerthy Suresh. Todd Haynes' spellbinding book adaption is as visually dazzling as it is sensitive. Haynes takes you on a deeply affecting journey by following the adventures of two deaf children across different time periods while exploring their curious connection. The action epic that put Kannada cinema on the map like few before it, became the first Kannada film to cross the Rs. 100-crore mark at the box office. The ambitious gangster saga led by 'Rocking Star Yash' is a rousing underdog story which gives Indian cinema yet another larger-than-life franchise to look forward to. Kathryn Bigelow's expansive drama follows the decade-long international manhunt for Osama bin Laden, from the events of 9/11 to his eventual death at the hands of US Marines. In Konkona Sen Sharma's sparkling directorial debut, a shy and sensitive Indian student (Vikrant Massey) pays a heavy price for his gentleness, while on a road trip with his conceited relatives and family friends. Led by a hauntingly beautiful performance from Massey, A Death In The Gunj remains one of the strongest ensemble dramas of recent years. Tamil cinema has had its share of father-daughter based films but few are as affecting, complex and disturbing as this Mammootty starrer. The film dives into the psyche of a helpless father who's taken custody of his teenage daughter suffering from cerebral palsy. Peranbu is a piercing coming of age drama which also raises several pertinent questions about parenting, disability and sexuality. Kumail Nanjiani and Emily Gordon's real-life love story serves as inspiration for the film that put romantic comedies back on the map. Bursting with heart and great one liners, The Big Sick is a witty and charming exploration of love and family while exploring clashing cultures with a much needed dose of empathy. Led by a career-topping performance from Ram Charan, set in the '80s, Rangasthalam tells the story of an innocent villager with a hearing impairment who gets mixed up in a political feud involving his elder brother. Director Sukumar impressively uses the big masala film to explore caste, class and oppression. Saoirse Ronan, Emma Watson, Florence Pugh, Laura Dern, Timothée Chalamet, and Meryl Streep star in a movie from writer-director Greta Gerwig's that does justice to their insane collective talent and the book on which the movie is based. That's it. That's all you need to know. When a boy from an impoverished and oppressed farming family kills a big shot, his father (Dhanush in fantastic form) fears retribution. He flees with the boy, the big shot's men in pursuit. Coming right after Vetri Maaran-Dhanush's gorgeous Vada Chennai, Asuran evokes mixed feelings. The screenplay is brilliantly cyclical and there's no denying the power of the mood and the material in a film you won't be able to shake off for days on end. A woman wakes up without clothes in a desolate building. You'd think you were in for a survival drama like Trapped. But Rathna Kumar 's Aadai plays with your head by making Kamini (a sensational Amala Paul) a fascinating and morally questionable figure, leading to one hell of a morality tale. When it comes to huge spectacle action, there is no greater living example than the chaotic achievement that is George Miller's Mad Max: Fury Road. Fury Road is just non-stop, carefully crafted carnage which somehow manages to be coherent, all while having used minimal CGI. Fury Road is a masterpiece of mayhem which cemented Charlize Theron as one of the greatest modern action stars and there's no experience quite like it. In an industry inundated with stories where things always work out, Akshay Roy's Meri Pyaari Bindu gave Hindi cinema a rare look at heartbreak. It made a long overdue case for why some relationships don't always work out and how sometimes that is the happy ending. Ayushmann Khurrana stars as the writer who can't get over the one that got away, Parineeti Chopra as Bindu. A bleak drama from Kenneth Lonergan, Manchester by the Sea is a deeply personal film which examines the ways tragedy can wear away at a person's soul, and whether it is possible to come back from the brink. Despite the heart-breaking premise,  the film is filled with unexpected moments of humour and warmth. Winner of the National Award for best Hindi film, Rajkummar Rao stars as a fish-out-of-water government clerk who tries to run a free and fair election in the Naxal-controlled conflict-ridden jungles of India in a nuanced film that explores the painful shortcomings of Indian democracy. Gareth Evans' gloriously violent Indonesian film features a police officer trapped in an apartment building filled with an army of bad guys he has to fight his way through. It has relentless end-to-end killing with some of the most brutal fight scenes you've ever seen. But despite its singular bone breaking vision, it still manages to have a satisfying plot and some fantastically well-crafted scenes of tension amidst the blood bath. On face value, Doug Liman's Edge Of Tomorrow deals with familiar tropes – of a war for the planet and time loops and alien invasions – but it's brilliantly executed with some fantastic combat sequences. Not to mention one of the most badass female action heroes in Emily Blunt's Full Metal Bitch. Edge Of Tomorrow has Tom Cruise as a man forced to relive the same day over and over again in a spectacular action flick that you just want to revisit over and over again. War is the definitive Bollywood action film of its time which proved to the world that Hindi cinema can do the slick sophisticated blockbuster, and do it well. It's Tiger Shroff's best film and the only film that's really known how to capture his ability and channel it into something actually cinematic. Even at its most ridiculous it's never not fun and it perfectly nailed the novelty of the 'two hero film'. War is an unapologetic star vehicle at its best, bursting with style, attitude and just pure swag. It's hard to pick just one amongst Peter Jackson's Middle Earth epic. In terms of battle sequences alone,  it's hard to find one that's quite as daunting and absorbing as the Battle for Helm's Deep in The Two Towers, followed closely by the Battle for Minas Tirith in The Return Of The King. In one of the greatest good vs evil stories ever told, Peter Jackson throws you onto the battlefield with your favourite characters. It's also straight up badass, because…Legolas. Just Legolas. The predictable but urgent Malayalam-language thriller has the sort of moral premise that allows it to transcend the trappings of ""lockdown storytelling"" and exist as an organic computer-screen movie – more on the lines of international hits like Searching and Unfriended. The revelations aren't shocking, but there's an arc to its characters – especially Fahadh Faasil's – that humanizes both the distance and intimacy of modern technology. Hrishikesh Mukherjee's Chupke Chupke is a laugh-out-loud comedy of errors about a man who is pretending to be a driver. Expect constant confusion and choreographed chaos of the best kind. The definitive coming-of-age drama, which marked the directorial debut of Farhan Akhtar, remains just as complex and intricate today as it did when it came out almost 20 years ago. Aamir Khan, Saif Ali Khan and Akshaye Khanna play loyal friends that overcome various obstacles of life in a film that captures college life and the transition into adulthood like no film before it, and few since have. One of Indian cinema's most iconic comedy, the film takes a deep, dark look into the scandals of bureaucracy and politics. Two Mumbai-based photographers get caught up a builder's surreptitious dealings with the government along with a murder which ends with the comical revamp of the Mahabharata that will forever be etched in cinema history. Few movies can claim to have the level of national presence and dedicated following of Jab We Met. With Geet's lovable chattiness, Pritam's groovy soundtrack and so much more, Imtiaz Ali created his own canon for Bollywood rom-coms filled with humour and emotion of an unforgettable kind. Amitabh Bachchan's, ""I can talk English, I can walk English, I can laugh English"" is forever etched in the hallmark of great Bollywood dialogues. This is a blockbuster comedy difficult to top. Bachchan maintains his comic timing, beating thugs with style, and with Bappi Lahiri's evergreen soundtrack, this action-comedy is one for the ages. The directorial debut of Nandita Das, set one month after the 2002 Gujarat Riots, explores the lives of the survivors and victims unabashedly – those that witnessed an entire city burn and crumble. This pithy and haunting film goes deep into the psychological and mental anguish the communal riots caused, and through that, makes a plea for peace and harmony. Family Guy creator Seth Macfarlane brings his signature pop-culture-referencing insult-comedy style to this story of a boy whose birthday wish brings his teddy bear to life. Except 30 years later, it's not as cute anymore as the two man-children just lounge around doing drugs and being idiots. Ted gives us one of the greatest comedic characters – a lovable, foul-mouthed cuddly toy full of memorable one-liners who armed us with an arsenal of handy insults. Set against the backdrop of the 2018 Nipah virus outbreak in Kerala, individuals from various walks of life come together to contain its spread in this gripping Malayalam-language thriller. Parvathy Thiruvothu, Tovino Thomas, and Revathi star in a film that's never been more relevant and, despite its haunting subject matter, is ultimately a story of hope. One man's heart-pounding crusade to tear down the crooked system that created him, The Bourne Trilogy is a shining example of a single story told over three parts, (the less said about the 2016 attempt to reboot the series, the better). The sophisticated espionage series that reinvented onscreen action gave us a new, more rooted kind of spy thriller, far removed from the Bond school of blockbuster, but no less exhilarating. Rajkumar Santoshi's immensely quotable cult classic about a pair of hapless slugs who hatch hare-brained schemes to get rich (played by Aamir Khan and Salman Khan), remains every bit the whirlwind comedy it was when it came out decades ago. For everything else, there's Crime Master Gogo. In what remains one of the greatest and most influential gangster epics of all time, City Of God chronicles the lives of young gangsters in Brazil's sultry slums, giving us a sprawling saga of drugs, poverty, crime and utter swag. A shining example of the new wave of Telugu cinema, the well-crafted comedy thriller starring Naveen Polishetty is as hilarious as it is engrossing, masterfully navigating the delicate balance act of humour and a tense, high stakes plot surrounding a series of murders. Years before he was asked to reboot another iconic space saga, JJ Abrams was tasked with reimagining Star Trek, leading to a well-conceived and sorely underrated reimagining of the iconic franchise. Star Trek, masterfully paid homage to the old while paving the way for the new, whilst also making it accessible to those of us who weren't previously married to the Star Trek franchise. With a strong ensemble cast recreating beloved characters, Abrams gave us an origin story of the USS Enterprise and its colourful crew, led by the Chris Pine's charismatic James T Kirk. Shankar's pure, unhinged sci-fi spectacle, for all its slipups, has two things we rarely see in Indian cinema – dazzling imagination and sheer vision. The scale, the visuals, the many forms of Rajinikanth going head to head with Akshay Kumar make the film a must watch. Rahi Anil Barve's debut film must be celebrated not only for its ambition, gumption and scale, but also its fascinating exploration of the horror fantasy genre. While looking for a secret treasure in a village in 20th-century Maharashtra, a man and his son face the consequences of building a temple for a legendary demon who's not supposed to be worshipped. A minor confrontation between a cop and an ex-army man snowballs into an escalation of egos and powerplay. Directed and written by Sachy and anchored by two terrific performances from Biju Menon and Prithviraj Sukumaran, Ayyappanum Koshiyum is a fascinating exploration of masculinity and privilege, neatly packaged in a riveting thriller. Deliciously despicable and delectably sinister, Bornila Chatterjee's The Hungry is a gloriously well-made revenge drama lead by an electric ensemble of seasoned performers like Naseeruddin Shah, Tisca Chopra and Sayani Gupta. Leonardo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt, and Margot Robbie lead the ensemble cast of Quentin Tarantino's ""fairy tale tribute"" to the waning days of Hollywood's golden age, which follows an ageing actor (DiCaprio) and his long-time friend and stunt double (Pitt) as they navigate a changing industry. This nostalgic throwback to classic sci-fi thrillers follows a young switchboard operator and a radio DJ whose discovery of a mysterious audio frequency sets off a series of discoveries that lead them deep into the unknown. The Vast of Night is a film you won't forget, announcing its writers, director, and cast as new talents to watch out for. Set in the coastal of village of Chellanam near Ernakulam, Lijo Jose Pellissery's sixth film traces a series of unfortunate events that follows the death of Vavachan Mestri (Kainakary Thankaraj) a few moments after he tells his son Eeshi (Chemban Vinod Jose) about his dream funeral. Despite the sombre setting, the film takes the form of a dark comedy with several laugh-out-loud moments popping up every few minutes. Four brothers who share a love-hate relationship stand behind one of their own in matters of the heart in this Malayalam-language family drama that has fast become one of the most beloved Indian films of recent years. An idealistic young man from a poor, oppressed caste family strikes a friendship with a much wealthier female classmate at law school in this Tamil-language film, earning him the wrath of her relatives and the society at large. Directed by Mari Selvaraj and produced by Pa. Ranjith, Pariyerum Perumal is a scathing look at the caste system and the society that is blind to it. After Mulk and Article 15, Anubhav Sinha set his sights on domestic abuse in his most recent social drama Thappad. The film stars Taapsee Pannu as a devoted wife whose entire world is shaken after her seemingly loving husband (Pavail Gulati) slaps her in a fit of rage. What follows is her messy, turbulent quest for justice and divorce, all while her family, friends and lawyers try and make her 'see reason' and not overreact at what was 'just a slap'. Gully Boy followed a predictable underdog trajectory but Zoya Akhtar and co-writer Reema Kagti build on these layers of finely etched relationships, memorable characters and an unforgettable 18-track soundtrack. When Murad finally says, Apna Time Aayega, you believe, for a brief moment in time, that you can also overcome the odds.  And what could be better than that? Writer-director Sharat Katariya's delightfully sensitive romantic drama, set in the Haridwar of 1995, is about a boy with low self-esteem and no achievements (Ayushmann Khurrana) who is compelled by his family to marry a smart, feisty, educated girl (Bhumi Pednekar) despite his objections to her plus-sized physique. The Harry Potter movies are the rare series to defy the notion that the books are always better. Rather than better or worse, the films were almost an extension of the books, wonderfully bringing to life JK Rowling's fantastical Wizarding World as the definitive franchise an entire generation grew up with. Based on the 2003 book by Cressida Cowell, the film tells the story of misunderstood teenager Hiccup, who is overlooked and underestimated by his warrior father, who forms an unlikely friendship with a dragon. How To Train Your Dragon is the perfect mix of beautiful animation, delightful characters, and a fantastic adventure rooted in the idea of empathy. Anurag Kashyap's Black Friday is more of a feeling – singularly shocking, stirring, cataclysmic, yet journalistic and depressingly objective, and one of the great achievements in Indian cinema. The reflective effect of this movie about the 1993 bomb blasts (based on Hussain Zaidi's superbly researched novel) was so powerful that nothing less than a TADA verdict forced the courts to certify its ""legality"". Vishal Bhardwaj's first film in his Shakespeare trilogy was an adaptation of Macbeth beautifully transposed to the Mumbai underworld. Maqbool was a triumph of casting with unforgettable performances from its ensemble of stalwarts like Irrfan Khan, Tabu, Pankaj Kapoor, Naseeruddin Shah and Om Puri. Shoojit Sircar's October is a thing of heart-breaking beauty. A boy (Varun Dhawan) coasts through life aimlessly until random tragedy strikes, taking over his life in ways he doesn't quite understand leaving him forever changed. An unshakeable portrait of pain and trauma, Honey Boy is based on Shia Labeouf's adolescence as a child actor with an abusive father, which sees the actor play the role of his father. Director Alma Har'el brings a sense of delicacy to a painful story that leaves you better off for having watched it. Bong Joon Ho's history-making take on class warfare and family strife was carefully crafted suspense at its best resulting in a rare movie that is as layered as it is accessible. A delicious Bollywood-ish tale follows the love story of Rachel (Constance Wu) and Nick (Henry Golding). The twist being that Nick is actually the son of one of the richest families in the world. Let the lavish, gorgeous chaos ensue. Six uncomfortably hilarious fables of revenge play out in this Argentinian anthology from writer-director Damián Szifron which escalates relatable grudges into tales of apocalyptic revenge. One of the most impactful, immersive war movies of all time, Steven Spielberg's cinematic achievement takes us as close to the front line as possible offering a human take on the chaos of war. Shimit Amin's iconic sports drama remains every bit the achievement it was when it came out, giving us one of Hindi cinema's greatest underdog stories led by an unforgettable SRK as Kabir Khan."
"Oct 21, 2020",positive," Every so often, and in increasingly rare numbers, a big budget Hollywood extravaganza comes along and negates the crushing conditioned cynicism built into our cinematic receptors. Walking into a franchise reboot of a series that hasn’t received fresh blood in nearly three decades, following a trilogy of films having starred an infamously fallen matinee idol, forecasts were dubious at best for George Miller’s Mad Max: Fury Road. Premiering out of competition at Cannes just prior to receiving its worldwide premiere, the seventy year old originator of the iconic series defied all expectations to create a beautiful and intense action film, standing as one of the best sequels to arrive in well over a decade. Stuffed with innovative visuals, bloody violence, insanely choreographed car chases and serving a rudimentary feminist allegory coursing through the usual arid bromide of commonly testosterone laced genre, the film is unforgettable testament to the heights such cinema can still attain. Max (Tom Hardy) becomes the unwilling prisoner of Immortan Joe’s (Hugh Keays-Byrne), a ruthless leader of one of mankind’s few surviving human populations following the apocalypse, hoarding water inside his mountainside kingdom. But one of Joe’s trusted leaders, the ferocious Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) has just stolen a war tanker, and with it, Joe’s bevy of buxom breeder women he’s kept locked in a cave for pleasure and progeny. Thrust into the band of crusaders out to capture Furiosa and return the human loot, Max understands his only chance of survival is to band with Furiosa. Much has been made of the film’s significant presence as a ‘feminist’ action film, considering Miller reportedly consulted with Eve Ensler concerning the characterizations of women, it’s impressive editing from Miller’s wife, Margaret Sixel (who also worked on Miller’s features Babe: Pig in the City and Happy Feet), and, it’s showcasing of actor Charlize Theron, whose narrative dominates the film as she relegates its eponymous hero into the position usually reserved for a damsel in distress. As Imperator Furiosa, Theron successfully launches herself in the dusty footsteps of Sigourney Weaver and Linda Hamilton, women action stars successfully crafted without adhering to fantastical notions dictated by the male gaze. The whole narrative thrust is the aggressive action a band of women takes in reclaiming their rights over their own bodies, creating a ripple effect of metaphoric interpretations for the continuation of mankind in the film’s post-apocalyptic universe. The cadre of sex-worker/breeders tend to be represent the film’s wobblier moments of characterization. Miller makes impressive use of pouty beauties like Rosie Huntington-Whiteley and Riley Keough, but Zoe Kravitz can’t quite manage to chew on her pulpy dialogue in quite the same fashion. Tom Hardy is a winning ascension to the throne of Max, here given the last name, officially, of Rockatansky, though those unfamiliar with the earlier trio of Mel Gibson films learn little of him except he’s lost his family to the cruel circumstances of a not-so-brave, dangerous new world. In essence, Mad Max: Fury Road is a bombastic, breathless, two hour chase sequence. Miller innovatively spins a furious environment filled with disgustingly realized villains, as the memorable leader, Immorten Joe, played by Hugh Keas-Byrne, who was also a villain in Mad Max. Given the budget and creative control to fashion his craft without studio interference, this is exactly the type of grand cinematic spectacle brimming with passionate, zealous ideas that’s been sorely lacking from the mechanical operations of formulaic tent poles. Warner Bros. presents their hot property in high definition, 2.4:1. The booming soundtrack, part of the film’s matchless experience, is in 5.1 Dolby Digital, though some of the immersive qualities are obviously not comparable to seeing the film theatrically (and as one of the more arguably appropriate releases using 3D technology). Miller coaxed DoP John Seale out of retirement (they worked together on the 1994 film Lorenzo’s Oil) to create a visually striking, continually bristling film. Thankfully, Warner Bros. also included minimal special features. Maximum Fury – Filming Fury Road:
This half hour segment features Miller and the cast discussing the making of the film. Miller discusses collapsing action and dialogue into one sequence, while production designer Colin Gibson reveals the film to have been drawn out in storyboard (which we see several of) before it was actually written. Mad Max – Fury on Four Wheels:
A twenty minute feature focuses specifically on the cars and engines used in the making of the film, many described as masterpieces, and all having one thing in common – they’re incredibly loud and powerful. The Road Warriors – Max and Furiosa:
This eleven minute bit revolves around Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron speaking of their experiences, how they approached their characters, working on set and collaborating with Miller, who raves about his lead actors. The Five Wives – So Shiny, So Chrome:
An eleven minute feature finds the actresses playing the five wives speaking of their characterizations and their relationship to the villainous Immorten Joe. Fury Road – Crash & Smash:
Four minutes of pre-production video tests are show with significant warning that none of the raw footage has been enhanced by CGI. Needless to say, it’s quite impressive. Though plenty are bound to dismiss its achievements on the heels of its critical wave of approval and overall box office success (it nearly reached four hundred million worldwide gross), George Miller has proven to be a continually exciting visionary auteur. Mad Max: Fury Road aims to overwhelm with his onslaught of beautiful images laced with treachery and brutality—and it succeeds.

"Jul 17, 2020",positive," Mad Max: Fury Road is set in a post apocalyptic future where humanity has lost hope and people fight for the basic necessities of life, under the rule of Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne).  Two rebels in the form of Max Rockatansky (Tom Hardy) and Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) lead the fightback for hope and order in a world turned mad. My friend asked me how I was going to write this up as a review.  I replied “I need a couple of days to let that sink in so I can form words!” Mad Max: Fury Road is exactly what it needed to be.  The pace is relentless – as soon as the film begins you’re projected into the high octane world of the wastelands. The plot is wafer thin with minimum dialogue, playing out like a silent movie surrounded by carnage.  In any other film, this would have been a massive criticism but this film gets away with it for good measure and reasons.  It lives in the moment, not dwelling on the backstory of how the world came to be or Max’s past.  It keeps things refreshingly simple. Everything about this film represents why I love going to the cinema.  It’s a feeling I haven’t lost since I was a child.  Visiting a cinema can be a magical experience where a film can transport you to another world where the impossible is possible.  Mad Max: Fury Road has that in abundance.  Visually it presents to you an old school nostalgia, a time where practical effects ruled over computer generated effects.  Before I open the debate, there is nothing wrong with computer generated effects.  Done correctly and it enhances the film.  Done badly and it will appear fake and cartoonish.  If I had to put a percentage on this film, 90% of Mad Max was done practically.  In today’s modern Hollywood where every film is interwoven and connected with shared universes, it’s unheard of and it plays in the film’s benefit. There are some crazy, mind-blowing stunts where you’ll wonder how it was achieved and it adds to the intense realism.  Every collision or crash on screen, you don’t doubt it, you believe it.  You feel it.  In a post apocalyptic world, forget Formula 1 and their DRS or Fast and Furious and their turbo/nitro charges.  In a Mad Max world, it’s just you, your guts, your guile and the machine you drive in.  It’s a driving film in its purest form.  If Fast and Furious 7 is like watching Top Gear on steroids, then Mad Max: Fury Road is like watching Top Gear on every conceivable drug known to mankind. The action is beautifully and bravely choreographed.  Just like Dredd or The Raid where the action is no holds barred, each action sequence performs like a domino effect dance where one thing leads to another and another, gradually building up to the spectacle such as the sand storm.  The whole thing is brutally chaotic and at times comedic but you can’t stop watching.  I’m glad the film had some fade to blacks moments or the audience would just stop breathing! Cars are a sign of power and the bigger it is, the more significant you are.  Nothing goes to waste as each vehicle is a metal rusting mash-up with another vehicle, creating a new beast altogether. The cars are also worshipped especially for the War Boys.  They proudly hold their steering wheels in the air as they head for battle.  They make a symbolic hand gesture to cement their commitment to their leader and their trip to Valhalla, a heaven where they can live forever after dying in glorious death. But the cult is feeble which Nux (Nicholas Hoult) questions during the course of the film.  The War Boys endlessly sacrifice themselves (kamikaze style) for a leader with his own corrupt game.  Because Nux doesn’t get the ending he desires, the principles of the faith start to crumble when it’s put under scrutiny. It’s a society that is broken with humanity on its last knees.  Immortan Joe and his War Boys are at the top of the pyramid and the rest are dependant on their services.  Joe hoards water and food in the Citadel to keep people desperate because the needs of humanity gives him the power to do what he wants, hence his line about resenting its absence if the people became addicted to water. But it’s also a world that is sick and toxic.  The War Boys are seen with nasal cannulas.  Immortan Joe’s face mask doubles up as a breathing mask.  His broken body is assembled together with body kit like Darth Vader.  Nux has cancerous tumours on his shoulders and has nicknames for them. Alliances also play their part, especially in the long chase and hunt for the escapees.  Joe has dealings with Gas Town (for petrol) and Bullet Town (ammunitions) to keep up their ongoing pace. But I don’t look at Mad Max: Fury Road having a feminist agenda.  I see it as a film about liberation, to break free of oppression and rule – a classic sci-fi ideology. Tom Hardy’s performance as Max is different from his predecessor, Mel Gibson.  Whether you’re familiar with the Mad Max story or not, this new interpretation and his struggles are more subtle and internal than spoken.  His performance is more physical.  When he’s captured against his will, he becomes a blood bag for the War Boys.  All Max wants to do is find peace in the new world but with a man with nothing to lose, he can succumb to the madness in order to survive.  This is perfectly illustrated in one brilliant scene where he simply walks off into the desert only to return moments later with a blanket full of guns and blood all over his face. But the outstanding performance goes to Charlize Theron as Furiosa.  She defies her master in order to escape his rule and takes his breeder wives along for the ride.  She seeks redemption and wants to return home.  In the quieter moments of the film, she provides the emotional heart especially when she discovers what happened to her home. Mad Max: Fury Road should be celebrated for its strong role reversal.  Furiosa is the lead in this film but there is a definite balance between Max and Furiosa and their shared empathy.  They are equals, looking for the same thing and that quality separates them from the animals.  Furiosa is not a sidekick or a damsel in distress.  She can take care of her own, without conforming to a stereotype. Theron delivers the most complete, well rounded and realistic character since Ripley was first introduced in Alien.  It also puts an end to the myth that female characters can’t hold their own in a big budget movie.  It’s a positive representation of women being survivors at the end of the world.  That’s definitely not a negative or a criticism or in some circles why the film should be boycotted – it’s a refreshing change from what we normally expect out of a summer blockbuster film. The film may be simple in its premise but it has enough intelligence without spoon feeding information.  The characters accept the world they live in and so does the audience. Films like Mad Max: Fury Road do not come along often.  Director George Miller delivers an epic and visual cinema art film that celebrates survival and hope in a bleak and deranged universe. If you can see it again, try an IMAX screening. Trust me, you won’t regret it! Favourite moments from the film? The flame throwing guitar man sticks out."
"Jul 5, 2020",positive,"Wall-to-wall visceral action, insane practical stunts, highly stylized production, with a thoughtful take on the apocalypse."
"Jul 3, 2020",positive," While talking to a friend recently I happened to mention how I was more excited about the new “Mad Max” than I was for a new “Star Wars.” He was surprised by that. I told him that while I will always be a huge “Star Wars” fan, I still have some residual disappointment over the prequels. Over the past 35 years, on the other hand, “Mad Max” has never let me down. Now that “Fury Road” has arrived, I have been lifted to a whole new level of excitement, adoration and respect. Post-apocalyptic road warrior Max Rockatansky (Tom Hardy) has been captured by the War Boys, the white-skinned, radiation-sickened minions of Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne). Immortan Joe is the warlord of an area of towering cliffs known as The Citadel, where he controls his people with small rations of what he calls Aqua Cola, clean water he pumps up from underground. Max being a universal blood donor makes him very valuable as a blood bag to help reinvigorate any War Boys who are feeling the effects of their sickness. On this day, Immortan Joe is sending an armored semi, called a War Rig, to the neighboring Gas Town and the Bullet Farm to trade water for the respective supplies their names suggest. The driver, Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron), has other plans for the Rig. She has helped Immortan Joe’s 5 breeder wives escape and is taking them to her old home, The Green Place. Immortan Joe gathers a posse of War Boys to chase after Furiosa. One of his drivers, Nux (Nicholas Hoult), is hooked up to the Max blood bag. Since he still needs the strength Max’s blood is providing, but he refuses to give up the driver seat to anyone else, he has Max strapped to the front of his vehicle as he launches full throttle down the Fury Road. “Fury Road” is the literal definition of controlled chaos. It’s an amazing, full-tilt assault on the senses. This incarnation of Max is truly mad, seeing visions and hearing voices, most specifically of his dead child. His experiences on his own in the vast wasteland have shaped him into a crazy, yet cautious, man of few words but meaningful actions. He is definitely out for himself, but not so self-centered that he can’t recognize strength in others. To this end, Max really isn’t the main character; Furiosa is. Just like in “The Road Warrior,” Max is more of a device, something the other characters use to help them in their cause. Furiosa might have been able to achieve her goal without him, but her chances improve dramatically with Max along for the ride. George Miller has written and directed all of the “Mad Max” films. While it has been 30 years since the last entry, “Beyond Thunderdome,” Miller tackles “Fury Road” like it has only been two or three. You get the impression that over the past three decades he has written down every random Mad Max-style stunt piece that has come to his mind, and he has put every single one of them into this film. Under normal circumstances that could make a movie feel bloated, but not in Miller’s capable hands. Even more amazing than the stunts is the fact that there is very little CGI work. Every wild vehicle, usually amalgams of several different kinds, actually works and are really flying across the desert. It’s such a glorious sight. So glorious, in fact, that I highly recommend shelling out the extra dough and seeing this in 3D. I don’t normally do this, knowing that people have so many different opinions about the technology, but this is probably the first film in this new era of digital 3D that is worthy of the gimmick. Or, rather, the gimmick is worthy of the film. Miller uses 3D the way it was conceived to be used, with several gags that made me flinch as car chunks and bodies flew toward me. He even rewards us with a fun, traditional gag, a kind of throwback (throw-forward?) one, right at the climax. “Fury Road” isn’t all fury, though. There is a strong story under all the mayhem. Furiosa is a very deep and flawed character, maybe even a little more than Max. There’s a moment when her story is revealed that actually got me a touch choked up, which is more testament to the directing talents of George Miller. This is the man who also gave us “Babe,” after all. I can go on and on, but it would all basically boil down this one truth: “Mad Max: Fury Road” is the most brilliant piece of mayhem to ever hit the screen. Period.

"Apr 9, 2020",positive,"Mad Max: Fury Road will be the film to beat for a long time coming, and the new high-water mark against which to judge action and blockbuster filmmaking. This is, quite simply, how it's done."
"Jan 10, 2020",positive,"It's a rare film that engages the mind while rocking the body. Miller's vision of a world consumed by its own greed, where water, gasoline, and bullets are the most precious commodities, seems even more relevant today than it did 30 years ago."
"Dec 3, 2019",positive," It grabs you from its frenetic opening scene, sinking its teeth into your neck, wrapping its pulsating tendrils around your heart, stealing your breath and gripping your balls in a vice-like grasp — if you have balls, that is. Mad Max: Fury Road is a cacophony of beautiful violence, a turbo-charged chase scene that plays out over two glorious hours, as close to riding a rollercoaster you can experience while sitting in a movie theater. Yes, I might sound like Peter Travers with this hyperbolic adulation, but I can’t help it. This new Mad Max film just might be the best action film we’ve ever seen. It will certainly be the one to beat in this summer season loaded with the usual suspects of sequels, reboots and destruction porn. How can I condemn destruction porn when Fury Road is more or less a non-stop orgy of explosions, car wrecks and hand-to-hand combat? That’s because, unlike the Marvel films currently polluting the multiplexes like Stepford Wives in their cookie-cutter plots and safe scripts where death is temporary and destruction without human cost, there is plenty at stake in Fury Road. Set in the same post-apocalyptic world as the first three Mad Max films, Fury Road features Tom Hardy stepping into the role made famous by Mel Gibson. But unlike Gibson’s character, Hardy’s Max actually seems legitimately insane. It’s a fact we learn right away, Jack, as he chews on a lizard and hallucinates about the people (presumably family members) he was unable to save. Unlike many reboots, which give a hot, young director a chance to fuck up a franchise, Fury Road was written and directed by George Miller, the man whose name is attached to the previous three Mad Max films. But if you look at Miller’s recent credits you get two Happy Feet films and a Babe sequel. WTF? Who knew Miller had such a virtuosic ballet of blood and ultra-violence left in him? But here’s the thing, Fury Road is more than an exciting, mindless bacchanal of gore and scorched earth. When we first meet Max, he is captured and brought to a horrific citadel ruled by the masked warlord Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), where he is tortured, branded and enslaved. Max is largely kept out of the action during the first third of the film, bound in chains and used as a living blood transfusion for Nux (Nicholas Hoult), one of Immortan Joe’s bald, white-skinned War Boys, a gang of twitchy psychos just waiting for their moment to go down in a blaze of glory. See, Immortan Joe is one evil dude who rules his kingdom by controlling the only water around. But things are about to change. With Max under lock and key, Miller introduces us to Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron), a one-armed road warrior tasked by Immortan Joe to make a supply run to another settlement. However, Furiosa has plans of her own, and soon after she goes rogue, Immortan Joe and his War Boys create a flotilla of trucks and cars, primed for battle and ready to blow the shit out of her ass. “Who killed the world?” someone asks at the beginning of the film. As Furiosa’s mission becomes clear, so does the answer to that question: men. The introduction of women characters is a stroke of genius here, one that pushes Fury Road into the position of best film in the Mad Max series. Unlike the men, broken or pushed into insanity by this new world order, Miller’s female characters express hope of a world reborn. The symbolism may be obvious, but it works. Fury Road wouldn’t have worked if it wasn’t so damned beautiful. Miller, along with writers Nick Lathouris and Brendan McCarthy (a comics artist), mapped out the entire film in storyboard and makes a glorious leap to the screen. Nothing looks fake, there is no shoddy-looking CGI filling in the spaces. This is a terrible world, a place of vast deserts, looming sandstorms and barren mountains. There is something striking in its awfulness. But unlike this broken world, you will leave Mad Max: Fury Road feeling invigorated, squirming with life. This is action filmmaking at its finest. Early Water doesn’t have much of an arc — after all, it’s a rehearsal tape. But it does have a surprisingly plentiful array of textures and transitions within its somewhat narrow parameters. "
"Oct 27, 2019",positive," You hear every little speck of sand shaking loose from his body from his head downward. Every sound is intensified tenfold until Hardy’s character stands tall and comes to his senses.  For those unfamiliar with ""Mad Max,"" ""Fury Road"" is the fourth installment in the George Miller franchise which started in 1979 with Mel Gibson. Without too many spoilers, in the original, Max Rockatansky was a patrol officer in a dystopian Australia, before he lost everything of value to him. His further adventures involve putting others lives ahead of his own. The entirety is a delicious assault on both your visual cortex and auditory system — a giant orchestral blend of machine engines roaring and wheels peeling combined with a booming overture of drums and guitar. 
There’s a short leg of the film where everyone is cast in a soft blue gradient. It’s like watching the film under a filter, and it’s beautiful.  
                          
                        Staying true to the character, Hardy’s Max doesn’t say much — often speaking in grunts or with simple gestures — but he doesn’t need to. The smallest movement of his eyes or gestures do the talking. Most of the time, he’s a terrifying badass who eats lizards raw and can take down a pack of men single-handedly without blinking an eye.  
Both he and Theron’s Imperator Furiosa (one of many lavish names in the film) are a ragged tag-team of warriors who you can’t get enough of on screen. 
You know who I’m talking about if you’ve seen the trailers — the wild guitarist playing his own personal concert atop a spectacular Macy’s Day Parade-like vehicle. Every time he comes on screen, you can’t help but grin because it’s so utterly over the top that it’s just another welcome addition to the mixed bag of eccentric characters on display. One thing that may surprise you given the film's testosterone-heavy marketing in trailers is that it’s driven by a female-centric storyline. Going in with little expectations having only watched the first “Mad Max,” I was ready for an all-out bro-movie filled with car chases, brawls, and mindless fun. While you certainly get all of that, you get a bit more, too, and it’s refreshingly welcome.  
While the movie clocks in at two hours, it feels like it goes on for longer, and it’s one of the rare times you won’t think that’s a bad thing. Imagine a gorgeously wild and hellish “Wacky Races” meets “Twisted Metal” (replace the scary clown face from the popular game with Max’s Immortan Joe). Numerous parties engage in combat — some hanging from wiry poles that would make Cirque du Soleil members jealous.
                          
                        For the final 30 minutes or so, I surrendered myself to the film, dropping my pad and pen with which I usually jot down notes to claw nervously into my cheeks and the back of my neck, awaiting the uncertain fate of our film’s protagonists over a majestic desert car battle. "
"Oct 21, 2019",positive," When I bought my ticket to see Mad Max: Fury Road, I had never seen a single Mad Max movie in my life. I knew it was an Australian dystopian franchise from the 80’s starring Mel Gibson, and had a substantial cult following, but not much else. So when I eased into my seat, I was pretty unprepared for the visual and thematic feast about to unfold before me. Like its predecessors, Fury Road is set in a grim desert wasteland where water and oil are scarce. Pockets of surviving humans are desperate for resources and power, and nobody has more of either than Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne). Things kick into high gear when Furiosa (Charlize Theron, Dark Places), a mysterious lieutenant in Joe’s army, is sent across the desert to fetch oil. Joe discovers that Furiosa has broken his five “wives” free from their prison and stowed them in her oil rig. Max is thrown into the action when his captors engage in a massive desert chase against Furiosa, who is bound and determined to reach an oasis called “The Green Place.” If Max seems like a bit of a footnote here, he is. Furiosa and the women are the heart and soul of Fury Road, championing female life and autonomy into something that could have easily been a popcorn flick for bros. When Max joins the women on their rig, initially self-preservation is his only goal. But these women, two of whom are pregnant, show him what it means to want survival - not only for yourself but for your children and a future world as well. It’s not a perfect movie, or one that’s universally appealing. Nearly the whole two-hours is a car chase, which can be tiring if you’re not into that sort of film. Tom Hardy (The Revenant) delivers a somewhat vague performance; at times it’s not easy to engage with his character. The action is continuous, the roars loud, and the explosions vivid. But on the whole, Fury Road impresses and surprises more than almost any other 2015 release (as evidenced by its 6 Oscar wins). Movie nerds, especially, will be thrilled to watch the energy and prowess of incredible stunt performers. Casual filmgoers will be delighted to see the tactile grit of real choreography and real explosions after a decade of shiny computer-generated stunts in almost every other action flick. But Mad Max suffers from none of these rookie mistakes; it truly knows how to “show, not tell.” We aren’t told why Furiosa has a mechanical arm, but we understand that she’s a warrior who realised she wants to fight for life instead of slavery. We don’t need definitions of the terms “Valhalla” or “blood bag” or the history of Gas Town and its relationship to the Citadel. We’re swept up in the chase, the fights, the conversations, and we’re told just enough to keep us engrossed. At the end of the night, Fury Road offers us a well-made, tightly-written critique of greed, oppression, and dehumanisation. It may be a bumpy ride, but it’s a ride like you’ve never taken before.

"Aug 2, 2019",positive," The Last Black Man in San Francisco: I thought this would be a story of gentrification; it’s sort of that, but mostly something stranger and more haunting. Jimmie Fails (played by an actor of the same name, who also co-wrote with his childhood friend Joe Talbot) is obsessed with the house he grew up in, which has passed into the hands of a white couple. With his best friend Mont (Jonathan Majors) he visits the house and engages in guerrilla upkeep; when the white couple breaks up and moves out, they squat there as they try to figure out whether they can buy the house for real. The house is gorgeous, from its painted ceilings to its witch-hat tower room, and you’ll want these two guys to succeed in their Comrade Quixote quest–but at a certain point you may notice that this is all about the ownership of stuff. When the two friends begin to put their plan in motion the first thing we see is them walking down a flight of steps flanked by two columns of homeless people. The hunger Jimmie feels for specific, highly-symbolic land and furniture begins to feel clutching, unsettling, misplaced; and believe me, the film will pay off on that tremor of doubt. This is a film about two guys who have not succeeded by conventional standards. They don’t have wives or girlfriends; they don’t have kids; they don’t own the home they’re illegally sharing. (If you keep a running tally of the kinds of places poor people can live, this movie will leave you with a double-digit list: SRO, group home, abandoned house, your car; somebody else’s car….) They do have one another, and their friendship is portrayed with such sweetness. At one point the camera draws an extremely unsubtle parallel between these two best friends and a straight couple. This is the friendship of two artsy guys who feel alone in the world, without city or community, homeless except when they’re with each other. And the fact that the final shots of the film show one of the friends rowing a boat out on the unresting waves of the Pacific Ocean, and then rowing the boat offscreen so only the waves are left, may suggest that this world doesn’t let you keep what you salvage. There are many, many semisatirical moments in this highly theatrical film, like the tourist party bus blasting “Somebody to Love” as it rolls past the naked guy waiting at the bus stop. The portrayal of San Francisco’s cuckoo aspect helped me deal with the fact that the movie’s climax is an act of political theater/nonconsensual audience participation. Maybe that is just how people in SF express emotions? There’s a lot in this movie which spoke to me, especially in its unexpected twists and moments. I’m not sure I’ve seen another film where the relationships which compete with the central friendship are not romantic relationships, but relationships with your family of origin. I loved the quiet, nerdy-kid humility with which Mont says, when Jimmie catches him drawing portraits of the dudes who just insulted him, “I shouldn’t get to appreciate them ’cause they’re mean to me? That’s silly.” This is a movie about the search for a home–the inability to find it where you thought you’d left it; maybe the inability to find it at all. There’s a lot to say about the politics of gentrification, but in this film gentrification is a synecdoche for a universal condition of exile. Mad Max: Fury Road: On a very different note… this kicked. So okay, I’d avoided this when it came out because I made the mistake of being on social media, even a little, and found the whole *~*discourse*~* of “Is this a good film because it’s feminist??? Or is it a bad film because it’s feminist???” so dumb and depleting. Started to feel like the people who liked it only liked it because it wasn’t something they resent, not because it was something awesome. It’s something awesome. It’s all hot orange and brown, the glamor of the punishing desert wind, it is completely OTT and it can’t go five minutes without an explosion and I loved it. The dialogue is often dumb in a way I don’t enjoy, but fortunately there’s little dialogue overall. One of my very favorite genres is “batshit pleasure-idiocy for the bad sweet tooth + genuine harrowing emotion,” and Fury Road is a classic of that vertiginous genre. You’ll feel things! You’ll respect these characters, you’ll love them and want their hard world not to break their spirits, and you’ll also get to cheer while they fight dudes on GIANT FREAKING BENDY POLES WITH FLAMETHROWERS. It’s so good. Lots of just very smart choices, in a movie which is also pure dumb pleasure. The mistrust and violence between our two heroes (MAX ROCKATANSKY and IMPERATOR FURIOSA, because this movie loves its audience with a swooning, surrendering love) is a smart choice. The fact that they meet an all-women’s community but it’s neither secret dystopia nor pacifist Earth Mother solution to their problems is a smart choice. The whole weird sad thing with Nux is a smart choice. The fact that the dictator’s army has a bard, and it’s A DUDE STRAPPED TO A WAR TRUCK WITH AN ELECTRIC GUITAR THAT SHOOTS FIRE, is… sure, okay, it is a smart choice. In general I pretty much loved all the people strapped to trucks. It’s such an immediate visual symbol for helplessness and complicity, and it makes the fights weird and unexpected. The heart of this movie is a scene in which Max gives freely what was taken from him by force; it’s a genuinely beautiful, hard-earned portrayal of sacrifice as an assertion of one’s humanity."
"Jul 30, 2019",positive," I don’t want to review Mad Max: Fury Road. I want to write love letters to it or draw it like one of those French girls. If I could find the right keystroke combination, this review would just be one long onomatopoetic recreation of the feral roar of approval bellowed from deep within my bosom as the credits rolled. They’ve called it a “game-changer,” a “masterpiece” and a “work of genius,” but none of those capture the totality of what writer/director George Miller has done here. It deserves some new term, some unique series of letters fused together by explosions underneath a desert sun. I don’t know? Maxcellent. There you go: It’s Maxcellent. It’s been asked “Is this a sequel to the other Mad Max movies? A prequel? A remake?” Shhh. Don’t you worry your pretty head about that none. You just keep your eyes on that extra fiery fire and characters with names like “Rictus Erectus” and “Toast the Knowing.” The film is set some time in the future when earth is almost uninhabitable, so given the Senate’s recent denial that climate change is a thing, at least 2016. Lone wolf Max (Tom Hardy) is grabbed by goons who serve Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), a decrepit and bloated monster who rules over a group of survivors. The entirety of the plot is Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) trying to escape with five of Joe’s sex slave brides and Max’s reluctant help. That’s it. Literally, there is no more plot. This isn’t to say that the film isn’t speaking volumes. Hell, it’s not even speaking: it’s shouting and screaming over a wailing guitar riff. The brides scrawl graffiti in the dungeon they escaped, reading “We are not things” and “Who killed the world? (riverbendgolfcomplex.com) ” The latter has a clear answer:  Dudes. Dudes killed the world. Unchecked masculinity killed civilization. Joe’s vile kingdom is the furthest point in testosterone-fueled evolution: Men are solely bred for war, women are disposable resources. Enter Furiosa. With one metal arm, no hair and so much bad-ass nobody else can have any, Furiosa is a human axe born to lop the head off the top of the patriarchy. She is powerful without surrendering her desired femininity and one of the greatest action heroes ever. Miller pulled off one of the boldest funding stunts, convincing the studio this was a Mad Max movie when Max is window dressing in a leather jacket, there simply to look cool. Fury Road is violence as opera; it is car chases as visual poetry. The stunning physical and practical effects trump any and all computer-generated tomfoolery. Your eyes literally can’t consume all that’s happening, flicking back and forth like nightmare-fueled REM sleep. Miller’s magnum opus is proof a film can be fueled by meaningful social subtext and still kick ass. It’s evidence that all-out action need not be reduced to “dumb fun.” It’s a reminder that computers can never, will never, be able to out-adrenaline real stuntpeople doing real stunts. It’s brilliant. It’s glorious. It is Maxcellent."
"Jul 16, 2019",neutral,"Fury Road seems aimed at dudes who fetishize chrome and steel, but Miller plants seeds of bolder, more incendiary ideas within the bro-fantasy."
"Jul 5, 2019",positive,"The sheer sustained energy of this thing is breathtaking, and Miller's singular vision is a thing of brutal beauty."
"Jun 3, 2019",negative," It’s a world gone mad in Mad Max: Fury Road, and director George Miller wastes no time establishing the no holds barred, kill or be killed state of living in his post-apocalyptic vision. A brief montage of sound clips outlining civilization’s downfall plays before Max Rockatansky (Tom Hardy) shows up, looking over a desert wasteland before fleeing in his car. He’s chased down and captured by a few “War Boys,” devout followers and henchmen of Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne). Joe is the cultlike leader of The Citadel, a desert city where he controls the oil, water and food supply. He’s barely living, with most of his body made up of machinery designed to keep him alive, and he rules over his impoverished masses with no mercy. Just as Max is taken prisoner, Joe sends out his War Rig (a massive truck/war machine) to get gasoline from their supplier. The truck is driven by Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron), whose shaved head and black war paint immediately establish her as someone not to be messed with. She drives off, but at a certain point makes an unexpected detour. Joe and his minions soon realize that Furiosa has taken Joe’s five young wives (called “breeders,” for reasons that should be obvious), and his only chances at getting a male heir, with her, prompting Joe to chase her down with everything he’s got. And with that, Mad Max: Fury Road starts its nearly two hour long car chase, with Furiosa and her five companions driving across the desert in the hopes of escaping Joe’s fast-approaching army of cars and War Boys. Max winds up tagging along with Nux (Nicholas Hoult), a dying War Boy hoping he can go out in a blaze of glory. It’s hard not to see the onslaught of marketing for Mad Max: Fury Road and believe that the film will represent some sort of transgressive alternative to the usual homogeneous pile of tentpoles unleashed every summer. Fury Road only delivers on that promise to some degree; the production design offers plenty of neat things to gawk at, implying there’s plenty more to this world than what’s on screen, and the minimal exposition is a breath of fresh air. What’s disappointing is how much of Miller’s film feels familiar and formulaic. It’s the same old story, just dressed up in a spiky, oversaturated outfit. It’s not that Miller is just copying and pasting another film’s plot—I’m having a hard time thinking of any other movies where ghoulish men hunt down their leader’s pregnant sex slaves. The familiarity comes from the structure and story beats, which emulate what’s been done plenty of times before: character development and themes boiled down to one word statements (survival for Max, redemption for Furiosa), a romantic subplot with no bearing on anything, a second act tragedy putting our protagonists’ success in doubt, and a “crazy” last minute plan acting as a transition into the final act and climax. And when your film literally moves down a straight line through a flat, two-colour landscape, a lack of variety will drag things down considerably. Action films with a simple, one-track mindset can be far from a bad thing (both The Raid: Redemption and Dredd are great, recent examples of the KISS principle in action), but Fury Road never successfully establishes any stakes. It’s easy to know where and how things will end up, and for that reason it’s easy to detach from the onscreen spectacle. There’s a point in the climactic car chase where Furiosa comes face-to-face with Joe, and angrily says “Remember me?!” It’s played as a cool, kick-ass moment, but I found it a strange thing to say, considering this is the first time both characters actually share the screen together. There’s no weight or purpose to this moment, but it falls in line with the expectations and structure of an action film, so it has to be there. That safeness, that feeling of Miller eccentrically colouring within the lines, is Fury Road’s downfall. It’s a world gone mad, but this film is anything but."
"May 10, 2019",positive," Its brutal war-torn world, built on the liquid viscera of blood, milk and oil, is a dystopia; but the future that Max (Hardy) and Furiosa (Theron) are fighting for feels gloriously utopian. It’s not just the visuals – a fire and brimstone hellscape conjured by Miller and DoP John Seale – that feel shockingly new, but the film’s politics. Fury Road is righteously, emphatically feminist and it feels so, so good; this is what action filmmaking – hell, all filmmaking – has been missing for so long. Theron’s thunderous performance leads the charge, in this film that steals your breath and boils your blood. What the cast and crew have achieved is rare and precious. Cherish it."
"Apr 26, 2019",positive," When I saw the trailer for Mad Max Fury Road I was positive it would be one I couldn’t see.  I don’t like violent films and it looked like a gory, violent mess.  However, I always go through my process I describe for evaluating movie content in How to Be Mormon and Like Movies. I look at reviews, the detailed content summaries on screenit.com and I ask friends who have seen the movie.  To my surprise I found it to have virtually no profanity and to not be as violent as I anticipated. It is an R but most of that is more battle like violence, some nudity and vehicular battles. Convinced it was within my comfort level I decided to go check it out . It’s a very tricky movie to review because it does what it is trying to do masterfully well. I don’t know how that can be debated.  Whether such a master work is your cup of tea is another question. It’s certainly not a movie I will be frequently rewatching but I did think it was good and engaged me more than I would have guessed. All in all it is a success and I can see why many people love it. I have not seen the original Mad Max movies because I always figured they were too violent so perhaps I will give them a watch.  This Mad Max doesn’t have much of  plot. It’s one action sequence after another.  It does not try to have symbolism or a puzzle like a Nolan film might have.  It doesn’t have a strong lead character like a Bond film.  The title is perhaps a misnomer because Mad Max has only a few lines of dialogue and is an ensemble player with Charlize Theron and others. Basically the plot that does exist starts out with setting.  It is a desert post-apocalyptic world that is ruled by a man named the Immortan Joe.  Max has been arrested and is forced to be a blood bag for a War Boy played by Nicholas Hoult.  Charlize Theron is Furiosa who abducts 5 of Joe’s wives called the breeders. The rest of the movie is Max, Furiosa and crew getting chased by Joe and having intense battles with each other.  Each of the cars is so imaginative with one even being a giant speaker system with a guy playing an electric guitar.  There are cars that have long poles for people to swing onto other cars.  There are rigs with gasoline and others covered in spikes. It keeps the action exciting because you don’t know how the cars work and how the fight will play out. For not speaking much Tom Hardy is good as Mad Max.  But the movie doesn’t give you a lot of time to contemplate his character.  I can’t even imagine how awful it must be to shoot a movie like this with all the dust and dirt but he is convincing as the stoic anti-hero. The CG is kept to a minimum and it at least appears to have a lot of practical effects. The stunt work is flawless.  I wonder how much Hardy and others did of their own stunts? Whatever the percentage is by professionals you definitely can’t tell.  It feels earthy and real which we haven’t seen in an action film in a long time. I loved how Mad Max handled its female characters.  It reminds me a little bit of Emily Blunt in Edge of Tomorrow.  These are not cliched warrior women or damsels in distress.  Even the breeder women are relatively complex especially for this kind of movie.   Charlize Theron is amazing! She is tough but has heart and there is a moment that is completely devastating for her and she sells it. There are different kind of women- old women, young women, pregnant women and they all defy female tropes.  The last thing I expected in a movie like this is an awesome group of women and it definitely helped sell me on the film.
Hugh Keays-Byrne is good as the villain Immortan Joe but most of that credit has to go to his costume and mask. There is such attention to detail.  The amount of time that must have been spent to get teeth right, skin layered and dry, lips cracked, everything covered in dust is mind blowing.  The makeup on the war boys including Nicholas Hoult is very convincing.  They are brainwashed to believe if they are obedient servants to Joe they will achieve immortality at the gates of heaven. Mad Max Fury Road is not a movie that gives the audience much time to breathe.  There is very little dialogue and I did feel kind of exhausted by the end of it. But then again I feel like it was trying to do something completely different and new and from a comic book guy like George Miller it makes sense it is primarily a visual spectacle.  Still, it pushed me to my limit of apocalyptic car battle sequences (who knew I had such a limit? 😉 ).  I’m a little surprised it is so universally loved because I would think a few people might be bothered by the thin plot and lack of character development? I guess they just accept it for what it is- a new dazzling creative vision of what a war movie looks like.  After all do we complain that the villains in a WW2 movie aren’t fleshed out enough? Do we want more dialogue in our John Wayne war movie? No.  Same with this.  It is visually incredible and the action is immersive enough to carry the day. Like I said, the women put it over the hump for me to a strong recommendation.  It was such a pleasant surprise and I bet you could see the movie and not even notice most of the women.  They are just characters in the movie like anybody else.  It looks gorgeous.  The action sequences are stunning and I was entertained. As far as content it has some nudity from a distance and women are milked like cows in one brief shot.  Characters are stabbed, impaled, tortured and shot in the battle scenes.  Another you see briefly has his face ripped off from a mask. A lot of crashes, explosions and sand storms that are intense.  A woman has a c-section mostly off screen and an IV is seen being inserted.  I know it sounds crazy but its actually more tame than you might think.  No language.  Mostly it is a lot of cars and broad fighting like a battle than one on one violence like you might get in a horror movie. Also the music by a guy named Junkie XL was outstanding with a great combination of electric guitar, medal sounds and a traditional sweeping score. Oh well.  Can’t make everyone happy.  I liked that it really wasn’t a girl power movie. If it had been a bunch of cliched warrior women I would have hated that. At least to me they were just normal characters doing awesome things.  It’s not like there was some big moment where the movie wanted you to applaud the tough women.  The action scenes are fast and non-stop and it just happens to be that a lot of the fighters are women.  I’m amazed anyone would have a problem with that.  So lame.  I find it hard to believe men would really complain about the female characters… I think the super feminists make that up in order to conjure up an adversary or something. Feminism is great.. but like everything in the world.. in moderation."
"Apr 16, 2019",positive,"  	 	Having seen the gobsmackingly over-the-top trailers, I went into ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" worrying that it would be review-proof. And it is, in that my review could consist of me pointing at the screen for 2 hours and going, ""AAAAAAAAARRRRRGGGHHHHHTHISISAMAAAAAAZZZIIINNNG!""  	 	""Fury Road"" jams the pedal to the metal and keeps its foot down for a breakneck 120 minutes of vehicular carnage, a jawdroppingly beautifully painted demolition derby streaked through with humour as dry as the desert in which it's set and hearts as black as the precious ""guzzle-ine"" that fuels it. Cracked lips and sandblasted faces leer from the ochre nightmare of a world fallen to rust, flame blossoms from speeding war rigs, twisted metal and bodies crash and tumble -- the mayhem is viscerally, exhilaratingly real, making the glossy CGI heroics of "" Avengers: Age of Ultron"" look like a Saturday morning cartoon."
"Apr 8, 2019",positive," Chaos reigns in George Miller’s Mad Max: Fury Road (2015), his long-awaited return to the world of his post-apocalyptic Ozplotiation franchise after a thirty-year absence. The budget and the actors may have changed, but this is clearly the evolution of the filmmaker’s crazed vision, arguably reaching the petrol-soaked Valhalla that he’s been striving for since the modest thrills of 1979’s Mad Max. It’s an injection of equal parts adrenaline and gasoline that tosses narrative out of the window and turns the action up to eleven. A flame-spewing guitarist is at the tip of a juggernaut at the vanguard of a fleet of spiked, hellish vehicles that make up the rolling army of Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne, the original film’s Toecutter). He’s the aptly grotesque warlord who breathes through a skull face-mask and keeps imprisoned a coterie of nubile breeding wives in the hope of a healthy heir. His general Imperator Furiosa (the hugely impressive Charlize Theron) has turned cloak, however, commandeering one of his War Rigs and liberating his wives. Immortan Joe and his War Boys (including Nicholas Hoult’s Nux) give chase across the baking Namib Desert – replacing the arid expanse of the Aussie Outback – after the runaways who have fellow ex-prisoner Max (Tom Hardy) riding shotgun. Far from being the set-up, that is effectively the entire plot. For Fury Road is that rare thing, an incredibly lean and gloriously overblown actioner. The acrobatics lie not in storytelling or in theme, but in the lurching crunch and twisted steel of high-octane vehicular mayhem. And the flames, oh the flames. Every pursuing wagon or War Boy decked in tribal paint and cultish zeal that Furiosa and Max manage to stave off is sent flipping and burning into the sand in spectacular fashion. Nothing is too much, and whilst there is the danger that some will find the unremitting havoc tiresome, Miller’s endless innovation keeps things fresh despite the surrounding wasteland. Max’s position as bystander, foregrounding Theron’s kick-ass heroine, also feels like a cool breeze in the stifling landscape. It may not a unanimous home run – there are still lingering shots of Joe’s scantily-clad harem for eye candy – but it’s certainly hurtling in the right direction. With close-cropped hair and painted with oil, Theron is the beating heart of the film and Furiosa’s character provides the picture with its less literal momentum. Hardy plays Max with typical tough-guy impassivity, grunting his way through the vast majority of the proceedings. There are no witty one-liners – in fact, one could almost compare it to a silent film were it not so deafeningly loud. But that is ultimately what Fury Road is all about. Sound and fury at 100 mph, and it’s one hell of a ride."

"Jan 23, 2019",positive," The restart – saying reboot would be a disservice to the film’s creativity – of the 1979-1985 trilogy that featured a cinematic journey to the post-apocalyptic lunatic fringe is an expertly crafted action film that is taken to another level by the surprising depth of humanity, particularly from Charlize Theron. Tom Hardy, taking Mel Gibson’s former role, plays the title character who gets caught up in a chase between cult leader Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne) and one of his War Rig drivers Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) after she kidnaps his five wives – selected for their breeding. Furiosa is hoping to take the girls to safety in her homeland but must enlist the help of Max when Joe recruits his entire army to stop her and get his wives back. Director and co-writer George Miller, who did the previous three films, does a great job of making “Fury Road” a stand-alone entity in the franchise. One doesn’t need to see any of the previous three films to appreciate the craftsmanship in the creation of this world and the elaborate chase sequences that feature some spectacular stunts and well-choreographed battles. Mad Max might be on the marquee, but this is Furiosa’s movie thanks to Theron. With her head shaven and a stump for a left arm, Theron is in complete kick-ass mode here, an almost motherly approach to protecting the wives that gives the movie a heart and soul. It is perhaps the best female heroine in an action film since Sigourney Weaver’s Ripley in the “Aliens” franchise. Also this week is “Pitch Perfect 2” (B), the follow-up to the 2012 surprise hit that goes back to the well a lot — basically taking the strengths of the original and finding ways to do it again. It’s a risk that hasn’t worked in sequels to movies like “The Hangover,” but the calculated risk pays off here with enough laughs and music to satisfy fans of the original. “Pitch Perfect 2” picks up with the Barden Bellas (a female acappella group at a fictional Barden college) on top of the world – three-time defending national champions and touring throughout the U.S. When a performance for the president takes an unexpected turn, the group is pulled from competition, and the only way to be reinstated for future competitions is by winning the world championship. The story is really secondary to the characters and music, with the talented cast – including Anna Kendrick, Rebel Wilson and Brittany Snow — all returning. Kendrick’s Beca is still charming – even if the plot forces a conflict that seems to serve as a roadblock just for the sake of conflict. I’m not really a fan of Wilson and was afraid her role would be expanded to an annoyance level here, but she works in small doses. There are several new faces – including Hailee Steinfeld as the group’s newest member – and a few fun cameos, but the biggest addition is Elizabeth Banks taking the helm behind the camera. Banks shows poise and confidence as a first-time director and accentuates its strengths. The musical numbers zip, and the one-liners come fast and furious, but Banks reels it all in to a satisfying concoction that fans of the original will surely enjoy. “Pitch Perfect 2” is rated PG-13 for innuendo and language and is now playing at the Regal Bowling Green Stadium 12 and Highland Cinemas in Glasgow."

“My name is Max.”

Those are both the first and final words spoken by Max Rockatansky (Tom Hardy) in Mad Max: Fury Road, the fourth chapter in George Miller’s post-apocalyptic mythology. Max doesn’t say much in Fury Road, partly due to circumstances–a metal grate attached to his face, or intense car chase sequences not suitable for small talk–but mostly due to his character: he is a man of great action and few words. His weary-but-sharp eyes reveal much of the complicated soul inside this weathered road warrior.
 Those are both the first and final words spoken by Max Rockatansky (Tom Hardy) in Mad Max: Fury Road, the fourth chapter in George Miller’s post-apocalyptic mythology. Max doesn’t say much in Fury Road, partly due to circumstances–a metal grate attached to his face, or intense car chase sequences not suitable for small talk–but mostly due to his character: he is a man of great action and few words. His weary-but-sharp eyes reveal much of the complicated soul inside this weathered road warrior. Max is quickly caught up in circumstances beyond his control, captured by a marauding gang from the Citadel, a desert butte-turned-fortress ruled by the depraved Immortan Joe, a disturbing villain who has set himself up as a deity ruling over the War Boys–his gang–and the suffering crowds below his elevated stronghold. When one of Joe’s best warriors/drivers, Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron), takes off with a war rig and his harem of wives used for breeding, it sets off the chase sequence which makes up the bulk of the film. Essentially, Fury Road is an extended chase sequence, with Furiosa and Co. on the run from Joe’s War Boys, various vehicular gangs, and the desert environment itself. Ever the loner, Max finds himself on the side of Furiosa and the liberated women in their search for a hope and redemption in a new, greener home.
 I don’t often make such expansive claims, but I’ll do so here: Mad Max: Fury Road is one of the top 10 action films I’ve ever seen, and even a significant, historic addition to the action pantheon, fitting nicely alongside Die Hard, Hard Boiled, and Terminator 2 as action films that will stand the test of time as influential and groundbreaking. The design, the art direction, the choreography, the cinematography, the story, the world-building–every aspect of Fury Road is exceptional and valuable. There’s not a single wasted scene, and this is the epitome of the motto “show, not tell.” Fury Road is incredibly cinematic, a visual smorgasbord both beautiful and harsh in its palette. The performances are outlandish where they need to be, but often are quietly affecting, especially Theron as Furiosa. She truly is the star of the film, a powerhouse of femininity and strength, and a perfect partner in survival with Max. Filmmaker George Miller can move quickly from elaborate overhead shots of the desert landscape, to intense and gritty action moments alongside the vehicles, to intimate close-ups of the human face, particularly the eyes. This visual rhythm makes Fury Road both intimate and sweeping in scope–it’s both ridiculously huge, and authentically accessible.
 The best word to describe Mad Max: Fury Road is exceptional: uncommon, atypical, remarkable, freakish, outstanding, unique, special. I still cannot believe a Hollywood studio would pay to make this, sending movie stars and inane vehicles into the desert to get blown up. To put it bluntly, Fury Road is batsh*t crazy in the best way possible. Example: one vehicle in Immortan Joe’s war party is essentially a stack of amps and speakers carrying four enormous drums and a blind maniac strapped by bungee cords who plays a flame-throwing electric guitar. If that sounds bizarre, yet intriguing…well, this is Mad Max, a steampunk-meets-Revelation action flick. Also, in a film genre where women are typically relegated to being sex objects or sidekicks–the recent Avengers: Age of Ultron hullabaloo is indicative of this propensity–Fury Road gives women agency, character, significance, and intelligence, all while retaining their femininity. Furiosa and Max are peers and partners; their relationship is no budding romance, but instead is marked by a growing care, empathy, and even friendship that compels Max to remain at Furiosa’s side through thick and thin. And he’s at her side, not the other way around.
 The Mad Max films are unique as post-apocalyptic action narratives, and I appreciate how Max is always the reluctant protagonist, a wounded person reeling more from his personal tragedy than the world gone to hell. In each Mad Max film, he’s caught up in circumstances where it initially has little or no agency to cause significant change, but eventually accepts his role in the narrative as someone able to heal and save others, even if he cannot save himself. He’s never looking for trouble or on some mission; he’s just wandering this world of fire and blood, angry and dejected, until some larger communal struggle pulls him into its center and he becomes a hesitant-but-eventually-willing savior. The Mad Max films remind us we can never survive and wholly live entirely in isolation. Max always ends up in some sort of community and embraced. True life beyond mere survival can only be experienced in the context of relationship. Yet despite the significant of community, Max also reminds us that the wilderness-both literal and spiritual–is often a lonely place. These deserts of personal pain are normative, and even healthy to navigate alone. Max is a man who has experienced great personal pain and trauma; he is the walking wounded. Max’s journey towards healing becomes an ongoing dialogue between solitude and communal life. As he embraces community to liberate and redeem those who are lost, he, too, finds healing and redemption.
 I don’t think it’s an accident that Max is a “blood bag” to those who are dying in Fury Road, a universal donor whose very existence in this world of death can bring about restoration and new life. Fury Road is a sort of “reversed exodus” story, the movement of a small band of liberated people who end up returning to their place of captivity in order to start afresh. They discover the home they seek is right where they started, but only when that home is freed from tyranny and depravity. For Max and Furiosa, the only way to truly go home is through the long journey into the wilderness, akin to Walter Brueggeman’s spirituality of the Psalms and its movement from orientation to disorientation to new orientation. Then the cycle continues, spiraling into greater depths as individuals and communities experience both great loss and hope. Mad Max: Fury Road is a thrilling picture of this spiritual cycle, as well as the best action film of the year (perhaps the decade).

"Nov 12, 2018",positive," George Miller’s Mad Max: Fury Road is spectacular – a cacophony of automotive carnage unlike anything that has ever graced the big screen. Miller delivers a blistering piece of action cinema – you can almost smell the grease and oil seeping through the sun drenched, sandy vistas. The director builds on the post apocalyptic world of his previous Mad Max movies, upping the scope and making the desolate wasteland an even deadlier place to live. Tom Hardy slips into Mel Gibson’s battered leathers as Max Rockatansky, the former cop haunted by the death of his family who now roams the cursed earth looking for solace. Max is hunted, captured and hung up to be the ‘blood bank’ for Immortan Joe’s (Hugh Keays-Byrne) War Boys. Joe is a twisted despot who rules his Citadel with oppression and fear, using his own religion to keep his people in check. He goes on the warpath when his trusted Furiosa (Charlize Theron) drives off to freedom with Joe’s five enslaved wives (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Riley Keough, Zoë Kravitz, Abbey Lee Kershaw and Courtney Eaton). Max and Furiosa collide and form an alliance that will see them search for redemption along the Fury Road. There’s a primal essence to Fury Road that makes it stand out from the many plastic coated, CGI filled blockbusters of the 21st Century. George Miller might be looking to the future in Fury Road’s dystopian narrative but he’s infusing the whole thing with film-making techniques from the past. The magnificent stunt work and the glorious vehicular action must to be seen to be believed. Miller might be 70 years old but his understanding of composing action sequences is second to none. It’s even more impressive when you take into account that the majority of it was done without the use of computer effects. You can sense the danger in every frame – this mise en scene is filled with mayhem. Glorious mayhem. Performances are often disregarded in action movies but Fury Road features a winning pair in Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron. Hardy’s Max is bruised and battered from the get-go – he’s the engine that gets the film s moving but Theron is literally it’s driving force, infusing Furiosa with an energy and urgency which pushes Hardy’s Max into the passenger seat. Their dialogue is kept to a minimum but they’re able to deliver so much simply with their eyes. Hugh Keays-Byrne delivers a hugely memorable screen villain in Immortan Joe. He’s the type of bug screen bad guy that you don’t get anymore. He’s not two toned or complex – he’s just evil and he’s willing to stop at nothing to get what he wants. Nichola Hout’s offers support as Nux, an ADD-fuelled follower of Joe who gets caught up in Furiosa’s long drive to freedom. Mad Max: Fury Road is unlike any other Hollywood blockbuster and George Miller achieves the impossible by making an big budget action film that fails to play it safe in any way. Miller’s film is epic in scope and ambition and he has managed to deliver a film that may have pushed the limits of cinema to breaking point."
"Nov 9, 2018",positive,A welcome return by George Miller to the kind of anarchic action he hasn't directed in the three decades since Thunderdome.
"Nov 1, 2018",positive," In what is possibly the biggest gap between instalments of a franchise, it’s been thirty years since Mad Max last rode across the wasteland in Beyond Thunderdome, but whilst original star Mel Gibson may now have retired the role, director of the original trilogy George Miller is still holding on at the grand age of 70. Miller has actually been planning Fury Road for over a decade now, with various false starts over the years and, even after getting the ball rolling (shooting began in 2012), some reshoots and a long post-production process have further delayed its release. But now Max is finally back, and goddamn was it bloody worth the wait.  Mad Max: Fury Road has more of a premise than a cohesive narrative, and what’s there is mainly to set up a series of action sequences. On first examination, this seems like a really bad idea but, much like the ragged machines the people of the wasteland drive, it works beyond all reasonable expectations. Once the wheels literally get rolling and things start going boom, everything clicks into place and the patchwork nature of the story becomes incredibly cohesive and durable. The pacing is expertly handled, weaving from set piece to set piece with just enough breathing space in-between the carnage. Though dialogue is sparse, Fury Road’s flawless handling of visual storytelling gets across everything you need with just raw emotions and reactions; you don’t need to be told what’s happening is crazy, it’s plainly obvious. The film hits every note possible, creating a film that is thrilling, funny, thought provoking, and even heart wrenching. No joke, I was close to tears near the end of this film, and any film that manages that is clearly doing its job at maximum efficiency. Though Gibson’s portrayal of Max will probably still be the de facto face of the character for generations to come, Tom Hardy’s interpretation certainly lives up to the legend. Much like his predecessor, Hardy’s Max is a man of few words and defines himself instead with his tough but fair attitude. His tragic back-story is only hinted at, the only real point where knowledge of the previous films may be helpful, but that only adds to the mystique of the character. But in many ways, the film doesn’t actually belong to Max himself. That honour falls to Charlize Theron’s Imperator Furiosa, and she knocks it out of the park. Furiosa’s past is equally vague and her dialogue clipped, but again we get more than enough just from Theron’s pitch-perfect performance. She commands the screen with nothing more than a determined glare and a badass prosthetic arm, and for stretches of the film you’ll forget that Max is even there…and that’s not a bad thing. Furiosa’s posse of runaway breeders (yes, that’s what they’re called in the movie) are just defined enough by distinct looks, personality and crazy names (one of them is called The Splendid Angharad. ‘Nuff said.), and the gang of gun-toting grannies they meet up with later are equally fun characters. In the midst of all the explosions and testosterone, Fury Road has a surprisingly strong feminist message. At its core, it’s a story about a group of women who are tired of being treated as objects and decide to fight back against their oppressors, and Max just happens to be along for the ride. Nicholas Hoult’s Nux adds a surprising amount of heart to the film, mainly because he goes through the biggest arc over the course of the story. Starting out as a devout worshipper of antagonist Immortan Joe (Keays-Bryne), his development from there is surprisingly touching and you’ll be rooting for the skull-faced nutter by the end. Immortan Joe himself is as ridiculous a villain as you’d expect from a Mad Max film; though not quite as memorable as the likes of Lord Humungous or Master Blaster, he is a vile and threatening foe with a cool look and an awesome voice, and that’s all you really need. As mentioned before, most of the attention has been paid on the spectacle of the film and it’s a risk that pays off with interest. There is not a single frame in Fury Road that is dull, no matter the situation. When cars aren’t flipping and guns aren’t firing, there’s always something to look at: the beautifully pristine desert landscape, the intricacies of the production and costume design, the gorgeous use of colour, or even just an interesting camera move or angle. DOP John Seale’s work here is just phenomenal, a true gem in his already long and stellar career, and it certainly puts the camerawork on almost all blockbusters to shame. Along with the cinematography, the editing is excellently attuned, cutting to increase impact but also allowing shots to hold when needed, as well as great use of both slow motion and sped-up footage. The score by Junkie XL is a monster befitting of this movie, combining metal, rock, electronic and orchestral music to craft a soundscape that accentuates the action unfolding onscreen, rounding out this impeccably crafted piece of movie magic. Mad Max: Fury Road is an adrenaline shot of filmmaking from start to finish. Its unorthodox approach to storytelling eschews traditional structure and pacing to craft a tale in a new and exciting way, relying on pure imagery to convey its bombastic narrative. The characters are drawn with broad but striking strokes, and you’ll be strongly connected to them despite most of them barely uttering a word. The action sequences are some of the best in recent cinema history, avoiding all the clichés and failures of the genre to create a rollercoaster experience both in terms of thrills and emotion. It’s like an insane 80’s B-movie, but one made with thought, effort, and enough of a budget to match its deranged aspirations. After it was all over, all I wanted to do was turn back around and experience it again. I cannot recommend this movie enough, so get out to your local cinema and support this movie with your hard-earned cash. It doesn’t just deserve your time. It demands it."
"Oct 31, 2018",positive," Like a sublime dieselpunk opera scored for blood, fire, guns and accompanied by an orchestra of insanely tricked-out vehicles, Mad Max: Fury Road roars to life in a breathless, relentless two hours of sheer lunatic joy. It isn’t just the best action film of the summer. It isn’t just the best action film of 2015. It may be the best action film of the decade.  Tom Hardy fills the worn, leather boots of Max Rockatansky this time, filling in for a too-old and definitely-too-crazy Mel Gibson. Max finds himself swept up in the mission of Furiosa (Charlize Theron), a lieutenant to wasteland warlord Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne). Furiosa has gone rogue, taking with her Joe’s Wives, whose health and fertility are assets more valuable than the clean water source that Joe lords over. Her goal is a pseudo-legendary Green Place, a land untouched by the nuclear apocalypse that turned the world into an endless desert.  What on its surface looks to be a two-hour car chase sequence is, in actuality, the most efficient, masterful and critical-hit kind of narrative. The dialogue is sparse, and what’s there is as lean and bare as the landscape. The true narrative of the film is found in the visuals, in the space between words, and the actions of the characters. Even during quiet moments, there is a palpable tension. It’s a perfect reflection of a world where, as Max’s opening voiceover narrates, there is only the instinct to survive. The man behind the world of Mad Max, director/co-writer George Miller, presents a meticulously-detailed world of which Fury Road is only a small part. While ostensibly a reboot of the original Max trilogy, it also doesn’t directly contradict anything from those films, and it fits very well in the exponential progression of its predecessors. Each film builds on the structure of the one before it in a natural growth, and the latest entry is no exception. Miller is as confident and assured here as he has ever been, and it’s clear this is his vision and his alone.  Narrative and world-building is all well and good, but a Mad Max film lives and dies on its diesel-burning set pieces, and Fury Road has those in abundance. From vehicles covered in iron spikes to Joe’s towering war drum caravan (psychotic guitarist whose instrument belches flame included), this is every bit a gear-head’s post-apocalyptic fever dream. The vehicle design in and of itself is something close to genius. Like the other components of the film, nothing here is extraneous, and not a single punch is pulled nor gratuitous. Nearly all of the effects are practical, with CGI only coming in to enhance the already spectacular stunts. It puts nearly every superhero film to shame. Thor may be fighting cosmic enemies, but he’s doing it in the green screen comfort of an air-conditioned studio. There’s something primal and hypnotic to the chase scenes, a brutal grace with a flow and a language all its own that could never be replicated by a computer. Even more striking, and many times more impactful, is the feminine power in the film’s story. In a cinematic landscape where Wonder Woman can’t escape development hell and Black Widow can’t get an even share of a billion-dollar franchise, the female-heavy cast of Fury Road seems downright revolutionary. Charlize Theron’s Furiosa is, of course, a total badass. That was made clear right away in the first trailers. But the Wives are no wilting flowers, either, and eventually Furiosa’s brigade is joined by a group of women warriors led appropriately enough by a character named Valkyrie. This story actually belongs to Furiosa and the Wives; Max just happens to be in it. In fact, aside from Max and Nicholas Hoult as Nux, one of Joe’s War Boys, there are almost no truly sympathetic male characters in the cast. Which isn’t to say that Max isn’t welcome company, mind you. Tom Hardy is a perfect Max, so well-suited for the role that he actually makes Mel Gibson seem miscast. He seems like a more serious Max than Gibson ever was, and he doesn’t seem to wink at the camera nearly as much. Hardy is very much in tune with the deadpan black comedic subtext of Miller’s campaign. Max is introduced to us as he chomps down on a two-headed lizard, which is humorous and horrifying in equal measures. Best of all, Hardy comes without any…shall we say…real-world baggage that would distract from the role. For all intents and purposes, he IS Max.  And, like Hardy, there is nothing in this film that is out of tune. Every part comes together seamlessly, even furiously, to create an action symphony so perfect that it only comes around once every few years. Like the propulsive, orchestra-and-electronic score by Junkie XL, this is a film that is both raw and refined, heavy and exhilarating. Miller has created nothing less than a masterpiece of enthralling cinematic mayhem."
"Oct 31, 2018",positive," The film is set several years after a series of catastrophic worldwide events caused the downfall of civilization in the year 2060 AD.  A desert community (named the Citadel) is run by tyrannical leader Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne, Toe-Cutter of the first Mad Max film) because he controls the entire civilization’s water supply. One of his Imperator’s, named Furiosa (Charlize Theron, at her most bad-ass), breaks off from a routine guzzoline (the film’s version of gasoline) run with Joe’s Five Wives stowed away in an attempt to escape his clutches. Along the way, they cross paths with Max (Tom Hardy), a former highway patrolman who is now being used as a universal blood bag for Joe’s army, nicknamed the War Boys. In the interest of full disclosure, it should be known that I have not seen any of the other Mad Max films, so this review comes from a complete Mad Max virgin. Once I realized Fury Road would be unrelated to the previous films in the franchise, I wanted to go in with a completely blank slate and zero expectations. For a review of the film from an experiences Mad Max fan, check out our very own Jonathan Barkan’s equally glowing review. Mad Max: Fury Road is unlike any film I have ever seen. Essentially an extended chase sequence, there are set pieces in the film that legitimately had my mouth hanging wide open. Miller was present at the screening I was at and stated that roughly 90% of the effects in the film are practical (he also said that eight cameras were destroyed during filming). With the exception of one heinous meant-for-3D use of CGI in one of the the final scenes of the film, it shows. What Miller was able to capture on screen is nothing short of a miracle, and truly shows off his talents as a director. Credit must also go to John Seale, whose cinematography is mesmerizing. While I was unable to see the film in IMAX 3D, I can say that a regular 2D showing is sufficient and doesn’t detract from the intended experience. Also great is that the film does not pander to its audience. The film kicks into high gear from the opening frame, with no time for exposition.  There is no opening scroll informing the audience what happened to the world and the state civilization is in now. There are no characters unrealistically explaining what is going on to other characters (since everyone on screen already knows). We are dropped right into the middle of this dystopian society and hit the ground running. Speaking of dialogue, it would be interesting to see the script for this one, as there is little dialogue in the film. The acting is uniformly great from everyone involved. Hardy is perfectly serviceable as our stoic hero, but the show really belongs to Theron. No one ever doubted her abilities as an actress, but she taps into a carnal brutality here that is captivating. The whole film is a marvel to behold, but the final act of the film manages to best everything that came before it in a spectacular sequence involving the War Boys swinging on poles (a tease of this was glimpsed in the final trailer for the film). Even though it has a 2-hour running time, Fury Road feels much shorter. This is one of the highest compliments any film can receive. I didn’t want it to end and I can’t wait to go back to see it again once it gets released this weekend. Mad Max: Fury Road is the best action movie I have seen so far this year, and I doubt anything else coming out will be able to top it. I won’t be able to praise it enough, so do yourself a favor and get yourself to the theater this weekend and see it. You won’t regret it! Up next from director Jaume Collet-Serra (House of Wax, Orphan, The Shallows) is the Universal & Blumhouse thriller The Woman in the Yard, and the cast is growing this week. Deadline reports that Russell Hornsby (Fences) has signed on to star in the upcoming thriller, joining the previously announced Danielle Deadwyler (The Harder They Fall). The Woman in the Yard, written by Sam Stefanak, is scheduled to be released in theaters on January 10, 2025. At this time, any and all plot details are under wraps. Stay tuned. Jason Blum and Stephanie Allain are producers on the film. Jaume Collet-Serra, Danielle Deadwyler, Gabrielle Ebron, Scott Greenberg and James Moran are EPs. Haley Pigman and Jungyoon Kim are the executives covering the film for Blumhouse."

"Aug 29, 2018",positive," To say that George Miller has stepped up his game since he left us at Thunderdome would be far too mild a statement to open with. Mad Max: Fury Road is not just superior to everything in this franchise, as well as everything else Miller has ever directed. It’s among the most exhausting, thrilling, visceral action films ever made. Powerful, villainous white guys have ruined the planet by way of their greed for oil and their warmongering, and now they are sustaining their power by taking control of women’s reproductive systems. So, you know, pretty far-fetched. But Max doesn’t belong to any of these festering wounds called societies. He’s feral. Again. No telling how long it’s been since Max saved the kids from Aunty Entity, but he’s lost himself again, wandering the desert hunted by man and haunted by those he couldn’t save. Again Miller puts Max in a position to redeem himself by helping the vulnerable and pure survive this apocalyptic future. Mercifully, there are no children and no mullets this go-round. Unsurprisingly, the great Tom Hardy delivers a perfect, guttural performance as the road warrior. As his reluctant partner in survival, Charlize Theron is the perfect mix of compassion and badassedness. Hardy’s a fascinating, mysterious presence, but Theron owns this film. Like the first two films in this series, Fury Road wastes little time on dialogue or plotting. Rather, it is basically one long, magnificent car chase. Miller adorns every scene with the most astonishing, peculiar imagery and the vehicular action is like nothing you’ve ever seen. Miller’s magnificent action sequences keep the film from ever hitting the dragging monotony of his first two efforts in the series. While the characters remain as paper thin as they have been in every episode, the vast superiority of this cast from top to bottom guarantees that the marauding band’s excess and abandon are handled with genuine skill. Fury Road amounts to a film about survival, redemption and the power of the universal blood donor. Clever, spare scripting makes room for indulgent set pieces that astonish and amaze. There’s real craftsmanship involved here – in the practical effects, the pacing, the disturbing imagery, and the performances that hold it all together – that marks not just a creative force at the top of his game, but a high water mark for summer blockbusters."
"Aug 27, 2018",positive," After more than a decade of writing about movies, the Oscars, somehow, still raise a fire in me. I know I will be disappointed. I know there will be one or two wins that seem perfect, one or two speeches that surprise, just like I know that most of the lauded films will be about white men enduring something. I know the Oscars matter, on a business and cultural level, no matter what the Coen brothers — who’ve conveniently already earned a few — say. Winning is power and power is money, and money lets people decide which stories get told. This year’s stories are good stories but, by and large, they’re familiar, and made by familiar names. The most familiar story — the one about a young person falling in love and finding her way — is, in an odd twist, perhaps the most subversive of the lot for the way it respects that young woman’s ordinary existence. Life can be complicated enough when it’s just life — bear attacks, interplanetary stranding or not. It’s maybe funny to call The Martian a confinement film — dude’s got a whole planet to himself! — but Mark Watney (Matt Damon) lives inside a bubble, a rover or a spacesuit, without a lick of outdoor air. Entertaining and visually appealing though it is, The Martian lacks one key element: characters. Mark can be dry, funny and sarcastic, but everyone else gets single-note personalities: noble (Sean Bean); socially inept (the math guys); efficient (Chiwetel Ejiofor); tense (Kristen Wiig). As a story of survival, it works, but it’s hollow. Room is the opposite, as much a story of what comes after as a story of the terrible captivity of Ma (Brie Larson) and Jack (Jacob Tremblay). A movie that improves on the novel on which it’s based is a rare bird — and Room is all the more rare, as Emma Donoghue wrote both. She chiseled her own novel into a film that understands “Will they escape?” is only half the question. Then what? How do you spend years confined and then go back to a world of cell phones, computers, cable news, open spaces, soccer balls? The Martian doesn’t ask about the aftermath. It doesn’t ask much of anything at all. Frankly, The Force Awakens should’ve taken the sci-fi slot, but it’s less concerned with science than it is with myth — and its mythology isn’t the kind the Academy cares for. What is The Revenant if not mythologizing? The astonishing man on a noble vengeance quest, pushed to extremes, part of a brutal world. While I disliked Alejandro González Iñárritu’s Birdman, I can appreciate it if I squint and tilt my head until all the characters look like part of Riggan’s psyche. There’s no trick that makes The Revenant work like that. It’s an endurance test with beautiful cinematography and, to be fair, a notable nod to the terrible treatment of native people. We’re hardly lacking in movies about determined white men fighting their way through to something (see also: The Martian, There Will Be Blood, Gladiator). How have the filmmakers — and DiCaprio — so cleverly shifted the narrative around this film to make it mean something? It means that cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki is a genius to have gotten some of those shots. It means that no one saw Valhalla Rising, another movie about men suffering, though with a change of weather and more hallucinogens. 
	On the flip side of everything — of climate, of gender, of theme — are the sweltering sands of Mad Max: Fury Road, a movie just as inventively filmed and edited, just as beautiful, and with so much more to say — about power, destruction, misogyny, freedom, fear and the world we live in. It’s by no means a perfect film, but it’s an action movie with a heart and a mind, built to do much more than just make you feel as if you’ve endured a visual pummeling.  The Big Short will leave you feeling mentally pummeled, and probably rather depressed. Smart, wry, cleverly playful in its anger, Adam McKay’s film about the corrupt banking system owes some of its palpable sense of rage to Ryan Gosling’s bitter voiceovers, and the delightful, peculiar moments at which the movie breaks the fourth wall. McKay and his cowriter, Charles Randolph (working from Michael Lewis’ nonfiction book), know that this is a lot of esoteric bullshit to take in, so at times the narrative stops, with celebrities explaining the finer points of mortgage bonds. Dizzying, biting, full of great performances, The Big Short is probably too smart to win an Oscar. And those two words — sturdy and sly — bring me to the last two best picture nominees, the ones with less high-gloss shine and media spin. Bridge of Spies is dramatic, to be sure, but Steven Spielberg can make this kind of movie while sleepwalking: smooth, smart, unsubtle in its interest in reminding us of the kind of people we can be. (It’s also here to remind us that Mark Rylance is brilliant and underused in film.) Bridge of Spies is unquestionably timely, concerned with how people can be more than their jobs, more than their families (well, white men can, anyway) and that a nation is only as good as its people. The grown-up, almost old-fashioned style of Spielberg’s latest shows a sure hand, but I miss the innovative Spielberg, the one who created aliens and adventures and freaking giant dinosaurs. This is the cinematic equivalent of the dad who grew up and got conservative — not socially, but in bearing and demeanor. 
Brooklyn is conservative on the surface, but when you scratch that period-piece façade, you find something rare in this batch of nominees: a beautiful, gently funny (bless every actress in those boarding house scenes) movie that takes the interior life of a young woman entirely seriously. As Eilis Lacey, Saoirse Ronan carries this film so splendidly that in any year that was not so utterly Brie Larson’s, it would be a crime not to give her every award; you can practically see her eyes changing colors with her moods. Brooklyn is also about America, and the mythology of coming here shares the screen with the lure of what you’ve left behind, the possibility of other lives that still tempt you, even if the shoes don’t fit. Director John Crowley has a sense of timing that gives every one of Brooklyn’s scenes a thoughtfulness; even a tiny role like that of Eilis’ department-store boss has layers of sympathy. Nothing melodramatic and terrible happens to Eilis, just life in all its 1950s colors and shapes. That such a moving film came out of such traditional shapes is magic in and of itself: This woman’s choices should be her own, then, now, always. "
"Aug 24, 2018",positive," It’s been 30 years since George Miller’s last outing on the road with Mad Max. It can be hard to come back to a series so embedded in the cult film phenomena and have a leading man so iconic that dad’s the world over are crying battle cries of ‘NO ONE CAN EVER BE MEL GIBSON!!’ But somehow, Miller has managed to create one of the best straight-up action films of at least, the past decade. In the world of Mad Max, and in his own words, the only goal is to ‘survive’. Not stated in any particular time frame other than ‘sometime later’, violence is the way to survival, as shown in pretty much any dystopian movie, ever. The earth’s inhabitant’s have adapted, societies have been formed and the structure of yester-year has been forgotten, of course there is going to be anarchy and destruction; the entire basis of the original Mad Max trilogy. In this world, you cannot exist without violence and destruction; people born into this world find joy in the chaos, particularly the War Boys whose cries of ‘IMMORTAN’ and ‘WITNESS ME’ shrill through the cinema. We revel in their elation and gladly jump aboard the War Rig’s down the Fury Road. Cinema will always divulge the obscene and violent (that personally I can’t get enough of) and I don’t believe that will change soon, but when a film is directly commenting on patriarchy and social structure, how can we complain?! Outside of the chase scenes, the ideas behind Fury Road are rooted in patriarchy. Despite the earth’s current state, a leader has emerged to exploit and use the people of the Citadel; Immortan Joe. Immortan Joe believes himself to be some form of deity, the man to save the people; he exploits different social groups for his own gain and controls access to water, food, milk and the gene pool, which has led to extreme deformities in his people. His ‘War Boys’ serve him, and deal with the action and the War Pups turn the cogs of the water wheel. The War Boys believe he has come to save them, that if they do his bidding he will grant them access to Valhalla (from Norse mythology), they are bred and rewarded for war, so I can forgive them for taking enjoyment in such acts. Immortan Joe is also a class A misogynist, he dabbles in sex slavery and keeps the most beautiful women in one room so he can use and abuse them and gain a male heir. In the case of ‘wife’ Cheedo the Fragile (Courtney Eaton), she even experiences a kind of Stockholm syndrome; attempting on numerous occasions to get back to Immortan where she believes she is safest. The reason dystopian movies are so great is because you can examine society in this way, you can break down these imaginary societies’ groups, see their motives and see the way they exploit different (if extreme), narratives, which can always been brought back to our current real-life society. Considering these traumatic events the five wives go through, there has also been much speculation about whether or not the film is ‘feminist’. For me, it’s a difficult task to solidly declare something ‘feminist’ or ‘not feminist’ because what might be empowering to one woman; may be downright offensive to another. My main criticism of the film as a whole was the lack of POC across the board and a few slurs (twice?). But what I’ve always admired, and will continue to praise, is someone who tries. Rome wasn’t built in a day and the film industry is not going to be bursting with varied characters of all ages, races, sexualities, genders and backgrounds in a day either. If we continue to praise and support movies that show some attempt and understanding then ‘up’ can be the only way, my friends. As someone very much in love with the ‘gun wielding chicks’ trope but also very tired of the Hunger Games led trope of ‘this woman is saving her world because she is special, and the reason she is special is because she’s a woman and that’s SO unlikely’, Fury Road stood out to me in a film series usually so heavily drowned in testosterone. What was so interesting to me was that, George Miller could have set the plot as Max escaping from the Citadel and for some reason takes the brides with him too, but no, Miller chose a woman character to carry out the task. Imperator Furiosa may be my favourite female character in a LONG time, Charlize Theron is phenomenal as the one-armed War Rig driver (representation of disabled bodies, yes?!), her determination, clear passion and teary eyes all through the first half are forever embedded in my mind and her anguish at the ‘Green Place’ is up there in the most iconic shots in the film. Furiosa’s authority is never questioned by Max, her abilities as a woman are never doubted, and her abilities as a disabled woman are never doubted. Like anyone encountering another human in this barren wasteland, Max’s only hostility is upon their meeting when he’s trying to save his own life; the fact that even a lone ranger such as Max can respect women in a society where people kill, rape and blow each other up for kicks is quite a feat for your standard flashy blockbuster. To the disappointment of many male fans and the elation of many female ones, the entire plot of Fury Road focuses around Furiosa’s transportation of Immortan’s Five Wives to the ‘Green Place’. Whilst a film discussing a woman single handily (literally) ending a sex slave trade in a never ending chase scene is completely thrilling, the brides themselves were pretty one-dimensional, a shame because the slight hints of their personality we did see were really interesting. Toast (Zoe Kravitz) clearly favoured herself as the next Furiosa, keen to handle weapons and get amongst the action, Capable (Riley Keough) showed great compassion for Nux, The Dag (Abbey Lee) was very spiritual but the most striking image in the entire 120 minutes for me was Splendid (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley) throwing her pregnant body out of a car in a high speed chase to protect Furiosa, these women are not just pretty faces, they have individual personalities and what Miller managed to communicate in what he described as a ‘silent’ movie (relying little on dialogue and mainly on implying) was more than adequate. The criticism of the wives’ beauty from viewers is rooted in misogyny; they are not too ‘model-like’ to be in this dystopia. Immortan chose these women specifically for their beauty, a man still practising the euro-centric beauty standards we hold currently. They were locked away and kept slim for breeding purposes; he clearly believes that keeping these women separate will eliminate the deformities in the gene pool. The first shot we see of the wives is also up for comment, what some say is a male-gaze doused magazine spread, I personally find to be an exclamation of freedom. The girls hose down in a desert, almost like a mirage. We see a close-up of the girls removing chastity belts, emblazoned with Immortan’s skull emblem, a sign of his property. With the breaking of the belts, the girls’ attitudes change, Abbey Lee Kershaw kicks hers away in a ‘fuck you’ to her previous life.  I also enjoyed the older female, their hardened faces and deep wrinkles telling a thousand stories, they had quick wit and a fast mouth, revelling in the thought of a new battle to face, these women have survived for so long, their thinking almost mimics that of the War Boys; killing for fun. The attitudes of Fury Road seek solace in women’s liberation and don’t shun or mock it. Miller wanted to make a straight up action film, utilising the bigger budget and technologies 2015 has to offer, it’s excusable to me that the backstories run a little dry. The Mad Max franchise has been this way since its beginning, iconic characters are created and loved with just so much as a name; The Coma Doof warrior has already been solidified as a fan-favourite character from this film, and we know so little about him, his electrifying flamethrower metal sound-tracking the film and a distinct warning call for Immortan and the War Boys’ arrival. The thumping drums and booms amp up the film on a whole other level, something I haven’t felt since Interstellar. The way the different music was used to signify the arrival of another War Party was a sonic experience I need to see more of, and would happily sit and read an entire novella on every last character I seen on screen. This is what Miller has given us, a world so rich in detail and drenched with love that we can’t possibly comprehend the entire scale of the thing; I can only hope that Miller takes the critical success of Fury Road and adapts the same approach for his next few films. I can’t wait to see more of the rich comic book type cinematography even Zack Snyder would be envious of, and Tom Hardy’s ridiculously perfect pout. With an overall consensus of ‘THIS IS THE BEST THING I’VE EVER SEEN’ I hope the rest of the action movie world are quaking in their boots from the madness. Chloe Leeson is 19 and from the north of England (the proper north). She believes Harmony Korine is the future and is pretty sure she coined the term ‘selfie central’. She doesn’t like Pina Coladas or getting caught in the rain but she does like Ezra Miller & Dane DeHaan a whole lot. Her favourite films are The Beach, Lords of Dogtown and Into the Wild. But DON’T talk to her about Paranormal Activity. She rants @kawaiigoff."
"Aug 21, 2018",negative,"""Mad Max Fury Road"" is one of the worst and meaningless movies I have ever seen."
"Jul 24, 2018",positive," There’s plenty of motion, stunts, explosions, visual effects and wonderfully weird post-apocalyptic images, characters and design to keep most reasonably minded filmgoers happy as they munch on their popcorn, sip on their drinks and think about their grocery list. The original Mad Max trilogy – and the first two films especially – are rightly regarded as standard setting, game-changing classics. Yet while it bears the brand name and tries very hard, Fury Road can’t quite honour the legacy of its forebears. It’s fine B-grade mulch, but it’s certainly no masterpiece. The new adventure finds Max (played by the ubiquitous, and somewhat miscast Tom Hardy rather than the original’s Mel Gibson) a loner with a suped-up car in a wasteland filled with motorised marauders. His only purpose is to survive. At first he is captured by the manic minions of King Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne, aka Toecutter from the first film, but not playing the same character) before joining forces with renegade truck driver Furiosa (Charlize Theron). A post-apocalyptic feminist warrior with a marvellously rendered artificial arm, she’s done the dirty on Joe, the evil overlord of the region, by stealing his five young slave wives and speeding them off across the desert to a new land and a new life. Max helps them traverse the sands, with their enemies in hot pursuit. When vehicles aren’t kicking up dust trails and crashing against each other at high speed, the soundtrack throbs anxiously as Max and Furiosa negotiate their next move, ever-wary of the giant vehicles in the distant heat haze heading their way. Especially impressive are the bizarre vehicle designs, which look like beautiful mechanical mutations, or artworks on wheels. One item even looks like a distant relative of the spiked VW from Peter Weir’s 1974 film The Cars That Ate Paris. Given how distinctive and inventive the action scenes in the original films were, it is disappointing that so much of the mechanical bump-and-grind here lacks any real spark or originality. Men fly about on poles, gunfire is exchanged, people scream and the mandatory fireballs send vehicles twirling into mid-air – an exhausted action-movie cliche that really needs to be retired. And for all his supposed genius, original director George Miller has slavishly adopted the standard editing rhythm of the standard 21st century tentpole movie, with a cut every second or so. Even Michael Bay holds shots longer. So what is the film trying to do? In a way, the answer is in the film’s prolonged chases, which serve as a metaphor for the film itself. Whereas the original trilogy set the pace in the early 1980s and influenced everything from The Terminator to Waterworld, Fury Road is more a case of Mad Max trying to catch up and prove itself worthy. The brand once set the bar. Now it is trying to reach the bar set by others. And as moderately exciting and frame-filling as its explosive set-pieces are, they don’t quite make it. There’s nothing in Fury Road, for instance, that matches the brilliance of the chases in Matrix Reloaded, To Live and Die in LA or even Quentin Tarantino’s Death Proof. Since the fourth one in 2009, the F&F series has established itself as the dominant brand for automotive mayhem through its house style of elaborate stunts and preposterous, digitally-assisted action. Sworn to continually top the previous film, they are full of kinetic images and ideas we’ve never seen before. Fury Road can’t make that boast. The very cleverly edited trailer certainly builds that expectation, but the prangs and demolition on show are, at the end of the day, pretty standard. There’s certainly nothing that tops what we saw in the finale of Mad Max 2, which still stands as the franchise’s golden hour. Like so many blockbusters, Mad Max Fury Road is essentially a two-act story stretched out to feature-length running time. With an unmotivated Max, the film feels dramatically hollow as it is only other people who compel him to act. He’s a cypher in the Wasteland with no real purpose. He only has a few scant lines of dry dialogue, but nothing as punchy as his classic line from Mad Max 2: “You wanna get outta here? You talk to me.” For the record, it’s not a reboot because it has flashbacks to the original films. Plus, as we all know too well by now, to reboot a franchise you need to have an origin story. This film simply drops us into the familiar post-apocalyptic world we left Max in at the end of Thunderdome. Might Fury Road have been better as a proper reboot? Perhaps. Was it a mistake to make a Mad Max film without Mel Gibson, who created the role? Perhaps. After all, you’d never make a Dirty Harry movie without Clint Eastwood. Gibson was involved with earlier plans for the fourth film, but after too many delays and the passage of time he eventually counted himself out. Just a thought, but how cool would it have been to have him play Max at age 60, still humping around the Wasteland, still fighting the scum, still angry. It would have given the enterprise the mythological heft and powerful sense of continuity that Fury Road lacks. It’s understandable how some audiences – presumably younger ones that did not grow up with the original films – might be a little suspicious of a franchise that tries firing up after being dormant so long. That was certainly the case with Star Wars Episode 1, The Phantom Menace. But as with that film, it’s likely that the anticipation, the legacy and the affection for the original films will earn Fury Road a lot of free passes from forgiving filmgoers – provided, of course, that there is more to come. And, of course, there is. Miller is planning more Mad Max films. He even has two screenplays completed, apparently. Let’s just hope he give Max a lot more to do the next time around than follow somebody else’s lead.
 With its tongue pressed firmly in its cheek, A Royal Night Out is a prettily decorated, politely outrageous piece of cinematic confectionery, a carefully balanced, souffle-light slice of historical fiction that has a great deal of fun playing with the truth by dropping two real-life princesses into a fictitious teen romp. The gossamer of fact upon which this merrily mounted lark is based is that on the evening of 8 May 1945 – aka VE Day, the end of the war in Europe – the young, radiantly beautiful future Queen of England, Princess Elizabeth (Sarah Gadon) and her high-spirited, if not-quite-so-beautiful, never-to-be-Queen sister Margaret (Bel Powley) talked their parents Queen Elizabeth (Emily Watson) and King George VI (Rupert Everett) into letting them out of Buckingham Palace – where they’ve been cloistered – and into the celebrating throng. Accompanied by two of the British army’s most incompetent officers, the girls are soon off the leash and on their own, drinking, dancing and mixing it with real people. It’s an eventful evening of character-building adventure: Elizabeth is on a mission to gauge the true mood of the people and to see how the King’s radio speech has gone down. Hooking up with an angry soldier Jack (Jack Reynor) who is absent without leave, Elizabeth also goes through a reality check as she has her beliefs challenged and witnesses the scale of loss London has suffered. There is much running, yelling, drinking and falling over, chiefly in the seedier parts of town, but while director Julian Jarrold – a period film specialist with Becoming Jane, Brideshead Revisited, The Girl, All the King’s Men and Great Expectations – effectively works up a wild-party vibe, he knows not to cross certain lines. After all, he’s toying with the reputation of real Royals. The film is plently of fun – seen with a cinema full of senior filmgoers, every comic beat hit its mark – and while it’s not intended to do so, A Royal Night Out will no doubt deeply irritate those republicans who would rather not see the royals celebrated. The 70th anniversary of VE Day has just ticked over; the Queen is more popular than ever; Prince William and Princess Kate have just had a kid – a girl, Charlotte, no less – and the new generation of young, attractive, media savvy Royals appear to be bringing a new generation of supporters into the royalist fold. The director swears all this is very happy coincidence. No doubt it is, but it’s also very telling that, this deep into the 21st century, a film about the teenage shenanigans of two princesses would have any appeal at all. And along with The King’s Speech and The Queen, A Royal Night Out could well be part of the start of a process of mythologising and humanising the cinematic image of the Queen. After all, it’s happened with every other monarch, and this one has certainly done enough to warrant the enduring attention of filmmakers. On the news that they’re going to have a baby, an estranged couple, Eve (Camille Keenan) and Charlie (Dustin Clare), walk about the earthquake-shattered city of Christchurch trying to piece together their relationship, hoping the other will compromise enough. Deftly directed by Kiwi Michelle Joy Lloyd, Sunday is a modest, neatly etched character study of two people in transition. Clearly inspired by the conversational style of Richard Linklater’s Sunrise trilogy, the film could have done with a few more ill-mannered arguments before hitting home with its touching finale.

Sunday has made a small but significant step into the history books by being the first film in Australia to be released simultaneously in cinemas and on a wide range of digital platforms. With this must come a new way of reviewing films with this release pattern. As a value-for-money person, this reviewer always considers the general cost of admission to a cinema and the associated bother when reviewing a new release, as they are always in cinemas. This does change when reviewing things for the home market, as the costs are lower while the convenience is greater. Therefore, something that might not be worth seeing in cinemas might nonetheless make for a better, more economical experience as a home release. And the experience of watching something at home is markedly different, with ambient noise, distractions and the ability to watch things on screens of varying sizes. In the case of Sunday, is this low-budget two-hander worth seeing in the cinema for about $20 a ticket? No. But seeing it for a few dollars via a digital platform, most definitely."
"May 21, 2018",positive," You don’t realize just how crappy most action movies are, until you see something like Mad Max: Fury Road — a movie in which there are no “action scenes” because the action pretty much never stops. And the film’s constant sense of violent motion is in the service of incredible imagery and transcendant moments. Lots of directors have tried to do what George Miller pulls off so astonishingly in Fury Road — the feeling that shit never stops blowing up, the intensity, and above all the sense that the heightened reality of comics and video games is finally appearing in live-action films. I’m thinking of Zack Snyder, Michael Bay, Robert Rodriguez and a few others.  But Mad Max: Fury Road is still in a class by itself. There are so many moments in this movie where I found myself saying, “Wow, I can’t believe I’m seeing this” — either because the visuals were so insane or so extreme, or just because there was intense beauty filling the frame. These moments, cumulatively, turn what could have been a run-of-the-mill post-apocalyptic fight-chase-fight movie into something actually poignant and emotionally engaging — because your mind is flooded with so much insane imagery, you get opened up to the actually quite good performances by Charlize Theron, Tom Hardy and others. In Mad Max: Fury Road, it’s the same post-apocalyptic world that you’ll remember from The Road Warrior and Beyond Thunderdome, more or less. Everything has fallen apart, and there’s been some kind of ecological collapse — and in a modern twist, there’s not enough water, either. Max Rockatansky (Hardy) gets ensnared with a group of white-painted skull-faced assholes called the War Boys, led by the terrifying Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne). And soon, Max is caught in the middle of a custody dispute between Immortan Joe and the insane shaved-headed Imperator Furiosa (Theron). Cue a lot of shit blowing up, crazy “war rig” trucks, people swinging through the air on big fishing rods dangling off of cars going 100 mph, and stunts that would make the Fast and Furious movies feel slow and sedated. I cannot emphasize enough that this movie almost never stops going — a huge amount of the film’s running length takes place on board moving vehicles. (In fact, this movie reminded me of nothing so much as Snow-Piercer, both in its focus on battles aboard a moving vehicle in an extreme environment, and in its heightened-reality, absurdist take on an apocalyptic world.) We’ve been judging action scenes by too low a standard: Can you tell what’s going on? Is the camera too shaky, or too blurry, or is the CG so cheap that you’re just seeing smudges? Are there quick cuts that keep you from following the moves? Or a bewildering mixture of too-tight close-ups and too-far wide shots? That’s like judging a gymnastics meet by the number of gymnasts who show up with broken ankles. Mad Max: Fury Road has action that’s easy to follow, but also incredibly overwhelming in the sheer insanity and complexity of what’s going on at any given moment. We’re talking about, basically, a two-hour truck joust. Miller uses techniques that I’ve seen overused elsewhere — like the “hard zoom” into the face of someone driving crazily — but here, they just add drama to an already oversaturated kinetic frame. The camera is constantly in motion as it tracks in on people crashing their vehicles and launching projectiles at each other.  Which brings me to the nut of what makes Fury Road such a unique theatrical experience. Miller uses the constant motion of the film to enhance its sense of scale (because duh, if you cover a lot of ground quickly, you reveal the true vastness of the landscape). Immortan Joe’s insane villain lair is huge, and so is his horde of unsafe drivers. And the land around them, most of all, is just massive — the untameable, unknowable desert plays a starring role in this movie, at least as much as the vehicles do. And the hugeness and terribleness of that bleak landscape makes the larger-than-life characters feel weirdly at home, even as it informs the movie’s key themes of trying to fill that dead void with something. After three previous Mad Max films, Miller understands that the post-apocalyptic story isn’t so much about the collapse of society’s institutions, but about what replaces them — and he’s fascinated by the twisted attempts to create a functioning society in the ruins of our own.  In a lot of ways, the Mad Max franchise belongs to the same subgenre as the Judge Dredd comics — it’s about a world that’s been laid waste, but also about the absurdity of surviving in that world. The heightened reality and bizarreness of both worlds is about holding up a mirror to show us how artificial and bizarre our own identities are, and then creating a new, extreme context where only ridiculous and psychotic selves make any sense.  What’s new in Fury Road is an obsession with fertility — one character carries around “heirloom” seeds, that stubbornly refuse to grow in this dead world. Immortan Joe counsels people dying in the desert not to become “addicted” to water. Immortan Joe’s most prized “possessions” are his breeders, four women whose existence is only aimed at carrying Immortan Joe’s babies. And the War Boys have an ideology built around death and birth — if they die in Immortan Joe’s service, they will be reborn. Even the perennial Mad Max concern with fuel is somewhat reinvented, because now it’s also about water, and the ability to create green. Agriculture is a collective enterprise, in which the individual has to become part of the collective, and so is human fertility, to some extent. So Fury Road is all about the rights of the individual in the face of the obsession with fertility — and in the end, this does become an overtly feminist issue. Imperator Furiosa and the “breeders” are fighting for their freedom, but also searching for an alternative vision of society that doesn’t see them as nothing but objects — without going into too much spoilery detail. Theron is the emotional linchpin of the movie, channeling so much intensity and grim humor, that she literally drives the story forward. Furiosa is one of the great action heroes, up there with Max himself, and Theron manages to put a lot of nuance and generosity into her. She carries most of the weight of the movie’s themes about self-determination, cult psychology and fertility, and it’s largely thanks to her world-weary performance that the movie can get overtly feminist without ever seeming preachy.  What makes Max unique in this world is that he has no ideology. Every other character in Fury Road voices an idea about how the world works, or what it all means — but Max’s opening voiceover says that he’s been reduced to just one thing: the desire to survive, at all costs. He believes in nothing, but he’s haunted by visions of the people whom he cared about in the past, whom he failed to save. Max spends most of the film listening to other people describe their complicated worldviews, with a mute shrug. He’s such a nihilist, he can’t even articulate his nihilism. Mad Max: Fury Road is like a really great rock concert, where you hold up your lighter until you burn your fingertips and you scream yourself hoarse and afterwards you feel like you’ve had a personal, beautiful mindfuck. This is one of the few movies I’ve ever seen where the whole audience broke into spontaneous, loud applause a third of the way in. The over-the-top, stylized, absurdist aesthetic is pushed to its limit (and a lot of the film’s dialogue is frankly ridiculous), but the ultimate result is so extreme, and married to such beautiful imagery, that it becomes a great work of art."
"Apr 30, 2018",positive," A children’s movie about how great science is, The Martian has a pragmatic message for budding astronauts: you solve one problem, then another, and see if you survive. The film’s obsession with years-long plans imparts a Soviet feel to the space program depicted, but its sunny optimism keeps the movie all-American. Not once do we believe The Martian will end with a shot of Matt Damon’s skeleton half-buried in sand. Maybe the film is so bright because the days are thirty-nine minutes longer on Mars than on Earth, the same thirty-nine minutes that should have been cut from this Friday-less Robinson Crusoe. Kristen Wiig, however, is on hand to show that girls aren’t into The Lord of the Rings. Ridley Scott’s backlot Mars offers a parable for New Yorkers considering the move to LA. Once you relocate, you’re stranded, and the chances of getting home are remote. Yes, you’ll have a vegetable garden you can sit near and watch the beautiful sunsets, but you’ll be alone, 50 million miles from your loved ones. You’ll conduct your social life via text and Skype, make trips to the desert in your electric car. You’ll continue to shave every day on the off chance you get a meeting. The movies can put a positive spin on anything. Seeing the world anew, or for the first time, becomes an allegory of motherhood and childhood in Room, which puts its protagonist (Brie Larson) in a situation not unlike Matt Damon’s in The Martian, but earthbound, and worse. If The Martian is a friendly version of dark Ridley Scott sci-fi, Room domesticates repugnant horror with spiritual uplift. Held hostage in a shed with the 5-year-old she’s had with her rapist captor, “Ma” becomes a stand-in for every young mother isolated by child care, chained by domestic servitude, and abused at night by a man who’s out all day in a world she may never see again. This dismal parody of heterosexual coupling reinforces the idea that it’s time to have families in some new way. A tour de force of subtlety and restraint, 45 Years is the perfect movie to see alone if you’ve just broken up with someone and want confirmation it was a good idea. No need to waste decades in coupledom if all it amounts to is an unnoticed gesture of frustrated defiance. The film saves that moment for its last shot, which isn’t quite the indictment it’s meant to be. That’s because the film stacks the deck against Tom Courtenay’s character, a retiree recovering from a heart attack. Courtenay’s performance is a model of invisible acting, even when he’s doddering or fumbling an important speech at a party, but the film belongs to Charlotte Rampling, a star presence who can command the screen just by watching the passing landscape from a boat. The performances in The Big Short are carried by wigs, makeup, and bad suits, like in a silent comedy. Adam McKay, Will Ferrell’s director, cuts away from everyone’s big moments in their big scenes, almost walking away from them. Christian Bale, with a fake glass eye to go with his wig, moves the film along by himself for large chunks of it, often by air drumming, despite the large cast of Hollywood dudes giving it to hedge funders by playing them as self-deluded slickster oafs who will never be Ryan Gosling or Brad Pitt, no matter how many billions they sock away. The explanatory cameos by Margot Robbie, Anthony Bourdain, Selena Gomez, and Richard Thaler barely work, and the Margot Robbie one is a sarcastic wink-wink insult to the audience that almost sinks the whole movie while, at the same time, referring to The Wolf of Wall Street, a better film than this. Even though McKay gives the impression he is using recognizable forms of infotainment to educate us, the film doesn’t do that—it’s barely in the form of a movie. This disrespect is what makes The Big Short so satisfying. It jeers at and burlesques Wall Street for letting the crash happen, using Michael Lewis’s book to show there were people who knew it was going to happen. Its slapdash quality reinforces the idea that it needed to be made. A fairy tale of lean-in capitalism about a Cinderella without a prince, David O. Russell’s Joy recasts the crazy family of a Capra comedy with stellar toxicity. Joy’s (Jennifer Lawrence’s) undermining relatives are the selfish American clan par excellence, claiming to know everything about Joy’s business while undermining her future. Robert De Niro and Isabella Rossellini, playing evil-universe versions of themselves as Joy’s father and stepmother, delight in their performances as fickle scoffers. Joy is a natural inventor prone to epiphanies about household products—the film could be called A Beautiful Mop. Her ingenuity and tenacity save her from a life of drudgery, though by the end her victory seems hollow. The film, busy with fake TV soap operas and flashbacks, doesn’t imagine another life for her, except maybe settling down with a cable-TV executive (Bradley Cooper) who lectures her and is wrong half the time. The mitigating factors in her struggle are that she can turn a profit, employ her friends, and help younger women manufacture improved lint brushes. Set in the early 1990s, Joy suggests these were the consolations working-class Gen X could hope for. A series of epic walk-and-talks about the future retconned to be 100 percent correct because they’re about our present. For example, the Amazing Steve predicts that journalism will change because of computers. (He says that in 1998, the same year Aaron Sorkin found out.) By the end, when Super Steve tells his estranged daughter he will invent the iPod for her, the movie is indistinguishable from a TV commercial. They should have given Steve Jobs away for free without anyone asking for it, like that U2 album. That way people (users) might have watched it by accident. A nasty film about the drug war on the US-Mexico border that flirts with fascism and artiness, succumbing to the former. The film suggests that the best way for Donald Trump to convince the Mexican government to pay for building a wall would be to tell them it would keep out the CIA. Benicio del Toro, maybe the last actor from the Robert Mitchum mold, plays an Agency-backed hit man with blasé menace. Del Toro, like Mitchum, is a strange, often indifferent actor who apparently spins a wheel of fortune to choose his roles. Once he settles on one, he’s either good or bad in it depending on something no one can figure out, maybe if work starts on a Tuesday. It doesn’t matter who directs him. In films by auteurs like Paul Thomas Anderson and Arnaud Desplechin he can range from okay to not good, and then in an overblown thriller like this he shows up with something to prove. In some scenes he stares at Emily Blunt like he’s reminding her she is not an American and doesn’t work for the FBI, she’s just a movie star playing a cop. Tom Hooper knows that eyes are important in cinema, so he has directed the actors in The Danish Girl to search the corners of rooms with their glances like they can’t find their keys or a mouse just ran by. He makes them doll-like, ventriloquist’s dummies, and when they talk to each other they converse in need-speak, like they are explaining which line to get into at the DMV. The film begins in 1925, so Hooper has imparted a silent-movie feel to The Danish Girl. Everyone in this movie’s Europe has been hypnotized by Dr. Caligari or tortured like Joan of Arc. Eddie Redmayne, as Lili, plays along, his coyness telegraphing femininity. He puts a flower between his teeth like Chaplin and seems forever on the verge of picking up two forks and sticking them into dinner rolls to make them dance. Since the film is about painters, Hooper hired Jan Vermeer to be his cinematographer. Women’s captivity is the great theme of most of 2015’s Oscar-nominated films, and Ex Machina is the most basic and manipulative of these, the tale of a hapless john sent on a bizarre mission by a pimp to see if he can free his whore. The sordidness is made oblique because the characters are a programmer, a genius CEO, and a pixie android, and it’s set in a sterile underground lab. This Taxi Driver for nerds is heavy with the fear of superwomen empowered by data-driven emotional intelligence and synthetic physical perfection, and hence able to outflank male idiots savants. Ex Machina succeeds as a mindfuck stage play for three actors, Domhnall Gleeson, Oscar Isaac, and Alicia Vikander, who were in a total of about a dozen films this year, all less weird and talky than this one. The unavoidable onslaught of virtual reality and artificial intelligence will make stories like this ever more relatable to lonely techies in search of mechanical love in robot form, but not to me. There’s not even room in my apartment for a vacuum cleaner. Nothing better could have been expected from the seventh film in the Rocky franchise than this flight from Hollywood back to Philadelphia. The savvy, intelligence, and heart of director Ryan Coogler’s screenplay equals his achievement in getting an assignment like this after making Fruitvale Station in Oakland at age 26. Boxing movies come with built-in emotional manipulation, and this one is no exception, establishing a family for Donnie (Michael B. Jordan) by bringing back a Rocky Balboa stricken with lymphoma. Stallone will go down in movie history as the only star of his generation willing to make way for Millennials and for black America like this. Michael B. Jordan’s Donnie, a pro-am boxer, rejects his status as the son of Rocky’s rival, Apollo Creed, and exiles himself to working-class Philadelphia, where he cajoles Rocky into training him. When he finally puts on his father’s red-white-and-blue trunks before the big fight, the moment is hokey but astute. He’s forced to imitate a father who didn’t raise him and who is not there to see what’s he made of himself. At the movie’s end, Rocky’s illness is left uncured and Donnie isn’t quite a champion, leaving the story ready for an eighth round. The last scene, on the steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art, predicts the ending of Star Wars: The Force Awakens but undercuts its own myth. It’s clear that Ryan Coogler got cheated by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Is there any doubt Creed was as well-directed and well-written as, say, Room? Coming a year after Selma’s Ava DuVernay and David Oyelowo were ignored in the Oscar nominations, ignoring Coogler was especially troubling, proof of the problem #OscarsSoWhite exposed—that the Academy consciously ignores black artists. Jada Pinkett Smith’s viral video about her husband Will Smith’s lack of a nomination for Concussion was justified, even if Janet Hubert’s response video, reminding Smith that years ago he had refused to stand with other cast members of the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air when they wanted a raise, exposed Smith as also a victim of karma. The Academy, after all, started out as a union-busting organization. He should have supported his fellow actors in contract negotiations. Yet Smith had played the Oscar game strictly according to the rules by starring in Concussion. It was a medical drama about a controversial subject written and directed by a conscientious filmmaker, in which Smith had to change his appearance and his accent—pure Oscar bait. If Sandra Bullock was nominated (and won) for The Blind Side, a sappy football drama, Smith deserved at least a nomination for a serious one. If Will Smith, who has been loyal to Hollywood’s way of doing things—loyal to a fault—can’t get a nomination, what chance did Ryan Coogler have? He made a good sports drama, a big film that made money and that critics liked. The Academy told him only Sylvester Stallone deserved recognition for it, the same way no one but four white screenwriters were recognized for Straight Outta Compton. The first half generates excitement as it explores teenage life in 1980s Compton and brings the group together. Then F. Gary Gray’s biopic switches gears and splits Eazy-E (Jason Mitchell), Dr. Dre (Corey Hawkins), and Ice Cube (O’Shea Jackson Jr.) into a tripartite version of a Hollywood serious-composer biopic like Rhapsody in Blue. When N.W.A breaks up the film becomes morose, bogged down in cameo parts, recriminations, and ugly management disputes—a history of beefs—before Eazy-E’s sudden illness and death from HIV/AIDS brings it to a close. Eazy-E’s tragedy, treated with the gravity it deserves, is not mitigated by Dre’s success as a businessman or Ice Cube’s prodigiousness. Cube’s dignity and conscience extend to the actor playing him, O’Shea Jackson Jr., his son in real life. Jackson the Younger is a carbon copy of his father who makes him seem even greater than the original; he’s somehow more Cube than Cube. Christopher Wallace Jr. set the precedent for this by playing Biggie as a child in 2009’s Notorious, a film that didn’t get mentioned much in relation to Straight Outta Compton, which was treated as the first biopic to admit rap’s centrality to American culture, maybe because it was from the West Coast. I used to be a movie theater projectionist and sometimes I have an anxiety dream that I’m back working in the booth. I must have been anxious about seeing The Hateful Eight, because the night before I saw it I had a booth dream. In the dream, different machines are in the booth with the two regular 35mm projectors: two 16mm projectors set up next to two 70mm projectors, the gauge Tarantino used for The Hateful Eight. These four new projectors crowding the booth—two of them small and two huge—are old models, battered and tarnished. I ask the theater manager why they’re there. He tells me the director of the movie we’re showing has made sections of the film in these three different gauges and the movie is to be projected that way. This director has also specified what make and model of projector each reel must be shown on, down to the year it was made. As I begin to thread the first reel, I see that the film is old and brittle and has turned pink from age. It has many torn sprockets. I examine it more closely and see it’s not a new movie at all, but a western from the early 1960s by the director Joseph M. Newman. The manager tells me to get going, but when I thread the projector I put a twist in the film, which I notice after I start the movie. I tell the manager it’s going to break, and he says, “Don’t worry. If it breaks we’ll show an old cartoon.” There were stories in the news about projectionists flying to distant cities to work in booths for The Hateful Eight, valiantly making sure the 70mm roadshow screenings went off without a hitch. When I saw it in 70mm in the East Village, I was happy there weren’t any promos for TV shows before it, or ads for soda, or any trailers at all—they couldn’t show them with a 70mm print. If Tarantino has done anything, he’s given us the experience of watching a new movie by itself, on film, without any extraneous crap beforehand to remind us that movies are part of a universe of media streaming elsewhere. Sitting in that theater watching The Hateful Eight put me in the hundred-year flow of people in big cities watching westerns in movie theaters, dreaming of places without skyscrapers and subways. The Hateful Eight is a reflective film in which the Hawksian Tarantino reevaluates the unfair comments he made about John Ford when Django came out. Maybe in rewatching some Ford movies featuring John Wayne in preparation for casting Kurt Russell in a role based on Wayne (and on the constructed authority Wayne brought to his characters—an authority that is questioned and then eliminated in The Hateful Eight), Tarantino realized he has more in common with Ford than he thought. Fordian reference abounds: Russell says “that’ll be the day” like John Wayne in The Searchers; Tim Roth’s character is named Mobray, after an actor in My Darling Clementine who, like Roth, plays a part in a saloon; the explanatory flashback subverts the narrative Liberty Valance–style. The film’s letter from Abraham Lincoln, Ford’s touchstone in American history, proves to be false and dangerous, but a beautiful story, held till the end. Jennifer Jason Leigh spits on that letter. She is the film’s destroyer, a poisoner who exists to upend all the stories men tell each other to justify their violence. A Kali figure of the cinema, Leigh’s Daisy Domergue, with matted hair and blood in her eyes, fights her captivity with a noose around her neck and the severed arm of Russell’s bounty hunter—the arm of the law—dangling from her chains. I saw The Hateful Eight while the occupation of the National Wildlife Refuge was happening in Oregon. Malheur, close to Hateful in French, was a western, too, with a plot like Tarantino’s. Holed up in the middle of nowhere in winter, a group of armed men telling each other bedtime stories about the Constitution threatened to make a bloody mess. Outside, the nation tore itself apart because a large segment of the population refused to give up old myths. The Hateful Eight is Tarantino’s most timely film. Swinging hard for the visionary and missing, Alejandro González Iñárittu’s Revenant combines Andrei Rublev with Apocalypse Now and Saving Private Ryan, unfurling winter panoramas in natural light and adding CGI animals. The heart of the film, the section in which Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) meets Hikuc (Arthur Redcloud) after the buffalo stampede, rises above Iñárittu’s gory conception for a moment, before ending in a hanging and a rape, because if we forget this film’s theme for a second we will be snapped back into it as punishment for daydreaming. The rest is a slog, Klondike Kat crossed with a Matthew Barney film, dominated by Tom Hardy’s distracting-entertaining Appalachian accent. One thing is certain: Iñárittu has finally solved the problem of how to film a realistic bear fight. The next cinematic problem he should tackle is screenwriting. Tinkertoys in a landscape that’s like a painting by Yves Tanguy, while in the foreground the Ed Roth car from the cover of The Birthday Party’s Junk Yard album drives by at 150 miles an hour. The most cartoonish film in a year of films like Warner Brothers cartoons is also one of the best. How? Mad Max: Fury Road is that one-in-a-thousand reboot that will greenlight even more reboots, none of which will justify its existence like this one. Charlize Theron as a one-armed truck driver in post-apocalyptic Australia wears black grease as sunscreen under a buzzcut, a look sufficiently removed from her usual perfume-ad glamour, which is displaced onto the women she is rescuing. Tom Hardy is better muttering than pontificating like he did in The Revenant. The entire cast seems handpicked for a kind of cinematic glory that has little to do with what goes on in other blockbusters. George Miller has done well to stay away from Hollywood and to switch from making animated movies to live-action ones. Miller also remembered to make the film directly about things, not all subtext begging for explication. The scarcity of water, oil wars, the arms trade, and female emancipation jostle for space with the customized vehicles, coming in and out of focus with the blitz. But when it comes to political subtext, it must be acknowledged that Immortan Joe’s demise was predictable from his water distribution method. Pouring thousands of gallons of water on people’s heads from a great height is not the best way to keep them pacified. Better to sell it to them in plastic bottles for 99 cents each. Like J. J. Abrams’s Star Trek reboots, his new Star Wars seems crowdsourced and easy to forget, an app you just closed. Kylo Ren’s mask sticks in my mind because he doesn’t need it and wears it anyway. He’s not a disfigured monster like Darth Vader, he’s handsome Adam Driver dressing up as grandpa on Halloween, preprogrammed for redemption. He’s not evil, he’s just young. Spotlight joins the thin ranks of good contemporary Boston films (Mystic River, The Fighter) and does them one better by offering an explanation for the dark cloud that hangs over the place like the devil looms over the town in Murnau’s Faust. Set in 2001, during the time of The Boston Globe’s exposé of pedophile priests in the Catholic Church, Spotlight glorifies investigative journalism and newspaper publishing for a world without newsprint. The film is spare and didactic, an instructional film explaining a disappearing profession. The editors and reporters in the film are saints whose personal lives are secondary to their work, and the Boston they work in is institutionally corrupt—cops and the courts stand between them and the truth as much as the Church does. It captures an essential truth about Boston, that feeling of drabness mixed with hostility and peculiarity anyone that who has ever had to knock on a stranger’s door in that town has felt. The key scene in this regard is the one in which Rachel McAdams stands at the front door of a disgraced priest, who happily admits to his crimes while his sister barks and snipes, shooing McAdams off. I’m sure that woman puts an orange traffic cone in her parking space in May. Dalton Trumbo (Bryan Cranston), the blacklisted screenwriter at the center of this earnest-frantic biopic, was pro-Soviet and a member of the CPUSA, his politics formed during the Depression. Called before HUAC in 1947, he served time in jail for refusing to name names and was denied work by the studios. After prison, he wrote films under pseudonyms, including Gun Crazy, and won Oscars for two of them. One was Roman Holiday—yes, Roman Holiday was written by a commie. He couldn’t publicly accept or acknowledge his awards until after Kirk Douglas and Otto Preminger broke the blacklist in 1960 by giving him screen credit on Spartacus and Exodus.  As a true-life version of Hail, Caesar! that features many actors familiar from Coen Brothers movies, Trumbo hams up the blacklist. The director, Jay Roach, directed the Austin Powers and Fockers movies, and Trumbo gets over its awkwardness by focusing on the mechanics of screenwriting under duress, which Roach marvels at. Here is a screenwriter willing to risk everything, including his family, to write B movies for low pay under a pseudonym, without compromising his politics. After Austin Powers in Goldmember, that point of view makes sense. Actors play real Hollywood figures with varying degrees of success. Christian Berkel, who plays Otto Preminger, captures his essence, turning the combative auteur into a sly interloper popping up in Highland Park with mordant Viennese panache. Trumbo leaves the impression that the ’50s worked out for everybody in the end, except for poor Louis C. K., as a leftwing screenwriter who smoked too much. Also set in the baby-boomer heaven of the 1950s and early ’60s, Bridge of Spies presents the cold war as genteel and humane compared to the present war on terror. Tom Hanks, a high-powered lawyer but also a middle-class everyman, proves that making deals with our enemies is a better solution than building walls or dropping bombs. Retrofitting the cold war for the end of the Obama era, Bridge of Spies combines the negotiation of international agreements with a Trumpist approach: deals are best handled by private citizens who know better than government officials how to get what’s best for the country. Today, of course, it is this businessman figure who wants to build a border wall, a bellicose reversal of this film’s message. The Coen Brothers cowrote it, but Spielberg’s unwavering belief in American values prevents any cynicism from coming through. At the same time, the film is mature, aware that Hanks is aging and could die of pneumonia without his overcoat from Saks Fifth Avenue. The scene with Hanks and Mark Rylance, as a pensive Soviet spy, listening to a Shostakovich piano concerto on a radio in a prison cell was not something I expected to see in a Spielberg movie. Set in Manhattan and on the road in the winter of 1952, Carol fetishizes the mechanical equipment of surveillance—telephones, cameras, tape recorders. Carol (Cate Blanchett) and Therese (Rooney Mara), soon to be lovers, get into a dove-gray Packard to escape Carol’s family, but can’t avoid the prying men who follow them anyway. Men are confused and pushy in Carol, and almost as forcibly drunk and well-dressed as Cary Grant in the early scenes of North by Northwest. Ed Lachman’s cinematography, in Super 16mm, is by far the most ravishing and understated among these films, a subtle tribute to the medium best suited for the intimacy of furtive glances and hushed conversations. The film is a triumph of art direction and wardrobe, a seductive art object. When Carol tells her husband “we’re not ugly people, Harge,” she is telling the truth about a film that finds beauty in bad situations. Leaving County Wexford, a rule-bound place where shoe polish is not for sale on Sunday because it’s “not a Sunday item,” Eilis, a thoughtful girl played with extraordinary composure by Saoirse Ronan, sails for New York. She moves into a boarding house and gets a job at a department store in Brooklyn, across the East River from the department store in Carol where Therese worked in Todd Haynes’s version of New York in 1952. Eilis meets and falls in love with a handsome Italian American plumber (Emory Cohen, channeling ’50s method actors) who’s as calm and good-hearted as she is. Then she’s whisked back to Ireland for her sister’s funeral and coaxed to stay there by an equally kind young man played by red-haired Domhnall Gleeson, who’s in every movie. Eilis almost makes the decision not to go back to the Brooklyn of 1952, a choice unimaginable to the renters of Brooklyn in 2016, who would take the first boat to that Brooklyn if they could. For all their strenuous effort in vintage bar and restaurant design, they watch a livable Brooklyn drift farther off each day. For Eilis, Brooklyn meant freedom from the past.

"Apr 16, 2018",positive," Ka-chunk, ka-chunk, ka-chunck, back in 1985, the ""Mad Max"" trilogy unceremoniously sputtered to an anticlimactic halt rather than going out on a furious, nitro-boosted blast. That tepid finale, ""Beyond Thunderdome,"" would become the post-apocalyptic Outback series' weak link, an unsatisfactory follow up to its crowning production. That film, ""The Road Warrior"" (1981), not only elevated Mel Gibson to bankable star status in Hollywood, it seamlessly spun together an odd olio of diverse genres without faltering into camp and boasted some of the greatest real-action car stunts recorded on film. What director George Miller and Gibson revved up was an instant cult classic, a box office smash (it covered its budget in the U.S. in one week) and a can-do mashup from Down Under that would become a model that many would try to copy, but few could emulate. With “Mad Max: Fury Road,” (released May 15) the series is back on track, and boldly so. It took decades to get here, but it’s well worth the wait, something well oiled in lineage and ready to sear into the minds of a new generation of thrill-injected converts. Something of a different texture, less polished and more gritty, ""Mad Max"" was conceived out of the OPEC oil crisis in the mid-'70s and the demented juices of Wes Craven and Tobe Hooper. Poetically subversive, the film became a political incineration of glut and the virtuous notion of humanity as inherently good, as few stuck their necks out for their fellow man as civilization slowly imploded. One subtle key ingredient that helped make ""Mad Max"" and ""The Road Warrior"" remain so indelible over time was their pointedly baroque scores composed by Brian May (not to be confused with the renowned guitarist from Queen) that effortlessly flowed with the action, underscoring it and heightening moments of tension with emphatic fist-pumping punctuation. Their classic composition has stood the test of time. For ""Thunderdome,"" which co-starred pop icon Tina Turner as the malevolent overseer of a desert stranded bastion of humanity, Miller went with the diva and a score that sorely missed May’s deft touch. In resurrecting the franchise, Miller knew that re-partnering with Gibson would not be possible as Max was conceived, and gestated, as something akin to James Bond or Tarzan, an ageless warrior battling arch-villains on a landscape changed only by the shifting sands of the zeitgeist of the moment. Jettisoned too, in the new millennia recreation, is the whole oil grab notion, tilled under by today’s alternative energy efforts and climate change fears. Had “Max’s” seminal inception been in the now, one could almost imagine the Lord Humongous, battle axe in hand, lording over a vast desert wasteland covered by a sheet of solar panels harnessed to charge ghoulishly tricked-out electric V8s. In the new ""Mad Max: Fury Road,"" the petrol, so precious in ""The Road Warrior,"" seems relatively abundant by comparison — and bullets too. Out in the desert sea, patrolled by clans of punked-out marauders, there's the Bullet Farm and Gas Town, a massive refinery that belches evil carbon clouds into the sky. What's scarce in the 2015 ""Max"" is water, green space and nubile women who can bear children. Those that can are stunning to behold in thin gauze that might drive some teenage boys wild as they're played by Victoria's Secret models or the progeny of rock ‘n’ roll royalty — Lenny Kravitz's daughter, Zoë and Elvis Presley's granddaughter, Riley Keough. We never get to go to the Bullet Farm or Gas Town. They remain distant images on the red horizon as Furiosa (Charlize Theron), charged with a shopping/raid mission by ""Fury Road's"" resident baddie, Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne, so unforgettable as the Toecutter in the original ""Mad Max"" and downright outlandish here looking like a Morlock on steroids) a.k.a. Dad (probably because he holds the keys to all the babes' chastity belts), decides to go off course on a little joy ride. This doesn't bode well with Joe, the Bullet Farmer (Richard Carter) or any of the other bloodthirsty factions suddenly on the tail of Furiosa and her war tanker loaded with live flesh and hope. Where is the new Max in all this? Yes, Tom Hardy, the guy who was a sheer menace as Bane in ""The Dark Knight Rises"" and so thespian in ""Locke,"" makes a fine Max. He's the draw, but this is really Theron's film. Her Furiosa, an enhanced 2.0 version of the Woman Warrior from ""The Road Warrior,"" comes fully imbued with the resolve and maternal sensibilities of Sigourney Weaver's Ripley from the ""Alien"" franchise. Part cyborg and always thinking ahead, she drives the film while Keays-Byrne gobbles up chunks of the screen time too. That main guy, listed up in the title, he's just along for the ride — and what a ride it is. When we first meet Max, he's barely finished eating a two headed gecko — raw! — before being picked off by a detachment of Joe's albino tweekers and harnessed as a sack of blood, mainlined into the arteries of the chosen War Boys — fanatic and finely conditioned malevolents, who like many of today's indoctrinates of terror are willing to die for a ""greater cause"" without understanding the ramifications of the chess game being played above their heads. ""Fury Road"" is one long chase sequence that borrows much from ""The Road Warrior"" (the music box nostalgically symbolizing innocence, a faulty sawed-off shot gun and a resilient tanker fortified in barbwire and under siege from a limitless foe), but also puts its own stamp on the series without tipping it over. Miller who has made 10 features — four ""Maxes,"" two ""Happy Feet"" and a ""Babe"" — had been incubating the project for a decade and a half. His diligent care and commitment to the perfect shot and live-action stunt work — not CGI enhanced zaniness (though there is some) like the ""Fast and Furious"" films — is aesthetically evident and underscored by the furious, yet fluid editing. As far as chase scenes go, this is as close to William Friedkin making ""The French Connection"" or ""To Live and Die in L.A."" on the ""really did that"" scale as one might see in their lifetime these days. The thrill per second ratio is off the charts, not to mention a tribe of women called the Vuvalini and a monster rock show that follows Joe's every move. Some might be well within their purview to call ""Fury Road"" bombastic, but none in their right mind could ever call it dull. Whether Miller set out to make ""Fury Road"" as an eco-pro message (green space is nonexistent) or not, the articulation of oppression, especially when it comes to the indentured women assigned for breeding and feeding, is squarely there and timely. Hardy and Theron play off each other beautifully too. If there's any throttle back to ""Fury Road"" it's that the new Max lacks soul and purpose. Gibson's warrior of the wasteland was something you could sink your teeth into and feel. The man lost his wife and child and that's what pushed him over to the edge of moral ambiguity — think Clint Eastwood's Man with No Name. It was visceral and real. Here, Hardy's Max is just a survivor haunted by the past in a way that feels half-hearted, blanched and doesn't fuel the character. It's inconsequential, however, as ""Fury Road"" is all about adrenaline and forward motion. There's never any let up from the get go. Before Max can utter his first words he's already been snatched, shackled (Bane-esque face plate and all) and mounted to the grill of a muscle car with an IV running to his blood needy host driving the jalopy of mayhem hot after Furiosa. In the end, Miller has done it and done it righteously — reimagining a sturdy franchise and living up to the original, while kicking the tired reboot to the curb. ""Fury Road"" is rife with activity and fertile with ideas. Rumor has it there's two follow ups in the works. If Miller's integrity is a staunch as it is here, they're sure to be smashes as well.

Cofundador y editor en FotografíaCalato.com y NoEsEnSerie.com, y crítico de Cinencuentro.com, MeGustaElCine.com, y Ventana Indiscreta. Mad Max: Fury Road es una de las mejores películas de acción de los últimos años. Punto. No es necesario ser fanático de las cintas anteriores ni del subgénero de películas postapocalípticas para disfrutar de esta producción; sus increíbles efectos especiales, grandes actuaciones, y escenas de acción increíblemente tensas y emocionantes. «Furia en el camino» debería ser utilizada en escuelas de cine para mostrar cómo desarrollar acción y emoción, suspenso y adrenalina. La película simplemente me dejó sin aliento. George Miller (guionista y director no solo de esta entrega, si no también de la trilogía original protagonizada por Mel Gibson) esperó treinta años para dirigir una nueva entrega de la saga de Mad Max, pero después de haber visto el producto final, puedo decir que la espera definitivamente valió la pena. Después todo, le dio la oportunidad de usar mejores efectos especiales, construir escenas de acción más locas y salvajes, y usar a un actor protagonista más joven y menos controvertido, así como a una de las mejores actrices hollywoodenses contemporáneas. Pero lo más importante es lo que dicha espera representa: Miller esperó tanto tiempo porque quería tener una historia que contar, y no porque quería hacer una secuela simplemente para ganar dinero. La historia es simple, más no simplista. Siento que Miller escribió un primer guión y, para enfatizar las emociones más que la historia en sí, le “sacó la grasa”, reduciéndolo a los básico y lo esencial. Hay pocos diálogos, Max casi no habla (al menos durante los primeros dos tercios de metraje), y la trama simplemente se trata de llevar a los personajes del punto A al punto B (para luego regresar al A… igual no es demasiado complicado). Se trata de un acercamiento directo pero efectivo, dándole una sensación de sencillez a la cinta muy refrescante en una época en la que muchos blockbusters se sienten “hinchados” e innecesariamente complicados (te estoy mirando a ti, «Era de Ultrón»). Como deben imaginar, el protagonista es Max (Tom Hardy, más conocido por interpretar al villano Bane en El Caballero de la Noche Asciende), quien comienza el filme barbado y sucio en medio del desierto. Después de una breve persecución, es atrapado por los secuaces de Immortan Joe (Hugh Keayes-Byrne), un señor de la guerra que gobierna una de las pocas ciudades que existen en este mundo postapocalíptico desolado y seco, en donde la gente se pelea por el agua y la gasolina. Su estancia en la ciudad, sin embargo, será breve, ya que unirá fuerzas con la valiente Imperator Furiosa (la gran Charlize Theron), una general de Joe que lo ha traicionado y se ha llevado a sus tres novias, interpretadas por Rosie Huntington-Whiteley (Transformers 3), Zoë Kravitz (X-Men: Primera Clase, Divergente), Riley Keough y Courtney Eaton. Juntos, emprenderán un viaje al “Lugar Verde”, una suerte de santuario en donde podrán vivir en paz. ¿El problema? Están siendo perseguidos por Joe y todo su séquito. Hacer una mala película de acción es muy fácil; si no, véase la mayoría de la filmografía de Michael Bay (especialmente sus últimas tres películas de «Transformers»). Hacer una buena película de acción, por otra parte, es muy difícil. No solo es necesario presentarles al público secuencias impresionantes llenas de explosiones, balaceras y violencia por doquier; también se tiene que desarrollar tensión y emoción, hacer que la audiencia se muerda las uñas y se les erice el pelo, y para ello se tiene que tener personajes bien definidos por los cuales uno se preocupe, no súperheroes invencibles y perfectos. No solo eso, también se tiene que filmar y editar la acción de manera clara, sin abusar de cámaras en mano o cortes rápidos. Y adivinen qué… Mad Max: Furia en el camino hace todo esto y mucho más. La película es una combinación de todo el caos que uno podría encontrar en las producciones del anteriormente mencionado Bay con la locura de las últimas películas de Rápidos y Furiosos y la intensidad de una cinta para mayores de 18 años a la antigua. Las escenas de acción, con la ayuda del ingenioso diseño de personajes y carros, son originales e inventivas, y jamás se sienten como ideas recicladas de filmes anteriores. Además, a pesar de que la acción es el foco de la historia, Miller logra presentarnos personajes creíbles y bien definidos, con motivaciones verosímiles y antecedentes presentados de manera breve pero clara (generalmente a través de flashbacks, al menos en el caso de Max). Lo astuto de la película es que jamás se va por las ramas; solo nos enseña lo que necesitamos saber de Max, solo nos presenta lo que necesitamos saber del mundo en el que se desarrolla. A muchos les podría parecer muy rápida o poco explícita, pero a mi me encantó. Las actuaciones son todas excelentes. Tom Hardy se transforma en Max desde la primera escena, jamás haciendo que extrañemos a Mel Gibson. Quizás se deba a que han pasado ya treinta años desde la entrega anterior, pero nunca sentí que Hardy fuera inferior a Gibson, o una copia barata del controvertido actor. Pero a pesar de que Hardy es muy bueno, a mi parecer la verdadera estrella de la cinta es Charlize Theron como Furiosa. Rapada, sucia y molesta, interpreta al personaje a la perfección, y resulta muy creíble como una lideresa fuerte pero con motivaciones muy emocionales. La escena en la que se arrodilla en medio del desierto y grita después de una horrible decepción me pareció particularmente desgarradora.  Las interpretaciones secundarias también son sólidas. Nicolas Hoult, irreconocible con un maquillaje blanco y lleno de cicatrices, da una actuación sorprendentemente sutil, convirtiendo a su personaje potencialmente estereotípico en algo un poco más interesante. Las novias son los personajes menos desarrollados, pero a la vez son presentadas como mujeres fuertes y con cierto grado de independencia (apropiada reacción después de haber vivido como objetos por tantos años), lo cual me gustó mucho. Y como el villano principal, Immortan Joe, Hugh Keayes-Byrne es muy bueno; con su gruesísima voz, look fuera de lo común y actitud despiadada, logra desarrollar a un antagonista extremadamente intimidante y memorable. Lo curioso de Mad Max: Furia en el Camino es que, a pesar de que el título lleva su nombre, la historia no trata necesariamente sobre Max. En realidad la trama se enfoca más en Furiosa, en su viaje y en su búsqueda de esperanza, y Max simplemente se une a ella. Esto no quiere decir que él no sea el protagonista; de hecho, me animaría a decir que ambos lo son, lo cual le da una dinámica interesante a la película. Mucho se ha dicho de que el filme es feminista, y después de haberlo visto, no estoy completamente seguro de ello. Lo único que puedo decir es que Miller nos presenta personajes femeninos fuertes e independientes, y que de algún modo critica a las sociedades que abusan de las mujeres y a la gente que cree que sirven únicamente para fines reproductivos (sí, hay gente así). Se trata de un contexto interesante para una historia de este tipo, un contexto con el cual uno se puede identificar, y el que cada uno ya tendría que interpretar a su manera para comprobar si verdaderamente es feminista o no. Puede que no lo parezca después de ver los trailers algo exagerados, pero «Mad Max: Furia en el camino» favorece los efectos especiales prácticos por sobre los digitales. Se nota que la mayor parte de la cinta fue grabada en los desiertos de Namibia, con carros de verdad, explosiones y choques reales, y dobles de riesgo. Esto, junto con la hermosa dirección de fotografía, la cual nos presenta escenas diurnas muy coloridas (llenas de naranjas y celestes) y escenas nocturnas azulezcas y muy estilizadas, le da una estética realista y sucia y grasienta a la película, estética de la cual muchas películas de acción contemporáneas carecen. No llegué a ver la película en 3D, pero por los comentarios que he escuchado, al parecer está bien implementado.  Por otra parte, la música, compuesta por Junkie XL, ayuda a desarrollar la palpable sensación de tensión y emoción que se siente a lo largo de la película. Me gustó que la música muchas veces sea diegética; el ejército de Immortan Joe tiene entre sus rangos a tamboristas y a un ciego que toca una guitarra eléctrica que lanza fuego (en serio, ¿en qué otra película encontrarías a un personaje así?), quienes contribuyen al soundtrack en algunas escenas. La música es muy buena a pesar de que, por momentos, se siente como una copia del estilo de Hans Zimmer.  Mad Max: Furia en el Camino combina las sensibilidades algo más tradicionales de George Miller (planos largos, acción filmada sin abusar de cámaras en mano, violencia brutal muy merecedora de su calificación para mayores de 18 años) con la espectacularidad de un blockbuster moderno (grandes efectos especiales, personajes grotescos y originales, una gran sensación de escala) para crear un gran espectáculo de acción y emoción, adrenalina y testosterona, un baile lleno de color y explosiones. Se trata, básicamente, de una gran persecución, pero una persecución grabada con estilo y con talento, poblada por personajes interesantes y bien desarrollados. Salí del cine temblando y con las manos sudorosas, y ese es el mejor cumplido que se le puede dar a una película de este tipo. ¡Que vengan más secuelas!"

Starring Tom Hardy, Charlize Theron, Nicholas Hoult, Hugh Keays-Byrne, Rosie Huntington-Whitely, Nathan Jones, Megan Gale, Zoe Kravitz, Riley Keough, Josh Helman, Jennifer Hagan, Abbey Lee Kershaw, Courtney Easton. In a stark desert landscape where humanity is broken, two rebels just might be able to restore order: Max, a man of action and of few words, and Furiosa, a woman of action who is looking to make it back to her childhood homeland. When George Miller said that Mad Max: Fury Road would be a two-hour long car chase, he wasn’t lying. There are maybe three or four moments serving as downtime between action sequences, allowing Miller to further the plot (which is actually quite fun and doesn’t bog down the exhilarating road rage) and develop his characters. The ratio of action to story is still intentionally one-sided, but what’s most remarkable is that not a second of Mad Max: Fury Road is wasted or feels superfluous. It’s a rollercoaster ride from the very start and is destined to be remembered not just as a successful resurrection of the Mad Max franchise (there hasn’t been an entry in 30 years) but one of the most unique blockbuster films in recent memory. In an age where CGI and computer effects dominate the presentation of these Hollywood epics, Mad Max: Fury Road takes a risky approach for the modern era by using practical effects. As a matter of fact, over 80% of the movie uses practical effects, and it shows. There’s an early scene where Immortan Joe (a tyrannical leader of a wasteland citadel played by Hugh Keays-Byrne) is being fitted with his war armor, and it’s impossible to not notice disgusting lumps, severely unhealthy skin conditions, and more. The scene only lasts about 10 seconds but is enough to showcase that some serious work went into the costume and makeup effects, and leave the impression that the rest of the movie is going to be one hell of a visual treat. Undoubtedly people are coming for the carmageddon chaos, but the design of Mad Max: Fury Road oozes a personality that is often missing from Hollywood blockbusters. It’s evident that George Miller is putting forth maximum effort into this production, painting an unrestrained canvas of crazy. For a wasteland the movie is filled with a wide array of colors, whether it be on clothing, armor, vehicles, and even flares. Instead of packing the movie with one type of enemy, there is a variety to them and their tactics; like dudes with flamethrowers attached to their guitars, or dudes with poles rigged to their vehicles that vault them all over the skies. The movie never sticks to our heroes battling one group for too long, constantly shaking it up so each battle is free from repetition. Thanks to this very distinct and often ludicrous approach to the world building and characters, by association the frantic and chaotic chase sequences, feel, well mad. Even though admittedly some of the action gets so wild it can become slightly incoherent (I still have no idea exactly how the villain met his demise), what is going on is ridiculously ambitious, coming across as a spectacle that needs to be witnessed. The violence is also shot from a healthy amount of angles (distance shots, close-ups, first-person shots, and even some beautiful shots off in the distance from the side) making the cinematography of Mad Max: Fury Road incredibly tight. No shortcuts or tricks were taken to make filming the carnage easy, resulting in something that is not only intense but marvelous to ogle. Normally I don’t advocate 3-D, but George Miller definitely makes good use of it here, to the point where it actually enhances the experience. There’s something about seeing pounds of dirt bounce up in your face and desert heat radiating off the screen that surprisingly works without interfering with the movie. There is also a money-shot towards the end when so much destruction is flying at your face you may hit the deck out of instinct. Normally 3-D just feels there or isn’t very noticeable, but here it becomes another part of a fantastic whole. It also helps that Tom Hardy makes for a pretty good Max that is able to capture his very guarded personality and mental struggles of coming to terms with the death of his family. There will be some diehard fans that will always prefer Mel Gibson, but it can’t be denied that Tom Hardy delivers in the role. The supporting cast is also easy to like and filled with quirky characters, like Nux (Nicholas Hoult), who will do anything to impress his comically over-the-top villainous leader Immortan Joe. Charlize Theron also gives a fine performance as Furiousa, the battle hardened rebel smuggling out Joe’s breeders in hopes of finding sanctuary for everyone back in her homeland. She sells the hell out of the role with her shaven head, and generally looks like a total badass amongst all of the mayhem. It also must be noted that during the brief instances of peace, all of our protagonists receive some minor character development, and are all brought together by a common theme of redemption. That’s not to say the story is high art, but when there are motives driving the characters in their action sequences everything comes much more alive and is easier to get lost in. Even the breeders being carried have their moments to shine, when they easily could have been relegated to the eye-candy that they initially appear to be. While I would say that Mad Max: Fury Road is readily accessible to those not familiar with the franchise, the self-contained story can get a little confusing at times. It’s not surprising because the original cut was over two hours, meaning that more of the exposition and plot details are axed, but it’s still frustrating when some minor things get a little lost in the shuffle. In the end it’s not too bothersome considering the amount of satisfaction you will get from the wild ride, but it still exists as a minor problem. Before closing this out it also needs to be mentioned that the sound design, mixing, and soundtrack for Mad Max: Fury Road are intense, upping the intensity of every single beat of action. There seems to be a running theme where trailers will use the best piece of music for the film in the trailer, but not actually have it in the movie. That isn’t the case here as the heart-pounding battle music from the trailer kicks in numerous times. The soundtrack also feels incredibly unique when you have heavy metal blaring from flamethrower guitars and drums pounding from battle-criers blasting in conjunction with the original music. Everything about Mad Max: Fury Road comes across as the antithesis to the modern blockbuster. It is a bloody violent R-rated action flick using the cinematic tricks of yesteryear to create something that can fit in wonderfully alongside what has now been accepted as the standard. Mad Max: Fury Road is that rare successful franchise resurrection; it is an 80s action film with the budget of a modern era film and cinematography so mind-blowing it feels as if it was filmed with technology from the future."

"Sep 20, 2017",positive," Also set in a dsytopian world, Fury Road sees Furiosa on the run from tyrant Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne) after she takes away his prized possessions - five young women who function as breeders of his army. Fans of the original Mad Max movies might feel cheated that Max (Tom Hardy) has become a bystander in his own movie. But if it's pure adrenaline they miss, there's nothing to worry about."
"Aug 22, 2017",positive,[Mad Max's] visual intelligence and wit vastly outweigh its concessions to the genre.
"Aug 16, 2017",positive,Mad Max: Fury Road is the perfect chick flick for the discerning viewer who prefers her protagonist to be more Ellen Ripley than a musical Charlie's Angel.

You made it all the way through the article – I hope that means you liked it (or if not ‘liked’ it, gleaned some useful information from it). Tyee articles are known for being quite lengthy, so we appreciate when people spend some quality time with our work.
 
Listen, I’ll get to the point – the article you just read was made possible because our non-profit newsroom was able to pay a talented journalist to research and write it. And we can only afford to do that because of our business model, which relies on a certain percentage of our readers signing up for our paid membership program called Tyee Builders.
 
The traditional business model for journalism in Canada has been completely disrupted, and we’re witnessing a slow collapse as corporate newsrooms buy up distressed publications, lay people off, and suck the value out of them before declaring bankruptcy. And it doesn’t help that tech giant Meta has blocked Canadian news on their Facebook and Instagram platforms.
 
Between 1 to 2 per cent of people who visit The Tyee contribute financially, but amazingly, that small percentage is enough to fund half of our overall budget. And it means we can operate without a paywall, too. 1 per cent of people giving means 99 per cent of people get access to quality, fact-based journalism from a talented team of journalists who live and work in B.C., Alberta, and across Canada. We think that’s pretty remarkable.
 It's a good sign when you bump into a couple of people you know who are just exiting the film that you are about to see. It's an even better sign when those people say, ""I wish I was you, seeing it again for the first time."" So it was with Mad Max: Fury Road. Director George Miller's robust reboot opened in wide release this previous week. Already the critics are frothing with praise and the plebs are lining up en masse. But is the hype all gunning engines and spinning wheels, or is there real power beneath the hood of this hot rod? For anyone who came of age during the original trilogy of Mad Max, The Road Warrior and Beyond Thunderdome, a holy set list on constant repeat at video parties in the 1980s, Fury Road is a welcome addition. While the original conceit of the Mad Max universe is maintained, the new film surpasses its origins, and offers up a brand new post-Apocalyptic funhouse ride, with a surprisingly thoughtful subtext. In a world that has fallen into chaos and ruination, humans have descended to little more than a pack of wild dogs, savaging what is left of the place, and then turning on each other in snarling snapping frenzy. Resources -- gas, water and food -- are controlled by the powerful through ritualized violence and constant threat. Watching the film one occasionally has the sinking feeling that we're not all that far from removed from this fictional place. Water is doled out in measured doses, and the population is imprisoned by desperation and need. It looks a lot like current day California. But put those thoughts out of your mind for the moment, you're here for some escapism, correct? Do not fear, the film transports quite unlike any other action opus released this year. Indeed, there is nothing quite like a good old-fashioned science fiction dystopia to take away your worries about doing your taxes or going to the dentist. But for all its hammer and tongs approach, the film is curiously gentle in some ways. Scene changes are denoted by a fade to black and silence is used to great effect. Some of the most powerful moments take place in stillness when humanity's dire state is sketched out underneath an impassive heaven. God is long gone, and all that's left is brute survival. The centre of the film is anchored by two oddly calm performances. Tom Hardy, who spent another film messing about in cars in Locke, plays the titular Max. PTSD flashbacks have rendered him half-mad, and his introduction in the film plays like a gothic nightmare of dead little girls and disembodied voices. Pity poor Max, he is truly lost in the wilderness of his own mind, wandering and alone. In a base rumble, he sketches out the reality of the universe that he occupies: ""As the world fell, each of us in our own way was broken. It was hard to know who was more crazy -- me or everyone else."" The other pillar of the film is that of Imperator Furiosa, played by the statuesque Charlize Theron. With a metal arm and a coolly raging gaze, Furiosa is a driver and a soldier. She is more than Max's equal in strength and tenacity. Unlike her male counterpart, she has the courage of her convictions, and an indomitable reserve of hope embodied in her memories of childhood spent in ""the green place"" -- a lost paradise governed by women, filled with plants and life. Our initial introduction to both these characters is brusque and peremptory. Almost before we're ready, we enter the wasteland, hotly pursued by a posse of souped-up vehicular maniacs. The film largely resembles one of Ed ""Big Daddy"" Roth's Ratfink cartoons come to wild life. This aesthetic is carried throughout, not just in the design of the cars and trucks bristling with sharpened spikes like so many fast moving sea urchins, but also in the people themselves. Pinioned, pierced and festooned in face and body, cheeks and mouths, slit wide and then stapled shut, they too resemble assemblages of bits and parts, repurposed and collaged together for maximum threat and hostility. In his attention to detail, Miller brings the goods in ripe, often overflowing abundance. Rich, thick Rococo embellishment abounds, lavished on like heavy icing on an overstuffed cake. It is luxuriant, generous, and occasionally bonkers. There is so much on display that the eye often struggles to keep up. This is a film that will no doubt keep fan boys and girls marvelling over the care and time allocated towards creating a fully realized world. But the filmmaker doesn't let detail clog the story -- the thing moves like it was on fire. Caught and caged within the first 10 minutes of the story, Max's wild bid for freedom functions as full-on immersion in the world of the film. His prison is a stone citadel, overseen by a dictator named Immortan Joe (played by Hugh Keays-Byrne in a nice nod to the original film). Joe is a grotesquery that puts Darth Vader to shame, with his powdered pustule-ridden body, kohl-ringed eyes and breathing apparatus that resembled an old-fashioned bellows. His control over the ragged populace is kept in place by an army of soldiers called the War Boys -- a collection of young white men bubbling with tumours, who derive their allegiance to their leader from the idea that death in battle will result in life everlasting in Valhalla. A young War Boy named Nux (played by Nicholas Hoult) provides much of this back-story. At least I think that he does; the speed with which he describes his society is sometimes hard to understand, with everyone yelling on about valor, victory and glory in Australian accents. But the basic gist is that whoever controls the resources controls the power, and so it is here as well. Precious water (pumped from an underground aquifer) is measured out just enough to keep the people in check. Old Immortan puts the dick in dictator in other classic ways, maintaining his lineage on the backs of a harem of beautiful young women that he keeps stowed away in an underground vault. Like Mormon wives, the women are kept impregnated and under tight control, breeding stock for the continuation of male power. Let me take a brief moment here to marvel at the men's rights groups who are calling for a boycott of the film, based on the idea that it is a female-led story. One wag called it a ""Trojan Horse"" feminist film. Feel free to scratch your head a little bit about this. Who would you relate to here? If it's some old white dude with a monster truck, and a bevy of Aryan followers, you might want to renew your white power membership, along with your men's rights card. But back to the story at hand! The action kicks off when the wives stage a jailbreak, helped along by Furiosa and her awesome truck, the War Rig, a majestic creature, bedecked and festooned with weapons of every stripe and powered by mother's milk. I kid you not -- breast milk is at the heart of this massive beast of a vehicle. But before you get stuck pondering such curious inclusions, the plot picks you up by the scruff of the neck and drags you along. The chase is on, and really the chase never stops, it just keeps going, getting bigger, wilder, and more gonzo cuckoo, picking up speed, until it rockets into your gut and brain. But despite the velocity with which the action takes place, the film maintains an internal narrative drive that never falters. Namely that we want these women and their unborn children to escape the clutches of the monster that would rape and imprison them. As the runaway women streak across the desert, Joe and his army of followers strap Max to the front of a moving vehicle and take off after them. Other male tribes (from Gas Town and the Bullet Farm, respectively) come to Immortan Joe's aid. These groups are presided over by male leaders with Elephantiasis, prosthetic noses and various other conditions. The men aren't looking so good. This is in stark contrast to the women who are sheathed in diaphanous muslin, glossy with good health and pampering. Indeed our first extended look at these babes finds them watering themselves down in the desert like they were on a Vogue fashion shoot. This posse of Apocalyptic supermodels initially comes across as little more than pretty cattle, but these women have grit, and soon enough, they're fighting for their own emancipation and freedom. They start by cutting off their chastity belts and leaving them by the side of the road. The Underground Railroad theme of liberating folk from sexual slavery is implicit, but like much of the film, it is only one more note in the grand Wagnerian thunder. Simply add it to score, like the trumpet blasts that mark the entrance of the Valkyries, and let this rock opera roar. Götterdämmerung and away we go! Hacking, shooting, slicing and dicing in a cacophony of screaming engines and bodies flying through the air like bits of ragged confetti. It is a veritable feast of old-fashioned ultra violence. Add in lighting sandstorms, leap-frogging motorcyclists, flame-shooting guitarists or best yet, the ""Vuvalini,"" a band of old lady bikers who maintain gardens in their handbags and fight like ancient wrinkly ninjas. Any film that makes a gang of weathered old grandmas into a super heroic fighting force has my full support. Is this film hysterical? Certainly. It is good dumb fun? Yes, indeed. But there is something more than just another science fiction romp. As curious as it may seem, you care that these characters survive in the face of the insanely ridiculous odds that are ranged against them. Here is where the film sets itself apart from the rest of the pack. It is equitable and fair in a way that few other action films are. Both men and women are given the scope to carve out their characters in the fullest spectrum of light and dark. I had every intention of liking the film, but this sense of justice made me love it. Tom Hardy, an actor of some power, supports the action, using his physical heft and his voice, a velvety cat-tongued thing that scratches and purrs to great effect. Theron embodies her own brand of heroic with solidity and strength. Whether she is smearing grease over her close-cropped hair or saving Max from certain death with her robot arm, the pair is well-balanced, and you root for them to see themselves in each other. In this, the film is oddly romantic, albeit of the doomed and desperate variety. But as the men discover, the love of a strong woman can make you a better man, and an even better road warrior. In the film's penultimate scene, when Max finally tells Furiosa his real name, making low noises of alarm in his throat, it is an act of bravery that surpasses hanging upside down on a moving truck.

"Aug 10, 2017",positive," This summer’s “Tomorrowland” from Disney and director Brad Bird and “Mad Max: Fury Road,” a “reboot” of the original Mad Max trilogy from the 1970s and ’80s from Australian director George Miller, go together better than you might think at first glance. Seeing them in tandem makes all the difference. “Mad Max: Fury Road” is the typical post-apocalyptic dystopian flick with themes of hope and redemption and regeneration. The lead characters are courageous, violent fighters and hope is a mirage. In “Tomorrowland,” the apocalypse is pending. There is still time to change, to do something. The main characters have optimistic energy, vision, and willpower. The only violence I recall is a bunch of human-looking robots are destroyed in a shop fight. “Tomorrowland” stops the forward — and backward — thrust of the “Mad Max” gaggle of mashed up reconstituted vehicles dead in their desert tracks and seems to ask, in a total un-Disney way, “Aren’t you tired of all these mayhem and scorched earth survivalist movies? Do you really think these cataclysmic events are inevitable? What about doing something to prevent these portent events in the first place? How and who would do it? The politicians? Corporations? Think again.” “Mad Max: Fury Road” features Charlize Theron as Imperator Furiosa (Latin for “furious commander”), a woman seeking redemption, though from what we will have to wait for the sequel to learn. She seems to be following the leader of a huge group of nuclear holocaust survivalists, Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), but in their trek across a barren landscape, she strikes her own course toward the Green Place where she was born. Hidden inside Furiosa’s tanker are several women, kind of like “sister wives” to the scarred leader, Joe. They are breeders for his “family.” A true despot, Joe realizes something is amiss and the caravan goes after her. He controls everything at his headquarters, The Citadel, especially water, to keep the sick, poor, and damaged survivors at bay. Joe’s survivalists have captured Max Rockatansky (Tom Hardy) as a source of blood for Nux (Nicholas Hoult). Max and Nux are bound so he can keep the supply of blood going and they take off in pursuit of Furiosa’s rig, too. To make a long story shorter, both Max and Nux join the women with Joe and his minions in hot pursuit. After making it through a narrow canyon passage, arranged ahead of time by Furiosa, they encounter a group of older women, a remnant, protecting the desert of what used to be the Green Place.  They decide to return together to Joe’s Citadel because it has water. The oldest woman carries a bag with seeds in it; one has taken root and a flash of green leaves is pushing through. Off the survivors go, promising a sequel as the credits start to roll. Nothing about this story is tame. It is filled with relentless non-stop action, violence with a hint of humor. The mutant blind rock singer-flame thrower Doof Warrior (iOTA), who is strapped to one of Joe’s lead vehicles with bungee cords, looks like a leftover member of the Motley Crue. It is so incongruous that all you can do is laugh. There is mention of hope and redemption and life-giving water here and there. A priest friend wrote on Facebook that “Mad Max: Fury Road” is “socially corrosive” from beginning to end. Actually I think this is what the movie is about: the consequences of uncaring, socially corrosive behavior will lead to worldwide disaster. The question is: what do you do about it? How do you restore the environment, order, and life itself? It will take a spectacular cinematic dystopian revolution — at least this is where “Mad Max” leaves us as a sequel (or sequels) is surely coming — but so what? We’ve seen it all before just packaged differently. Children are made to kill children in “The Hunger Games”; the “Divergent” franchise, to me, is basically the same story. We can perhaps look to “The Giver” and “Fahrenheit 451” as the source of the post-apocalyptic genre in fiction and movies like “The Omega Man” in 1971. Hollywood keeps pumping out these movies, many based on popular novels, for new generations to flock to theaters to see, only to leave and wait for the next one. (Television’s fascination with the vampire sub-genre tells the same story: the end is near and life after is going to be hell.) Yes, there are those spiritual and religious themes that we console ourselves with. But then what? Although largely panned by critics, ideologically I found “Tomorrowland” to be a breath of fresh air amid the dystopian dust created by peat-and-repeat movies. Both films are fantastical imaginings of future cataclysms to come, one dark and the other much lighter, but “Tomorrowland” risks being different from all the other films in the genre because it appoints, practically anoints, those who can change the course of history. Go backward to 1964. Young Frank Walker (Thomas Robinson) makes his way through the crowds at the New York World’s Fair to the inventor’s pavilion. He is carrying his invention, a jetpack made from a vacuum cleaner, to enter a contest. Will his invention help make the world a better place? But the man in charge, Nix (Hugh Laurie), dismisses it because it is just for fun with no real purpose, though he knows Frank is a very smart kid. Instead, he introduces Frank to Athena (Raffey Cassidy) who seems to be Nix’s daughter (a Disney version of Nux in “Mad Max”?) Frank is smitten and Athena takes him on a tour of a place that exists in another dimension: Tomorrowland (drawn from Disney theme park’s Tomorrowland, of course.) Fast forward into the future, but not too far, and we meet Casey Newton (played by Britt Robertson; note the connection to the name Newton) who is very bright and dismayed at the bad news all around her. The earth is a scary place. It is decaying and the government is shutting down NASA, where her father Eddie (Tim McGraw) is an engineer. Britt seeks out Frank (George Clooney), now a recluse, and when Athena appears again, they fight off some robots and try to save both Tomorrowland and the earth. “Tomorrowland” makes a strong statement about setting aside politics and big profit corporations because of their failure to care for the earth, indeed their record of over-consuming and destroying resources and wants to encourage us to use our imaginations to solve the world’s problems — to let loose the creative energy of artists and scientists to change the inevitable doom that pop culture continually regurgitates for us. The evening news, local or national, report on environmental stories often, if we are paying attention enough to notice and ask questions. Or if we can connect the dots from art and current events that Pope Francis lays out for us in his encyclical, “Laudato Si’, on Care for Our Common Home” perhaps we can join the dreamers, artists, scientists and people of good will to make the changes needed to nurture and preserve the earth for everyone’s benefit, not just the rich and powerful. So why are we compelled to watch disaster as entertainment but as some do, refuse to acknowledge the human element to climate change and the consequences of scorched earth human activity unfolding in front of us? “Mad Max: Fury Road” and films like it, are actually prophetic. “Tomorrowland” takes the bold step of telling us directly what we can do because as loud and explosive as these other films are, we don’t seem able to see, hear, or understand. Maybe this is why Hollywood keeps making them. Regardless, are we not entertained, as Maximus (Russell Crowe) yells to the crowd in Ridley Scott’s 2000 “Gladiator”?  As far as the American film industry and the world audience go, isn't this all that really matters? For mindful viewers and creative people of good will, I hope not."
"Jun 27, 2017",positive," Perhaps most insane of all, it’s as close to a futuristic feminist manifesto as any movie I’ve ever seen (the possible exception being Volker Schlondorff’s under-appreciated “The Handmaid’s Tale.” The credit goes to George Miller, who invented the “Mad Max” franchise almost 40 years ago. That particular Max was played with surly charisma and matinee-idol good looks by Mel Gibson. Aside from a car-strewn vision of a post-apocalyptic future, the “Max’s” have almost nothing in common — no more, say, than Roger Moore and Daniel Craig as 007. The outline is vaguely the same, but everything else is different. The new movie hits the ground running. In a briefly subdued introduction, Max (Tom Hardy) munches on a two-headed lizard and mutters, “My world is made of fire and blood. It was hard to know who was crazier — me or everyone else.” Within minutes, the smart money is on everyone else.  Max runs afoul of a tribe of albino baldies who control the water in this dehydrated dystopia. Their leader is Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne, Toecutter in the original movies)  — a brute whose human parts are barely held together by Hieronymus Bosch-like prosthetics. These War Boys, as they’re known, are experts at using other humans as commodities.  A dozen or more women are hooked up to giant pumps that continuously extract their breast milk.  Max himself is trussed up as a human blood bag attached to Joe’s sickly son Nux (Nicholas Hoult). Having sketched out the bare essentials, Miller then sends us on a non-stop two-hour chase that’s made all the more stunning by the filmmaker’s decision to eschew CGI effects as much as possible. So yes, those are stuntmen engineering those incredible smash-ups, riding motorbikes down impossible inclines or dangling over their quarry like demented escapees from Cirque de Soleil. And that quarry is: a onetime loyalist named Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron, still gorgeous despite her shaved head and robotic arm). On a seemingly routine petrol run, she’s gone rogue, making off with Joe’s most precious possessions. They are a quintet of scantily clad lovelies known as Breeders who apparently survived the Apocalypse by hiding out in a Victoria’s Secret store. Furiosa has vague pre-War Boys memories of a green place where she and her mother lived peacefully before being kidnapped. She intends to bring the Breeders there and Max, who’s graduated from blood bag to hood ornament, ends up on her side. Miller’s original Mad Max trilogy laid out the blueprint for countless future-set films that followed.  Here, he outdoes himself, ramping up the landscapes as much as the action.  A mad dash through a crazy-quilt rock formation suggests “Stagecoach’s” Monument Valley re-imagined by a visionary lunatic. A journey through a foggy quagmire, seemingly inhabited by crone/crane mutants, is eerily disturbing. “Mad Max: Fury Road” has all its teeth, too.  And then some. Because amidst all the sound and fury, Miller still made room for a human element. SaportaReport, founded in February 2009, is a trusted voice in metro Atlanta.

"Jun 27, 2017",positive,You need to go see this film. Wins for women in Hollywood are too rare for you not to.
"Jun 23, 2017",positive," No movie has approached the post-apocalyptic genre quite as definitively as George Miller’s Mad Max series. The Australian director’s vision of a desert wasteland where warlords battle for fuel has been so influential that it remains the gold standard for many fans, and with good reason — the Mad Max films rank among the most bizarre imaginings of life after the fall of civilization. The world of Mad Max is inventive, violent, and straight-up weird. It’s a place where gang leaders have cult followings, the noise of revving engines is ever constant, and characters have names like The Lord Humungus, Toecutter, and Toast the Knowing. No, I am not kidding. It’s also a world filmgoers haven’t seen since the release of the third film in the series, Beyond Thunderdome, in 1985. Finally, thirty years later, we have a new entry, Mad Max: Fury Road. It was worth the wait. Miller’s latest octane-fueled adventure is a movie with a lot on its mind in addition to the wild costumes, crazy vehicles, and mind-blowing effects. The new film brings world-weary hero Max Rockatansky (played by Tom Hardy, taking over from Mel Gibson) to the Citadel, an oasis of sorts ruled by the tyrannical Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne). Captured for use as a walking blood transfusion for Joe’s warriors, Max escapes with Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron), the driver of one of Joe’s tanker truck War Rigs. Furiosa is also carrying a dangerous set of fellow escapees: five young women (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Zoe Kravitz, Riley Keough, Abbey Lee, and Courtney Eaton) whom Joe has been using as his personal sex slaves. The strongest parts of the Mad Max films have always been effects and production design, and it’s thrilling to see Miller working with a budget that fits the scope of his ambitions. Immortan Joe and his army are pale, cancer-ridden beings, kept alive by complex sets of tubes and tanks. The cars look like the results of a demolition derby in hell. One even serves as a wall of amps for a mutant guitarist whose instrument doubles as a flamethrower. Again, not kidding. What’s also impressive is Miller’s ability to tell a clear story in the midst of non-stop action. Fury Road is essentially a two-hour-laong car chase, but within it, the characters, their motivations and conflicts remain discernable and compelling. Keeping all of that straight in a world that feels so different from our own isn’t easy to pull off — Avengers: Age of Ultron could barely manage it without the societal breakdown. But this isn’t just a movie about brooding wanderers and spectacular car crashes. The women of Fury Road are the ones who get most of the attention, and who are undeniably the heroes of the film. They are tough, and know how to take care of themselves, but also represent their world’s best hope for change. The film frequently juxtaposes the difference between their compassionate, renewal-focused instincts, and Immortan Joe’s destructive excess. Mad Max: Fury Road is a giddily entertaining film that sneaks in a progressive stance on women’s rights. What’s more, it does so in a way that serves the story and doesn’t feel forced. George Miller has told a story that feels authentic to the world he’s created, but that also takes it in a new and fascinating direction. It’s fantastic to have Max Rockatansky back on the road, but it’s even better that his creator has done so with a greater purpose in mind. We value your feedback on the articles we post.

"Jun 1, 2017",positive," In some ways, Fury Road is everything I expected. It is often cacophonous in its engine roar and explosive, well, fury. It is loud, and intense. But these things aren't enough now, in the two-decades-plus aftermath of Terminator 2: Judgment Day and the steadily escalating summer tentpoles that have followed. I feel desensitized to the computer-generated and often sterile destruction that's defined the arena these kinds of movies have operated in. It's not that I don't enjoy them, but my capacity for surprise is difficult to stir. Mad Max: Fury Road is ostensibly a sequel to the original 1979 film and its two follow-ups, but it appears free of much in the way of obligations to fiction or canon. You don't need to have seen any of them to grok the premise of this new film — that human nature, along with a helping of post-peak oil and weapons of mass destruction, has poisoned the world, leaving an archetypal post-apocalypse in its wake. Food is scarce, water is scarcer, and gasoline and the jury-rigged vehicles that require it rule everything. The titular Max (Tom Hardy) is a nomad survivor living in the wasteland, but the film doesn't mince words or script pages before he's captured and made a human blood bag for the minions of warlord Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne). Meanwhile, Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron), Immortan Joe's most accomplished field commander, has betrayed him, stealing away his ""wives"" and fleeing with a massive war rig. Max and Furiosa's paths collide, and the two must work together to survive and escape Joe's nightmarish, gasoline-fueled army. If this sounds insane, that's because it is. Fury Road spends scant few minutes establishing a hellscape full of war boys, bullet farms and Aqua Cola, and then lets it all go. What follows is a nearly relentless onslaught of beautifully orchestrated chaos, an artfully controlled explosion that erupts in waves over the course of 120 minutes, an extended chase scene that spends only minutes here or there allowing you to catch your breath. Fury Road diverges from any film being released this summer that might realistically be considered a peer or a competitor by virtue of its physical presence. There's little in the way of computer-generated destruction to be found here, outside of one particular sequence. Instead, director George Miller has captured some of the most incredible practical stuntwork I've ever seen. Massive, kit-bashed vehicles smash against each other in a film that is essentially one long chase scene. Fury Road offers a stark, limited color palette filtered through endless dunes and sand that puts an emphasis on motion. Despite its consistently high level of carnage, Miller keeps a tight rein on everything, avoiding the confusion and mess that plague so many summer event movies. The chases and wrecks are artfully choreographed, the constant motion tending toward the balletic. Despite the near-total display of fire and rage on screen, there's a perceptible sense of restraint at work in Fury Road. It's an intense, violent movie, but Fury Road never feels gratuitous with the gore, instead trading blood and dismemberment for a wrenching sense of impact as bodies are thrown against or from the vehicles that dominate the proceedings. That sense of economy extends to Fury Road's script as well. Miller and co-writers Brendan McCarthy and Nick Lathouris have whittled it down to the barest essentials. It's a remarkable display of economy, and despite some occasionally wooden dialogue that scratches at the edges of disbelief, the story is a model of efficiency. This is all the more impressive because of the subtly subversive heart of the film — that it frequently doesn't feel like Max's movie at all. While Max gets the voice-over to begin the film, and his perspective establishes Miller's demented vision of the carpocalypse, it's Furiosa who finds a character arc and a kind of hero's journey. Even as Max and Furiosa work together, there's a clear sense of purpose to Theron's performance that's missing in Hardy's PTSD-plagued portrayal. Max's violence feels unhinged, like a force of nature, but Furiosa is the only character in the film that ever really finds catharsis. That catharsis is contagious. Fury Road is a shark, constantly moving, stripped down to the most basic, powerful elements needed to achieve its goals. Despite its big-budget trappings and wide release, there's a real sense of independence and auteurship on display, an energy, ferocity and fearlessness that this kind of film so rarely sees. Occasionally, we get a summer movie that has a chance to change things, to change the conversation, movies like 28 Days Later or The Raid. Fury Road belongs in that conversation, and sits next to them as something made to knock everything else on its ass."
"Apr 26, 2017",positive," Yes, I know that Cannes is reckoned a citadel of capital-C cinemah, and yes I know that it’s famous for premiering art movies from all over the world. So it may sound a bit odd when I tell you that one of the best films showing here—maybe even the best—is a Hollywood action movie that’s opening tomorrow in the U.S. But I’m just back from this morning screening of Mad Max: Fury Road by the veteran Australian director George Miller, and I can only say that it’s one of the purest pieces of filmmaking virtuosity you’ll see anywhere. Set in a post-apocalyptic world run by thuggish armies, it stars Tom Hardy and a superb Charlize Theron as two tough-but-honorable renegades trying to escape along with a group of young women who’ve been held as slaves. That’s the whole plot, which is basically an excuse for long chase-and-battle sequences in trucks, cars, tanks, and motorbikes across inhospitable landscapes tinged gold or blue. This buzzsaw of action scenes is so dazzlingly original that it makes your Dark Knight, Avengers, and Spider Man showdowns look trite, dull, and unimaginative. (Unlike them, Miller made this stuff up rather than taking it from comic books.) Normally, when this kind of populist crowd-pleaser plays at Cannes—like Pirates of the Caribbean or Indiana Jones—it’s showered with boos from an audience that thinks of it as the embodiment of evil. Here, viewers not only applauded at the end, but even during the movie each time a bravura sequence came to an end. One famous critic even declared it “the best movie ever made.” Even if you don’t normally like action pictures, Mad Max will astound you. It’s a shame it’s not in competition. I can almost imagine the jury—headed by the Coen Brothers, who know good directing—giving it the Palme d’Or. But only almost. This is Cannes, after all. And it is the enduring genius of Cannes that it is always the same—crowds thronging the Croisette to get a glimpse of the stars, enormous billboards plugging movies you’ll never hear of again, TV cameras pushing into your face after screenings to get your reaction—yet it somehow manages to make every year feel different. One small way is with the official satchel they give everyone who’s part of the festival. Its omnipresence makes it one of the year’s trademarks—sometimes unhappily so, when the design is some shiny white plastic that looks like go-go boots from the sixties. The 2015 version is a real keeper. It looks like a classic child’s schoolbag but in bright blue—as if it had been designed by Wes Anderson. Civilians can see or even buy it here. Take the visibility of women. Last year, the festival was voluminously thumped for the absence of female filmmakers—so voilà!—this year’s opening night film, Standing Tall, wasn’t merely made by French actress Emmanuelle Bercot, but the red carpet was pointedly dominated by women: Natalie Portman (who’s making her directorial debut), Julianne Moore, Naomi Watts, Lupita Nyong’o, Chinese stars Fan Bingbing and Angelababy. Ruling the stairway to the Palais was Catherine Deneuve who, 71 years old and still starring in films, may be the closest thing there is to the Queen of France. She’s essentially playing the soul of France itself in Bercot’s movie, which starts off looking like a gritty movie about a troubled young man—played by charismatic newcomer Rod Paradot, who resembles a young Leonardo DiCaprio—but winds up being hymn of praise to the benevolent French social system. Deneuve plays a judge who, no matter how often he acts crazy or violent – he’s a kid stuck on fury road—still tries to see his best side and labors to save him with help from a social worker played by the French Sean Penn, Benoît Magimel. Naturally, she does. Just as naturally, it was adored by the French audience. As for the rest of the world, we snickered at the Gallic amour-propre, while admitting that by the standards of the famously dreadful opening-night fare at Cannes—last May was the risible Grace of Monaco—it was pretty good. And people are saying that Paradot is a real discovery. A more important discovery is that film is globalizing even faster than you ever imagined. Just as Hollywood movies are now made with foreign audiences in mind—meaning more action and less dialogue—so directors from outside the U.S. are learning that it’s hard to sell a film abroad in their own language with homegrown stars. This year’s competition includes two movies from Italy, one from Greece, and one from Norway, and what all four of their hot filmmakers have in common is that they’re working in English with stars you know from Hollywood. Last night was the first of them, Tale of Tales, one of the rare movies nowadays that tries to capture the primal feeling of real fairy tales rather than do a wised-up riff on them. Working from a classic book of fairy tales, filmmaker Matteo Garrone interweaves three stories about royalty—one about an overbearing queen (Salma Hayek) who’ll do anything to have a baby, another about a womanizing king (Vincent Cassel) who unwittingly tries to seduce a crone, and yet another about a ruler (Toby Jones) so obsessed with fleas that he marries his daughter off to an ogre. While the movie has an unsettlingly cross-cultural vibe—it looks like the characters should be speaking Italian instead of English—Garrone has a wonderful visual sense and, by the film’s end, builds to some genuine and startling emotion. It’s not a knockout like Mad Max: Fury Road, but heck, it would be a lot to expect two great movies from a festival that, as I write this, isn’t even 24 hours old.

"Mar 7, 2017",positive,The memories of the original Mad Max series are intact. This is not more of the same. Fury Road takes you down a different trail.
"Feb 28, 2017",positive,"It is a wild, inventive, barking-bonkers trumpet voluntary of Wagnerian proportions, and I loved it. I loved it."
"Feb 24, 2017",positive," Anyone who is familiar with George Miller‘s Mad Max series must have been eagerly anticipating his latest as much as I have. It has now been 30 years since we last saw Max in his post-apocalyptic desert world. But it is almost as if no time has passed. His world is still one of “fire and blood,” as he describes it, where the only ideal left to humanity is the will to survive. Although essentially one long chase sequence, broken up into about four or five sections, Mad Max: Fury Road is an intense, thrilling experience, which is not only overflowing with action but also possesses a surprising amount of emotional depth, where we get to know characters almost solely based on their last-second actions when everything is on the line. With some fantastic performances by Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron, among others, and some fast-paced, adrenaline-pumping action sequences, this is truly not a film to forget.A landmark moment in the world of action moviesMax is this future’s version of the loner hero archetype, a character that is most typically seen in classic westerns (think Clint Eastwood‘s man-with-no-name from The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly). The hero has a wounded past, and mostly seeks to help himself, but is suddenly thrusted into a situation where he has the ability and the choice to save the lives of others.Fury Road finds Max (Hardy) on a chase across the desert in a massive gasoline truck, surrounded by stowaway wives of a psychopath named Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), and led by the fierce Imperator Furiosa (Theron). With the intention of getting his wives back, Immortan Joe sends his entire force after them. What ensues is a days-long chase across the desert, where the horde of incoming men chase them on armored cars, giant monster trucks, and motorcycles armed with explosives.Though it may sound similar to the excessiveness of a franchise like Transformers, Fury Road is anything but. Despite the noise and cacophony, it is actually quite tame, especially since it could have also been extremely gory as well. It may just be the most balanced mixture of insanity that I have ever witnessed on screen.source: Warner Bros. PicturesThe impeccably choreographed action sequences of Fury Road are sometimes so off-the-charts with madness, but then, rather than beat the violence into submission, Miller backs off, giving you a chance to breathe, before once again diving back into it. It is a roller coaster of ups and downs, with the in-between moments setting the tone for the wildness that is about to come. By the final climactic battle, the end result is one of near-perfect balance, there is not even one too many action scenes, or one too few.An emotionally impactful experienceIn a movie that almost primarily exists for the purpose of pumping the adrenaline, Fury Road actually has something deeper to say as well. Certain characters, especially that of Nux (Nicholas Hoult), have a remarkable arc from start to finish – rather than just existing as a pale, brain-washed psychopath, he eventually discovers that his life could be much more meaningful. Even the clear villain of the film, Immortan Joe, is not purely evil, as he is only after Furiosa in order to get his wives back, whom he clearly has feelings for.It is Furiosa herself, though, who is the most impactful. Played with stern, powerful confidence by Theron, Furiosa is the breakout star of the film, at times even more so than Max. Her purpose and motivations are what drive her, and more often than not she proves herself capable of taking care of business.source: Warner Bros. PicturesReally, Fury Road does not have any shortage of strong female characters. Even the stowaway wives of Immortan Joe are able to show that they are much more than the damsels in distress that they first appear to be. This is especially contrasted to the original Mad Max films, which almost solely focused on the title character. Times have changed, and with them have the roles for women, even in a film such as this that most people would expect to be catered to a male audience.In the end, though, this is still Max’s film. And Tom Hardy is more than capable of taking up the role that Mel Gibson made famous in the original trilogy. Hardy even does his best to imitate the gruff, subtle Australian accent that Gibson had in those films. He is the strong, silent type, and often tells more with a single close-up stare than any amount of unnecessary words could do. I’ve always found Hardy to have a strong screen presence, capable of playing roles as diverse as Bane in The Dark Knight Rises to the soft-spoken protagonist in last year’s underrated The Drop. Even with an extensive and growing resume, Fury Road is among his finest work.A familiar dystopian worldThe world of Fury Road is one that fans of the series will be familiar with. It is a mesh of cyberpunk weirdness, where people talk in strange accents, hold wild ideals, and dress similar to how Lady Gaga might imagine the future to be. It is similar in obscurity to the first three Mad Max films, but it also, at times, stretches into parody.source: Warner Bros. PicturesThis is not necessarily a bad thing, though, because it also laces the film with some much-needed humor. (There is one scene in particular, containing a fire-spewing guitar on the back of a truck, that still makes me laugh). Miller doesn’t overuse it, either, and only brings the humor at the most opportune moments, when the audience is especially in need of some comic relief.ConclusionIf there is one thing that Fury Road has proven, it is that action movies are nowhere near obsolete. Though this is the age of CGI, it is also one where anything you imagine can be recreated on screen, without the limits that past technology had. Miller has escalated his already-entertaining series into the present world, and it is an experience that seems like the one he always wanted to create, yet was never quite able to back in the ’80s. With the additions of Charlize Theron and Tom Hardy, along with a well-talented supporting cast, Miller has truly knocked this one out of the park. A home run if I’ve ever seen one, and one that I’m looking forward to experiencing again.(top image source: Warner Bros.

"Dec 5, 2016",positive,looks like oil on a hot engine
"Oct 24, 2016",positive," By now, you’ve probably heard an incredible amount of hype for Mad Max: Fury Road: that it’s a non-stop car chase, an unabashedly feminist thrill ride, the bane of misogynists, and a critic’s wet dream.  With only two negative reviews out of 177 raves, the film currently stands at a 99 percent approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, and pundits are already analyzing its chances for Oscar success after its Cannes premiere generated multiple rounds of spontaneous applause throughout the film. So far the common theme among audience reactions seems to be “my head exploded.” Much has been made of the brilliance of director George Miller’s decision to create such a high-concept action film, but the mechanics of how he’s done that are even more breathtaking than the fact he dared to do it at all. Miller has taken the physical tropes of action films and re-imagined each one of them.  Instead of being a linear trajectory, the standard high-speed chase becomes a complete cat-and-mouse at one point, when the pursuer abruptly becomes the pursued. Instead of having a single threat from overhead in the form of an aircraft, Miller engineers a jawdropping sequence involving tall, swaying rigs on moving cars to create the harrowing, chaotic effect of innumerable villains dropping out of the sky. The chase ultimately extends off the ground and becomes the equivalent of the kind of three-dimensional battle you’d expect from Star Wars. And instead of a standard “fight-on-top-of-a-train” scene, Miller deconstructs and uses every part of a moving semi, while the camera moves in, around, and under high-speed vehicles with a fluidity that makes the cars themselves feel as though they’ve become a physical landscape.  Logically, a film this dedicated to action should have skimped on characterization; instead, Fury Road uses its lack of development for each character as an advantage rather than a hindrance. We don’t know why Charlize Theron’s Furiosa is seeking redemption here in the desert, but the glimpses we get of the Wasteland’s starving society and Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), the despot she’s been working for, leave us with plenty of guesses. We don’t know the backstories of each of Immortan Joe’s escaped wives, the sex slaves whose flight catalyzes the events of the film; but at the same time we do, because the story of violence against women is universal. Before they escape, Immortan Joe keeps them in a large sealed vault—literally a giant locked safe. After they escape, his sole concern is with recapturing the potential sons they carry inside of them, which he refers to as his “property.” The women themselves are utterly disposable at his hands—the urgency of their escape isn’t just about escaping sexual subjugation, but about regaining their agency from a man whom Miller clearly intends to be read as a literal embodiment of patriarchal rule over all women. We don’t know why Tom Hardy’s Max carries his own Greek chorus, credited as “the Accusing Dead,” with him in his head, but we see in every wince and flinch away from human contact—wonderfully conveyed by Hardy even though he’s forced to wear an iron muzzle for the first 40 minutes of the film—that his particular brand of “madness” arises from guilt and loss. When they finally help one another to find the redemption they’ve been seeking, the emotional resonance feels like a more powerful climax for the film than any high-charged explosion could be.  There is an incredible tenderness at the center of Fury Road—it’s two hours of action, yes, but it’s also two hours of characters protecting one another, believing in one another, and deciding to trust in one another because it’s the human thing to do. We expect this kind of trust to be earned over time in the standard blockbuster, but we don’t expect it to be given on principle because characters are trying desperately to retain what makes them human. It’s one of the most subtle elements of Miller’s show-don’t-tell structure, and it makes an incredibly powerful impact.  Like the original Mad Max trilogy, Miller’s dystopia is drenched in political commentary, but while the film’s feminism has recently taken center stage, its environmentalism is far more strident—not in the least because its message of a world ruined by hopeless dependence on oil comes just days after the U.S. authorized the beginning of drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, a hotly debated issue that’s been the center of four decades of controversy. “Do not grow addicted to water,” Immortan Joe tells his parched people, “lest you start to resent its absence.” Nothing will grow in once-lush spaces in the Wasteland because Immortan Joe has pumped the water away from its sources and poisoned the soil through fracking. Fury Road is so overtly moralistic on the subject of conservation that the urgency of the chase eventually seeps into a kind of metaphor for climate change, in which humanity is racing barely ahead of its own environmental destruction. Yet as with all Gaia-centric views of the world, environmentalism and feminism go hand in hand. The Wasteland’s fabled “green place” is home to the clan of “many mothers,” one of whom has patiently carried seeds with her for years in hopes that finally something will grow. Female solidarity is the only thing that can topple Mad Max‘s patriarchy, the endless reign of Joe and his warboys. “Our sons will not be warlords,” the escaped slaves write on the vault he locks them in—along with: “Who killed the world?” Theron’s Furiosa is the most fully realized female action hero since Ripley. Like Ripley, she carries herself with a deep wariness, letting her actions speak for her, and rarely giving into despair. But unlike Ripley, she has aims of doing more than just surviving; her choice to help free the slaves sets off a chain of events that can only end in death or regime change.  At one point during Mad Max there are 12 women on screen and they all have speaking roles & none of them are talking about a man. It shouldn’t be groundbreaking for this many women to have roles in an action movie in 2015, but it is. But Fury Road as with most of its themes, is less concerned with preaching a philosophy of feminism to you than with letting the ideals of feminism speak for themselves. In this narrative, women aren’t expendable, negligent plot devices; they’re characters with just as much agency over the plot as any of the men.  Just as important is Hardy’s choice to play Max as a subtle, quietly feminist hero. Max never objectifies the women he’s with, or views them as props for his own agenda. He helps when he’s asked to help, and when he finally speaks for any length of time, it’s not to take charge of a group that’s floundering without his help—it’s to make a suggestion, stand back, and then let the group decide. This view of what equality actually looks like in a film is rare enough; but it’s even rarer to see it in this kind of genre material. Fury Road passes the Bechdel Test, of course; it also passes the Mako Mori Test, on at least seven different counts. Mad Max: Fury Road leaves those mediocre measurements of gender representation—which the vast majority of Hollywood films never even attempt to pass—so far behind that it seems almost silly even to use them as yardsticks in the wake of the strength of Fury Road‘s narrative. Other films that have had this level of active female representation have been written off by critics, either as being “girly,” or as portraying those characters as weak; but Fury Road is every inch the high-testosterone, manly action movie of your dreams. And even when they show weakness, its female characters are still fully in charge of their own destinies. It’s incredible how much that adds to the film. Mad Max: Fury Road could easily have been a gorgeous but hollow spectacle, reliant on its jawdropping practical effects and stunt work but not much else. Instead, it’s a gorgeous, fully realized spectacle with an unapologetic insistence on allowing women to form a part of its core narrative—and it will have Hollywood rethinking its tired, male-centric narrative tropes for years to come.

"Jul 14, 2016",positive," Mad Max: Fury Road doesn’t exactly feel like a narrative feature film. There are no character arcs to speak of. The plot is about as barebones as can be: Get from point A to point B, and don’t die. Dialogue is minimal. Motivations are obvious and unchanging and largely unexplored, which isn’t a problem given the production’s interest in the basest of instincts—the eternal social struggle between freedom and slavery. Rather, Mad Max: Fury Road feels like an extended special effects show, a two-hour-long ""sizzle reel"" designed to get you hyped for something bigger and more explosive. Though anything ""bigger and more explosive"" might have rather dire consequences for the planet: Action flicks don’t get any bigger or more explosive than Mad Max: Fury Road. We open with the titular mad man, played by Tom Hardy, staring out over a ledge. Images of his dead family flash through his mind. They have been reduced to ghosts haunting him for his failure to protect them after the world fell. The planet has been rendered one huge desert, an endless expanse of wind-blown sand swirling about the plains. Survival is the only thing that matters now—and surviving means staying on the move, constantly running from scavengers and brigands. Captured after attempting to flee one such band of raiders, Max is taken to a citadel held by Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne) and his sons, ""war boys"" whose bodies are painted white and who live only to die for their father. Caged, branded, and tattooed with his blood type, things are looking bad for Max until Joe realizes that Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) has absconded with five of the beauties he keeps locked up for breeding. In order to bring Furiosa back—no mean feat, given that she’s driving a ""war rig,"" a sort of semi on steroids that is armed to the death—Joe sends his war boys after her. One of the war boys, Nux, is getting a blood transfusion from Max but desperately wants to go on the raid. So he chains his blood bag Max to the front of the car and takes off after Furiosa. For a movie titled ""Mad Max,"" it feels like Max is barely in it. Oh, he’s in it. He’s in almost every scene. But he’s very frequently not doing a great deal: For the first third or so of the flick he’s wearing a mask and strapped to the front of a car, and I would be surprised if the number of words he utters tops 300. Granted, Mel Gibson’s Max wasn’t exactly loquacious. But Hardy’s is almost mute. Indeed, it occasionally feels as though the movie should be titled Imperator Furiosa, ft. Max Rockatansky. Not that there’s anything wrong with that: Theron’s a fantastic actress and does ""intense anger"" about as well as anyone working today. But this movie is her story, not Max’s. It’s about her quest to save five women from sex slavery and, in the course of doing so, rediscover the land from which she had been stolen almost 20 years before. Director George Miller makes excellent use of non-traditional actors in Fury Road. The five aforementioned beauties are played by a veritable rainbow of models: the straw-blonde Rosie Huntington-Whiteley; the white-haired Abbey Lee; the redheaded Riley Keough; the brunette Courtney Eaton; and the raven-haired Zoe Kravitz (Kravitz and Keough are the only members of the quintet with more than a handful of IMDB credits). On the male side of the ledger you have Nathan Jones, an enormous Australian strongman who suffered a spiral fracture whilst arm-wrestling the equally enormous Magnus Samuelsson. Miller employs these folks for a reason: They look cool. A coterie of leggy models wearing wispy fragments of clothing in the desert is a striking image, just as there’s something striking about a man-mountain, deltoids bulging, hoisting the engine of a car above his head even as the vehicle is doing 80 miles per hour on the desert flats. If you’re into watching a bunch of things that look cool killing each other for two hours on the big screen—and really, who isn’t into that?—then Fury Road will be to your liking. And if you’re not? Well, there’s always Pitch Perfect 2. One final note: Please don’t see this picture in 3D. The director himself prefers two dimensions. If you pay extra money to see this movie in 3D, you will not only deserve the eye-ache that you get, but you’ll also be rewarding an evil, immoral corporation that is trying to separate you from your money by forcing you to watch something you don’t want."
"Jun 14, 2016",positive," If you want a vision of the future, at least from George Miller's perspective, picture a boot stamping on a human face for about two hours. Those in search of a bludgeoning good time will find it in his new scorched-earth action extravaganza, ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" — it's hard to remember the last time a summer tent-pole movie over-delivered in the ways this does. In resurrecting the Australian post-apocalyptic road-movie series that made his name — and launched Mel Gibson's career — over three decades ago, Miller has skipped the salad and gone straight for the steak. Never mind that his last live-action feature was ""Babe: Pig in the City"" in 1998, ""Fury Road"" is a master-class in cinematic onslaught. It's as if the director had taken the climactic tanker-chase sequence from ""Mad Max 2"" and strung it out into an entire film. It's exhilarating, but also exhausting. Working with cinematographer John Seale and editor Margaret Sixel (who is also Miller's wife), the 70-year-old director adopts an approach that could almost be called old-school, especially when compared to the weightless CGI that defines most big-budget action flicks nowadays. His set pieces — and this is a film that consists of little else — have a pleasing sense of gravity and physical heft to them, the product of bravura stunt work, judicious digital tweaking and lots of heavy metal colliding. There's real coherence in the way they're spliced together: The shots all connect, and only in the most frenzied moments does it become hard to parse what's going on. In a time of both misinformation and too much information, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.By subscribing, you can help us get the story right."
"Jun 10, 2016",positive," As the film begins, Max has been captured by the War Boys, a breed of ghostly white, bald man-children—scarred and stapled and riddled with bulbous tumors—bred to be Immortan Joe’s fighters. Max, his face partly covered by a Bane-style iron mask (curious, since Hardy also played Bane), is to serve as a human blood supplier for the War Boy Nux (Nicholas Hoult), until he manages to escape when Immortan Joe’s army goes after a rogue commander named Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron). Furiosa is certainly the film’s best creation—a bald she-warrior with a metal arm, a giant smoke-belching war rig, and a righteous cause. She’s trying to bring Immortan Joe’s Five Wives to the childhood home that she barely remembers, a utopian land of female warriors.

"May 28, 2016",positive," The production company logos that open George Miller’s Mad Max: Fury Road are accompanied by the deep rumbling of a loudly revving engine — and good luck finding a more appropriate starter pistol for this movie, which is like a machine that roars at full throttle for two solid hours. Miller’s last entry in the Max franchise, which has run the gamut from grubby low-budget exploitation movie to pricey studio blockbuster, was 1985’s Beyond Thunderdome, where (in something of an artistic suicide) he saved the series’ signature motif of tricked-out post-apocalyptic vehicles roaring across the desert plain for the final 20 minutes of the movie. No such restraint is shown here. Fury Road is for all intents and purposes a 120-minute chase, where the focal vehicle must keep moving, and thus, so must the movie. But there’s more happening here than empty spectacle, which has drawn the ire of some of the Internet’s more odious commentators. Later for them. Socio-political ramifications aside, Fury Road is, plain and simple, a bracing, sublime, towering slab of cinema, a rare thriller that actually, y’know, thrills. Fair warning: it takes some time to get going, as re-introductions and (often muddy) exposition are necessary. Tom Hardy steps into Mel Gibson’s iconic role of Max Rockatansky, haunted by voices and nightmare visions, captured and kidnapped into a terrifying dystopia ruled by the tyrannical Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne — yes, the same Hugh Keays-Byrne who played The Toecutter in the original film, which is a lovely Easter egg for longtime fans). Max is kept alive merely as a “blood bag” for Nux (an unrecognizable Nicholas Hoult), one of the many bees of Joe’s horror hive, sent across the desert on a supply mission. Leading that charge is Imperator Furiosa (a grease-browed Charlize Theron), who suddenly changes course and sets off the pursuit. These opening scenes are the rockiest; Miller struggles a bit with his tone, the storytelling is heavy on the gibberish, and the first chase, while technically dazzling, isn’t all that involving. (The general murkiness of the early scenes is done no favors by the inevitable darkening of 3D projection; do yourself a favor and seek it out in 2D, the filmmaker’s preference.) For this viewer, the movie doesn’t come alive until the action scene that follows: a rough-and-tumble bit of hand-to-hand combat between Max, Nux, Furiousa, and her precious cargo: the “Five Wives” of Big Bad Joe (played by Zoë Kravitz, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Riley Keough, Abbey Lee, and Courtney Eaton). It’s a sequence of intense ingenuity and constantly shifting power dynamics, and it brings the picture to life for one simple reason: first we were just looking at machines, but now we’re looking at people. And understanding those people makes the subsequent scenes of their machines matter more. Yet that’s not all that makes Miller’s work as an action director so stunning, and what separates him from the monotonous bigger-louder-faster likes of Michael Bay or the Furious artiste of your choice. It’s that he understands, and employs in his set pieces, such inchoate yet frequently absent principles as geography, rhythm, and tempo. Much has been made of the ferocity of the editing — 2700 cuts, per the filmmaker. But it doesn’t feel as choppy and discombobulated as, say, a Transformers movie, because those films seem cut to disorient while creating the impression of speed and excitement, while Miller (and his editor, and wife, Margaret Sixel) situate the viewer within the sequence to create actual speed and excitement. And, even more revolutionarily, they vary that speed throughout the picture, shifting gears like the drivers of those big rigs, which goes a long way towards keeping viewers from feeling like they’ve been bashed in the head with a fucking hammer for 120-plus minutes. (It doesn’t hurt that he’s also more inclined towards practical effects than computer-generated ones, which gives the action far more weight and heft than the collections of 1s and 0s that pass for stunts nowadays.) As Fury Road geared up for its magnificent climax, I was reminded of a Quentin Tarantino interview where he recalls seeing John Woo’s A Better Tomorrow II for the first time, with a friend who turned to him at about the same point and posited, “If they don’t get naked and boogie at the end of this movie, this has been for nothing.” Have no fear — Miller gets naked and boogies. That final chase is, quite simply, one for the books, a dazzling delirium of dust and fire and sheer kinetic force. Miller zips his camera, pulls out his sound, wails his punches, and bangs and fuses his shots up against each other like a welder. It is bonkers, and it is brilliant. And here we are, nearly 700 words in, and I’ve barely mentioned the people that populate this film — which says more about the elegance of the style than the purveyors of its substance. Hardy is, unsurprisingly, a perfect Max, easily sliding into the wandering gunslinger archetype (lest we forget, he was introduced in Thunderdome as “the man with no name”), his two or three moments of fleeting humor and/or humanity shrewdly parsed out over the narrative. He is, as usual, a man who does more than he says; Miller regards him in much the same manner. (There’s a wonderful bit where he doesn’t even bother to follow Max away from the group on a solo sidebar — he merely regards his condition as he leaves, and as he returns.) He’s great, and the title’s the title, but this is unquestionably Theron’s movie. She works with authority, fights like a badass, thinks on her feet, and generally wrecks shop, and if you can make it through the scene where she hoists a rifle onto Max’s shoulder, takes careful aim at an approaching vehicle, and growls “Don’t breathe” and not burst into applause, well, you’re made of stronger stuff than I. But when she lets out her howl of rage and grief at what should be the culmination of a physical and emotional odyssey, it becomes clear that she’s the character at the picture’s center. She’s the one who takes the risk, and who takes the journey; that’s the way these movies work. Max took his the first time out, and serves as an aide and/or inspiration in subsequent installments. Much of the advance word on the movie, even before its Men’s Rights Activist “boycott,” held that her character and story gave the film a decidedly feminist bent, but this isn’t a case of half-hearted “female stuff” or the current vogue of “…but with ladies” repurposing. The Eve Ensler consulting hire actually makes sense in the context of the movie; this is a story of survivors of sexual violence, fighting back and reclaiming themselves. That they are first revealed in a vaguely eroticized bit with a water hose is a clever bait-and-switch on Miller’s part, and a sly acknowledgment of the way (as writer Matthew Monagle notes) exploitation filmmakers have, from the Corman era forward, smuggled progressive messages into their genre sheep’s clothing. And to that specific point, charge-leading MRA garbage person Aaron Clarey is right when he accuses Miller of using the Max franchise and action cinema in general as a “Trojan Horse” for a feminist message, though he’s wrong about absolutely everything around that point (his insistence that the Australian-made Max films are “American culture” and his declaration that “nobody barks orders at Mad Max” seem to imply that he’s never actually seen a Mad Max film, and his Chicken Littling about how “feminism has infiltrated and co-opted Hollywood” seems to imply that he’s never actually seen a movie, period). Make no mistake: via this smashing, thrilling, crowd-pleasing studio summer blockbuster, a decidedly pro-woman, pro-victim, pro-empowerment message will reach an audience that might not’ve gone looking for it. And that, friends, is even more delightful than a movie that pisses off a bunch of knuckle-dragging, retrograde, retroactive, mouth-breathing MRAs."

	""Mad Max: Fury Road"", la nueva película de Mad Max del australiano George Miller tuvo su premiere mundial en un contexto de privilegio, en el marco de la 68 Festival de Cannes, con lo que se refrenda la adoración que el certamen francés siente por Hollywood. La película se exhibió fuera de competencia pero es de esos títulos que atraen multitudes, reflectores y mucha promoción que le viene bien a Cannes. La proyección concluyó con una ovación de los asistente al Gran Teatro Lumière, la sala más importante de la Croisette, lo que significó un recibimiento más que satisfactorio para la película que protagonizan Charlize Theron y Tom Hardy, quienes estuvieron presentes en la alfombra roja. 
	""Mad Max: Fury Road"" es un reboot de la saga que interpretó y que hizo famoso al actor Mel Gibson, allá en los inicios de los ochenta del siglo pasado. En ese sentido, retoma el espíritu y el ambiente de un mundo postapocalíptico (muy claramente en el segundo filme), un planeta arrasado y erosionado donde los supervivientes conforman tribus y hordas salvajes, feudos dominados por tiranos despiadados que pelean por el agua o la gasolina. 
	El filme abre con Max (Tom Hardy), un ex policía que se encuentra a la deriva después de perder a su familia y a su hija. Así, es capturado por las huestes del Inmortal Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne) un deforme y aberrante tirano que controla a un pueblo segmentado en guerreros, obreros y lumpen. El Inmortal Joe abre y cierra a su conveniencia las compuertas del agua y así mantiene sometidos a sus súbditos. Max es torturado en las catapultas, mientras sale una misión dirigida por la guerrera emperatriz Furiosa (Charlize Theron) a traer combustible de otro pueblo a cambio de agua. Pero a medio camino, Furiosa se desvía para fugarse, pues lleva a bordo un cargamento secreto: las hermosas esposas de Inmortal Joe,. El villano y sus hombres comienzan su persecución por el desierto y Max es forzado a ir con
	ellos. 
	""Mad Max: Fury Road"" responde suficientemente a las expectativas pero no va más allá de ellas: es una larga persecución llena de emboscadas y combates con estrambóticos vehículos en marcha. La mayor apuesta se ofrece a partir de una puesta al día de su estética y narrativa, Resulta así una fábula futurista de mucha violencia y crueldad, pero con una carga de fantasía que la vuelve irreal. El director, apoyado en el fotógrafo John Seale, el escenógrafo Colin Gibson y el editor Margaret Sixel, utilizan la cámara rápida y el ralentí con eficacia, una paleta de colores dominada por el ocre, así como un maquillaje y vestuario vistoso, que crean una distorsión visual que lo aproxima al cómic. El otro componente importante son los efectos visuales, que conforman el corazón de la propuesta."
"Apr 27, 2016",positive," Yes, Fury Road is, of course, yet another remake, reboot or re-imagining with veteran Australian director George Miller returning to the character which he first unleashed in his original gnarly 1979 B-picture, a film which also made a star of a young Mel Gibson. Seventy year-old Miller, whose biggest other hits as a director have been the Babe and Happy Feet movies, might seem to have long moved on to gentler, greener pastures. But his fourth Max is just as berserk as any of the others. It seems Miller has gone back to Road Warrior - the previous maddest of this Maxes - for the brutal tone of this. While cannibalizing bits of the earlier films and their mythology, Fury Road stands apart from them too. You don't need to have seen them to get a kick out of this. But it will also reward your affection for the old movies too. While the previous flicks had an identifiably Australian setting - they came juiced by Aussie petrolhead and bikie culture - this one, shot mostly in the eye-scorchingly epic deserts of Namibia, exists in a post-everything world of its own. And, despite Tina Turner's Thunderdome theme of old, Miller did need another hero. He's effectively got two. There's Tom Hardy as Max, a guy who is neither as pretty or as talkative as his predecessor but clearly more damaged. She starts out as the amputee bionic-armed road warrior in the service of Immortan Joe, the grotesque despot - though he does have Tina's hair - who rules over the Citadel, a rock city towering above the desert. Played behind the oxygen mask by Hugh Keays-Byrne who was villain The Toecutter in the first Max, Joe is a tyrant with a hydrant, rationing water to the dirt-dwelling rabble below. When Max is taken prisoner in the Citadel, he ends up as a blood donor to ailing war boy Nux (Nicholas Hoult) whose genes are suffering a radiation hangover from whatever turned to the old world to dust. When Furiosa decides one of her fuel delivery trips will be an escape for her and Joe's harem, a muzzled Max ends up as a hood ornament cum drip stand on the front of a Nux's pursuing car. Eventually, Max winds up, still with enough plasma, aboard Furiosa's heavily-armed road train tanker carrying Joe's willowy young brides to their desert sunset fashion shoot ... ah, no some sort of sanctuary. That's just one of half a dozen or more spectacular vehicular battles rendered often in long takes with little visible digital effects enhancement. Miller who also brings back some of the early films' trademark overcranked speed-zooms. Visually, Fury Road is also a movie of stark beauty, especially in the few minutes of its 120 on screen it decides to sit still and take in the scenery. This is a car chase movie which brings its own band along. One of the chase vehicles carries a flame-throwing metal guitarist backed by a tribal mass percussion section. Max himself sure isn't a lot of laughs. Hardy only has a few lines, his back story filled in with nightmare flashbacks, one looking like it's lifted a frame of one of Max's former victims from the early films. But he's a commanding presence. No, Furiosa can't save those girls - ho ho - single-handed. But she's the human touch in this inhumane world and the madly beating heart of this technical wonder of a movie."
"Apr 15, 2016",neutral,A wildly monotonous film that operates at one volume - fortissimo - bludgeoning us over the head into either submission or exhaustion.

"Mar 15, 2016",positive," At the time of going to press, some very curious and unprecedented chatter was doing the rounds online: namely, that Mad Max: Fury Road could well be in line for Oscar glory next year. It’s not usually chatter afforded to wallet-busting action wheezes, but thanks to Oscar-winning cinematographer John Seale, this film has the makings of a winner. And the look of the craziest, most delirious spectacle you’re likely to lay eyes on this year. As in, sit too close and you might lose your nachos. The fourth instalment of Mad Max is packed to the gills with big names, but first, a moment of reverence for the film’s director, George Miller. As the man behind the original 1979 Mad Max blockbuster, the Australian director’s career has taken him hither and thither in Hollywood, from Babe: Pig In The City to Happy Feet. Long story short: we’re in safe enough hands here behind the camera. And it’s all needed to create the desperation of this arid, post-apocalyptic world. Calling the shots is Immortal Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), who controls the population’s water supply and produces vast amounts of mother’s milk from his own battery farm of imprisoned pregnant women. She is heading back to the oasis that she was snatched from as a child. Trailing her are a raggle taggle of comely sirens; beautiful breeders that warlord Joe wants to have babies with. Out in front of the camera, things are equally as promising as behind it. Tom Hardy, playing our hero Max, has emerged relatively unscathed from Child 44 where he was caught rapid channelling the Count from Sesame Street. This time round, he’s playing a straight-up hero, no twist. With the right amounts of humanity, herculean strength and tenacity, he’s a compelling Max, if a man of few words and fewer emotions. Charlize Theron, meanwhile, playing the haunted Imperator Furiosa, is equally compelling. Rosie Huntington-Whiteley looks properly luscious in the role of Splendid, a doomed breeder. Props, too, go to Nicholas Hoult, playing wild-eyed foot soldier Nux with vim. Ambition of scale does not automatically equate greatness (remember Waterworld?), but in this case, the eye-popping extravagance is a real joy. It’s loud and boisterous to a nerve-jangling point. The action sequences, which are hyper-stylised, unfold at velocities that will make your head spin. Every so often though, the whole juggernaut runs off the reservation, drunk on its own spectacle. For reasons best known to the film’s creators, the warlord is accompanied by his very own metal guitarist and drummers playing atop a truck (techno, it seems, did not survive the apocalypse. Soz). The pudding is officially over-iced. But a film that uses 3,500 storyboards and 480 hours of raw footage wasn’t really fated to be a cinematic turkey. It’s not so much Mad Max as… well, maximum madness. Strap yourself in. It’s a hell of a ride."
"Mar 15, 2016",positive," Your first thought watching Clouds Of Sils Maria is that you don't envy writer-director Olivier Assayas having to manoeuvre Juliette Binoche and Kristen Stewart about a filmshoot in the Alps. To be fair, there's a chemistry between the two famously mercurial leading ladies that makes perfect sense, while also suggesting Assayas may have something of a magic touch. It is a dominant factor in why this elegant, ponderous European film works on the levels that it does. Binoche is Maria Enders, an ageing screen goddess travelling with her vaguely emo PA Valentine (Stewart) to accept an award on behalf of the aged playwright who gave her her first break. He passes away en route, they discover, and soon afterwards an edgy young director asks her to appear in his new production of the same play - only this time as the tragic elder of the two central female protagonists. Maria and Valentine decamp to the Alpine home of the late writer to rehearse. Of course, that's only part of what goes on. There's lots of metadramatic undulations as Maria faces usurpation by the bratty starlet set to play opposite her (Chloë Grace Moretz). All the while, smudges appear as Maria and Valentine collide at varying temperatures. It's chatty and meanders a bit, but there's a hypnotic, unfixed ambience to Clouds of Sils Maria that is wholly compelling (and more than likely intentional on Assayas' part). Full of wit, wisdom and knowing glances it may be, but it's earthy and sensuous too. A mature, perceptive drama for grown-ups. A NEW British royal has just landed in this world but don't expect Princess Charlotte to get a viewing of this problematic comedy-drama about her great-grandmother and great-grandaunt itching for a night out on the tiles to celebrate VE Day in 1945. Playing Elizabeth is David Cronenberg favourite Sarah Gadon alongside Bel Powley's more unruly Margaret. They implore King George (Rupert Everett) and the Queen (Emily Watson) to let them on the loose but quickly shake their military escort and are dazzled by the lairy hubbub. Soon Liz is skipping through the braying streets of London in search of her sister who has run off with some pilot and is now in the back room of a brothel. (Yes, you read that correctly). Helping her negotiate such frightful things as buses and people is Jack Reynor's robust squaddie (helpfully called Jack). A Royal Night Out fancies itself as some kind of Richard Curtis pastiche whereby the beautiful caged princess gets swept off her plummy vowels by Jack's everyman (who of course has no idea what or who she is). The problem is that these are real people who are alive and well and sitting on thrones. So it's not really spoiling things to say that at the very logical moment when our two handsome young leads should lock lips in romance, the camera has to swing away awkwardly so as not to get anyone into any trouble. This gives the entire operation a hollow, ultimately conflicted feeling. It has its charms - a jazz-age fizz, Powley's gooning, a tasteful aesthetic - but it is too lightweight. Wicklowman Reynor, meanwhile, struggles with the London accent. It's been three years since Pitch Perfect proved a surprise box office hit. The story of the Barden Bellas, the a-cappella girl group fighting the boys for competition supremacy, surfed the Glee wave by adding a bit of knowing humour and proving far less derivative than expected. The sequel finds the young women nearing graduation and thinking somewhat vaguely of the future. It's a consideration made all the more important in the opening scenes when the Bellas, having reigned supreme for those three years, face the ignominy of failing in front of President Obama. Fat Amy (Rebel Wilson) suffers a wardrobe malfunction during a Wrecking Ball-style aerial number and the world gets a chance to see what type of waxing she favours. Stripped of their titles and overloaded with shame the only way that the Bellas can get reinstated is if they win the World Championships in Copenhagen. Their main rivals are German uber group Das Sound Machine, perfect specimens of somewhat fetishistic a-cappella greatness.Cue some arguments, sing-offs and lots of great singing. Beka (Anna Kendrick) is the only one seriously considering a future after college as she gets a secret internship in a recording studio. There's also a new recruit, Emily (Hailee Steinfeld), who is keen to sing her own compositions, and presumably take on the mantle when Kendrick, Wilson et al graduate. Kay Cannon's script is sharp in some places like the digs at casual misogyny. Conservative America's assumption that a bit of female anatomy is the worst thing ever is a case in point and the thoughtless insults delivered by the commentators John (John Michael Higgins) and Gail (Elizabeth Banks) are the most consistently funny parts of the film. The other humour is a bit more hit and miss and Rebel Wilson starts to grate after a while. Overall the script does feel a bit formulaic and contrived in parts, I especially didn't like the parts that were meant to be heartfelt, but perhaps I'm just a heartless ould boot. There are lots of cameos and a good few laughs and on the whole lots to enjoy for fans of Glee style musicals, and fans of the first film won't be disappointed. It also happens to be Elizabeth Banks' feature directorial debut and she does it well. The gods may have chucked all kinds of obstacles - from unfavourable exchange rates to actual wars - in the way of this belated fourth instalment of George Miller's gasoline-soaked western but it has been worth the wait. Such a wobbly genesis combined with a monstrous budget ($150m) and comparable storyline could have seen Mad Max: Fury Road go the way of Waterworld (shudder). The key here is that Miller himself is still at the helm, and he's had a long time - 30 years since Tina Turner cackled in Beyond Thunderdome - to think about just how he wants his legacy to remain intact. Controversial mainstay Mel Gibson is dropped from the role of the titular road warrior for Tom Hardy (The Dark Knight Rises, Inception). Mad, tormented and murmuring sparsely in a Lee Marvin burr, Hardy does nicely as the brave loner reluctantly helping Charlize Theron's traitor guide five young women across the scorched nothingness of post-apocalyptic Oz. They are on the run from Immortan Joe (Hugh Keys-Byrne), a monstrous dictator, and his army of tooled-up and revved-up War Boys who rampage over the sands. The word electrifying is flung about too lightly in describing action cinema, but Fury Road is certifiable in this respect. There is barely any let-up over its two hours of grinding, white-knuckle gear changes, crashes and explosions. Max and his charges are hunted from one knife edge to the next, and talk is kept to a minimum. It could be tedious if it wasn't so downright stylish and smart. Miller now ranks alongside Gilliam, Lynch, Burton et al as one of cinema's more distinct visionaries thanks to this elseworld of warped, hideous survivors and bizarre contraptions. I confess that the prospect of two hours of a Ukrainian film with no words, just sign language and no subtitles did not fill me with great excitement. Yet Myroslav Slaboshpytskiy's writing/directorial debut is one of the most remarkable films of the year. Slaboshpyrskiy has said that his dream was to pay homage to the silent movie, and in this he does it in an extraordinary way. Unlike other productions which feature deaf characters in a hearing world this is total immersion in a world where everyone is deaf. Sergey (Grigoriy Fesenko) arrives in a large institution for deaf teenagers and must negotiate his place in a well-established hierarchy. There are rites of passage to accede to the most powerful levels of this hierarchy which is built largely on an after school hours schedule of crime and prostitution. At night, with the help of the woodwork teacher, the young men go out to mug people and drink. Two of the young women, Anna (Yana Novikova) and another unnamed (Rosa Babiy) are transported to have unprotected sex with lorry drivers with the ultimate aim of getting them to work in Italy. When Sergey falls in love with Anna the rules are broken and the balance tipped. There is a kind of Lord of The Flies vibe and much of it is graphic and unflinching. For one protracted scene, raw in terms of both visuals and emotion, I simply had to look away. A tough film but with many rewards."
"Mar 15, 2016",positive," A sequel being released 30 years after its predecessor must be something of a record. But in fairness to George Miller he's been planning this film since 1988. In the original Mad Max, a transgressively violent dystopian thriller, Miller and Mel Gibson had made their names telling the story of Max Rockatansky, a motorcycle cop adrift in post-apocalyptic Australia. Released in 1980, the film was dismissed as tasteless schlock by critics but would soon become a cult classic, and it spawned two sequels, Mad Max 2 (1981) and Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome (1985). By the time that last film came out, critics such as Roger Ebert had begun to realise what Miller was up to, and that his films were full of style and ideas, as well as gore. The story for Mad Max: Fury Road occurred to Miller in 1988, and he conceived the film as a road movie in which Max and his antagonists are fighting not over precious resources, but enslaved people. It took him more than a decade to find the time to make it, and in 2001 was all set to begin shooting when 9/11 happened. A 2003 attempt was shut down mainly because of the outbreak of the Iraq War, and after that Mel Gibson appears to have lost interest. Heath Ledger was considered as his replacement but, after his death, when Miller returned to the project in 2010, Tom Hardy was cast as Max. That sort of production history usually results in a stinker, but Mad Max: Fury Road is a wonderful exception to the rule. Because it's a scintillating action picture, breathlessly edited, glorious to look at. Poor Max is still wandering Australia's desert wastes in the aftermath of civilisation's collapse when he's captured by feral soldiers, and taken to a remote desert kingdom. The Wasteland is a kind of feudal fascist state ruled by a growling, bellicose tyrant called King Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), who controls the water supply and ekes it out to a pathetically grateful horde of underlings. Bizarrely, Immortan Joe farms hefty women for their milk, which is considered a bit of a delicacy, and also maintains a harem of girls intended to provide him with heirs. Other slaves, Max among them, are used by the king's sickly warriors for transfusions of healthy blood, but while he's being dragged on a convoy across the desert he manages to escape. And when he stumbles on a group of young women who've sneaked out of Wasteland, he finds common cause with their tight-lipped leader, Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron), and they began a battle to escape to freedom together. The plot of Fury Road is deliberately basic. Miller never makes the mistake of explaining too much about his apocalyptic world, and little hints here and there invite you to fill in the gaps yourself. Instead he focuses entirely on the momentum of what, after 20 minutes of scene-setting, essentially becomes an extended chase movie. For this is a nightmarish future, in which all legal checks have been removed leaving the strong to prey on the weak with impunity. Bits and pieces of pop culture have survived in the bizarre pageantry of the king's retinue, which includes massed kodo drummers and a manic electric guitarist suspended off the front of a moving truck. One-armed and crew-cut, Charlize Theron is still the best-looking person in the movie, though Rosie Huntington-Whiteley gives her a run for her money playing one of the king's heavily pregnant concubines. Perhaps it's the writing, or maybe Tom Hardy's puzzling reluctance to seize the spotlight, but this is Ms Theron's picture, and her intensity and tenaciousness steals every scene from Hardy's gloomy and curiously lifeless Max."

"Feb 29, 2016",positive," What a ride of a movie! If you think ""The Fast and the Furious"" series is the ultimate rollercoaster thrill about what motor vehicles are capable of, then you are dead wrong. Master director George Miller, the creator of the “Mad Max” series that began in 1979 proves once again that he is at the top of his game with ""Mad Max: Fury Road,"" which hits theaters on Friday. Yes, surely there must be some CGI, but the kind of CGI in this movie is only supplementary to what the filmmakers have achieved on the set -- this set being the deserts of Namibia. For those who are accustomed to the series, this film will not disappoint with regard to its unique dystopian spirit and quality of craftsmanship. For those who are newcomers, it will bring on a whole new world of vigor and blow their minds. I might sound like I'm exaggerating, but “Fury Road's” 120 minutes of filmmaking is spotless and tight as a rope with no room for maudlin or cheesy valor. The movie is set in the near future in an Australia gone haywire, where the remains of civilization have been devoured and overthrown by highway gangs, and water and oil have become rare resources. In this post-apocalyptic world, one such gang, led by the evil dictator Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), has set up a neo-capitalist community run on slavery and exploitation. The canyon where Immortan Joe has set up his regime has water, but he dispenses it to his people scarcely and rarely. That is not the only problem though; he owns thousands of men who call themselves ""war boys,"" high on blood, anarchy and violence, and ready to kill, rape and destroy at Joe's will. Max (Tom Hardy taking over Mel Gibson's throne) is a traumatized, lone man caught by the gang as a ""blood bag."" His voice-over clearly states what he is and thinks of himself: ""I am a man haunted by the dead and hunted by the living, I have only one instinct left, and that is survival."" The action begins immediately. Joe's right hand, Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron, showing once again what a talent she is), is set to lead a convoy of vehicles into a city where there is gas to refill their petrol on a huge rig that looks not like a truck but like a war machine. At this point it's important to note that the vehicle modifications in the series are legendary for their strange industrial design and lethal potential. Driving the huge rig, we notice her cool but worried expression; there is something utterly wrong here. Soon enough it is clear that she is trying to save a handful of women used for breeding purposes from the clutches of Joe and take them to her childhood home called ""The Green Place."" Joe catches on to what she's doing and goes after her with his own army of war vehicles. And the endless chase begins in the vast deserts of Australia, as we watch the two groups in constant motion in a cat and mouse game that is truly fit for a cruel and relentless world where the weak and dumb die immediately. Max accidentally ends up in Furiosa's crew and finds himself aiding their getaway, with his own freedom also in mind. Epic music blasts away constantly as the endless master-shots and close-ups of those involved in the chase are thrown before us for our pure primordial need for adrenaline and fear. We are always on the edge of our seats, with no chance to breathe, as we helplessly remain awestruck in the visual kinetics and acoustic splendor of this film. But it's not just about the thrill and post-punk atmosphere; Miller's cinematic language is not at all vapid on a philosophical level, and he makes it his main aim to show us what a dreadful place the world can be if left to the clutches of human greed. One might think there is no branch of hope to hold onto here, but one would be very wrong, for Miller also puts forth a very feminist, egalitarian and just point of view through the character of Furiosa and her band of women who gradually transform into a beacon of freedom and solidarity. They become the only hope humanity is left with. ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" captures the joy and style of what action cinema once was -- a good story with convincing characters supported by the stunning choreography of cinematography, editing and production design. Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoğlu has gone to the Silopi district of Şırnak province, where a curfew that had been in place for months ended in January."
"Feb 23, 2016",positive,"  George Miller’s Mad Max: Fury Road is the potent, powerful tonic we never knew we needed. The fourth installment in his Mad Max franchise is an overwhelming reminder of the unique places blockbuster filmmaking can go if we take off the shackles and let it run wild to places that can be magnificent even though they might also be rancid, putrid, and disgusting. The film’s post-apocalyptic wasteland is a marvel to behold and festers inside one of the best action films we’ve seen in decades. Miller not only creates one of cinema’s all-time best chases, but he goes a step further to transform the story into a celebration of feminism striking back against patriarchy. It may be a patriarchy riddled with gout and wielding chainsaws, but no blockbuster has delivered its message with such verve and bravado.   Max Rockatansky (Tom Hardy) was a cop before the world fell apart from nuclear war and ripped asunder by the need for water and fuel. Trying to live alone in the wasteland, Max is captured by war boys, a group of young, pasty, dark-eyed men who blindly follow the tyrannical Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), who has power only because he controls water and food. Meanwhile, Joe’s lieutenant Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) pretends like she’s making a trip to Gas Town on behalf of the demented leader, but instead had gone rogue to protect The Wives—five young women who are used by Joe for the purposes of breeding. When Joe discovers Furiosa has betrayed him, he sends out his war boys, which include Nux (Nicholas Hoult), who drags Max along because he needs the Road Warrior’s universal blood type. Eventually, Max and Furiosa’s paths collide and they must drive to the safety of “The Green Place”.   Fury Road never apologizes for being weird. It never winks at the camera. No one questions names like “Gas Town”. The only way to live in the broken world presented by Mad Max is to never question it. Miller doesn’t want to turn off our brains or shock us into submission. He wants us to jump into a grimy, filthy pit that’s endlessly fascinating. In the world of Mad Max, everything—including and especially human beings—is a resource, and while Miller maintains the essence of his previous Mad Max films (not an easy task considering their vast differences), he paints his richest picture on the biggest canvas. The film’s designs are consistently grotesque but also absolutely breathtaking. The movie is beautiful in its ugliness. Miller fills his movie with freaks and rejects who now rule the world, and shows that this is a setting that has truly gone “mad”.   That insanity extends to the action. The film is one long chase scene. We get a brief appetizer as Max tries to escape from prison on foot, but the real pursuit begins with Furiosa goes on the run. From there, the movie rarely takes a moment to breathe as Max, Furiosa, and their passengers try to fend off rampaging hoards of bandits.   Miller’s film is a standout in the genre not only because the set pieces are terrifically designed, but also because they have weight. CGI is a marvelous tool, but it’s become the only tool current blockbusters employ to get thrills from the audience. There’s still some CGI in Mad Max, but it’s used mainly to provide texture to the environment such as crowds and putting Joe’s insignia on the side of a mountain. When it comes to the action, the movie is hardcore, explosive, gleeful destruction as a unique assortment of vehicles comes bearing down on Furiosa’s war rig. Fury Road demands to be seen on the biggest screen and with the loudest speakers.   Despite the assault of action mayhem, the movie never becomes prideful, and maintains an offbeat sense of humor that goes beyond cartoonish violence. Miller manages to wrap the film’s strangeness in its visuals. For example, the muzzle Max is forced to wear also represents the guilt he feels over the people he couldn’t save. If Max refuses to do anything other than “survive”, he may as well be a desperate hood ornament on Nux’s car. It’s not until he chooses to live for others that he becomes more than a muzzled blood bank. This thematic richness pushes Mad Max beyond a visual feast and into a film that’s surprisingly thoughtful without being smug or condescending.   It’s not Miller’s fault that so many other action films have no desire to deliver more than a couple hours of loud noises and bright lights. Many people like blockbusters because they’re not challenging, and if you don’t want to engage Mad Max’s themes, you can still enjoy the picture. But those who embrace the film’s subtext will leave with a far more fulfilling experience.   The filmmaker takes a brilliant approach to feminism by expanding it beyond “tough chicks are cool.” Too often, a strong woman in movies and television is one solely defined by her ability to inflict violence. Mad Max goes further in its depiction of women. Theron is terrific as Furiosa, not just because she’s physically formidable and gives a commanding performance. Underneath her tough exterior, Theron conveys Furiosa’s guilt without the need for exposition. We know she’s looking for redemption because she’s done Joe’s dirty work for far too long. I don’t want female characters who are just “tough”. I want to see women on screen who are unafraid to be vulnerable and then strike back at their enemies. I want character arcs, not props.   The disturbing truth lying beneath the movie’s gritty exterior is that we’re not so far away from Miller’s outlandish world. Aside from the environmental concerns of draining our planet’s resources, Miller hits a huge blow with the position of women in our current society. If I have one criticism of Mad Max, it’s that the movie takes too long to get to one of its best aspects, and so it feels slightly abrupt when it reaches that point. I don’t want to spoil how the movie comes together, but when it does, it provides enough character diversity set against an incredible set piece to deliver a powerhouse rampage against misogynistic forces.   I’m in awe that this subtext is even present and so shrewdly included into such a gloriously bizarre and psychotic landscape. Mad Max: Fury Road is the action movie we’ve forgotten to demand, or perhaps we never knew we could ask for. Miller’s picture bursts from the mold, screaming and mesmerizing. It’s a pulse-pounding ride with tremendous performances, an electrifying score, unforgettable set design, astounding cinematography, and all in service of not only entertaining the audience, but also shaking them from a stupor. It may be odd to quote Aristotle when referring to a movie where characters have names like “Rictus Erectus” and “Toast the Knowing”, but the quote is well earned: “No great genius has ever existed without some touch of madness.  Matt Goldberg has been an editor with Collider since 2007. As the site's Chief Film Critic, he has authored hundreds of reviews and covered major film festivals including the Toronto International Film Festival and the Sundance Film Festival. He resides in Atlanta with his wife and their dog Jack."
"Feb 22, 2016",positive," It’s not often delays, financial dissolutions, and waning interest make a film better, but I don’t want to know what Mad Max: Fury Road might have been without them. In its current form the film embodies a logical escalation of what director George Miller began over three decades ago by embracing the insanity eating away at his titular road warrior’s resolve. Survival becomes a collective pursuit whether in the wastelands left behind after wars ravaged the earth of gasoline, water, humanity, and life itself or a heaven won through sacrifice at the feet of megalomaniacs stealing themselves a throne. Status is measured by one’s ability to reproduce, repopulate, and retain that iron fist on those only able to follow. And while Max would rather fade into the dust, he never could let the oppressed languish in chains. This fourth installment of Miller’s post-apocalyptic adventure series began as an idea in 1998, set itself up to shoot twice before 9/11 and the Iraq War shook resolves financially and politically, and even found a short spurt of lifespan retooled as an animated feature. The director never stopped hoping or fighting to get the script co-written by himself, the original Mad Max‘s grease rat Nick Lathouris, and cult comic artist Brendan McCarthy ready. I have to imagine he realized how off-track Beyond Thunderdome went because Fury Road is all about the high-octane action of warring factions inhabiting a lawless desert expanse—not the in-your-face potential for salvation or green notion of environmental decay. That stuff remains, but it’s relegated to a few lines of dialogue and character motivation. What rises above is a destruction-laden chase for freedom. Miller seeks redemption alongside Max (Tom Hardy in the role originated by Mel Gibson) and Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron). He looks to bring back muscle and grit while they strive to erase memories of loved ones they couldn’t save. While the latter two are as close to saints wrapped in antihero bodies willing to do whatever it takes that this world can offer, they can single-handedly rescue a continent and still find no peace. Redemption’s a concept that pushes them forward with purpose as waking nightmares of the dead refuse to let go. This fact alone gives Miller a successful rebirth because it shows how brutally honest he is with his creations. The Wastelands eat them alive, spitting them out broken and screaming. The briefest respite of sanity within it proves more painful than any physical duress endured. The conceit is simple: Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne returning to the franchise as a villain so far-removed from his Toecutter that the confusion Miller bred by utilizing Bruce Spence back-to-back in identical roles is kept at bay) rules a kingdom built on the fresh water he wields as a weapon to keep his citizens thirsty and loyal. Like he has done countless times before, Joe enlists Furiosa to drive a War Rig to Gastown for a restock of fuel. On this day, however, she goes rogue by hiding the warlord’s concubines (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Riley Keough, Zoë Kravitz, Abbey Lee, and Courtney Eaton‘s “Five Wives”) and detouring east towards “The Green Place”. It’s not long before Joe’s men discover the ruse and he alongside a militia of War Boys take to the road to recapture his property. Max comes along for the ride accidentally after being captured an unknown period of time previously and transformed into a “blood bag” for War Boy Nux (Nicholas Hoult). Almost at the end of his lifespan before meeting God in Valhalla (most definitely drawn in Joe’s immortal image), he uses Max’s blood to stay strong enough to die in battle. It’s the chance our iconic figure needs—a free trip to the outside to bide his time until an escape opportunity arises. Like before, however, Max cannot leave defenseless innocents to die. So what begins as Furiosa and Max individually fighting against Joe, Gastown, and another city coming from all directions soon condenses to two lost souls against the world. The war that commences explodes into a fiery spectacle unlike anything we’ve seen cinematically in decades. That argument about how CGI has ruined the popcorn blockbuster is met with maniacal laughter on behalf of Miller and his audacity to stay true to his roots. If you didn’t believe before that our collective disinterest in Hollywood tentpole features stems from their disingenuous origins of pretending digitized pixels can replace reality, you will after witnessing Fury Road‘s chaotic dance of vehicular and human choreography. I’m talking Cirque du Soleil acrobats jumping from one moving automotive Frankenstein to another, revolving on sticks to swoop in with bombs and bullets as bodies fall under behemoth tires or fling into the atmosphere from the force of a cataclysmic crash. There’s even a truck carrying six giant Timpani drums and an electric guitarist attached to bungee cords laying down riffs like 2060’s version of a Medieval trumpeter. We’re allowed four breathes during the carnage: one after an opening depicting Max’s incarceration, and three more separating the prolonged chase scenes shot in sumptuous color and pieced together by frenetic cuts. There’s a huge body count and a legitimate sense of dread throughout thanks to not being sure who might get ripped apart next. The use of practical effects is key to this because we feel as though we’re watching a stunt that could very well end in death. Whether it’s someone crawling under a speeding tanker, launching himself from the back of one car to the hood of another, or running from a hail of gunfire, everyone is holding onto a real piece of scenery. That means they could easily lose their grip, pull themselves up, or get lost underneath the weight of shrapnel. Cinematographer John Seale shoots so much coverage that I felt I was soaring in and out of the action despite edits instantaneously teleporting me from one place to another. I know there were an intense amount of cuts and yet my memory conjures each sequence as a continuous take. That is how invested I was in the action and the sorrow etched on the face of every actor. We feel the reluctancy of Hardy’s heroics, the desire for hope underneath Theron’s hardened glare, and the wives’ fear of the unknown falling way short of what a homecoming with Joe will bring. For his part Keays-Byrne is menacing even with his mouth covered for the duration. He’s the manifestation of Miller’s new world order, a hybrid man/machine running on blood, water, and gasoline. Mad Max lives on—survival at all costs.

"Jan 18, 2016",positive," The 72-year-old Aussie emergency room-doctor-turned filmmaker, George Miller (“Lorenzo’s Oil”/”Babe: Pig in the City”/”Happy Feet”), masterfully helms this technically competent, loud, brutal, compelling, and richly visual reboot of his cult post-apocalyptic action-fantasy series (it’s the 4th installment, that began with Mel Gibson in 1979). It’s basically The Road Warrior, but on steroids. It features sparse talk, well-choreographed action sequences, good chemistry between the stars and a long cartoonish vehicle chase across the post-apocalyptic sun-parched Wasteland. There’s one episodic chase scene after another until the weaker viewers might get car sick, as there’s no rest-stops for the weary from the drawn-out increasingly tiresome chase. It also makes little sense, and I tried seeing it twice to see what I may be missing. But I determined it’s not worth the effort–this isn’t Homer, after all, it’s merely a diverting big-budget pop-culture film that has little knowledge to add in exploring the world’s culture scene. During the time of a water shortage and ruin, the evil despot ruler Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne), looking Village People smart in his toothy, death’s-head face mask, gets on the case of his ally Imperato Furiosa (Charlize Theron) and she rebels against his tyrannical rule. The scene takes place some forty years into the post apocalyptic period in Australia. In the opening scene, things look bad for the captured Max, as the War Boys, the despot’s thuggish army, have Max wearing a trident-like mask and he is strapped onto the front of a marauding car. While Max is in dire straits, the despot and his minions are chasing down the rebel warrior Furiosa. She has a mechanical left arm. The gutsy lady has taken with her 5 of the ruler’s wives (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Zoe Kravitz, Abbey Lee, Courtney Eaton and Riley Keough). We learn she’s hoping to return to her faraway homeland, the Green Place, and find shelter there. "
