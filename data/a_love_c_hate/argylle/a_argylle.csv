Apr 14 2024,negative,it was fun in the sense that a perpetual ferris wheel would be fun yeah the lights and view is great but when does this cyclical journey end
Apr 14 2024,positive,matthew vaughn created another fun and exciting spy movie that has you on the edge of seat dont go into this thinking that this is a james bond serious spy movie or you will end out being disappointed the silliness is what makes this movie great and enjoyable this was definitely a fun movie to watch and sets itself up for other sequels going in different directions
Apr 14 2024,negative,i thought it would be a fun silly movie but it was just silly i think it was an attempt on a satire of spy movies but it failed in all levels i love some of the actors but even that didnt save this movie
Apr 14 2024,negative,what a waste this movie is an exercise on who not to cast as a spy writer or anything as a matter of fact maybe as a suburb helicopter mom she messed up every scene she was in  bad writing very baddd cinematography and the catastrophe dallas stop casting her she is not good
Apr 14 2024,negative,wow i created an account just to say how horrible did they even have people test watch it how did this get released the plot could have been good if the writers knew how to write dont waste your life watching this
Apr 14 2024,positive,sometimes we just need to not take movies so seriously this is one of them total campy fun almost innocently absurd at times havent laughed this much in awhile fun time
Apr 14 2024,positive,i absolute loved it  sorry to say but none of the critics listed here are reliable so go by the audience meter  the plot is crystal clear and very inventive the jokes are great  the stilted book dialogue is that way on purpose ahem light hearted and silly but dark at the same time  so good you wont regret watching
Apr 14 2024,positive,a bit long but a fun time its a campy take on the bond genre not a serious movie by any stretch of the imagination and i would bet it wasnt created to be people need to stop taking movie so damn seriously
Apr 14 2024,positive,there is a similarity between this style of movie and mr right sam rockwells 2015 movie enjoyed it after i changed my expectation
Apr 14 2024,positive,this movie is full of delightful twists and turns that kept me on the edge of my seat the comedy pushes a little over the top towards the end but i was constantly laughing or had my jaw on the floor ran long
Apr 14 2024,negative,one of the worst movies ive seen in a long time decades actually  the writing was basic at best using words like good and bad to express emotion  i assume they were trying to spoof spy films but they missed terribly  not funny or original just absurd and cheesy  i feel terrible for the real actors who signed on to this one  if you want to laugh at how painfully tragic a movie can be  then this is the one for you  enjoy
Apr 14 2024,negative,a room full of people thought that this was a good idea that should be unleashed upon the world that group of people should find new jobs
Apr 14 2024,negative,dont bother full of cliches character development nonexistent a colossal waste of time money and talent
Apr 14 2024,negative,absolutely terrible an attempt at action and comedy and it failed miserably at both two hour and 22 minutes of my life ill never get back brutal
Apr 14 2024,positive,great entertainment i love the story and performances cant wait for the sequels
Apr 13 2024,positive,do you remember being young do you remember how it felt to experience something new when every day there was no choice but to learn something and each discovery was a promise of how little you would know come tomorrow an endless trial emptying the ocean in the cup of your young hands watching it drip between your fingers no matter how hard you pressed them together the world was simpler then it must have been it was slower your choice of daily entertainment was presented on a shelf its expansion an event you would watch something and laugh rewatch it until you could recite the jokes to your friends and your plagiarism could be identified in turn do you still watch those movies unearth them from charity shops trawl through the ever expanding web of streaming services which cling leechlike monthly and eventually turn to old friends when you find the limits of the artificially inflated web of media they were silly exaggerated with bright colours and cheesy dialogue they made you laugh and you couldnt tell if it was with them or at them then came self aware smirks and fourth wall breaks then came lampshading narrative conventions and emotional moments until you are forced into the role of a bad faith cinema sinophile how can you care when they dont when they mock any emotional involvement in the world they have created are you sick of irony or expanding worlds that demand your commitment to their conceits would you like to spend an evening heckling the tv and laughing atwithfor something watch argyle    its not amazing no matter what my rating may imply it is not life changing it will not fix anything but its fun the movie is goofy in the first half i found the overall tone a bit slimy and the plot hard to follow by the time the half way point is reached i was more onboard the ice skating on crude oil using knives stabbed into doc martins got me fully its camp its bright it feels and it engages fully in that feeling had i watched this as a child it would likely be comfort movie by now this is a film that my nostalgia will caramelise given half a chance give it a shot even if you hate camp and cheese you should have fun tearing the whole thing apart afterwards destruction is the catharsis of opinion after all
Apr 13 2024,neutral,silly premise predictable plot kinda like romancing the stone but not nearly as good  if it was 30 minutes shorter i might have given it 3 stars  it was fun but just so ridiculous and over the top
Apr 13 2024,negative,some movies are so bad their goodnot this one  2 hours ill never get back
Apr 13 2024,positive,i think this type of movie is purely entertainment its not supposed to be this serious thing to be so picked apart on its a really interesting way to tell a story and its really fun and cheesy but thats whay a action romcom is for
Apr 13 2024,positive,apple has been doing a good job of delivering fun offbeat comedies family plan ghosted spirited that provide enjoyable mindless entertainment my wife and i watched argylle last night and other than being a tad long it fits the bill nicely there are plenty of nifty special effects some surprising twists and a talented cast that is obviously enjoying themselves immensely im not sure what more youd want or expect from a movie that will keep you entertained from start to finish if youre looking for a highbrow film thats beloved by the critics youre clearly in the wrong place but if youre looking for a fun way to pass an evening you cant do much better than argylle
Apr 13 2024,negative,so boring  with such premise how could they go so wrong
Apr 13 2024,positive,entertaining just wasnt a fan of the ending
Apr 13 2024,negative,this movie is an insult to viewers intelligence
Apr 13 2024,positive,for english below    kamera schnitt schauspieler story ich war lange nicht mehr so gut unterhalten aussergewöhnliche audio und videoqualität auf appletv plus ich freu mich sehr auf die 4k uhd um es nochmal zu sehen    cinematography editing acting story i havent been this entertained in a long time exceptional audio and video quality on appletv plus looking forward to the 4k uhd to see it again
Apr 13 2024,positive,watched this because i was bored and had nothing to do would have been pretty unhappy if the situation had been different it starts pretty good if you like campy and silly but it loses its fun about half way through it then goes on and on and on 2 hours and 20 minutes was way too long great cast but definitely not worth the time investment if i had to pick a word for the story it would be either preposterous or stupid not sure which
Apr 13 2024,negative,argyl sucks   
Apr 13 2024,negative,didnt finish the film the characters were awful and story done make sense
Apr 13 2024,positive,the promotion for this movie was misguided and distracted from the film i can understand the desire to lean in to the philosophical question as to what is reality but such a question should not be asked in cryptic marketing that should instead let potential audiences what they will be buying into this is an excellent film in the hyper genre of spy films the casting is spot on for the characters and story the story goes out of its way to make everything plausible i would be happy to chip in to fund a sequelif only the industry was open to fan funding having watched the film i want to see what comes next
Apr 13 2024,negative,silly and fun start with clever premise and twists that completely fell apart at the end  stars had no chemistry howard was either miscast or misused other than his first scene rockwell added nothing  my wife and i were very disappointed      dua lipa was fantastic
Apr 13 2024,negative,terrible movie by the end i was saying out loud wtf the movie preview made it out to be a different movie all together and what i watched wasnt it
Apr 13 2024,negative,mildly entertaining quite dumb good production
Apr 13 2024,positive,good clean fun terrific parody of spy action movies for example tom cruises continuing attempts at shockaction  bryce dallas howard sam rockwell bryan cranston catherine ohara samual l jackson just to name a few are having a great time and the viewer knows it  well worth the watch as long as you know going in that this movie is tongue in cheek and dont take it seriously
Apr 13 2024,negative,its clear the movie was meant to be a wacky high concept comedy with purposefully bad dialogue action and story but did they deliberately stop working on the special effects they looked like temporary animatics im sure this cast was sold on the idea this movie would be funny or maybe the paycheck was big enough to ignore reading the script they did their best with what was given but nothing could have saved this mess
Apr 13 2024,negative,this movie is insultingly bad
Apr 13 2024,negative,with a cast this talented you would be surprised at what cliché and overall bad writing can do for a movie the twists were predictable at many instances and the ones that werent predictable felt disingenuous this coupled with many copout deus ex machina resolutions made for a film that was certainly not worth the 2 hours you have to sit through
Apr 13 2024,negative,it was a good time filler and even though it was supposed to be cheesy it was almost hard to watch the jokes and impossible action scenes was not very comedic
Apr 13 2024,negative,couldnt get past first ten minutes no idea what was going on i had to check to see if somehow i started half way through the movieterrible i also dont understand how in this day and age killing with machine guns is appropriate or considered cool  in any movie let alone one thats pg 13
Apr 13 2024,positive,hilarious and campy action movie thats a lot of fun sure its a little long but its so entertaining it didnt feel like it also youll love it if youre a fan of sam rockwell hes his classic lovable self ready to watch again
Apr 13 2024,positive,so many twists i hope they make a movie or book one the book is even better and the is movie was amazing
Apr 13 2024,positive,i thought it was a good action movie i didnt see the twist coming which is surprising cuz usually i do
Apr 13 2024,negative,bad story cheesy effects bad casting with dallashoward just waiting for it to end
Apr 13 2024,negative,this was the worst movie i have seen in a long time
Apr 13 2024,negative,movie was so bad i had to make a rotten tomatoes account just to rate this just chaotically stupid and devoid of humor
Apr 13 2024,positive,most movie critics seriously need to get over themselves and have some fun  matthew vaughn is a comedic artist  this was entertaining visually amusing twisty and fun  great character development and brilliant casting with likable amusing characters     was it a bit ridiculoussure but thats what was half the fun
Apr 13 2024,positive,i went into this movie with no expectations at all and thought it was entertaining perfectly cast and a fun ride to be on
Apr 13 2024,positive,this movie makes me think of austin powers so much fun
Apr 12 2024,positive,nice to see a different take on the genre
Apr 12 2024,negative,it was very entertaining lots of good cringe but funny moments however my reasoning for not including the other four stars is that you cant put samuel l jackson in a movie without him saying motherfucker at least once
Apr 12 2024,negative,sam rockwell as usual tries valiantly to keep this wreck afloat the rest of the cast are wooden and can barely deliver their lines not funny not entertaining bad directing and editing mean that gaps exist where you can yawn before you switch it off and watch something brilliant like slow horses or ted lasso
Apr 12 2024,negative,ruined my day when she abandoned her beautiful cat allfieliterally shut the movie off
Apr 12 2024,positive,it was so fun a nod to good old fashion spy comedy of course it was unrealistic and silly that is what made it so much fun the actors were wonderful and beautiful and i would totally recommend this to anyone wanting a laugh
Apr 12 2024,neutral,the final act and big twist didnt work that well for me but overall it was alright no where near vaughns best work but it was mildly entertaining
Apr 12 2024,negative,shame on you john cena shame on you
Apr 12 2024,positive,it started of as typical and predictable but as the movie progresses the storyline becomes more interesting  overall it was a fun creative spy movie to watch at least once
Apr 12 2024,negative,quite good for the first 30 minutes then bad and got worse
Apr 12 2024,positive,it has been a while since i have seen a movie so entertaining i recommend giving this humorous spy movie a chance i loved the humor and the twist with the writer turned spy or rather the spy turned into a catloving writer
Apr 12 2024,negative,ridiculous and boring
Apr 12 2024,positive,sorry not sorry but the plot was ok and fun  but convoluted the acting not so much  a nepo baby who cant act and sam roswell miscast 
Apr 12 2024,negative,i really wanted to like the movie but i have to say this was a stupid movie  i like bryce dallas howard but she was the wrong person for this role  the last 30 minutes of the movie was just dumb and drawn out
Apr 12 2024,positive,i loved the movie original story different than your typical blockbuster movies
Apr 11 2024,positive,great adventure comedy action movie the actors entertained many comedic moments the scene in the train is super i think its a masterpiece
Apr 11 2024,negative,the best part of the movie is the trailer the first 4 minutes are the best bordering on ridiculous so youre hoping this is a comedy  its not after that there is a painful waiting for sam rockwell because maybe he can save this horrible misunderstanding of a movie sam gives it an old college try but the script is more powerful and so he fails at 52 minutes i stopped watching it was en episode about skull crushing i felt used and betrayed and needed to take a shower i would only recommend this movie to my worst enemies
Apr 10 2024,negative,it started really well i thought all these big names in should be good a bit far fetched  long winded glad i didnt visit the cinema to see it
Apr 10 2024,negative,there are good and bad elements of this movie it tells a very contained story dealing with a handful of characters and i thought the world settings and characters felt empty and shallow     the action scenes are entertaining but some in particular got in their own way trying to showcase this characterswitching mechanic where it wasnt needed     i have no issue with the plot or concept both were perfectly good and make sense of what is happening in the first part of the movie  although i think some wanted a different movie based on unfounded expectations alone     stylistically i love the effort that went into things like propagating the argylle pattern and creating the toy figures of the characters and i wonder why the film felt so dull and lifeless when that level of passion was present     i thought there were lots of cute ideas stretched too thin and some scenes were amazing tech demos but could have cut back to be more entertaining     lastly i have to call out the godawful cgi blinking its like the better the cgi gets the worse it looks i truly feel that omitting some of the undoubtedly expensive cgi in favour of something less produced would have benefitted some scenes edit sorry also the cat which may as well have been a bowling ball for all the charm it possessed
Apr 9 2024,negative,dumb story  disappointing  false advertising with well known actors and celebrities  stupid plot twists  weird and unnecessary romance  waste of money to see in theaters  overall was a stupid movie  do not recommend
Apr 7 2024,negative,what a garbage movie ive made an account just to leave this review what a completely utterly dumb unwatchable movie
Apr 7 2024,positive,i really enjoyed the first two thirds of the movie the last part was kind of convoluted and drug on for too long though the first bit actually seemed to be kind of a mash up of sandra bullocks lost city and the bullet train movie it was action packed and entertaining but the pace kind of slowed after that cgi was a little overdone as well some of that chase stuff was physically impossible  the real treat though was the cast lots of big names in there and they all did a great job too bad the writing kind of petered out towards the end  a fun watch though just dont take it too seriously
Apr 7 2024,positive,a wonderful dynamic funny film that entertained distracted from problems and helped to spend a few evening hours interestingly
Apr 7 2024,negative,what a waste of what felt like 7 hours so incredibly stupid  like a stupid bad dream  save your time  there is absolutely nothing good about this movie even though sam rockwell is in it
Apr 7 2024,negative,this movie is so bad i dont even want to spend any time reviewing just save your time and money
Apr 7 2024,positive,super fun great to watch with my teen
Apr 6 2024,positive,a light hearted clever movie that kept me at the edge of the seat and i personally enjoyed the impossible plot twists
Apr 6 2024,negative,physics in the end just gave up how was this girl iceskating on oil with knifes in her shoes surely that wouldnt work wouldnt she have bloody feet if she was alright in the beginning she would still end up with a knife half way up her foot at the rate she was going she even started skating on the concrete not even on the oil plus the blades werent even fully on the ground half the handle was on the floor as well as the blade so unless she was levitation flying or shes just allowed to ignore physics itself because its a movie there is no possible way she could be iceskating with oil as the replacement for ice if iceskaters could do this i dont think they would ever go to an ice rink they would just ice skate anywhere and everywhere but nor would they have feet other than that i enjoyed the movie for the big plot twists and it made me laugh most of the time
Apr 6 2024,positive,it was a funny very tongue in cheek feel good film we laughed out loud at quite a few of the jokes and tittered at the others we loved every minute of the film in fact saw it twice because we missed a few things looking forward to the next one
Apr 5 2024,positive,its well done movie
Apr 5 2024,positive,without a doubt i recommend this movie to watch i had a lot of fun great movie acting story moves
Apr 4 2024,negative,worst movie ever cant believe i wasted my time and money on a disney spy movie
Apr 3 2024,negative,it was absolutely terrible because 1 john cena was barely in it
Apr 3 2024,negative,normally im a big fan of mattew vaughn his style is usually great and hes just churned out hit after hit but then theres argylle i realized they were going for quirky but this delved into the ludicrously silly the plot was smart but needlessly complicated if they had taken entire sequences out of the last 30 minutes of the film for those who have seen the film im sure you know which farfetched ones im talking about the movie would have been so much better for it the idea was a great one unfortunately  the execution was a bit of a convoluted spectacle
Apr 3 2024,positive,great movie i really liked the atmosphere the colors the acting in general the film left a very pleasant impression
Apr 2 2024,positive,its entertaining but its too much for one movie it could have been split into two parts to be honest on a good note great cast
Apr 2 2024,positive,just a fun movie if you want something to just take you away from the day to day this will do the job
Apr 2 2024,positive,the humor of the director of this film is very specific not everyone can understand it there are many hidden hints in the film and to notice them you need to watch the scenes carefully the plot acting fight scenes and music are just great i definitely enjoyed this movie
Apr 2 2024,negative,garbage pure garbage  no redeeming qualities whatsoever    rons daughter is cast horribly  everything else is hot wet garbage
Apr 2 2024,positive,great cast great acting original concept that felt fresh all those critics complain that all there is reboots and superhero movies and reboots of superhero movies but then when they deliver a great original movie its still not enough also the soundtrack was fun and was a highlight of this movie it lost a star because the choreographed dancingfight scene was stupid and completely took me out of the movie and the visuals didnt feel like the rest of the movie or it felt possibly misplaced im not sure it felt like it could have been one of her daydream sequences not part of reality but it was reality so it through me off even as a dream sequence it would have been bad they could have cut it out of the movie and it would have better
Apr 1 2024,positive,yet another example of the critics being completely out of touch with what those that actually watch films for entertainment enjoy just as kingsman before it argyylle doesnt take itself too seriously it is a silly fun action packed film that is very enjoyable to watch brilliant work
Apr 1 2024,positive,it was phenomenally great
Apr 1 2024,positive,my verdict  the movie is great this movie is like a fairy tale with a happy ending i really enjoyed this movie
Apr 1 2024,positive,a welcomed change to a lot of moves on streaming apps funny silly and somewhat predictable but i enjoyed
Apr 1 2024,positive,omg i loved this movie it was by no means cerebral or like a cinematic masterpiece but i loved it the cat was cute the plot was entertaining and it was fastpaced and engaging
Apr 1 2024,positive,when i see the critics review so low on a movie that is very much a fun watch i remember that some people cant just enjoy a well made movie to entertain an audience the casting was spot on across the board and they all nailed it fight scenes normally get boring after 45 seconds if you know how its going to end but this was not the case ill give the song electric energy a lot of credit in that department anyway the only reason to not like this movie is if you wanted citizen kane knew that it wasnt going in and were going to not like it before it started because it wasnt id watch it five times again before i watched something by christopher nolan made while he stored his farts in a decanter to smell while he makes 500 useless time shifts in a movie because hes a genius best time shift he made was holding a movie release off so hed have a better chance at the oscars this review went off the rails argylle was better than oppenheimer i guess thats what im saying
Mar 31 2024,positive,high camp with a great soundtrack ignore the haters and enjoy the silliness and the beautiful cinematography i loved it
Mar 31 2024,positive,the trailer hooked me and then i absolutely loved all of the unexpected plot twists of the movie  howard has an incredible screen presence and an unmistakable chemistry with rockwell who was charismatic and hilarious it was exciting seeing the recognizable faces in their various roles  ohara and cranston made a fantastic couple as well    i found the plot easy to follow and loved how many layers were peeled away throughout the film  an absolutely enjoyable ride from beginning to end
Mar 31 2024,positive,in my opinion this movie is excellent in every way both the acting the plot and the music make a very pleasant impression
Mar 30 2024,positive,this movie is bright funny entertaining humor music fight scenes made an unforgettable impression i really liked this movie
Mar 30 2024,positive,quite a bazaar plot with surprising twists  it was a fun watch
Mar 30 2024,positive,this spy film is an art i love films like this  and the post credit scene and that ending this film may not have done well in theaters but it delivers on what it promises a film with a highquality cast a light funny and actionpacked film from start to finish a light and welltold story and i really hope for a sequel give this movie a chance you wont regret it
Mar 29 2024,positive,really good movie not excellent but solid     yet another example of where the critics are way off
Mar 29 2024,positive,m i the only one who knows that argylle is kings man agent
Mar 29 2024,positive,a fun filled movie not to be taken too seriously
Mar 29 2024,positive,it is a good story despite many twists but it is good entertainment
Mar 29 2024,positive,now i came into the notion that the movie was bad as i did not hear much but that they were blaming certain people as always i have to see it for myself to determine if i enjoyed it now when it comes to movies like this i look for the simple notion of  does this entertain without spoiling the movie  it did its job to entertain and tell an enjoyable story definitely a must watch
Mar 28 2024,positive,one of the best spy movies ive seen when it seems that you already predicted the next events the film stuns you with another surprise music and jokes add charm to the film it fascinates in general while watching this film i remembered the spy 2015 and the first part of kingsmen
Mar 27 2024,positive,a fun romp loads of action and ridiculous plots disengage brain roll a fatty and enjoy
Mar 27 2024,negative,rockwell is the only redeeming element of this dumb twisty pseudoblockbuster
Mar 27 2024,positive,i went to see it with my friends and we really had a great time was the plot a little convoluted yes would i pay to see it again definitely   it was funny action packed the actors were awesome and the twists were fun i hate when movies are too predictable but also when theyre so confusing you cant enjoy the story  this has a nice balance the music was also fantastic
Mar 27 2024,positive,two hours passed almost imperceptibly i liked the drive the rhythm of the film the colors the film is atmospheric somewhat reminiscent of the era of the 80s definitely like it and im adding this movie to the list of favorites
Mar 27 2024,positive,it was a bit confusing at first but it all comes together and ties it all together a very entertaining movie really enjoyable
Mar 27 2024,positive,great actionpacked movie loved all the plot twists i hope a 2nd one will come out in the future
Mar 26 2024,negative,just save your money nothing to watch here
Mar 26 2024,positive,i dont understand haters of this film i completely disagree with negative reviews i think this is a great entertaining movie with jokes awesome music cool fighting scenes it reminds me of 80s and i definitely like this film
Mar 26 2024,negative,obviously for young girls only seriously stupid movie
Mar 25 2024,negative,god that was bad between the cringy characters the bad cgi and a plot worthy of a bad old times james bond parody i had to sit through this hell of a movie even the cat who is incidently the best character of the cast was deceiving
Mar 25 2024,positive,this is an incredibly fun film that may not always generate laughs but it makes for a great time the premise of a book within a movie one that exists within our real world is a great gimmick to show off the layers that exist in fiction we love a little exaggeration in our entertainment the story is surprisingly solid and the cast does a terrific job all the action sequences are solid and well staged definitely worth checking out
Mar 25 2024,positive,i disagree with critics i like this movie the idea concept script music jokes actors played well especially bryce dallas howard and sam rockwell
Mar 25 2024,positive,argylle is a tongue in cheek spy movie that doesnt disapoint it is funny and had some great action scenes i think that it ran out of steam near the end but still well worth watching i really enjoyed some of the scenes with the cat and the action fighting scenes
Mar 25 2024,positive,i wasnt sure what to expect with this movie but it was entertaining i have to admit it was about 30 min too long and got crazy in some parts towards the end with the smoke bombs and oil spill but overall it was a super creative story with a ton of plot twists i didnt see coming great cast sam rockwell is always just so good and him and bryce dallas howard were great together i think if you go into it that its a fun take on a spy movie and not like youre watching a bond film youll enjoy it
Mar 25 2024,positive,this film was genuinely really enjoyable for me and my family the embarrassing dance scenes throughout the movie were honestly some of my favorites while it was definitely a bit draggedout it stayed a fun time throughout and i was really impressed with dallas duality in her acting throughout the movie i understand why some would dislike it but for what it truly is its a fun entertaining movie that really does speak to those oldfashioned crime novels
Mar 25 2024,positive,argylle is absolutely crazy its messy at times but the chemistry between bryce dallas howard and sam rockwell is great the action is super fun its funny and the twists were bonkers my main issue is that its way to long it needed to be shorter its not great but its fun for what it was 35
Mar 24 2024,positive,argylle was incredibly beautiful cinematically if you stay off your phone you can follow the deeper meaning of the film its brilliant visually but if you dive deep you meet a person that has awoken finally and has been programmed by their parents the theme repeats many times and pulls her into situations she may not have reverted to her negative way if it wasnt the parent controlling her at the time i sound crazy im sure but we all fall on habits to deal with situations in life depending most likely based on situations we have already faced and most habits are formed in childhood its where were conditioned kind of like a spy to react to situations familiarity which comes from those around us family and friends   dive deeper and the movie will make much more sense really enjoyed it     at the end she is able to rely on herself and is free to think for herself not influenced by any outside sources looking forward to the 2nd one it would be a dream come true to be a part of this movie really spoke to me thank you for making this     so many great actors as well loved the scene with catherine ohara saying ill play mother
Mar 24 2024,positive,if you like the kingsman style movies youll like this its a good no brainer escapism movie dont take it too seriously and youll enjoy it
Mar 24 2024,positive,there were definitely some cheesy moments through out the entire movie however it was a mix of comedy action romance and in general not as predictable which was awesome entertainment value was great
Mar 24 2024,positive,its absolutely incredible this film is funny and has great twists im dying for a second film i loved this film
Mar 24 2024,positive,i missed seeing this when it was briefly in the theater even though i had been waiting for its release  all the bad reviews kept me awayi streamed it this evening and was surprised at how hilariously silly it was  a fan of spy spoofs and 007 and john wick really why should he have all the fun for me argylle is ticking all the boxes spy rom com with a cat  what i am saying is i loved it and sometimes the reviews are just wrong
Mar 24 2024,positive,i actually liked this more than i thought i would i was also locked in a room for 10 hours with a laptop so but not the worse thing i saw that week
Mar 24 2024,negative,guns are stupid knives are stupid this movie is really stupid
Mar 24 2024,negative,it was good for the first 2030 of the movie then they went a little nuts on the twists until it got so ridiculous i was constantly rolling my eyes i thought i was watching a movie about an author going on an adventure instead i got some bizarro nonsense with the author now turning into some unbelievable agent in an imaginary grossly violent land complete with multicolored smoke super lame and really dumb movie waste of my time and very disappointing
Mar 24 2024,negative,i left halfway through the movie  too long for the plot it handles
Mar 23 2024,positive,i watched this movie with my children and grandchildren and we all loved it  it had action comedy and suspense  not every movie needs to be a fabulous deep endeavor  argyle was simple playful fun that that was just what we needed  i think it a great film when you can make a 70 40 and a 15 year old all happy please give it a go and make up your own mind
Mar 23 2024,negative,truly painful to attempt watching bryce howard was great in the help but is awful in this how did no one stop this
Mar 23 2024,positive,it was honestly a funny and enjoyable movie
Mar 23 2024,positive,argylles action sequences are thrilling and the story kept the audience guessing with its surprising twists however the movie mixes humor and romance to the action that felt weird and cliche despite the tonal juggling act argylles core strengths lie in its action sequences and plot twists if youre looking for a fastpaced spy adventure with a surprising story argylle might be worth checking out
Mar 23 2024,positive,one of the best films ive ever watched i want watch this movie again i like characters jokes and music great film
Mar 23 2024,positive,wont win loads of nominations at the oscars but this movie would hold you spell bound from beginning to end with loads of laughs and action scenes the choreographies were pure art and should be in a museum youll end the movie with the largest smile on your face and sometimes thats all you ask for from a movie
Mar 23 2024,negative,this movie should be two times shorter
Mar 23 2024,negative,cgi was terrible characters were trying their best movie was too long

Mar 23 2024,positive,it was such a fun movie i loved everything about it
Mar 22 2024,negative,bad writing camp direction and just basically cringe
Mar 22 2024,positive,argyle was one of those movies that you need to just turn off your logic and enjoy the ride was it over the top yes was it predictable yes did i care no   it reminded me of the fun action movies they used to make in the 80s and 90s that they just dont seem to make anymore movies dont always need to be realistic and scientifically accurate as long as they are entertaining and dont take themselves too seriously
Mar 22 2024,positive,i would recommend watching the movie with friends for me and my friends the movie was very funny and we couldnt stop laughing

Mar 21 2024,positive,i like this film soundtracks are great
Mar 21 2024,positive,as a dua lipa fan i was a bit disappointed that she was in it for around 5 minutes but i felt she was a natural behind  the camera  the plots are a bit silly but fun  the star of the film has to be alfie the cat 
Mar 21 2024,positive,wanted to post 25 but decided a 3 to get more of a positive review some good action and i like the idea of what was being done here  doesnt execute that well but allows for a fun ride
Mar 21 2024,positive,this was a rollercoaster ride from the start argylle completely caught me off guard and presented me with one of my best movie going experiences in such a long time guy ritchie once again gives us a classic high stakes winner takes all spy movie bryce dallas howard  sam rockwell rock the house with this one truly a blast
Mar 20 2024,positive,i love this movie i watched it three times and i want to see it again the best film ive ever watched
Mar 20 2024,negative,i couldve watched shrek
Mar 20 2024,positive,i found this movie to be quite tasteful for any audience this action comedy had quite the stack of actor excellence with the addition of outside celebrity appearances plot twists were on par and just the right amount of puzzling to allow the audience to put the pieces together themselves loved this movie
Mar 20 2024,positive,argylle delivers a captivating whirlwind of twists and turns that keep audiences on the edge of their seats from start to finish
Mar 20 2024,positive,enjoy this movie very funny
Mar 20 2024,negative,very bad    didnt like    too many twists and i dont like churros
Mar 20 2024,positive,saw this movie the day after i watched the trailer for it i was absolutely floored by the twists and turns this movie takes nothing was given away by the trailer which is hard to come by with recent movies if you like action comedy spy movies this is definitely a must see
Mar 19 2024,negative,truly flabby and witless the dua lipa opening sequence promises so much and then we get irritation and stupidity from a fat and narcissistic duo awful a major dent in apple brand values
Mar 19 2024,positive,actors played well music is great and i adore cat alphie funny entertaining movie
Mar 19 2024,negative,everything on paper looked good but its just not that good of a movie
Mar 19 2024,positive,i loved it from start to finish and wanted to watch it again immediately
Mar 18 2024,negative,while it was fun at times the plot had a couple of loose points that made no sense 
Mar 18 2024,positive,bought this the first weekend available on streaming and wasnt disappointed its just a fun movie its cheesy and typical spy movie fare but much fun with it its not overly cheesy until the very end but they did such a great job getting us there i was for it usually i am not a fan of that much cheese but it worked oddly in this one i dont think in any way this movie is a flop but more a reality that most future movies will make their money and most of it on the back side of the box office movie theaters should be put on notice to lower the cost or somehow vastly upgrade the experience because during covid we upgraded our home theaters
Mar 18 2024,negative,this made me extremely depressed this is what contemporary movies are the fact this was made is malice to humankind
Mar 18 2024,positive,no matter what others say but i love this movie
Mar 18 2024,negative,a stinker among stinkers one or maybe two surprise twists in a movie is acceptable but 30 or 40 is just stupid an example of how stupid this film is when there is oil on the floor you can skate on it like a figure skater
Mar 17 2024,negative,boring comedy to its finest
Mar 17 2024,positive,its just a really entertaining absurd fun movie instant cult classic
Mar 17 2024,positive,everyone who doesnt like this movie is simply crazy i went with a party of 5 to watch this movievarious ages and everyone loved it i feel like this movie was the first actual chick flick action movie in years and while it isnt meant to shake the entire world and make a movement in the movie industry not every movie has to be this way plot twist after plot twist keeping us all on the edge of our seats highly recommend
Mar 17 2024,neutral,its ok some fun bits i liked the leads  but it is way to long
Mar 17 2024,positive,fun humorous action and lots of twists  great entertainment 
Mar 17 2024,negative,too long ending was terrible
Mar 17 2024,neutral,i have not read anything about this one apart from the one line description plot  lets take out of the way that the cgi are just ok and the skating scene fight should not be in the movie at all  the rest was easy to watch will you watch it again nope but it is not wasted time at least will you miss anything if you dont watch it also no
Mar 17 2024,positive,cool movie i like fighting scenes and soundtracks  this movies is definitely in my favourites
Mar 17 2024,negative,one of the worst movies ive ever watched got ridiculous considered asking for my money back 
Mar 17 2024,positive,wow what an incredible spy movie bryce dallas and sam rockwell really rock in their characters if you expected something like kingsman or ms and mr smith well maybe u ll feel dissapointed but if you like surprises and r a real fan of spy stories for sure will enjoy untill the end
Mar 17 2024,negative,argylle is hands down the worst movie of 2024 the trailer made it sound it would be dope but then when you see it the last hour is stupid the end was just making up things along the way to make it a huge waste of time
Mar 17 2024,positive,story top but long
Mar 17 2024,neutral,not sure what i watched 
Mar 16 2024,positive,fun and entertaining
Mar 16 2024,negative,wowthis was tough to get through too overthetop and cheesy for me maybe i would have enjoyed it more if i was intoxicated
Mar 16 2024,positive,very entartaining and funny rockwell and howard rules all actors played well i adore the cat awesome movie
Mar 16 2024,negative,i really wanted to like this the only plus was alfie the cat was cute
Mar 16 2024,negative,lamest movie ive seen in a while cheesey and stupid
Mar 16 2024,negative,terrible bryce dallas howard is abominable in this rockwell tried to save it but no dice waste of time skip it
Mar 15 2024,negative,jeeeeeeze what kind of bullcrap crazy cat lady shiet is this how can i get my time back
Mar 15 2024,positive,very funny this film reminds me spy 2015 or first part of kingsmen definitely my type of movie actors did their job well and i adore soundtracks thank you
Mar 15 2024,positive,loved it so funny and tbh a breath of fresh of air to most films out
Mar 15 2024,negative,filled with over the top scenes confusing plot gaping plot holes uncomfortable moments and the feeling that it will never end
Mar 14 2024,positive,i loved this movie it was trully entertainiong i was captivated the whole time i laughed and giigled so much i dont get all the bad critics it was fun the cast is amazing even if some are only in a scene or two really liking mathew vaughn movies so far is it a masterpiece no but it is a good fun movie
Mar 14 2024,negative,sam rockwell was fantastic as usual  the rest was painful to watch
Mar 14 2024,positive,my opinion actors played very well excellent music choice electric energy soundtrack is awesome i love this movie
Mar 14 2024,negative,its hard to put into words just how terrible this movie really is   the cgi seldom looks finished the action sequences are tedious and for some reason the movie keeps insisting on introducing new twists to resolve outrageous plot holes   if it didnt try to take itself so seriously it could have been a better installment in the scary movie franchise
Mar 14 2024,positive,pretty good watch my boyfriend and i watched the movie on theatres surely it didnt bore and quite fascinated us specially the endings and twists all the way we had great fun watching it the rainbow action moment was a chefs kiss tbh its not quite an action spy movie but a genius spy thriler lastly the greater the spy the bigger the lie im a fan
Mar 13 2024,positive,it was indeed rather too long and kind of collapsed into something like silliness in the last reel but the drubbing that the film took at the hands of the professional critics suggests that some people who are paid to consider cinema as an art form have kind of forgotten that sometimes fun in enough of an excuse
Mar 13 2024,negative,big waste of time  expected so much more from this director  bought this movie and so sorry i did
Mar 13 2024,positive,the funniest movie ive seen during the last year awesome actors cool music i really like this film
Mar 13 2024,positive,fun no brainer how did it get the rights to use the beatles now and then in the movie so soon after its release
Mar 13 2024,positive,very entertaining the smoke scene when they played run by leona lewis was so beautiful my favorite all time movie scene 
Mar 13 2024,positive,a brilliant movie five stars to the director writer actors everyone involvedloved it
Mar 13 2024,negative,this movie was a perfect example of a great idea with a horrible execution too many plot twists that easily became confusing to say the least i wouldnt spend an evening at the theaters to see this but if you love action and a comical anount of plot twists this is the movie for you
Mar 12 2024,positive,just a fun movie totally unexpected  great spoof on all of the great spy thrillers 
Mar 12 2024,positive,argyle was wonderfully reminiscent of movies like romancing the stone but with some unexpected and delightful twists highly recommended for any fan of intriguing spy movies
Mar 12 2024,positive,good fun works up to a good crescendo and sets the scene up nicely for a future series of films
Mar 12 2024,positive,argyle was entertaining from start to finish  my whole family enjoy watching this movie
Mar 12 2024,negative,started well  story then dragged and became silly after a while
Mar 12 2024,negative,argylle makes for a great coming attraction but as a fulllength feature its a hot mess    nothing is what it seems and you cant keep track of your spies without a scorecard  this caper careens from one plot twist to another with the tables turning so many times that i found myself not caring who the good guys and bad guys were    argylle is smug with its own cleverness with its moviewithinabook premise bryce dallas howard plays elly a mystery author whose books are becoming all too real shes chased by good spies  bad spies chief among them sam rockwell he comes to her rescue on a train but is he a friend or foe    argylle has an allstar cast and i wanted to like it but the film wouldnt let me its loud  has too many plot twists so that the good will of the audience is trampled    director matthew vaughn has a panache for stylized violence but here its overdone and too much of a good thing    i did like the vignettes with henry cavill as the titular spy especially the sexy assassins tango with dua lipa but those scenes are in the coming attraction so theres no reason to sit through the bloated film
Mar 12 2024,positive,the movie had so many plot twists that i could not keep  with who was who in various scenes  i went a second time and it was a little better to make sense of the story line overall i am a fan of spy and action movies and this comedy certainly had  plenty of that  my favorite scene was the last battle starting with the oil slick and skating all the way through the dancing and shooting at the same time  it was entertaining enough just wish i could have kept up with all the changes and plot twists better
Mar 12 2024,positive,this movie was good i dont know why i got a bad rap
Mar 12 2024,positive,great movie a bit too long however mostly entertaining with unfathomable twists
Mar 12 2024,negative,awful one of the worst films i have ever seen
Mar 12 2024,positive,awesome soundtracks i love this movie thank you
Mar 12 2024,positive,i thought it was funny  usual marv movies dont take it too seriously
Mar 11 2024,positive,this movie was all over the place and lasted wayyy longer than it needed to be but it was hilarious and action packed throughout the entire film the twists  turns and betrayal kept the story interesting cant help but think it was inspired by lost city but i enjoyed it
Mar 11 2024,negative,what a waste if time the trailer looked like fun but the back and forth between real and imagined was just a pain to watch
Mar 11 2024,negative,this movie was way over the top bad i stayed for the whole thing but it was difficult to watch cant recommend stick with the trailer  its almost the only redeeming thing about this movie
Mar 11 2024,negative,good cast cute cat nice plot twist in the middle otherwise not that great bryce dallas howard and sam rockwell made a weird pairing didnt fit for me loved seeing catherine ohara in a role like that though
Mar 11 2024,positive,great movie just a lot of plot twists but very funny and great movie
Mar 11 2024,negative,apparently most of the budget went for the cast since they are using tons of cgi the writing is lazy or most probably poorly paid this movie was most likely written in a day or so and bad script was not revised they just kept it from start to end the viewer knows exactly how the plot will develop and what to expect from the scenes culmination for me it was boring to watch frustrating and insulting
Mar 11 2024,positive,very entertaining  im not sure why it got such bad reviews from the critics i mean its not shakespeare but very worth watching
Mar 11 2024,negative,matthew vaughn has a particular style that works in this film it absolutely does not work the movie is way to long that characters do not mesh with the styleand the dialogue is midlevel at best chalk this one up as a letdown from  matthew vaughn
Mar 11 2024,positive,i liked the movie good soundtracks interesting plot great action comedy all the actors played well
Mar 11 2024,positive,fun movie with lots of surprising twists
Mar 11 2024,negative,watch this only for the unbridled joy of having it end chase after boring chase lots of killing very thin plot
Mar 11 2024,neutral,the beginning started off at a solid b by the middle after the first plot twist it had gone down to a c by the end after the third deus ex machina its a c     what killed it was the deus ex machinas too much of them in a row
Mar 11 2024,positive,its like kingsman but with twists dont believe the critics theyre here to make our existence more miserable watch the movie and i am telling you there are no dull moments and its something a family can watch together 3
Mar 11 2024,negative,sam rockwell is wasted on this garbage  bryce looks horrible needs to get healthy stop giving people the idea that fat is ok the plot is same old stuff weve seen this movie before it was 2 stars before the reveal killed it
Mar 11 2024,positive,overall was a good movie but all of bryce dallas howards action scenes were so cringe
Mar 11 2024,positive,i would like to refer to this movie as like watching the tv show get smart there are some cheesy corny dialogue and scenes present but thats what i feel by the satire of this movie its a fun movie to watch it may not be to everyones liking but from my perspective i enjoyed the twists and turns and i thought this was a great cast
Mar 11 2024,positive,it was the best action movie i have seen in a long time and like the twist in the middle it keeps you wandering
Mar 11 2024,negative,this is not a review it is a warning if you enjoy storyline wit plot or any conventional movie staples then this cinematic excretion is not for you the storyline is mind bendingly senseless and the twists are just hackneyed tropes shoved up their own bottoms save yourself the time and do something equally entertaining like getting a colonoscopy
Mar 10 2024,positive,bro this movie is awesome i want more i dont care what others say like confusing or something like bro best movie ever but i want harry to play more
Mar 10 2024,positive,a fun silly and action packed movie  took my mum to see it for mothers day and we both loved it while i agree it was long i would absolutely watch it again for the fun action colour and overall silliness of it we really liked how the storylines intertwined sure the skating bit was a stretch im a figure skater i would know but it was funny and i overall had a good time i hope to see a continuation to the story sometime in the future
Mar 10 2024,negative,this is just sad how they ruined a potentially good movie with all these dumb plot twists and cringy special effects good actors didnt manage to save it
Mar 10 2024,positive,i really like this movie very good
Mar 10 2024,negative,we have a winner for worst film of the year
Mar 10 2024,positive,fun and crazy movie with surprising plot twists and great action
Mar 10 2024,positive,a ridiculously fun movie this was just a lot of fun a lot of twists on the old cliches and just generally innovative put on your suspension of disbelief and a load of popcorn and have fun
Mar 10 2024,positive,entertaining for sure to those looking to get away and into a movie with your popcorn and blanket  this one is worth the watch 
Mar 10 2024,negative,it was not a good movie
Mar 10 2024,positive,as usual the critics are wrong big surprise
Mar 10 2024,positive,great romantic action movie all the feels for aiden and elly and the action sequences were hilarious and gorgeous and so fluid
Mar 10 2024,negative,it hurts to even attempt a critique of the film out of respect for the great sam rockwell i will say that ive seen better rubbish
Mar 10 2024,negative,only worthy scene dua lipa dancing
Mar 10 2024,positive,if you are able to leave your sense of reality to the side this film is stupid and fun it has a couple plot holes within the realm of the spy genre but it does have some wild twists  seriously do not understand how film critics are so out of touch with what certain demographics will enjoy in a film
Mar 9 2024,positive,wtf did i watch imagine a soap opera jammed into one movie it just kept getting weirder and weirder it had action so still giving it 3 but holy f it was strange to watch
Mar 9 2024,positive,it was good but some places were sort of dumb im glad i saw it though
Mar 9 2024,positive,its romancing the stone meets the kingsmen very funny  romantic  action packed in a cartoon kind of way i had a blast just good fun
Mar 9 2024,positive,totally a female leaning movie which is probably why it has upset so many people  a funny movie that doesnt take itself seriously but is not predictable which most movie are these days so different and refreshing
Mar 9 2024,positive,yes it was corny and over the top but it was fun action packed if you enjoyed barbie and its silliness this is of the same kind so it is definitely for a certain subset of people i enjoyed it and so did my kids perfectly appropriate for them ages 11 and 12
Mar 9 2024,positive,entertaining funny captivating touching   might not be the most perfect work of art but it is gonna worth your while if you like fun    loved it
Mar 9 2024,negative,honestly with its almost cartoon style action scenes i could only make it through 20 minutes before shutting it off thinking this is just plain stupid
Mar 9 2024,positive,very disjointed but fun in places   really a big budget movie like this should be better
Mar 9 2024,negative,givig a 1 star rating and that is being generous this could have been an enjoyable comedy thriller instead it has a poor plot poor acting and way too drawn out lastly the ending is too unrealistic
Mar 9 2024,negative,just so incredibly dumb predictable and annoying not in a fun way or sharknado way just plain dumb still better than the lighthouse
Mar 9 2024,positive,yes its a bit long but its solid entertainment and you will walk away knowing you have had fun
Mar 9 2024,negative,aside from bryce dallas howards body not built for that kind of movie im not body shaming its a fact the terrible dresses they made her wear even made her look worse this movie wouldve been better as a comedy
Mar 9 2024,negative,too corny and far fetched
Mar 9 2024,negative,starts off fun and entertaining by the crude oil skating scene it was simply unwatchable
Mar 9 2024,positive,great movie very surprised by sam rockwell and bryce dallas howard
Mar 9 2024,positive,fun movie sam rockwell is perfect regret not seeing it in the theater critics can be critical
Mar 9 2024,positive,this movie truly feels like a fever dream youre not sure whether to take it seriously or not and it perfectly captures a feel good spy movie if youre having a bad day sit down and put this on
Mar 9 2024,positive,it was a blast so much fun sam rockwell was stellar as usual a must see
Mar 9 2024,positive,really dont see how critics give this movie such a low score  it makes fun of the ridiculous fight scenes in movies i find it more violent than necessary but its so tongue in cheek its almost laughable the script directing and acting is good that is why they changed it from apple tv movie to theater then pay per view
Mar 8 2024,positive,its fun its strange i liked it and would like more
Mar 8 2024,positive,very funny and entertaining critic rating isnt justified
Mar 8 2024,positive,i really liked this at the start great actors interesting story but it drug on way way too long too many twists too many spy clichés in fact i think they used all the spy clichés by the end i was very ready for it to be over despite that its still fun enough for a once through watch
Mar 8 2024,negative,i literally could predict all the movie
Mar 8 2024,neutral,had some fun parts the premise was interesting but the chemistry between the leads fell flat movie dragged in parts dialogue was lacking
Mar 8 2024,negative,despite some funny and good action scenes and a good twist the weirdness was too much and not thrilling
Mar 8 2024,neutral,bad cgi  boring fight scenes  unnecessary plot twists
Mar 8 2024,negative,unbelievable just unbelievable how can a producer see this movie after its done production and say yup its perfect lets give this to the world one of the worst things i have ever seen in my life just sad because one of my favorite actors sam rockwell is in thisshame they should honestly refund people who paid even a cent to see this
Mar 8 2024,negative,feminists ruin movies
Mar 8 2024,positive,not a perfect film but its cast score by lorne balfe direction visuals and action sequences all deliver making up for the flaws in its story
Mar 8 2024,positive,i really enjoyed this movie does it get a little ridiculous and insane with its plot twist and heavily cgi action shots sure but the absolute charm of howard and rockwells onscreen chemistry is undeniable and theyre surrounded by a pretty fun cast with plenty of laughs and excitement to boot
Mar 8 2024,positive,i really like this film please dont trust what this experts think it really is a good fresh spy movie with twist and a wonderful cliphanger at the end waiting for the next one
Mar 8 2024,negative,urrghh what disappointment
Mar 8 2024,negative,did anyone notice that it is the plot from total recall a decent idea but really poorly executed and the leading girl could not have been more miscast if they had instead cast antony hopkins in the role nonsense
Mar 8 2024,neutral,a little corny at times although meant to be that i found it slow
Mar 8 2024,negative,i found it to be only marginally funny wish i had just waited to stream it versus paying for the theatre
Mar 8 2024,positive,i really enjoyed this film it made some crazy out of the box choices that i had never seen in a film before i enjoyed the weird action but sometimes i do feel like it could get to much overall this movie not be for everyone as some of the action might be too cheesy and to corny
Mar 8 2024,positive,the cgi surprisingly for an apple movie was questionable in quality the plot mostly made sense but did have unexpected twists which is rare for me falls into a lot of the same traps of the genre for the he purposes of plot continuation overall it was enjoyable good cast definitely carried it id maybe watch again and would definitely watch a sequel
Mar 8 2024,negative,nonsensical story lacks character development we dont care much about the main protagonistbad cgi and choppy fight scenes sam rockwell is miscast as a super fighting spy or should have had more training he doesnt use his fists correctly
Mar 8 2024,negative,oh boy that was sad no wonder they promoted it so muchthe clips are better than the movie
Mar 7 2024,negative,invincible heroes overuse of plot twists lots of green screen pop music setting up a franchise usually hollywood bland youll only watch once
Mar 7 2024,positive,action packed  plot twisted few scenes cringe
Mar 7 2024,neutral,easy watch but boring
Mar 7 2024,positive,probably one of the best spy movies definitely the best made by this director far from perfect overly exaggerated and way too long action sequences that try to be funny and fail the cat was cool though it could be used better
Mar 7 2024,positive,i actually liked it  its funny its like different movies compiled into 1 ahahaha very humorous fun movie to watch very light
Mar 7 2024,negative,the storytelling takes too much time of back and forth
Mar 7 2024,positive,fresh movie loved it
Mar 7 2024,positive,its a bit long is the only thing i agree with the critics on  otherwise its a funny satire with a great looking cat thrown in  one of the bullet ballets was psychedelic and yeah dua lipa makes that dress look good
Mar 7 2024,negative,why is rotten tomatoes so full of obviously fake positive reviews these days i mean seriously just read some of the 5 star reviewstheyre laughable
Mar 7 2024,negative,so unrealistic multiple scenes that make 0 sense fir example to oil scene where they cant use guns rhen all the sudden they can so dumb also she kneeled down in the oil and came up knee or leg had no oil on it horrible plot overall not worth the money to see
Mar 7 2024,positive,i dont know why the critics slammed this i thought it was a lot of fun
Mar 6 2024,negative,it seemed like they just madeup a lot of stuff to make the movie drag to over 2 hours  too too long and not a  good story
Mar 6 2024,positive,its not as bad as the reviewers say  i liked it
Mar 6 2024,negative,why every single obvious thing should be explained only because of sam rockwells dialogs i can rate that 2
Mar 6 2024,positive,action packed and funny
Mar 6 2024,positive,so much fun intriguing and entertaining
Mar 6 2024,positive,just a great ride with attractive stereotypical characters not for those who take their fun seriously
Mar 6 2024,positive,it was okay but if you are going to have a super spy they cant be overweight it was just distracting  i like bryce but for this role she didnt fit the character  most actors when they take a role get in shape for the role
Mar 6 2024,negative,even though argylle does attempt to do much within its over two hour long feature sadly this resulted in a rather disappointing frustrating messy bloated and convoluted outcome despite having  a strong casting lineup
Mar 6 2024,positive,the greater the spy the bigger the lie    argylle is a 2024 spy action comedy film directed and produced by matthew vaughn      its ok but i feel mixed about this one   id recommend it if you like this genre but if not then probably give it a miss     this is quite complex sometimes funny sometimes confusing and sometimes silly especially towards the end but its enjoyable enough without being too memorable    when the plots of reclusive author elly conways fictional espionage novels begin to mirror the covert actions of a reallife spy organization quiet evenings at home become a thing of the past accompanied by her cat alfie and aiden a catallergic spy elly races across the world to stay one step ahead of the killers as the line between conways fictional world and her real one begins to blur
Mar 6 2024,negative,how the hell did someone greenlight this steaming pile of garbage
Mar 6 2024,positive,its a fun action movie hitting many spy movie tropes but refreshingly lighthearted
Mar 6 2024,positive,this is a weird one i didnt expect to like it but i did kind off the story is pure nonsense but the acting rockwell and dallas howard have great chemistry is good and there are really fun fight scenes on older dance music the first half is great but i lose interest in the plot after that
Mar 6 2024,positive,if its not your cup of tea then thats fine but this movie is nothing short of a masterpiece in terms of what it was aiming to do and that is compelling action and pure camp a bloated plot is the point its part of the joke it spins and spins like an ice skater building momentum compounding on itself and building up its comedic energy with each new twist and turn bringing you to new highs of sheer dionysian madness ready to accept joy as its fed to you from the vine it executes this flawlessly its plot isnt hard to follow and its characters are compelling enough to carry you through it without breaking immersion and its a perfect cast
Mar 6 2024,positive,it is fun and surprising twist
Mar 6 2024,negative,a sad choice considering the length of the film directed by matthew vaughns masterwork it is awkward because he intends to make two more sequels in the future just a penny for their opinions then depraved horrible inferior tiresome and confusing all around
Mar 6 2024,negative,more twisted and confusing than the movie inception but not in a good way
Mar 6 2024,negative,this movie was just stupid and was not worth the time i spent watching it
Mar 6 2024,positive,movie was ok some funny parts but i wouldnt leave the house to go see it
Mar 6 2024,negative,god is everyone just trying to make a buck in this industry dishing out this trash
Mar 6 2024,negative,perhaps the most boring movie that has the most action and twists ever made  this is mindnumbingly dull  the first 20 minutes introducing the characters had a good start even though it felt like a modern telling of romancing the stone  what follows is labored intrigue with a plot of a spy organization that peddles terrorism trying to keep its dirty secrets hidden  populated by talented actors often in supporting roles it borders on confusion not because of complexity rather its all nonsense  halfway through it becomes tiresome  m vaughan has proven himself the heir of m night with the coincidence sealed by the appearance of howard in both their films
Mar 6 2024,neutral,a fun first half dosent save the obnoxious second half
Mar 6 2024,negative,honestly while yes its a cute movie this is nothing more than mr right 2015  the man from uncle 2015 having a love child this feels so much like the same thing in relation to the scenes of both movies i felt as though i had scene it before but is still a good movie
Mar 5 2024,positive,one of the best movies in recent history 
Mar 5 2024,negative,movie was fun but way over the top script great actors with a really bad storyline
Mar 5 2024,positive,good film overall would struggle to re watch as without the twists i would struggle to be interested in the non action scenes
Mar 5 2024,negative,you know how you twist a piece of wire too much and it breaks yeah one too many twists in this silly movie causing it to self destruct way before the credits rolled and they were dumb twists it was bad i fast forwarded through many of the poorly executed tropes and a post credit scene i dont think it was required as id be verrrry surprised if this stinker ever gets a sequel it became apparent in the post credit scene this was attempting to link itself to the kingsmen movies somehow except i enjoyed those movies the key difference being matthew  vaughn wrote and directed those movies but was only the director here he only gets half the blame for this disaster
Mar 5 2024,negative,sitting through it was absolute agony it was all over the place with its plot cliches all in all a terrible movie with a great cast
Mar 5 2024,negative,first half was passable the latter half comical and cringe worthy passed the time but wouldnt recommend
Mar 5 2024,positive,meh is about right it did pass the time mildly entertaining popcorn was delicious thats about all i can really say about it oh i liked the addition of the cat but then again i am a big cat fan if you are super bored and have nothing to do this could possibly suffice
Mar 5 2024,positive,great cast bdh was really funny and entertaining the movie was almost too cheesy and gimicky at times but it was a fun ride
Mar 5 2024,negative,first part of the movie was fine but it just sucked
Mar 5 2024,positive,i thought this movie was hilarious i laughed from start to finish
Mar 4 2024,neutral,not sure how else to put this but it was a massive cringe fest the cat looked super weird and creeped me out the weird dance sequence made no sense but was visually cute
Mar 4 2024,neutral,it was bad but also good
Mar 4 2024,positive,i went it with little to no expectations the trailer made it look rather silly but we gave it a shot i was very pleasantly surprised it was funny had some good twists and i thoroughly enjoyed it there were two particular scenes that were just too dumb the oil scene was the worst for me  without giving too much away that said i would definitely see it again  it was a good and fun movie for a night out 
Mar 4 2024,positive,it was a good movie plot twists that i didnt see coming but it did have at least one scene that was a bit corny
Mar 4 2024,neutral,a spy thrillercomedy film centered on subverted expectations as a plot device that while not terrible was ultimately too convoluted too heavyhanded and too long to enjoy
Mar 4 2024,positive,its a fun movie dont get me wrong it just doesnt add up to anything special the many possible endings and dropping of the tempo so many times made this almost an unbearable movie but like i said it was fun and it had its moments which i enjoyed
Mar 4 2024,negative,this movie went from bad to really bad  a shallow story line enriched with convoluted violence
Mar 4 2024,positive,this movie was fun but towards the end it gets very silly almost to the point of too silly in all the movie was decent
Mar 4 2024,negative,simply awful spoiler once dua lipa dies in the first ten minutes its downhill from there it looks as though a matthew vaughan wannabee tried to make matthew vaughan film badly with a lot of money an impressive cast is totally wasted except for bryce dallas howard who is totally miscast if you are in to colourful and empty headed cgi this is the film for you
Mar 4 2024,positive,loved the mix of humor and drama which made me laugh
Mar 4 2024,positive,my boyfriend and i watched it and loved it action packed and funny something for both of us
Mar 4 2024,positive,exciting spy movie   liked it a lot
Mar 4 2024,positive,loved the actors and storyline kept you alert loved every bit of it
Mar 4 2024,positive,a fun ride with some interesting plot twists seeing this helped suppress some of my bond withdrawal soundtrack was fun as well just suspend your disbelief and go with it  you wont be sorry
Mar 4 2024,positive,absolutely loved this campy goofy spy romcom this movie is constantly making fun of itself and the spy genre full of over the top action scenes and oneliners super fun movie but if you hate campy films this one isnt for you
Mar 3 2024,negative,went off the rails about halfway through
Mar 3 2024,negative,i had low expectations but this movie under delivered on even those  it was so bad i almost walked out because id rather be home watching tv  love sam rockwell too and tough to see such a talented actor in such a mediocre production
Mar 3 2024,negative,what i have just watched is one of the most insanely idiotic things i have ever seen at no point in the rambling incoherent movie were they even close to anything that could be considered a coherent film   everyone in the theater is now dumber for having watched it    but seriously it was bad very bad my brother always says that expectations are big part of enjoying a movie and i didnt come in with high expectations but nonetheless it was able to disappoint me when they break out into a dancing scene in the middle of a firefight it just gets ridiculous cartoony action and crazy coincidences i can deal with but this total departure from acceptable storytelling and a long drawn out not very interesting plot had me seriously considering getting up and leaving
Mar 3 2024,positive,sometimes hard to follow and storyline hard to believe but overall it wasnt a bad movie
Mar 3 2024,positive,was clean fun and enjoyable  may see it again
Mar 3 2024,negative,it had a lot of action but just like the same action all the time and the plot was super boringit had to use a lot of songs to make things feel alivesam rockwell did his best to hold up the movie but overall i just couldnt wait to leave
Mar 3 2024,positive,its a cute fun movie some parts get a little cheesy and the cat cgi is rough at times  but if you go in just hoping to be entertained you wont be disappointed
Mar 3 2024,positive,disagree with critics this is a fun movie they need to lighten up if you enjoy plot twists irony and whimsythis movie is for you be ready to get tickled
Mar 3 2024,negative,i dont recall laughing even once disappointing
Mar 3 2024,positive,witty and fun dont care what anyone says this movie was pretty darn good
Mar 3 2024,positive,the trailer of this movie hooks my interest with this style of movie the plot summary is about a novel writer who accidentally write a story that mirrors reallife events attracting the attention of a spy determined to keep her writing to predict the future unexpected surprises throughout the film keep viewers excited adding an element of unpredictability  the genre of the movie is action adventure comedy drama mystery  thriller just only the genre is very interesting for me it is including many topics all in one movie so my expectation from this movie is very high i want to see some new technique of storytelling in the movie  after watching the movie i think it can meet my expectation but not that much the screenplay and content in the movie are well prepared but there is some scene that leave me a question how come of this and that but because it is a comedy movie thus making those questions clears without being serious the movie is very entertaining with numerous comedic scenes that make me laugh frequently throughout the entire viewing  i very like sam rockwell performance as aiden he has done great job in both action and funny scenes with his charming and hilarious character the rest of actor and actress also done it well they make me feel passionate and impressed by their performances  the cgi and effects are good i would like to praise the postproduction team for their outstanding work on the movies sets the background has a great detailed the colorful of each scene make me know how hardworking they are the action scene is amazing as well there is a brandnew action scene that make me feel wow it is a great combination between arts and action ill respect whoever thinking about the action scene   i will give it 8 out of 10 this movie makes me enjoy and satisfied i like overall of every component the screenplay director actor and postproduction team have made a fantastic movie lastly i recommend you guys to try and watch this movie for once you will not be disappointed for sure and this movie will sure make you will entertain whole 2 hours for sure
Mar 3 2024,negative,fun premise that initially looked to satirize the cliche elements of spy thrillers however as time went on the film then makes serious attempts at recreating those same cliched elements making me wonder if they were serious or not the phrase always in moderation comes to mind with this film specifically in its plot twists if every other scene has some sort of plot twist that everyone can see coming a mile away then it seriously degrades the dramatic effect      spoilers i guess dont watch this movie    obviously elly was argylle the whole time every time she looked in a mirror the dude was talking to her doesnt take a genius to figure that one out     the second the movie starts depicting the long lost romance with elly and aiden shes all of a sudden one of the bad guys and shoots aiden you think they would just let that go and shes supposedly the best spy in the world of course she played a part and shot him in a place that wouldnt kill him they have a romance to settle after all this has been done numerous times in spy thrillers     and that ending scene with the mom from home alone lol that was honestly my favorite scene for all the wrong reasons of course the theme of home alone mom brainwashing elly with various things would come back in a manchurian candidate style way this was literally a scene in zoolander where the triggering device kept going on and off and the hilarious duality of good guy bad guy ensued again im trying to figure out if they were just satirizing the whole thing or not this was the climax scene by the way    and of course concerning the random barge worker that smacked home alone mom to end the climax of the entire film was it     a a random act of kindness by some masked up barge worker that no one has seen before     or     b keira aka the last remaining plot hole that was mentioned numerous times the author of the mysterious email elly got about a plot twist to shoot her lover through a very small section of the chest devoid of any major arteries and right where keira in ellys novel funny enough was also shot and her fate never being explained until now     if you guessed a then you would really like this movie
Mar 3 2024,positive,a wild ride with more twists than celtic knotwork
Mar 3 2024,positive,sooo much fun and captivating to watch my favorite movie of the year so far
Mar 3 2024,positive,movie tuff ash

Mar 2 2024,positive,fantastic action great acting by the characters
Mar 2 2024,positive,this movie was filled with action twists  laughs if you are looking for a light hearted action movie this is the one for you
Mar 2 2024,positive,great concept and funny execution could have been a solid 710 if theyd cut down the runtime by about 3040 minutes the film suffers greatly from drawn out fight sequences and scenes that dont add anything plot wise by the end i had lost interest and just wanted it to end
Mar 2 2024,negative,horrible stupid movie started out okay and then went way sideways
Mar 2 2024,positive,unpopular opinion but i loved the movie as a casual watch not in my top favorite but it was enjoyable
Mar 2 2024,positive,pleasantly surprised with how good this was good action and phenomenal characters
Mar 2 2024,negative,was that a movie  flat poorly written poorly acted  looked like a rough take  fell asleep  left early   save your self skip it   save your money   just watch the trailer that was good
Mar 2 2024,positive,i dont know why this movie is getting so much hate it was an enjoyable a tad over the top romp with some lovely twists and a stellar cast  is it because the melded humour with spy  personally thought it was delightful  not perfect of course but a great watch 
Mar 2 2024,positive,this movie was just fun  it had a few twists and turns to keep you guessing but dont take it too seriously  if you just want to laugh and have a good time this did the trick  it reminded me a little of the lost city
Mar 1 2024,positive,cheesy spy move same director as kingsman so its of that would i like it and i loved the disco music
Mar 1 2024,negative,horrible garbage this movie was way to long and i just wanted to get out of the theatre the worst experience i have ever had horrid absolutely horrid the biggest piece of trash ever
Mar 1 2024,negative,its disgusting its a waste of timeits a two hour tiktok short play
Mar 1 2024,positive,loved it so much it is an incredibly fun movie
Mar 1 2024,negative,the movie started out well with a fun spin on the typical spy movie story but became too long too convoluted and too silly the last half hour of the story ruined the movie for me
Mar 1 2024,negative,i love big screen movies  i was seduced by the previews ive only walked out of a couple of movies in my life and im 73  but this was one of the most boring stupid movies i have ever seen  and i walked out after an awful dance and then skating scene  omg these actors should be so embarrassed they are so much better than this movie  dont be fooled by the name actors dont waste your money  i wouldnt even say watch this if it comes to free tv
Mar 1 2024,positive,how does this have lower ratings than beekeeper at least this has an original ish script and a decent twist this is a definite add to ma collection
Mar 1 2024,negative,if you want to see a movie where the next scene is completely random its a good watch however if you are looking for a movie without 100 plot holes or a movie with good writing this movie is not for you was laughly bad which made it a fun watch
Mar 1 2024,positive,i loved the entire movie sooooo much
Feb 29 2024,positive,i thoroughly enjoyed the silliness of the movie to my mind this was not meant to be a tense spythriller but in the same vein as kingsman which makes sense given the postcredit scene it made me laugh and had me intrigued in places too the only thing i wasnt totally keen on was the extended iceskating scene i think that it could have been much shorter and would have landed better
Feb 29 2024,positive,enjoyed it  laughed out loud  fits my sense of humor
Feb 29 2024,negative,gosh what a turkey    dont get me wrong im a big comedy fan and actionfilm fan im a very generally positive person too i also appreciate what huge nuanced efforts feature films are and what an incredibly tricky balance of skills it takes to make a good one    so believe me im not putting down this film without good reason it just defies so many basic principles of good filmmaking and storytelling i felt i had to say something in case i might be able to save someone from spending their money and time on it    its too bad because it starts off with a fun premise that in better hands couldve been something very good and for the first 1520 minutes it seems to be going that way    then the silly overlong train fight sequence occurs then brian cranstons twodimensional scenerychewing character appears a shame as hes so brilliant with better material and direction then lovely talented catherine ohara was obligated to do the same i felt so sorry for them both    and all the ludicrous contradictory plot twists as if the writers figured the more twists they could cram into a story the better it would be    but what drove me crazyand eventually out of the theater very rare for mewas the constant exposition for those of you unfamiliar with the term its when rather then going about their business letting the story unfold and letting us enjoy the film as a developing intriguing thing the characters stop and make long speeches explaining things to each other and hence the audience its about as fun as having someone in the seat behind you keep leaning over and explaining the story its why one of the most basic principles of good storytellingwhich these writers apparently hadnt heard aboutis show dont tell yep this picture has a big ol mess of telling    in hindsight the plot was so ridiculously convoluted there may have been no other way to hold it together but is it entertainment or is it such a bunch of pointless cliched situations action sequences of gratuitous ladeda killing posturing as comedy ha ha right and holdeverything timetoexplainagain moments that one ends up thinking why is this film working so desperately ludicrously hard to make such little sense and to go in so many directions at once did anyone connected with it actually watch itand how could they have and not realize what a mess it was and why am i sitting here watching it when it would be so much easier not to    keep in mind too that its ostensibly a comedy and that comedies arent nearly as obligated to make sense as other films they can even be ridiculous what they cant doand expect to be any goodis ignore the audiences integrity and wander all over the cinematic map throwing an interminable barrage of disjointed cgidriven drivel from the screen because they dont think the most basic aspects of good storytelling apply to them    as a good friend of mine wouldve said its about two hours too long you have been warned 
Feb 29 2024,negative,this movie was such a cluster ef its all over the place
Feb 29 2024,negative,i really like sam rockwell and he made it worth the two stars i gave it it shouldve ended 5 times before it did a friend i saw it with said it started bad got better then got much worse i feel it had a lot of potential but tried too many twists and got way too unrealistic the previews also made it seem like the car was a central part but really just an ai minor character 
Feb 29 2024,positive,it was really good different than i thought it would be but in a really good way
Feb 28 2024,negative,terrible too long and not enough cena  movie seemed to never end
Feb 28 2024,negative,it was waaaaayyyyyyy too long it got so over the top with double double agents stuff and ridiculously unbelievable if you were a bad guy that got killed you stayed dead but a good guy or the top bad guy nah you could die 8x she also ice skated on crude oil even slid on her knees in it but didnt have any on her
Feb 28 2024,positive,so fun the plot was so thrilling would highly reccomend for a fun action movie acting was so good characters were interesting and compelling the fight scenes well coordinated nit realistic obviously but a fantastic action film that doesnt take itself too seriously in my favourites
Feb 28 2024,negative,it was a 10pm show and i took a nice two hour nap in the theater 
Feb 28 2024,positive,i saw this last night and loved it  sam rockwell delivers as always an amazing performance and i have a new found respect for bryce dallas howard she did an fantastic job  bryan cranston and catherine ohara were wonderful  in their roles and samuel l jackson was perfect as usual  the storyline was intriguing and the action was fast paced and fun  rockwell and his obligatory dance scenes are always a pleasure   the only minor issue was the cgi or fx with the cat was over the top terrible  so bad it was actually comical in a painful sort of way  absolutely recommending for a fun night of movie watching   will be buying this when it comes out its definitely one that will be watched more than once
Feb 28 2024,positive,fun quirky exciting and the jokes land well the cg stuff was a bit obvious and may break suspension of belief but well made  though it reminded me of citadel
Feb 28 2024,negative,the first act was engaging clever and entertaining  it went downhill fast however and became bloated and confusing  i want my 2 hours back
Feb 28 2024,positive,i had high hopes for this film as a fan of the kingsman sagas but was disappointed whilst the actors played their parts well the endless plot twists just turned this from something interesting to mediocre the 12a also meant that the film had to be more restrained then the kingman films and it was evident throughout that perfect moments for a little bit more language or violence had been reined in     i think the film would have been better if it had just remained as a writer who accidently authored the secret missions the trailer made for a more impressive film then the resulting actual film
Feb 28 2024,negative,wow well it wasnt the worst movie ive seen  but it was not good  it was even bad in certain areas i was the only one in the theater for 615pm show on cheap tuesday no joke bryce was miscast for layered role  some of the fight scenes were cringeworthy  the movie stopped playing towards the end due to technical issues and they tried to restart it  but i was done  couldnt stand any more  15 stars
Feb 28 2024,positive,i liked the pace and the back and forth with argyll and aiden  i did not like the dance sequence although it was very colorful  the ending confused me
Feb 28 2024,negative,the best part of the movie was the music bdh is a solid actress however she is unbelievable in the lead role  sam rockwell was good as always  it is a shame that the script didnt give him much to work with overall
Feb 28 2024,positive,i enjoyed the action and the twists around every corner good movie the first movie i had see bryce in she was great
Feb 28 2024,negative,just plain dumb  the only reason i gave it a 1 12 was it did have lots of action scenes
Feb 28 2024,positive,this movie was a very nice break from reality it is very cheesy but on purpose it was filled with stars and very action packed i will definitely watch again
Feb 28 2024,positive,argylle kicks off with promising intrigue blending elements of winter soldier and romancing the stone within the stylish universe of kingsman the first half delivers a solid foundation skillfully intertwining fiction and reality as elly conways novels manifest in the real world however the film stumbles in its second half struggling to maintain its initial momentum the attempt to balance 007style sophistication with fast and furious intensity results in a tonal inconsistency that detracts from the overall experience by the final act the narrative overstays its welcome leaving audiences longing for a conclusion sooner than it arrives
Feb 28 2024,negative,i have never left a review on rotten tomatoes but this movie was truly awful  the acting was decent but the plot was ridiculous  my husband and i wondered afterwards why we didnt just walk out of the theater instead of watching the entire thing  glad it was 5 tuesday
Feb 27 2024,positive,great movie soooo funny well written
Feb 27 2024,negative,what a stupid movie  a complete waste of time after seeing who was in it i said why not go and see it  i think the actors just wanted a paycheck on this one  would not recommend it it hurt my brain watching this movie total nonsense
Feb 27 2024,positive,there were twists and turns that kept you guessing what was going to happen next
Feb 27 2024,positive,say what you want about this movie but with good action some funny moments and good characters made argylle a good experience
Feb 27 2024,positive,nice plot twist and it didnt take itself too seriously  good fun
Feb 27 2024,negative,movie starts good then gets worse with every turn
Feb 27 2024,negative,no just no seriously felt like two directors the first half was awesome  goofy in the right way halfway through the movie and you know where they more than jumped the shark they took jumped the shark to the next level the second half ruined the movie and all they built in the plot and twists before the end because it went in 45 mjn too long i said to my husband do you want to go i dont even care how it ends he said yes and we read what happened in the last 510 min on the drive home whats so frustrating is i loved the first ½ but once the smoke fight scene came on the rest of the movie was rotten dont do it
Feb 27 2024,negative,i was so excited about this movie but i did not enjoy it much the action is great and fun but the cgi is terrible and the story is so long the movie felt like it lasted forever it was too many plot twists that and most were pretty predictable that it just got boring
Feb 27 2024,negative,long movie that dragged on waste of time
Feb 27 2024,positive,very entertaining and the plot twist was a
Feb 27 2024,positive,this movie was really good surprisingly it was excellent i saw this in theaters and the movie had not only a great story but scenes that just made you go wow  honestly this movie gets a solid 45 stars the movie was good but not that good to get a 5 star rating
Feb 27 2024,negative,really bad writing everything was foreseen nothing really made sense or was in anyway realistic i mean i get its gunna have some comedy but it was cringe i and a few others couldnt even look at the screen the type of movie that has you rolling your eyes its sad because it had good actors the writing is just terrible and everything is sooo over the top its nonsensical
Feb 27 2024,neutral,a silly movie with way too many shoot em up scenes okay to pass the time away
Feb 27 2024,positive,i loved  it but family did not like it 
Feb 27 2024,positive,this felt like reading a fixit fanfiction off of ao3 the plot was well thought out the writing was more than cheesy and was more than unhinged
Feb 27 2024,negative,sucks the shouldve lost some weight before she played a spy 
Feb 27 2024,negative,video games and superhero movies have ruined action movies forever now all action stars are invincible and all bad guys are npcs set on dumbass
Feb 26 2024,positive,this was entertaining but i did find moments where this dragged on  its an action movie and i shouldnt be begging it to get on with it   the characters were likeable but moments where you could have created spin and suspense and interest it just presented it and dropped the ball  id watch it again but im not going to see it on the big screen
Feb 26 2024,positive,great action and very funny
Feb 26 2024,positive,best comedy ive seen in a long time i was literally cracking up during the entire movie   it was so good that im going to watch it again once i can stream it   if you like spy comedies with crazy twists then this movie is for you i loved it
Feb 26 2024,negative,i often find matthew vaughn movies to be a mixed bag of reactions  argylle wasnt for me despite the fairly promising start  the best efforts from bryce dallas howard  sam rockwell to carry the story it just becomes a slog to get through a movie wanting to do too much with too much handholding  nearly every aspect of the humour is flat  got a couple of small laughs when it questions the conveniences  if you forget the fairly fun action sequence aboard the train the rest of the action comes across like a practice run thats more concerned with trying be funny set pieces set more around the overbearing music   lastly the trailer made the suppose big twist to be predictable in my view
Feb 26 2024,positive,the film is far from being considered abominable but it is a huge disappointment in vaughns filmography the film is fun and its characters exude charisma with every step they take but i think that films like kingsman achieve their goal perfectly by balancing action comedy drama and intrigue correctly things in which argylle fails miserably still i appreciate that experiments like these exist that they break out of the box and try to innovate
Feb 26 2024,positive,it was captivating and had a unique story there were many levels to the story all of the upcoming previews were terrible
Feb 26 2024,positive,the storyline was pretty good as well as the action
Feb 26 2024,positive,really enjoyed it  a fun movie  it got a tad long and a bit over complicated at the end and they could have done without the g ds completely  but overall a good fun film
Feb 26 2024,negative,first half okay then it went down hill tryiing to fill 90 minutes
Feb 26 2024,negative,what a mess it didnt need to be as long as it was a few of us nodded off a couple of times the best thing about the movie was the cat
Feb 26 2024,negative,i made an account just so i could give it one star it had some amazing cast but threw it away this movie has a stupid amount if plot twists and each is more predictable than the last do not watch unless you wanna laugh at it
Feb 26 2024,negative,just a waste of time for a weakly told story that seems to never want to end
Feb 26 2024,positive,i thought it was well done i love the actors and i felt like they were trying something i hope that they keep trying new things i wish the cgi was better but overall i would recommend it if you loved mr right you will be happy to see our hitman on the big screen 
Feb 26 2024,positive,a fun and energetic way to spend an hour and thirty minutes the first half of the movie sets the tone for some action scenes that air on the side of comedy on purpose although some say the plot is convoluted it invites the audience to follow along with the characters journey through her own confusionspoiler and for those paying attention set ups are paid off with a few twists that form the movies emotional center
Feb 26 2024,negative,totally unrealistic  silly dancing  good beginning plot but then became ridiculous  almost left after a half hour but then thought it may improve  no such luck  the 2 main actors were very likable until the very end of the movie
Feb 26 2024,negative,while the twists and the action sequences were great the rest of the movie just didnt hold up with most characters just being hollow in the inside
Feb 26 2024,positive,fun campy movie enjoyed it for what it was enjoyed the choreography
Feb 26 2024,positive,it is a very funny movie and i enjoyed every minute of it even though it is a little long i hope more people will go to watch this movie and feel the joy even though the critics are not kind to this film
Feb 26 2024,positive,i was between 3 and 35 stars i really liked a lot of moments in the movie and the cast was amazing  but damn it ran about 3040 minutes longer than it should have
Feb 26 2024,neutral,interesting at first about halfway to 23 of the movie the plot became very complicated and almost silly as our many movies today just too much fighting we need more movies where the interaction is between the characters not just hitting each other
Feb 26 2024,positive,twists and turns are done with the overarching story in mind its a great film see it in theaters and yes the action is over the top on purpose so sit back and enjoy
Feb 25 2024,positive,appreciate the cast  the cast is phenomenal  the movie is too long so confusing and so much could have been cut from the movie  the cat attack at the end so dumb  if taylor swift really did write this i would deny it too  i would say skip it
Feb 25 2024,positive,i loved it delightfully quirky with lots of twists and turns
Feb 25 2024,negative,my god what a torturously terrible movie 20 minutes in and i was already ready for it to be over the flash backing back and forth between fantasy argyle and sam rockwell got old almost immediately and they just keep doing it for far too long speaking of far too long the movie could have had at least an hour edited out of it or maybe  5 of its fake ending idiotic plot twists removed   i would have walked out if i hadnt been with friends i sat through this entire train wreck of a movie thinking at some point it might get better but it just kept getting worse im 99 sure this was written by ai it is just god awful
Feb 25 2024,negative,it was terrible i slept the entire movie
Feb 25 2024,positive,aside from a great twist that flips the film on its head and great moments of action and comedy argylle is not perfect nor is it supposed to be matthew vaughn presents a fun homage to spy films  in all their silliness and ingeniousness  and besides a few nuggets of subtext thats all argylle is and that is enough to justify its existence sometimes a film can just exist as a fun time at the movies and nothing more or less
Feb 25 2024,negative,dancefight scene was extrememly corney and hard to watch
Feb 25 2024,positive,very likable characters lots of action and funny twists
Feb 25 2024,positive,not bad but neither very good too many plot twists for me 5 minutes for dua lipa and 10 minutes for samuel l jackson
Feb 25 2024,negative,it started off alright and got increasingly daft as it went a long by the 3rd act i was thoroughly bored
Feb 25 2024,neutral,the stunts were farfetched but interesting however in general the plot was confusing and often difficult to follow a poor version of a james bond movie  the bit that happens during the credits did not make sense further it didnt work because most of the audience had already stood up and were leaving so most patrons missed at least half of it
Feb 25 2024,positive,a humorous spy movie with a great cast my husband and i really liked it and will look forward to the second one
Feb 25 2024,positive,a high energy movie with a lot of twists and turns  theres one part thats just very bizarre but overall a lot of fun
Feb 25 2024,positive,ridiculously fun  clever and action packed the videography perfectly showcases bryce dallas howards curvy assets 
Feb 25 2024,negative,disappointing to say the least with a great cast i was hopeful but they all just sold out to a cheesy script we left the theater with 20 minutes left because staying and watching actors you like participate in the circus that was on the screen just made us sad for them and for us
Feb 25 2024,negative,the absolutely worst thing ive watched in as long as i can remember so bad and not in the so bad its good way stupid nonsensical cringeworthy the dance number and ice skating scenes were especially awful i dont know if this was trying to be a comedy or what but just a total fail of whatever it was supposed to be if i werent with other people i would have gotten up and walked out of the theater oof
Feb 25 2024,negative,movie was ok in the beginning and got so wack from the middle to the end
Feb 25 2024,positive,the entire movie was ridiculous but awesome enough to be really good and great acting considering m
Feb 25 2024,positive,ok  the third act is weird but its a really fun movie
Feb 25 2024,positive,this is the most enjoyable movie ive seen in recent memory bryce dallas howard is a goddamn delight and this is something one needs to experience for themself to get the most out of it i can see why critics arent into it its formulaic the action scenes border on gratuitous and theres not a ton of deep dialogue but for an actualviewer its funny smart touching exciting and twistyturnt its biggest flaw is that i cant see it for the first time again
Feb 25 2024,positive,funny and clever movie that matched the trailer if you like the trailer youll probably like the movie fun scenarios fun fighting a bit over the top and silly at times but if you expect it and go with it youll enjoy it
Feb 25 2024,negative,wow teens walking out saying what a waste of two hours they werent lying bad
Feb 25 2024,negative,garbage movie dont even bother watching it
Feb 25 2024,positive,it was action packed and had lots of surprises

Feb 25 2024,positive,very entertaining and fun lots of twists and turns great cast
Feb 25 2024,positive,great movie probably vaughns best with so many cult classics and good films its saying alot well written great cast chemistry they story is an over the top popcorn flick but in my humble opinion i think everyone delivers in a big way see it in theaters and buy you a copy this one wont make half what its value is just that dang good
Feb 25 2024,positive,the spy movie satire was strong with this one absolutely loved it
Feb 25 2024,positive,awesome movie had me laughing the whole time 
Feb 25 2024,positive,more of a dppof of a spoof  but it had its moments
Feb 24 2024,positive,this movie starts out rather challenging to stay captive to but once you get past the first 2030 minutes of it do i believe you really get an idea of where the movie is heading and what its about its comical at times has action and is genuinely a decent movie over all with a wild twist i recommend seeing it but it wasnt my kind of movie for sure
Feb 24 2024,positive,i loved it  just a fun movie   cool scenes  a lead feminine actress action movie done right
Feb 24 2024,positive,fun spy comedy movie with some uncommon twists providing a well rounded entertaining experience
Feb 24 2024,negative,im not going to liei hated it there was so much cgi that it was bad it was cringe af and so stereotypical so predictable he calls her kiddo bruh and theyre in love oh and of cooouuurse the ship needs to blow up as they sail away
Feb 24 2024,negative,bad bad bad movie was hoping it was something like kingsman about the first 15 mins is ok then down hill from there 
Feb 24 2024,positive,i loved it very entertaining fun to watch good music and lots of action i enjoyed it and did not look at my watch to see what time it was
Feb 24 2024,neutral,the movie just didnt come together  who was argile was he her alter ego the two principle actors i thought were a complete mismatch  there wasnt a spark of a romantic  fire between them  its too bad because i really like the the  actor who played argyle   his name escapes me at the moment  his talents and suave sophistication  were completely wastes in this movie  this was a movie trying too hard to put itself together
Feb 24 2024,positive,action packed energetic and funny
Feb 24 2024,negative,bad vfx terrible script the plot was a mess it was boring overlong and too absurd to be funny
Feb 24 2024,positive,great movie love the action and comedy along with the great cast
Feb 24 2024,positive,a pretty average film while the story was a bit basic and had too many twists the visuals were absolute eyecandy i cant even begin to describe how creative it was visuallywise     if you want a movie to passively enjoy this will likely be your cup of tea
Feb 24 2024,positive,i love the movie very enjoyable and great cast
Feb 24 2024,positive,this movie was sooooooo nice
Feb 24 2024,positive,this movie was very very good everyone should recommend watching it

Feb 24 2024,positive,sooo much fun i was in love with sam rockwell by the end ive always loved him but not as a sexy action star i also love that bryce dh wasnt typical actress skinny in this it made it all so much more realistic i know a realistic spy thriller but it was
Feb 24 2024,neutral,i laughed hard a few times but it was so cheesy at times reminded me of austin powers
Feb 24 2024,positive,great action scenes and you cant go wrong with bryce dallas howard and sam rockwell loved it
Feb 24 2024,positive,loved it better than expected theyre arent many fun movies that come out anymore dramatic and serious seems to be the norm its nice to be entertained for a couple hours and have some fun and a few laughs
Feb 24 2024,positive,a bit over stuffed and over complicated for its own good but still a fun enjoyable film overall
Feb 24 2024,positive,a silly spy movie with a sprinkling of fun action sequences but very bland dialogue and longer than it needs to be
Feb 24 2024,positive,a lot of fun and silly action   i was crying at the fight scene toward the end
Feb 24 2024,positive,cheesyfondu cheesy we laughed through the whole movie the balance of comedy and action was right on and kept us guessing even if the lines were a bit predictable
Feb 24 2024,positive,argylle boasts an action style reminiscent of matthew vaughns kingsman characterized by opulence theatricality and dynamic energy with lorne balfes score sharp editing and a unique narrative approach featuring a story within a story it had the potential to be an outstanding spy action film unfortunately due to awkward character dynamics and certain visually offputting scene designs the film falls short of achieving the excellence it could have attained
Feb 24 2024,positive,really good morning 
Feb 24 2024,positive,too long and too silly
Feb 23 2024,positive,excellent fun exciting spy with a cat
Feb 23 2024,positive,so much fun hilarious amazing cast 
Feb 23 2024,positive,a light hearted almost satirical take on the usually contrived standard plots that occupy the spy thriller genre making it an easy and surprisingly funny watch overall would recommend
Feb 23 2024,positive,its a kingsman style movie from the matthew vaughn plot even does make sense somehowcrazy stupid action comical characters and choreo but hits great and is entertaining maybe a little too long but if you love kingsman youll like it
Feb 23 2024,negative,i couldnt get tickets to print and had to rebuy the tickets so i paid twice no one could help me
Feb 23 2024,positive,liked the plot the fight scenes and the spectacular leading actress for her skating scene
Feb 23 2024,positive,omg i just saw this movie and had to write a review just twists left and right so much fun to watch and had me gasping constantly definitely a great watch and for the first time i wouldnt mind re watching this movie dont understand the other low reviews cause this was awesome

Feb 23 2024,positive,lots of action and a fun storyhad you kinda guessing till the end
Feb 23 2024,negative,terrible i fell asleep twice
Feb 23 2024,negative,without doubt the worst movie ive ever seen it tried to be silly but ended up falling flat the previews for it were superrrr misleading making the movie seem like it would be funnier and more interesting than it was at the end of it i was super sad that this is the movie we chose to spend our money on instead of one of the others i am never the type to fall asleep during a movie or to walk out but we genuinely wanted to walk out the only reason we didnt walk out is because we thought surely it gets better we were wrong
Feb 23 2024,positive,i was hoping to be entertained  mission accomplished  there are a lot of laughs in this movie and while it isnt paving new ground and doesnt claim to it is a fun watch  over the top a lot of the time but sometimes thats where i want to go
Feb 23 2024,positive,it was hilarious and fun i loved the twists not at all what i expected going in and i swear this will be all i think about for months so good loved the chemistry of the actors and story i couldnt stop laughing
Feb 23 2024,negative,i would give it minus 5 if i could worst movie i ever sat through till the end and only because i did not ask the people i went to see it with if we should just get up and leave in the middle of it in the end we all agreed worst movie ever a completely ridiculous plot we joked that our stupid neurons got a boost for over 2 hours difficult to believe all these actors agreed to be part of this piece of garbage and that apple made it a complete waste of over 2 hours of my life life is precious do not waste it on this movie
Feb 23 2024,positive,argylle was an absolute romp a star studded cast delivers a relatively fun time seems to be aware of its overall wacky tone which adds to the joy there is a decent yet simple plot with a bit of mystery thrill and a dab of romance for good measure
Feb 22 2024,negative,just too much would make me laugh and then ruin it with some ridiculous scene went on forever for no reason a poor over the top boring version of kingsman
Feb 22 2024,positive,it was a good laugh with plenty of action
Feb 22 2024,positive,it was ok got a bit cheesy
Feb 22 2024,positive,it started with a lot of action however  it was a little silly in places
Feb 22 2024,negative,this is one of the worst movies ive seen i was so excited to see it but the trailer was misleading the stunts were so stupid and unbelievably unrealistic the twists just kept coming to the point where it was idiotic
Feb 22 2024,negative,tries to be light and funny but drags on without enough comic relief to tie its dragged out plot points together i wanted to appreciate it for its stupid silliness but i was bored when the plot tried to hard to be a serious action film its silly in blips and pockets but doesnt carry its own weight
Feb 22 2024,neutral,while entertaining the plot of this film is quite farfetched and the action sequences are comical at best argylle is mostly a good time but has more than a few cringeworthy moments and eyerolling plot twists
Feb 22 2024,positive,a refreshing quirky fun time if you are looking for something different thats lighthearted then go see this movie has action comedy some drama and great music as well no masterpiece or anything but it isnt trying to be
Feb 22 2024,negative,what a mess they couldnt decide if they wanted  over the top silliness or an action movie rockwell s talent was wasted btw the only thing this movie had in common with the book is the title good book terrible movie
Feb 22 2024,positive,it was a good movie and its a lot of twists and turns
Feb 22 2024,positive,great movie dont take it too seriously and enjoy it for what it is funny entertaining creative and quirky sure a little hokey and goofy but why do you go to the movies if not to have some fun
Feb 22 2024,positive,it was thoroughly entertaining funny and at times serious i did enjoy it i would recommend it it takes your mind of the world and its many problems it is a welcome escape 
Feb 22 2024,positive,the kingsman crew did not disappoint
Feb 22 2024,positive,went in with no expectations and came out pretty satisfied  great movie worth a watch
Feb 22 2024,positive,honestly this movie is kid of mid but the girl i was watching it with put her head on my shoulder so in my unbiased opinion this is by far this best movie ive ever seen 5 stars
Feb 22 2024,negative,took the time to review my first movie just to tell anyone reading to save their time 2 hours of my life ill never get back but genuinely wish i could star studded bag grab lost respect for a few actors today
Feb 22 2024,positive,great great movie so dynamic and captivating with lots of intrigue
Feb 22 2024,negative,what a hot pile of absolute garbage i cant believe that many actors read that awful script and said yes to it i wanted my money back so bad
Feb 21 2024,positive,delightfully goofy and dramatic
Feb 21 2024,negative,i thought about suicide during this moviejust so that it would be over
Feb 21 2024,positive,great storyline insane plot twists excellent writing bryce dallas howard is incredible love the female kingsman
Feb 21 2024,negative,not good hard to follow
Feb 21 2024,negative,it had some entertaining parts with few solid story spins but mostly cringe lousy unrealistic scenes that made no sense not worth watching on regularly priced days
Feb 21 2024,positive,this movie has its flaws but knows it does and it makes it hilarious go into this movie knowing that its going to be silly and not serious it does have its moments tho but also know its trying to make a point if you love a laugh and lots and lots of stylized action watch no matter what the reviews say
Feb 21 2024,negative,cheap stupid and offended the audience intelligence with its many flaws    hollywood need to rethink its scripts
Feb 21 2024,positive,great movie for the family
Feb 21 2024,positive,i loved this film full of twists and turns that you dont see coming i dont usually like films like this but i would definitely recommend this film and will probably go and watch it again at some point
Feb 21 2024,positive,finally a fresh story line with a lot of twists and turns i knew if rt did not like the movie it would be good and it was
Feb 21 2024,positive,i thought it was a very good movie  full of action and some laughswith an unexpected twist  i wasnt really expecting it was a long movie but first time on a 2hr plus that i never get bored
Feb 21 2024,negative,a miscast lead and dreadfully tame action sinks what would be an otherwise entertaining movie to leave on during a party
Feb 21 2024,positive,absolutely loved this movie it reminded me of seven psychopaths and i loved every minute of this movie
Feb 21 2024,positive,it was fun lots of action ron howards daughter is cute   the movie could have shaved off 30 min easily   lots of big stars in it
Feb 21 2024,positive,really fun interesting plot and a fresh take on the genre good character development franchise with a fresh coat of paint the jokes land and it doesnt take itself too serious
Feb 21 2024,positive,it gets a little silly at times however if you enjoy the classic kingsmen vibe with good fighting sequences than its definitely worth a watch
Feb 21 2024,positive,it was a fun romp but the runtime was a bit long clever with out having to think too much this movie is a bundle of tropes in one cheeky movie whether that is good or not depends on you i suppose
Feb 21 2024,positive,it is a fun romp of a movie i enjoyed the wonderful cast the locations are beautiful and  beautifully shot
Feb 21 2024,positive,if you are expecting a spy movie along the lines of the kingsman series this is not that  its more like spy 2015 meets romancing the stone  it is enjoyable and funny in that respect  i did enjoy it quite a bit surprisingly so considering the reviews  so if you are looking for a good time with some laughs i would suspect you will have a good time seeing argyle
Feb 21 2024,negative,the worst movie ive been sucked into seeing in a long time bryce dallas howard is off of my list of actors to watch it started off as something that might be cute but it quickly became aggressively dumb
Feb 21 2024,positive,loved loved loved this movie this is one of those movies where it is completely unpredictable and has you enthralled in the plot the entire time must see
Feb 21 2024,positive,it was a fun movie  a lot of action and humor
Feb 21 2024,positive,movie seems a little slow and predictable in the beginningbut is the perfect setup and contrast once the train ride beginsand then the action and plots twists take off all the way to the endand into the credits  make sure to keep watching into the start of the credits
Feb 21 2024,positive,it starts a little bit slow and kinda confusing but when it starts to build up boy it keeps you on the edge of your seat with the spy thriller part aaand in a good mood with the laughs if you like the kingsman youre going to love this one
Feb 21 2024,positive,i very almost got up and walked out in the first few minutes thinking maybe the cinema would let me go see something else instead     but then the movie lets you in to what you are really seeing and even acknowledged so many of the things that were poorly done in the first five minutes     at that point with some relief that the rest might not be as bad i settled in and let its fun absurdity have its way a bit like with the kingsmen franchise it hooked me and it twisted and turned the whole way to the finish line including into the credits     i was left feeling very satisfied and saying wow ok i hope there are more of these movies im glad i stayed     as for the writing it was a bit childish but a child could never have imagined such layers and plot twists well done this is my first ever review i just felt so compelled to offer the movie and viewing audience some encouragement to see it
Feb 21 2024,positive,i really enjoyed the movie its not at all what i thought it was about i thought it was about a cat and i was reluctant to go but glad i did
Feb 21 2024,negative,it may have been one of the worst movies ive seen in the theatre and i wanted to like it i am a fan of the kingsmen movies and had high hopes for this prospective trilogy  it was a disjointed mess with a roster of usually fine actors i hate giving anything a single star and may have even given this two if it didnt drag over the 2 hour mark
Feb 21 2024,positive,superb entertainment extraordinary that some people dont get satire or irony the escape scene from the armoury is pure genius overlong no way look forward to the seeing the next one
Feb 20 2024,positive,i thought the moving was really fun the twists silly stuff and even the car all seemed to work for some entertainment and amusement
Feb 20 2024,neutral,it was all over the place couldnt wait for it to be over the cat was the best part
Feb 20 2024,neutral,its best for its individual scenes but its too long with too many twists but its very fun the song is great tho
Feb 20 2024,negative,2 hours of my life i am never getting back absolute garbage start to finish hard to understand story line and clearly was written by a child
Feb 20 2024,positive,i enjoyed the twists and the humour in this spy spoof  sam rockwell was smooths  funny in his roll in this movie
Feb 20 2024,positive,i thought this movie was really fun i enjoyed the entire movie aside from one main scene which was overdone imo otherwise im glad we bought tickets to see this
Feb 20 2024,positive,im disappointed that this movie was better received i found it to be endlessly entertaining and fun and visually stunning i can see how it really pushed the envelope of absurdity to the max which might have turned off some audience members but i loved it fun movie deserved better
Feb 20 2024,positive,funny with a lot of twists
Feb 20 2024,negative,i was so disappointed in this movie usually when the ratings are above 70 by people its good and this one started out really good but then went south in the second half and got really stupid
Feb 20 2024,positive,twist unexpected one scene was a little over the top but it was entertaining
Feb 20 2024,positive,yes that movie cost way too much yes its way too long and yes its super far fetch but i still had a friggin blast haha
Feb 20 2024,negative,opening scenes were good to pull you in but it went downhill from there the inverted crosses hidden throughout the movie was tasteless too we expected it to be bad and it didnt disappoint our expectations
Feb 20 2024,positive,entertaining but not much substance
Feb 20 2024,positive,amazing movie had no idea what was going on until the last half an hour  if you like movies of this kind this is absolute unit for you
Feb 20 2024,positive,it gets better and all makes sense just enjoy it as it is until that point then it gets worse but it was great    great spy movie with plenty of action and plot
Feb 20 2024,positive,action packed and funny also
Feb 20 2024,positive,if youre looking for a deep emotional movie this is not it but if youre looking to have the time of your life in the movie theatre this is definitely for you it was thoroughly entertaining and i would see it 10 times over just for the laughs it gave me
Feb 20 2024,positive,action packed  fantastic
Feb 20 2024,positive,it was exciting all the way through i loved the crazy plot twist
Feb 20 2024,negative,this movie was a devastating waste of money and time the amount they mustve spent on this movie has to be astronomical but for what a bunch of alisters desperate for a money grab dont watch this movie unless youre ready to be disappointed dont trust the trailer either if the movie kept the trailers storyline my rating would be much higher
Feb 20 2024,positive,spy comedy romantic film i loved this movie 5 stars
Feb 20 2024,positive,this movie was fantastic it had action humor twists and all in an appropriately cheesy kind of way
Feb 20 2024,positive,as a spy thriller enthusiast argylle surpassed all my expectations it wholeheartedly embraced its overthetop cheesiness making it an immensely fun experience despite the occasional cgi hiccup im looking at you alfie the laughter and excitement throughout compensated generously with thrilling action and comedic brilliance argylle kept me engaged from beginning to end its the epitome of why i adore cinemaa wild memorable ride that keeps you smiling well beyond the final credits
Feb 20 2024,positive,this is a movie that keeps you guessing in a great way i can usually predict a lot in movies but this has so many plot twists and surprises that you learn that you cant expect anything smart ideas though a little farfetched sometimes in execution  one downside though is that while it has a lot of the extreme luck and skill action sequences typical of spy movies it takes it too far in the last act  my disbelief was no longer willingly suspended  and it was just a little too silly   but that doesnt take much away from the enjoyment of the movie still a worthwhile watch
Feb 20 2024,positive,entertaining interesting ploy not what you think it is at all
Feb 20 2024,positive,although occasionally hindered by bad effects and being a bit too silly the brilliant action scenes and fun performances from pretty much every actor involved makes argylle worth the watch
Feb 20 2024,negative,i absolutely loved the kingsman so i feel kind of bad giving this movie a two star rating sure the kingsman was over the top as well but it was funny the jokes in argylle were not funny at all i found the dialog predictable and flat i love all the actors that were in the movie but i found this movie took the shine off all of them
Feb 20 2024,neutral,dallas bryce howard is the wrong choice for the lead she and sam rockwell had no chemistry some of the scenes are stupid and too long for example the oil skating scene 
Feb 20 2024,negative,absolutely the worst movie ive seen in recent memory it was absolutely painful to watch it is another drastically disappointing effort by such a star studded cast they must have been paid a near record setting amount to have signed up for such an abysmal script just when i thought it couldnt get any dumber it did it was about as nonsensical as a plot a child might like in the form of a straight to dvd cartoon especially in todays streaming world i went with my 29 year old son and we both made the same comment that we wanted to walk out not sure how the lead actress got the role but she did not give off super spy vibes at all every one of those actors will now have no problem answering the question what was your worst movie this is my very first movie review i felt i needed to warn people about this i hope the hint of a sequel at the end was some kind of joke this movie was put in the wrong type of can when it wrapped
Feb 20 2024,negative,this movie was simply terrible   silly but in a stupid way not funny   i had high hopes but they were dashed
Feb 19 2024,positive,funny movie and great spy story love this movie sooo much watch itt 
Feb 19 2024,positive,i loved this movie there are definitely cheesy moments but theyre intentionally over the top and hilariously entertaining i recommend it and cant wait to watch it again
Feb 19 2024,positive,entertaining fun movie with some goofiness
Feb 19 2024,positive,if you like seeing an action adventer and you like kingsmen then youll like this some many awesome revelations
Feb 19 2024,positive,argylle is a fun action packed spy adventure  with lots of twists and unexpected moments but felt like it relied heavily on these to keep viewers locked in as the film progressed it positioned itself as more of an action comedy which made for some cheesy sequences especially towards the endthe oil ice skating was notable for all the wrong reasons      overall an enjoyable watch with a stacked cast  but the film does feel like it runs about 20 minutes too long suitably silly and intriguing story the cat was definitely the highlight
Feb 19 2024,positive,as a fan of the kingsman i expected this movie to be a little bit outrageous and it was in a good way  the acting and action scenes were were great and the story line had a refreshing amount of plot twists  it was a little bit long but it was certainly very entertaining and definitely fun
Feb 19 2024,negative,went on way too long matt vaughn fan but this one misses by a lot
Feb 19 2024,positive,argylle is a very enjoyable spy caper that was truly suspenseful for the first half great chemistry between howard and dependably charming rockwell throughout the twists were fun and mostly surprising although it was also fun to guess what the next twist would be i was a little unsettled by ellys flip on the ship the surprise ending leaves me looking forward to the next installment i think there is more to the characters we met i hope it gets made   i saw this at the theater 21824 but there was no place to enter my ticket to give a verified review
Feb 19 2024,positive,very funny and entertaining 
Feb 19 2024,positive,argyle is a good action packed movie the story line was filled with plot twists that will definitely keep the movie watchers engaged the one let down was the profane language the harsh language hindered the flow of action negatively impacting the movie and was not necessary the actors scripted lines would have been much more easily enjoyable without the misplaced language
Feb 19 2024,negative,the movie was bad myself wife and our 2 children witnessed 2 others leave during the choregraphed dancing colored smoke kill scene i am not saying acting was bad just the movie itself no matter the actors the story line was too much
Feb 19 2024,negative,the movie plot was very hard to follow acting was phony the sound for the actors talking was so low it was hard to hear what they were saying which made harder to understand the plot  it is probably one of the worst movies i have seen in a long time
Feb 19 2024,positive,it was good  lot of plot twists
Feb 19 2024,positive,it has been a long time since i have enjoyed a movie this much it was both fun and entertaining
Feb 19 2024,negative,did not like anything about this movie walked out after less than one hour
Feb 19 2024,positive,the movie was funny and suspenseful  the actors were great  i could have done without the vulgar dance move in 2 of the scenes  i did not add to the movie at all  loved the plot twists
Feb 19 2024,negative,the previews led me to believe that this was going to be a really good action movie but it was terrible way too many extremely unrealistic scenes its more like an action comedy and i had no idea it was that
Feb 19 2024,positive,fun action filled spy spoof
Feb 19 2024,negative,so many twists that keep making the movie worse
Feb 19 2024,positive,kept the spirit of the kingsman highly entertaining
Feb 19 2024,negative,the movie was terrible it had some good parts but was overwhelmed with complete nonsensical and unbelievable garbage
Feb 19 2024,positive,really fun lots of twist lots of action and she acted it flawlessly 
Feb 19 2024,negative,worst movie ive ever seen all over the place and just horrible
Feb 19 2024,positive,yeah i get that some people think its too long and oversilly but i loved every minute i never once was bored and the whole theater was laughing out loud with me bravo just chill shake enjoy repeat 
Feb 19 2024,negative,a mess the tone is all over the place and the story is boring and predictable
Feb 19 2024,positive,it was silly and over the top and we loved every minute of it my teenage daughter would go see it again tomorrow
Feb 19 2024,positive,stupid funny action flick  i liked it and did not take it too seriously  a likable cast  suspend your disbelief
Feb 19 2024,positive,fun action packed movie
Feb 19 2024,neutral,incredibly ridiculous but entertaining nonetheless
Feb 19 2024,positive,i go to movies to be entertained and this one kept my interest and gave me many reasons to chuckle and roll my eyes with my wife good fun
Feb 19 2024,negative,not funny enough to be a comedy no plotline most of the acting was underwhelming and did not yse the strengths of the actors contemplated leaving at the 60 min mark should have
Feb 19 2024,positive,undoubtedly the greatest film of the twentyfirst century if not all of cinematic history
Feb 19 2024,positive,good acting good action good fights good story was a meh movie id recommend watching before judging
Feb 19 2024,positive,super fun movie with plenty of unexpected twists and turns to keep you entertained it did seem like the movie was running on fumes by the end and the allout shootemup scene was a bit overthetop bordering on the ridiculous regardless two thumbs up for a great cast and lots of laughoutloud moments
Feb 19 2024,negative,this movie was terrible it was painful to sit through some of the scenes and acting seemed utterly amateurish sam rockwell and ariana debose were a breath of fresh air whenever they were on the screen bryce dallas howards acting was unbearable to watch i cant even remember how many times the director did a closeup and she had an expression on her face that said what am i doing in this movie
Feb 19 2024,negative,i found it mostly boring the cat was my favorite part of the movie  waste of 2 hours and 20 minutes in my opinion
Feb 19 2024,positive,hear the lamb roar  this was a masterpiece
Feb 19 2024,positive,slow start but got better with good humor
Feb 19 2024,negative,plot felt like an unedited first draft action was unsatisfying and a good chunk of it happened off screen there wasnt enough time for any of the supporting characters to get fleshed out despite the movie feeling like it was dragging on characters make choices seemingly just to move the plot forward with little to no actual underlying motivation
Feb 19 2024,negative,disappointed with cheats and predictably
Feb 18 2024,positive,i adored this movie bryce looked absolutely incredible and it was so much fun to watch i kept saying wait what so many times because of the plot twists and the colorful fight scene was so great visually and i wanted to be a spy in real life so i could take out bad guys with my husband like that lol it was so great im definitely going to buy this one on itunes
Feb 18 2024,negative,in an era where the cinematic landscape is a fertile ground for satirical endeavors argylle emerges as a curious specimen albeit one that seems to have lost its way amidst its own ambitions    the film unfolds over an interminable span of two and a half hours a duration that regrettably seems to stretch the patience of its audience to the breaking point this sentiment was palpably evident in the sparsely populated theater where i witnessed several patrons make an early exodus well before the narrative reached its midpoint    argylle positions itself at the intersection of satire and spoof a niche that when executed carefully can yield a gem however this film stumbles failing to secure its footing in either category the screenplay languishes devoid of wit its attempts at humor fall flat leaving the audience in a state of bewildered silence the phrase master file a recurring motif within the film quickly becomes a tiresome refrain emblematic of the movies repetitive and uninspired script    one is left to ponder if the creators harbored an intention to craft a film so bereft of merit that it transcends into a realm of deliberate terribleness
Feb 18 2024,positive,i loved this movie the editing was fantastic and the plot wasnt too hard to follow unlike some other spyinspired movies  even though it was quite long i didnt find myself getting bored of it it does a great job of keeping viewers hooked  it is just ridiculous enough to be an almostsatire of classic spy movies and there are some scenes where i found myself crying with laughter  overall a really great movie especially for teens
Feb 18 2024,negative,it was leave the movie 30 minutes into it bad please save your money just dont do it
Feb 18 2024,positive,fun movie loved all the twists and turns
Feb 18 2024,negative,my brain hurts from all the plot twists only the gas dance and oil skating scenes were good
Feb 18 2024,negative,terrible boring long movie
Feb 18 2024,positive,really liked the movie great date night flick
Feb 18 2024,negative,i think the film delivered what it promised but in a much more exaggerated and confusing way but anyway i was surprised by the plot twist i believe my assessment was very realistic
Feb 18 2024,positive,pretty weird pretty funny pretty good
Feb 18 2024,positive,i really enjoyed being entertained by argylle
Feb 18 2024,negative,bad movie good cast bad movie not a kingsman story would not have wasted the  on it
Feb 18 2024,negative,plot confusing but fast paced with a bit of romance not too bad   the downside for mei didnt like seeing a cat being dropped from a height and shot at even if its not real and computer generated  also seeing people being killed in a swirl of brightly coloured smoke set to my favourite snow patrol song even though tongueincheek trivialises violence so this ones not for me
Feb 18 2024,negative,long drawn out disappointment
Feb 18 2024,positive,the fightdance and skating scenes were very unexpected funny and very well executed i agree though that the movie was a tad too long than needed
Feb 18 2024,positive,fun movie some over the top parts for sure buy still good fun satire of james bond which is probably why the over the top parts are so over the top
Feb 18 2024,positive,a beautiful cinematic experience that kept me guessing and on the edge of my seat
Feb 18 2024,positive,i was prepared for a silly movie i rather enjoyed this and felt it was a well written story i fell in love with the lead actors so some of the goofiness didnt bother me  better than expected for me
Feb 18 2024,positive,ignore the critics they got this film entirely wrong brilliant film the entire cinema was laughing yet it still managed to be emotionaly moving only criticism is that the plot line was a bit confusing but that didnt detract any value from the film itself
Feb 18 2024,negative,really boring and the plot is a mess the main character has no agency she just goes along with the ride and her motivations keep changing whenever someone tells her they should the cgi cat is just a set piece the music is pretty good
Feb 18 2024,positive,great acting very entertaining
Feb 18 2024,positive,cute and entertaining
Feb 18 2024,positive,an original storyvery refreshing  they found a way blend a spyadventure story with romance and a little comedy  very entertainung
Feb 18 2024,negative,this movie is dreadful it is tolerable for the first 30 minutes and painfully goofy after that
Feb 18 2024,positive,it was an interesting movie although a bit too long
Feb 18 2024,negative,the only reason i didnt leave the theater was because i did enjoy watching howard drive that dump truck around
Feb 18 2024,positive,i thought it was clever and funny and im so proud that imperfect body bryce was the lead lady
Feb 18 2024,positive,great movie fun to watch people that say it jumps all over the place are true but it isnt  random
Feb 18 2024,positive,i think the critics were way too hard on this movie yes it did not have a single original idea and it was very stylized almost to the point of parody but it was damn fun to watch like well buttered popcorn you have to enjoy it for what it is its a light snack not a gourmet meal it would have been better if they tried to be a scary movie to spy movie genres not like austin power but a matthew vaughan version but that didnt happen instead we got a well executed and well paced spy caper that was easy on the brain and fun for the eyes
Feb 18 2024,positive,funny and clever with an allstar cast it gets a bit silly near the end and some of the fight scenes are over the top eyerolling bad but overall the plot is fun the characters are great and we are less nicely into possible sequels
Feb 18 2024,positive,very funny and action packed
Feb 18 2024,positive,a fun actionpacked spy comedywhats not to like
Feb 18 2024,positive,great spy movie with many plot twists
Feb 18 2024,positive,a kick ass film with twists
Feb 18 2024,negative,good until it went too over the top with dance scene in the smoke bombs and continued to be too over the top
Feb 18 2024,positive,dont listen to the critics go and watch this over the top silly spy action
Feb 18 2024,positive,fun movie was disappointed to see samuel l jackson in itbecause hes a villain in kingsman perhaps that is a twist definitely go in expecting ludicrous plot lines its got great actors and its also a pleasure to see a real sized female actor where her weight had nothing to do with the plot
Feb 18 2024,negative,cannot tell if the point was to be so bad it was actually pretty funny or seriously trying to be a good movie and being bad at it there is some humor a lot of plot holes and the movie is far too long
Feb 18 2024,positive,more plot twists than a rollercoaster but nice eye candy campy humor and good actors  worth seeing
Feb 18 2024,negative,in my top ten worst movies of all time relentlessly pointlessly hopelessly endlessly stupid imagine bullet train without the wit  bryce dallas howard must have been sadly desperate for a role to have allowed herself to be made the butt of a very bad joke
Feb 18 2024,positive,i liked the action enjoyed the characters
Feb 18 2024,positive,funny over the top silliness
Feb 18 2024,positive,ive been thoroughly entertained what a cool and enjoyable movie

Feb 18 2024,positive,super fun movie with lots of interesting twists kind of silly but thats the point its not meant to be taken seriously
Feb 18 2024,positive,every plot twist you could think of they thought of
Feb 18 2024,positive,i think this was unfairly slammed i wasnt going to see this in theaters myself but since apple doesnt like to make their films accessible i went ahead and checked it out it was very entertaining you have to think of this as a comedy and just a comedy there were a few good action scenes but the movie was mostly for laughs i had a series of goodhearted chuckles throughout this film im actually impressed with what apple is doing here and i am looking forward to their future projects
Feb 18 2024,negative,a tangled story told at tortuous length argyle is a mission best left unopened
Feb 18 2024,positive,i went to see this movie and i loved it very original and uniquefantastic twists and turns  would recommend it to anyone
Feb 18 2024,positive,if you take the plot literally this is a difficult movie to bear if you take it as a writer with a bad case of writers block who escapes into a fantasy of delusions and hallucinations and nothing from getting on the train to the ending really happened then this is soso not terrible not great
Feb 18 2024,positive,cute actioncomedy with only a couple over the top silly scenes recommend for an entertaining couple of hours love bryce dallas howard and sam rockwell

Feb 17 2024,neutral,this was a fun movie kept you entertained and guessing even when its silly you get or at least your supposed to get that its taking itself lightly as a non serious film i am not a fan of this director at all but he made dislike him a bit less here bryce dallas howard was great in this and carried the movie well
Feb 17 2024,positive,enjoyed the entertainment and surprise ending
Feb 17 2024,positive,not quite as bad as everyone is saying  probably could have cut 20 minutes and wouldnt have made a difference  still an enjoyable movie
Feb 17 2024,positive,this twisty action filled spy movie is entertaining but drags on in a few scenes that could have definitely used a bit of trimming
Feb 17 2024,positive,excellentbetter than top gun
Feb 17 2024,positive,brice howard was excellent in this movie i didnt know that she had such acting skills she was great in this movie
Feb 17 2024,negative,slow not funny at all had a hard time staying awake

Feb 17 2024,neutral,too long of an ending
Feb 17 2024,positive,while not a perfect film it was still a fun ride with a lot of twists that you dont expect
Feb 17 2024,positive,what a fun romp that is silly but very entertaining not sure what the critics are on about but this was a fun time at the cinema
Feb 17 2024,positive,after watching barbie i thought a stupider movie could not be made but then i went to watch this movie thank you for surprising me like this  5 on 5    oh do not misunderstand me i meant stupid and fun this is a funny action commedy where stupidity is just an intentional upper layer unlike barbie build upon an amazingly well written narrative plot with surprises always around the corner do go and watch it
Feb 17 2024,positive,silly fun i thought i went looking for dumb fun and got what i wanted
Feb 17 2024,positive,at first i thought i would of hated this movie the beginning wasnt my favorite but i was in a mindset that was already negative after watching the whole thing i came to enjoy it it gave me a good laugh at some scenes   there was alot of twists in the story most of them i didnt see coming which i enjoy    overall i would suggest this movie to others
Feb 17 2024,neutral,making a cat a secret agent really lame
Feb 17 2024,negative,the movie was about 3040 minutes too long the 1st act was good but fell off at the 45 minute mark
Feb 17 2024,positive,its a very cute spy movie
Feb 17 2024,positive,it was cute funny and easy going i honestly want to go and see it again i loved it
Feb 17 2024,positive,not sure why this movie has been so panned i really enjoyed it  it was fun and the cast is great
Feb 17 2024,positive,the set up of the movie premise was much too long once the action started about halfway into the movie the pace picked up and it was fun to watch sam rockwell  was awesome as always bryce howard was good too
Feb 17 2024,negative,with a decidedly out of shape action lead and a dearth of fun lines to mediate a mediocre script i am disappointed i didnt just take a nap instead today
Feb 17 2024,negative,so bad i starting looking at my phone half way through awful on multiple levels bad bad bad saving yourself the money
Feb 17 2024,positive,i dont know what the other reviewers were thinking this was supposed to be a wildly fun ride and it delivered it was over the top and entertaining     in my opinion it falls in the same range as mr right extraordinary and spy another great actioncomedy     is it a dramatic masterpiece no but thats not what it was marketed as its lighthearted fun which we need with all the craziness going on in the world     totally worth the watch
Feb 17 2024,positive,this was a sillyfun popcorn movie it was a little like romancing the stone the cast was great i liked that the main characters looked like regular people not overly done hollywood stars even though they are hollywood stars  i would recommend
Feb 17 2024,positive,fun movie great to go with the love of your life
Feb 17 2024,negative,i honestly dont know how this movie is rated as high as it is that is the most generous rating ive ever seen on rotten tomatoes i have seen some bad movies but this is safely the worst movie i have ever seen what a waste of talent
Feb 17 2024,negative,this might have been the worst movie ive ever seen it was like a very long bit but the bit was bad
Feb 17 2024,positive,action packed funny plot twists upon plot twists  whats not to like
Feb 17 2024,positive,one of my most fav spy movie of all time so good
Feb 17 2024,negative,please save your money and time the beginning of the movie interesting but then it went south and never returned
Feb 17 2024,negative,brilliantly awful more twist than plot i wasnt sure if this was supposed to be taken as a straight parody the film seemed to want to be taken seriously sometimes and then there was some indistinct point where i realized it never could possibly be from that point on my friends and i laughed freely and abundantly
Feb 17 2024,positive,not an award winning movie bit we didnt expect that its just a fun time with several good surprises along the way  roll with it
Feb 17 2024,positive,in the theater right now it is so mcdonalds gave me steve buscemi vibes at the beginning but he wasnt there twist is kind of predictable but not every movie is as good as water boy i however do love the cinematography got too go my freind just sneezed on me
Feb 17 2024,negative,terrible movie 2 hours nonsense the kingsmen was a great movie each successer gets worse and worse
Feb 16 2024,positive,loved the begining and middle but ending was sooooo stupid the smokedance scene and the skates on oil was beyound stupid and iq insulting
Feb 16 2024,positive,matthew vaughn delivers an entertaining cleverly concepted movie that never fails to surprise the genius camera movement and positioning leads to an entertaining ride because of a rhythmical vivid choreography and powerful acting a concept you havent seen yet  if you can let your demand to control go you will enjoy this journey and wont regret it
Feb 16 2024,positive,this was a fun movie  better than average and entertaining with a number of plot twists that will keep you guessing
Feb 16 2024,negative,dont spend your free time on this movie
Feb 16 2024,negative,it was the stupidest movie i have seen in forever even the action scenes could not redeem it
Feb 16 2024,negative,argyle promised much but delivered little despite a promising premise the execution was lackluster with a disjointed plot that seemed to wander aimlessly the characters were underdeveloped making it challenging to invest in their journeys or understand their motivations additionally the production values felt subpar detracting from the overall experience attempts at humor fell flat and any suspense was predictably resolved leaving a forgettable impression overall argyle was a missed opportunity to deliver a compelling story making it hard to recommend
Feb 16 2024,positive,i admit the story kind of runs dry by the end although i enjoyed the over the top scenes after all it was obvious the actors didnt take the movie that serious and that didnt exactly ruin the story id like to point out that the cameos were always a welcome additon to the story to conclude the movie is kind of out of date for the current generation and is best suited for people with broader preferences in genres also much relies on people having a lax approach on the realism of the movie it is worth a watch cringing is guaranteed
Feb 16 2024,positive,it was a fun movie just a little long
Feb 16 2024,positive,this movie is hilarious plot twist after plot twist it is a must see
Feb 16 2024,positive,if you are expecting a serious spy movie it is not it is a fun entertaining movie not meant to be a serious spy thriller lots of plot twists lots of action sequences great performances by all especially sam rockwell overall thoroughly entertaining worth the trip to the theatre get a large bucket of popcorn enjoy and have some fun
Feb 16 2024,negative,i love this director so you can imagine how disappointed i was with this film  ill try to keep this spoiler free the plot was bad but with an action movie that can be overcome with good fight scenes and special fx unfortunately the same guy that gave us some of the best fight scenes with kingsmen gave us some of the worst with argyle the cgi was awful and wouldnt have been good 20 years ago the dialogue was corny and the acting wasnt great some of the fights were intentionally offbeat and meant to be funny but they were just bad none of the jokes landed and pretty much nothing they were going for worked overall a huge waste of a talented director and actors i dont understand how this turned out so bad
Feb 16 2024,positive,great family friendly film this is an action comedy which is appropriate for all ages making it a great watch with kids if you arent wanting to see one of the many cartoons that are out  love brice dallas howard love that she is not the typical size 2 leading lady
Feb 16 2024,positive,i really liked this one caught it before any spoilers and i was truly surprised with some twists i enjoyed the acting story and ridiculousness too
Feb 16 2024,positive,it is a fun movie  full of twists and turns my family and i enjoyed it
Feb 16 2024,positive,pop corn fun  with twists
Feb 16 2024,positive,entertaining when accepted for what it isa fun twisty time that relies on the viewer to recognize the movies use of overthetop action and imagery is an intentional nod to the creative license utilized in the main characters novel a lot of the action sequences are a mix of real action and the way the action plays out in the authors ellys mind suspend your disbelief and youll have a great time
Feb 16 2024,positive,i like the movie it was funny and entertaining nothing for thinking nothing seriousjust laugh
Feb 16 2024,neutral,my expectations for this movie was way too much  its a sloppy mess of a story  sadly a box office flop

Feb 16 2024,positive,you might enjoy it if you jump out of your comfort zone and take it for what it is
Feb 16 2024,negative,complete waste of time so many twists in the plot just to have twists terrible characters and plot completely forgettable

Feb 16 2024,positive,long and weird yet hilarious
Feb 16 2024,positive,the movie was was fucking brilliant  a fantastic witty spy flick with plenty of twists and turns along the way
Feb 16 2024,positive,i loved it bwcasue it made me laugh and smile and sad
Feb 16 2024,positive,not at all what i expected but thoroughly enjoyed it  action packed and fun   there was a section toward the end that was way too long and hokey for how the rest of the movie went  starstudded cast  id recommend it
Feb 16 2024,positive,it was a very confusing movie but every time you thought it was wrapping up another surprise turn  lots of ai action  i did like it which surprised me
Feb 16 2024,positive,fabulous unbelievably intricate action stunts plot swings lol times never know what comes up next
Feb 16 2024,positive,it was fun lighthearted and suspenseful at the same time  the cast was wellchosen  would love to see a sequel
Feb 16 2024,negative,my apologies in advance if i sound like a grumpy old man but i just lost three hours of my life ill never get back
Feb 16 2024,positive,movie is good fun wont win movie of the year but will entertain you throughly for 2 hours sam rockwell dominates the screen as usual
Feb 16 2024,positive,i thought it was campy cute and entertaining i smiled cringed and winced at the over the top what would you call it loving counter attack gunplay scene  all in all an action movie with a plot that somehow worked enjoyable
Feb 16 2024,positive,i liked it sam rockwell solidifies his status as a chameleon equal to gary oldman upbeat spy romp worthy of a large tub of popcorn for me it wasnt too long as some are saying lots of plot twists enjoy
Feb 16 2024,neutral,the beginning was entertaining then it just hung a hard right and just kept going off track i was relieved when it was over too weird to be enjoyable
Feb 16 2024,positive,we loved all the action the twists and turns of the plot and of course the cat alfy
Feb 16 2024,negative,only slightly better than madame web thanks to sam rockwell but otherwise i cant even remember anything meaningful about the plot it almost seems like someone asked chatgpt write me another kingsmen movie with a cat and a female lead with amnesia as the protagonists
Feb 15 2024,positive,i thought that argyle was a fun movie  it kept me interested  the plot was intricate with many twists and turns  bryce dallas howard and sam rockwell were very good in their roles
Feb 15 2024,negative,the first 15 minutes was that bad i was going to walk out of the cinema the motorbike and car scene had terrible cgi as well as the oil scene     the story is pretty good with decent twists but was let down by cringe worthy scenes
Feb 15 2024,positive,absolutely hilarious movie that keeps you captivated with all the character twists
Feb 15 2024,positive,lovely cheeky spy capergreat actors enjoying selves and chewing scenery 
Feb 15 2024,negative,really into the first 45 minutes which is basically playing out like a modern retelling of romancing the stone    you have an actual character arc with the reserved bookworm overcoming her fears and being thrust into the world of international espionage she writes about a bit cliché but totally enjoyable    also sam rockwell crushes it    but then we have a series of predictably unpredictable twists and turns that undermine the entire story up to that point     leaving me frustrated at the potential missed opportunity and pondering what the point of any of this was
Feb 15 2024,negative,jumps all over the place not liking a theme that wants you to not feel you can trust anybody or anything in your life  wants you to rob you of anything or anyone that has been an anchor of light and love what a bleak view horrible movie 
Feb 15 2024,negative,boring i fell asleep it was a good nap
Feb 15 2024,neutral,i went into the theatre thinking the movie was about the cat unfortunately the cat looked fake most of the time    the biggest cliche is when she overhears her savior saying he wants to kill her and she freaks out and leaves thinking hes a bad guy too but he means that shes driving him crazy    they tried to replicate kingsman with the colored smoke canisters obvious and unnecessary    she attached knives to the bottom of her boots and then skated on oiled concrete like it was ice this would most definitely not work and it irritated me so much the blades would have gone through her boots into her feet she should not have been able to skate on concrete the sparks would have ignited the oil in the end she used her gun anyway which is what she was trying to prevent in the first place    the best part of the movie is when you find out her dad is the head of the evil organization and her mom is a scientist who brainwashed her
Feb 15 2024,positive,cute moviesilly at times predictable but good for a smile
Feb 15 2024,positive,it was like a drunken experience  it was intended to have a lot of levity but it was just too silly and never tried to grab any instances of sincerity and realness
Feb 15 2024,positive,it was fun loved the cat although some shots were cgi quite the twist unexpected one of those movies where you look at your companion and say what some fanciful dance numbers that were silly but fun good performances unique and innovative storyline perhaps not the ride of your life but enjoyable
Feb 15 2024,positive,absolutely fabulous my granddaughter and i went to see this yesterday and were bowled over so funny and different great entertainment obvs the cat was star but the action and twist of the cast and story was terrific much recommended
Feb 15 2024,negative,a poor movie bad casting bad acting bad script not good
Feb 15 2024,positive,great fun watching this movie action comedy  good story line we plan on going again
Feb 15 2024,negative,i went into this movie with an open mind and even after reading the reviews decided to give it a chance went with 3 other people and we all agree that its one of the worst movies we have seen in a while if it wasnt for the fact that we spent 40 we would have walked out after 10 minutes the fight scenes were constant and 3 times longer than they needed to be the story in itself is extremely weak i am not a harsh critic whatsoever but the fact that i fell asleep through 45 minutes of the movie shows how awful it was so disappointed because there were some wonderful actors in it
Feb 15 2024,positive,went in with a preconceived notion of what this movie was about it was shattered just a fun movie with lots of plot twists
Feb 15 2024,positive,great movie but did not need to be 2 hours at all i feel like thats where the comedy momentum was lost some scenes were way too long and not funny enough storyline got mixed up a few times so much cgi overall cool funny movie to watch at home
Feb 15 2024,positive,kept you thinking through the whole movie mostly entertaining
Feb 15 2024,neutral,even many things in the movie do not make sense the movie is so funny
Feb 15 2024,positive,i have no idea what the critics are smoking this movie is a funny multi twist movie that has classic spy clichés its creative with its use of camera angles and music that follows through out the movie the cameos that they use are well done and enhance the experience honestly loved this movie
Feb 15 2024,positive,its twisty funny and quite the visual feast  it feels more stylised than most action movies tend to be and feels like its more suited to a bit more discerning moviegoer     it loses half a star for the rather odd special effects at the start of the movie and a run time thats perhaps a touch too long
Feb 15 2024,negative,the trailer for argylle really intrigued me it was funny and had a good soundtrack when i went to see it though i was thoroughly disappointed the cgi was awful to say the least the first hour of this was promising but falls flat on its face in the second
Feb 15 2024,positive,i thought it was cute but i did see most the plot before it played out my boyfriend thought it was a little too gooey still a fun watch
Feb 15 2024,positive,i went with my family without much knowledge or expectations and i was totally surprised its a fun movie its so clear the cast e joyed doing this movie lot of plot twist nothing is as it seems good comic timings and cool action we enjoyed the show
Feb 15 2024,positive,loved every minute of this movie  it has been awhile since there has been a laugh out loud popcorn flick that you can just sit back shut off your brain and just enjoy the ride
Feb 15 2024,positive,agent argylle is a thrilling and mindbending movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat from start to finish the concept of a fictional spy agency coming to life is both intriguing and gripping the film expertly blurs the lines between reality and fiction leaving the audience questioning what is real and what is merely a creation of the authors imagination the action sequences are intense and wellexecuted and the plot twists keep you guessing until the very end with a strong lead performance and a captivating storyline agent argylle is a mustsee for fans of espionage and mystery
Feb 15 2024,positive,original surprising twists and turns silly and fun loved it
Feb 15 2024,positive,delightful worth suspending your disbelief and enjoying the ride  creative story adeptly written twist thrilling funny action packed awesomely acted
Feb 15 2024,positive,dallas is not a great comedy actor sloppy comedy would not see again
Feb 15 2024,negative,poor start to the movie the acting was substandard and the plot was too spoofy
Feb 15 2024,negative,never have i ever even had an inkling of a desire to write a movie review until now this was the first theatre movie in my life ive ever wanted to run out of it had the bones to be so great but the plot became so convoluted and unbelievable with even worse stunts and antics i wish i could take a time machine back to when i hadnt seen a few of my favourite actors in this movie i want to remember samuel catherine and bryan as i loved them before
Feb 15 2024,positive,nice lighthearted film pretty good for valentines day surprisingly 
Feb 15 2024,negative,it just dragged on and got a bit stupid its like the writer couldnt find anything to fill the movie up with so put stupid dumb not funny things in like the dancegun show and the ice skating with knives dumb movie not a fan
Feb 15 2024,negative,absolute garbage  do not waste your time

Feb 15 2024,positive,fun imaginative lots of twists and a great cast if you dont take yourself too seriously and let yourself enjoy it youre in for a good time
Feb 15 2024,positive,great story too much violence and killing
Feb 15 2024,positive,a very good movie with entertaining action scenes  the movie was somewhat hard to follow but the acting and story line made up for that  id recommend this movie to others with a caution to look up the plot line of the internet to better understand the complexes in the plot
Feb 15 2024,negative,too long uninteresting characters who arent as funny as they think not hard to follow but too many plot twists ultimately take the fun out of it a lot should have been cut
Feb 15 2024,positive,this is an absolutely bonkers movie and so long as you dont take it too seriously you will be in for a thoroughly enjoyable ride the soundtrack is fabulous and there are several laughoutloud moments for me the film was an easy watch very daft and over the top and i absolutely loved it
Feb 14 2024,positive,lots of action unexpected twists unique story really enjoyed it enjo

Feb 14 2024,positive,it was funny and pretty original a little too long
Feb 14 2024,positive,loved the twists and turns
Feb 14 2024,positive,i was pleasantly surprised by this movie i really was not expecting much  just went to enjoy a bit of fluff but i was blindsided by how fun and original this was did it get kind of ridiculous at some point sure but i was okay with that because i didnt feel like i had to think too hard about it  i was just along for the wild ride its uplifting entertaining and fun with a really original story and i personally really enjoyed it
Feb 14 2024,positive,fun movie with the exception of the  oil skating scene cheesy
Feb 14 2024,positive,awesome movie with great action and plot twists
Feb 14 2024,positive,funny but dorky husband slept through the whole thing  valentines date lol
Feb 14 2024,positive,funny movie great actors a little bit too long
Feb 14 2024,positive,i loved the idea of the plot and how things turned outsurprising and left it open to a sequel
Feb 14 2024,negative,not great it had some good moments but the trailer didnt show how ridiculous this movie was going to be too crazy for me
Feb 14 2024,negative,totally disappointed in this film i had trouble staying awake the director seemed intent on making this a kingsman film and it isnt nearly as good it gets so absurd that it isnt even funny sam rockwell was poorly cast he lacked chemistry with howard and didnt fit the part
Feb 14 2024,positive,the movie had a lot of twists and turns plus a lot of laughs it was fun to watch
Feb 14 2024,positive,very entertaining movie with a few twists along the way while a bit predictable it still keeps you interested the action and some intriguing twists a bit over the top at times but fun and worthy of seeing 
Feb 14 2024,positive,no over thinking required just funnyand different from your average movie loved the music
Feb 14 2024,negative,oof despite a few fun action pieces the cringe and confusion of the story and the rest of the actions pieces make this very rotten people left the theater through out the film rotten i dont blame them
Feb 14 2024,positive,some really really fun moments but the excitement i felt watching the trailer was not matched by what was provided
Feb 14 2024,negative,some may like that slapstick naked gun stuff but this was just terrible shocked this was even released as an imax movie  didnt deserve the large theatre and premium format 
Feb 14 2024,positive,im going with the audience reviews on this one its fluff but it makes internal sense i  found the onionstyle peeling back of layers refreshing  it kept me engaged  the camera work was interesting without inducing vertigo the sound  music made a solid contribution without going over the top the critics ought to be penalised for piling on american footballstyle im regal unlimited so i intend to see it again to determine how well it stands up after all the spoilers are known
Feb 14 2024,positive,if you like the silliness and rapid action of the kingsman films  this was a fun ride as well great cast a refreshing take on the modern spyfi genre
Feb 14 2024,positive,absolutely loved the movie only for people with a good sense of humor brainless hacks just stay home and be lame love love love the movie
Feb 14 2024,positive,totally refreshing to have seen this i went unprepared by expecting a 007 spy type movie and left with a smile the 12 star was one of the over the top scenes lasting a little too long and not offering the engagement of the others
Feb 14 2024,positive,twists innovativegreat cast yeah watch it
Feb 14 2024,positive,me and my friends went to see this movie together for galentines day and we absolutely loved it and loved how cheesy it was on some parts we were cracking up with every moment 1010 from us 3
Feb 14 2024,neutral,while the whole romp is somewhat fun and delightful with some plot twists that keep some momentum and viewer attention the entire movie is operating on high fidelity improbability drive in the extreme  many abbreviated plot points as well as transitions were confused  to the point of the went off meds briefly  also lack of continuity makes it a hard follow for detail oriented people  all in all go to the matinee  it is cheaper  or wait for apple tv
Feb 14 2024,positive,good action and funny parts
Feb 14 2024,positive,it was over the top  hilarious with lots of twists i dont understand why people that hate over the top movies continue to watch them 
Feb 14 2024,positive,this was an excellent action movie love it all the way to the end
Feb 14 2024,positive,utterly ridiculous spy film possibly the best rom com of the year despite not being a rom com at all
Feb 14 2024,positive,it was very entertaining with lots of twists and turns  we were thoroughly entertained
Feb 14 2024,negative,not funny  not a vaughn feel
Feb 14 2024,negative,the fight scenes were ridiculous  especially the dancefight scene with howard and rockwell howard is in no kind of shape for fighting and cena is no actor except in the ring
Feb 14 2024,positive,just okay and too long
Feb 14 2024,positive,fresh and fun lots of influences recognized but grand on its own lots of potentialpart of the kingsmen franchise
Feb 13 2024,negative,i dont understand how the audience score is not rotten for this boring predictable movie    without a doubt matthew vaugns worst work
Feb 13 2024,negative,not fun bad acting
Feb 13 2024,positive,a few different times we couldnt hear the sound very good especially when people were talking with accents but it was a very good movie at times it was a little hard to follow and there were a few pretty ridiculous scenes but all in all it was worth seeing sam rockwell was very good as always
Feb 13 2024,positive,an absolute carnage of pure cheese comedy and action an array of fantastic actors doing what can only be described as pure fun
Feb 13 2024,negative,this movie kept going and going and going and lost me when we went full blown knifeshoeoil skatingdeath sequence  i wont be watching this one again but kudos for creativity
Feb 13 2024,positive,the movie was fun to watch but i did not know the entire movie was silly it was a little to long for that type of movie
Feb 13 2024,negative,the worst movie ever save your money or donate it to charity instead
Feb 13 2024,positive,ok watch action cute cat but quite confusing story especially in the second half
Feb 13 2024,positive,entertaining flick in the spirit of the original kingsman quite long but engaging throughout plenty of action some comedic moments
Feb 13 2024,positive,hysterically funny very entertaining fast paced with twists and turns
Feb 13 2024,positive,kind of uneven  the first third of the movie was just joyful and i really enjoyed the setup and having no idea where it was going  the middle third and first big reveal was honestly pretty disappointing  the last third was better but again uneven in pacing in that the first of three action finale scenes in my opinion was the most noteworthy and energetic so each scene that followed was less intense and then it was over  the big final twist in the midcredits button was kind of expected and kind of cool  expected in a sort of you know this really seems like thoughts in the third act that turned out to be correct
Feb 13 2024,positive,silly outrageous but very entertaining  the surprise revelations throughout the movie were cleverly done and not telegraphed at all  i left the theater with a smile on my face which i cant say for all the movies i have seen  deep no  fun very much yes  please dont take this movie seriously just enjoy it
Feb 13 2024,positive,matthew vaughn has been involved in a lot of great movies over the years and some not so much its always interesting to know whether a director can just get lucky if the script is good or unlucky if theres studio interference too many things go into what makes a good movie with a cast like argylle a healthy budget and his name behind it its inexcusable to be as bad as it is its a generic movie that is 60 passable fun and 40 full of blandness and plot holes    things get off in a good way the opening action sequence is okay its a bit too digital and the action itself is surface level you can overlook that since its an imagining from a book this is just the first of several things you tend to overlook because theres some intrigue to keep you focused on some fun things going on theres a train fight sequence that is more elaborate than the opening sequence albeit a bit too over the top as we get near the halfway point things you overlook become outweighed by a story that is building itself up to fall down upon weak legs those weak legs come in the form of plot holes that stand out embarrassingly amongst too many characters and no true sense of direction the plot makes sense but our lead has no ambition to lead her to that point    i waited to write a review to see how my thoughts would change i left the theater knowing it was just above average because there are a lot of fun parts but also a lot of issues sticking out like a sore thumb a few weeks after seeing it the issues have stayed with me way more than the good parts how a script with so many plot holes is greenlit with an all star cast and production like a lot of movies nowadays would make for a better story than what argylle gives us its watchable but you can watch 10000 other things that are better and dont just serve a purpose to be a time passer
Feb 13 2024,negative,the whole movie was farcical fraught with fantasy elements that went against the overall seriousspythriller grain that it was purported to be  also the previews were misleading about the entire character and tone of the film
Feb 13 2024,positive,argylle is utterly absurd  once you accept that youll have a great time at the theaters its funny witty charming  sam rockwell is easily the mvp but the twists get a bit too convoluted it could have benefited from a r rating  at the end it left a lot on the table
Feb 13 2024,negative,the plot was very indirect
Feb 13 2024,negative,started off better than expected but the ending was terrible
Feb 13 2024,negative,shouldve gotten a refund
Feb 13 2024,negative,it wasbreally disappointing the poster actors even not main charaters the trailer is not about the film the misleading and disgusting  i never pay for a vaughn movie
Feb 13 2024,positive,i didnt have high hopes for this but i enjoyed it more than i expected fun set pieces  if you dont think about the death and destruction that they involve  the plot twists did have a diminishing return though as they are piled on and on as the film goes on i dont think there are as clever as the director thinks they are some of them have a oh come on really feel to them
Feb 13 2024,positive,i completely disagree with the critics on this movie i think it was great and funny it had twists that surprised you the movie should have a much better score than what its getting credit for it kept me entertained throughout i 100 recommend going out and watching it
Feb 13 2024,positive,the movie was great lots of twists and turns but was easy to keep up with it
Feb 13 2024,negative,i agree with the critics on this one as with most argylle this stinks
Feb 13 2024,positive,quirky enough to keep me awake with some interesting twists and special effects if you liked the kingsmen movies  and you will recognize kingsmenlike action scenes  youll like this movie bryce dallas howard is always pleasant to view and to some especially if youre a dude and you go with some of your guy buddies the arguments about howard as a redhead vs platinum blonde will be interesting critics be damned this film is much better than the 32 the experts give it and 122 minutes is not long at all about the length of the first half of an nfl game and much more entertaining
Feb 13 2024,positive,it was wonderful what are these critics talking about
Feb 13 2024,negative,this movie was horrible  if you need a nap go see it it will put your right to sleep
Feb 13 2024,positive,i really liked the movie 5star until the dance smoke scene that and the ice skating scenes ruined the whole movie  very disappointing let down
Feb 13 2024,negative,the previews were so good unfortunately they were the best parts of the movie 
Feb 13 2024,positive,fantastic laughter suspense twists actionpacked dont miss it
Feb 13 2024,positive,this was incredibly fun great fresh plot twists
Feb 13 2024,positive,i really loved it there were plot twists and turns and things you never saw coming on the downside it was a bit cheesy at times
Feb 13 2024,positive,unbelievable twisty and funny and such a good movie will watch again and again
Feb 13 2024,positive,ok i had to log in to give the critics a 1 star review  they are so stupid not that this is news   i am a 50 year old man and me and my 20 year old son both loved this movie along with the whole audience   lots of laughs good plot plot twists and action   i am not at all surprised that the credits were way of again please do not let them sway you ever especially this time
Feb 13 2024,negative,210 enjoyed very few things about this the twist was relatively good but asides from that it is not worth your time to go see nearly fell asleep at one point and thought about leaving the theatre twice good cast average plot and odd film style
Feb 13 2024,positive,great acting great writing silly yet engaging tongueincheck dialogue much better than i thought it would be an actioncomedy that i really enjoyed
Feb 13 2024,positive,it was so funny and i loved sam rockwell
Feb 13 2024,positive,this is a good movie overall it doesnt try to take itself seriously instead allowing more absurd in a fun way scenes some parts of the storyline could get a little convoluted or unnecessary but a good movie in general
Feb 13 2024,positive,fun and silly action movie
Feb 13 2024,positive,this film is very funny i would highly recommend it to those who arent looking for a deep story
Feb 13 2024,positive,it was really entertaining and a lot of celebrities
Feb 13 2024,positive,funnier than i expected
Feb 13 2024,positive,excellent move  lots of fast paced action and making fun of cia and themselves with plenty of twist and turns worth the cost
Feb 12 2024,negative,i liked the storyline but the execution was sometimes ridiculous i like bryce but she was not the right actor for this part it definitely fell short of my expectations
Feb 12 2024,neutral,the first half of the movie was enjoyable the last half lost our attention with silly dancing while shoot em ups was going on 
Feb 12 2024,positive,is argylle completely ridiculous yes but is it a lot of fun also yes this semisatirical sendup of spy flicks brings together an ensemble cast to continuously and literally wink at the camera to let you know that it knows what it is and behind the bombardment of highenergy action sequences is an engaging story that continually keeps you guessing however the film features so many twists and turns that it may cause motion sickness also despite the large budget some of the visual effects are distractingly cartoonish nevertheless i wouldnt mind seeing another installment of argylle
Feb 12 2024,positive,it was entertaining  i enjoyed the twists and turns
Feb 12 2024,negative,the stupidest movie of my lifetime
Feb 12 2024,positive,i really enjoyed this movie it was different and not a copy of other films from the past the run time could have been 15 minutes less
Feb 12 2024,neutral,argylle is an entertaining movie despite its flaws i think the first 45 minutes was everything that shown in trailer i liked the twists it worked really good the pacing felt off at certain times makers should have trimmed the movie easily from 2030minutes fight sequences are good cgi is terrible     overall a decent spy triller film which had its fun moments and flaws as well howard and rockwells chemistry is good to watch it on screen
Feb 12 2024,neutral,waste of a terrific bryce dallas howard performance uneven and unable to stick with a tone this will end up frustrating the viewer more than it entertains
Feb 12 2024,positive,its fun okay  kingsman fans must watch its cheesy over the top and such a laugh  its a great action comedy romp and youre not left begging for it to be over because you will enjoy every minute   bruce dallas howard is a hottie  sam rockwell is a hottie
Feb 12 2024,positive,one of the funniest movies ive seen in a long time  action sequences were totally over the top which totally fit with the movie and added to the laughs  loved it
Feb 12 2024,negative,over long over convoluted plot line it does have the occasional laugh but nowhere near as funny as it thinks it is sort of passed the time but in reality two and half hours of my life i wont get back
Feb 12 2024,positive,the creativity and what comes next
Feb 12 2024,positive,the storyline was unique
Feb 12 2024,negative,unable to see the movie as the theater didnt have a 12pm showing plus the theater was closed because the co detector was going off  fandango customer service said they couldnt do anything because it was after the start time and the theater didnt call them
Feb 12 2024,negative,overall a silly movie with few redeeming factors  id wait for streaming if even then
Feb 12 2024,negative,if youre used to watching bad movies that make no sense this is the one for you its an absolute horrible movie that makes no sense and has terrible storywriting
Feb 12 2024,positive,if you like spy adventures but are in the mood for some laughter this is the movie for you considering the junk being peddled by hollywood these days this movie was a surprising over achiever
Feb 12 2024,positive,i guess the reason why so many professional film critics gave this movie a poor review is because the plot was just too clever for them    the ice skating scene alone is worth the price of a ticket
Feb 12 2024,negative,this is one of those movies you want to like for the entire film but unfortunately the plot is just too dumb i mean comeonoverweight writer turns out to be the spy yeah rightthe one thing i did like however was the opening scene with dua lipa on the motorcycle she can act and should be in more movies as a more central rolecharacter anyway this movie was just 30 min too long and wore out its welcome quickly c minus or 25 stars out of 5 dont waste your valuable 2 hours if you have dirty dishes in the sink to wash
Feb 12 2024,positive,twist after twist maybe too many twists but some great twists effects are hit and miss a bit too long at the end but overall tight script
Feb 12 2024,negative,this movie started out so well  it was entertaining with some interesting twists and turns and great performances from the cast  a little after you hit the halfway point in the movie it all falls apart  the movie gets incredibly stupid and ridiculous to the point where i would have walked out if i wasnt with someone else  bryce dallas howard is a convincing authorcat lady but cant pull off becoming a deadly international agent  it seems like the movie was developed by two teams  team one is talented and invested in making a good movie team two the last part of the movie hates the audience and intentionally destroyed the movie
Feb 12 2024,positive,very enjoyable movie refreshing to see not another super heroe movie loved all the plot twists made it more fun to watch alfie said so
Feb 12 2024,positive,action packed and hilarious
Feb 12 2024,negative,im done waiting to see if bdh will learn how to act movie tried to be everything but good even katherine and bryan are meh
Feb 12 2024,negative,very much disappointing  poor special effects in opening scene  main character e conway not fit for the role   long movie time and boring dialogue   action sequence in spite the innovation and artistic filming remains poor and silly  high grade actors not affecting the story scope   link to kingsmen movie in post credit unsecssful and i kinda didnt get it     you just want to go out in the middle of it  total waste of time  
Feb 12 2024,negative,horrible waste of time and money
Feb 12 2024,positive,pretty good movie a little boring in the first half but the fight scenes were really cool and make it up overall pretty solid start for 2024
Feb 12 2024,positive,its an overthetop campy spyfi movie which is exactly what i expected and wanted thank you for this meal matthew vaughn
Feb 12 2024,positive,a whole lot of fun with more than a enough twists to keep you on the edge of your seat beautifully done
Feb 12 2024,negative,i thought it was really dumb it was waste of time  money
Feb 12 2024,positive,first off this is for anyone who likes cheesy comedies if you are a looking for a mission impossible type movie this is not the one its super hilarious and yes with extra cheese i laughed the whole movie but my husband on the other hand fell asleep
Feb 12 2024,positive,a film that has enough fun in it to make up for the poor script the movie has a creative premise but when the movie takes a million twists at the end it becomes an eyeroll fest the acting is pretty good overall howard and rockwell have good chemistry nothing special about the movie but still a fun enough watch
Feb 12 2024,positive,awesome movie i was riveted and stayed glued to my seat the entire movie  i will buy this movie once its available on streaming services so we can enjoy it many times throughout the year
Feb 12 2024,positive,clever and interesting a fun movie
Feb 12 2024,positive,great movie did not expect the ending it was hilarious
Feb 12 2024,positive,loved this movie  very enjoyable and a great casti especially loved the cat  i highly recommend seeing this especially if you like to laugh
Feb 12 2024,negative,walked out of this movie after about 30 minutes  this movie amazingly takes great actors and makes them look terrible
Feb 12 2024,positive,fun movie absolutely looking forward to a sequel
Feb 12 2024,negative,bryce dallas howard is incredibly bad the action scenes are ridiculous
Feb 12 2024,positive,really fun and exciting lots of twists and turns i would def recommend
Feb 12 2024,positive,loved it the twists just kept going on and on honestly like an onion of lore caution extremely loud at the beginning car chase like wow my ears were praying
Feb 12 2024,positive,it a great movie with many twist if you love kingman you will love argylle too
Feb 11 2024,positive,fun actionwhat movies are supposed to be
Feb 11 2024,positive,worth a watch but its a little too long the ending is just silly and the plot is everywhere all that said the movie is entertaining
Feb 11 2024,positive,it was fun definitely cheesy but very entertaining lighthearted action comedy flick
Feb 11 2024,negative,terrible movie sam rockwell was funny at times but most of the movie was just awful
Feb 11 2024,negative,it was kind of a corny movie and in my personal opinion not the best of acting
Feb 11 2024,positive,i personally really enjoyed this film use of comedy was good and i enjoyed the cinematography plot twists also added to what made this film a good watch
Feb 11 2024,negative,first time ever i would like to have my money back at the end of the movie its a waste of time and truly a big disappointment on screen     apple are living up to their name lets make people pay the big bucks for something truly overrated in this case advertising with people that have 5 minute screen tome and delivering the biggest b movie since well ever made     its so bad that this is the first time im writing a review     peace out
Feb 11 2024,positive,great story great action really fun movie
Feb 11 2024,positive,had never heard of this before seeing the trailer  it was the best movie ive seen in a long time  creative story line excellent acting it was so great  i rarely see movies more than once but id definitely see this one again
Feb 11 2024,negative,terrible silly did not come together skip it
Feb 11 2024,negative,i went into the theater thinking this was going to be a goofy but fun movie but it was so cringey ridiculous that it was almost awkward to watch it starts out well the campiness is fun the last third of the movie is so over the top that its nearly unwatchable it ruined everything that i was enjoying about the story 
Feb 11 2024,negative,much more interested in trying to make you laugh and marvel at spectacle than take itself too seriouslyand it is funnythe moments the film does attempt earnestness fall flat as a consequence of such confused and inconsistent tone the action is proficient albeit superfluous at times sprinkled with noticeably awkward cgi but the films biggest offence is its unjustifiably extensive runtime absurd and not always in the way it perhaps intends to be the film can be very entertaining providing you leave your artistic intellect at the door
Feb 11 2024,positive,toooo funny  likable characters  great action scenes
Feb 11 2024,positive,although argylle is a bit too goofy for my taste im a huge sam rockwell fan and loved the character the run time is too long in my opinion 
Feb 11 2024,positive,this was a great movie it has lots of plot twists and keeps you on the edge of your seat
Feb 11 2024,positive,the cast is very good and they make the movie watchable but argylle is an overlong muddled mess of a movie there might be a decent version of this movie where they cut out thirty minutes of the movie as well as the uncanny valley cat but as it is argylle misses the mark
Feb 11 2024,positive,the best movie ive seen in a while funny

Feb 11 2024,positive,argylle has an absolutely captivating story with unexpected twists and an interesting story line that kept your attention for hours 1010 would recommend
Feb 11 2024,positive,this movie had a great amount of twist and turns that kept the story going along with some very funny scenes
Feb 11 2024,positive,we enjoyed it argyle is tongue in cheek over the top action with what actually turns out to be a fairly unique plot twisting story our group consist of five people ranging from 24 to 67 years old everyone enjoyed it and we all were puzzled as to why the ratings have been so low for the show
Feb 11 2024,negative,started off fun enough then just got stupid
Feb 11 2024,positive,almost not quite a little quirkiness and some cleverness but unsatisfying
Feb 11 2024,positive,imaginative and fun flick with an amazing cast sam rockwell is the best
Feb 11 2024,negative,sam rockwell carried the audience past the gaping plot holes
Feb 11 2024,negative,bad bad bad its a waste of talent   absurd nonfun long lasting bad taste in your mouth

Feb 11 2024,positive,i dont know why this movie is getting such a bad wrap if you liked kingsman of kingsmangolden circle then youll like this too cheesy over the top action corny jokes plot twistsits not meant to be high brow cinema its meant to be fun and it achieves that
Feb 11 2024,positive,overall it was a funny movie with action and many plot twists there were times when i was watching it that i though ok relax how much more can you do but they just kept on coming  the cast was good and funny it wasnt great but it was still funny and had a good amount of action
Feb 11 2024,positive,what a fun movie  not at all what i expected but it was great fun
Feb 11 2024,negative,i really liked all the kingsman movies so i was really hyped unfortunately the movie was a disaster for me in the first 10 minutes i was confronted with really bad clichéd sayings i know it was intended that way but it was a cringe festival for me the rest of the movie was filled with bad twists every 10 minutes they were also predictable if you saw the trailer and there were plot holes  the cool fight scenes that we know from kingsman were maybe 1 or 2 in the movie i have the feeling they wanted to save some money    but i still think the movie might be something for some other people some people really enjoyed the comedic dialogue and laughed in the movie theater my general recommendation is to wait for the movie to be on your streaming service to watch it for free without extra costs

Feb 11 2024,positive,wasnt expecting to enjoy it as much as i did  the actors were perfectly placed  action and plenty of comedy   sam rockwell is his usual cool self whilst it was a pleasure seeing bryce dallas howard being cheeky and and owning the screen  i will definitely be watching this one multiple times
Feb 11 2024,positive,it was humorous and a fun ride  i never took it too seriously
Feb 11 2024,negative,one of the worst movies ive ever seen  would have just gotten up and left but didnt have anything else to do  felt like it was 6 different movies chopped up and put together to last 2 hours  not many movies ive seen that using my imagination to wonder why who did what was just not worth the efforti just didnt care   id rather close my eyes and daydream about washing my clothes than watch this movie again
Feb 11 2024,negative,way too many twists to even want to keep up with this movie some good actors to where this should have been decent at least corny ash
Feb 11 2024,positive,i enjoyed the movie but it could have been so much better it had such promise sam rockwell is just brilliant i honestly think if he wasnt playing the part i wouldnt have enjoyed the movie he is an amazing actor
Feb 11 2024,positive,purrrrrrrrrrfect 
Feb 11 2024,negative,hated it zero stars

Feb 11 2024,negative,worst movie ive seen in years
Feb 11 2024,positive,i enjoyed it a lot of action fantasy  comedy sam rockwell is super  the cast brilliantly written which is a roller coaster ride in itself enjoy looking forward to the sequels
Feb 11 2024,negative,overly cliched utterly lacking in tension too many twists far too long the action sequences were unreal and uninvolving all the goons were faceless masked even when there was no reason for them to be wearing  masks the casual attitude of the heroes to murdering large numbers of people was deeply disturbing  no empathy no consequences no hesitation the big shootout at the end was completely sociopathic  a romance sequence with the two stars smiling at each other as they murdered dozens of people there were a couple of laughs in the movie but most of the attempts at humour failed to work and a lot of the lighter aspects of the movie involved casual murder a lot of action movies involve violence but the lighthearted approach to it in this movie made it very disturbing
Feb 11 2024,positive,it was the kind of escapist movie ive wanted to see for a while i thought it balanced the tongue in cheek action and comedy quite well and i didnt find the run time too long at all made for a good night out
Feb 11 2024,positive,a very funny twist on the spy movie universe it was great seeing something different lots of laughs and oh nos and more laughs i absolutely loved the movie i cant wait to see where the storyline takes us after watching the last scene of the movie and then the end credit if matthew vaughn is serious and not just pulling our legs it will be well worth waiting for
Feb 11 2024,positive,total fantasy but very entertaining
Feb 11 2024,negative,ridiculously awful and awfully ridiculous its an insult to your intelligence and to the spy movie genre maybe had it been funny it could have been somewhat worthwhile but its just an excruciating bombardment of non  sensical rubbish

Feb 11 2024,positive,awesome  clever funny well written  acted  loved it
Feb 11 2024,negative,cheesy worse than kingsman

Feb 11 2024,negative,wow that movie was bad poorly acted had a terrible plot line and the cinematography was horrible it was a true waste of electricity we left after one painful hour an hour i can never get back
Feb 11 2024,positive,really entertaining movie such a fun watch its fastmoving its slick its actionpacked its funny its got a starstudded cast and its got several twists and turns to keep you entertained  this movie isnt the godfather but its not trying to be its simply a fun action thriller and its not trying to be anything more  matthew vaughn is a director with a very unique style and this movie is no different it gives off the exact same vibe as the rest of his films which isnt a bad thing  another positive is the editing was fantastic especially in the action sequences  see this movie and have a fun time dont expect a masterpiece and youll have a great time i guarantee it
Feb 11 2024,positive,hilarious and entertaining with a few unexpected surprises loved it

Feb 10 2024,positive,it was the best spy movie ive ever seen with a very suspenseful and action packed story while also being very funny and having the best plot twists i have ever seen its a very underrated movie and i dont understand the low ratings 910 movie and totally would recommend watching
Feb 10 2024,neutral,it had me wondering if it was true or not  but i  dont like silly comedy  i was tired so maybe it was just the time of day after working too

Feb 10 2024,positive,my 15 year old daughter and i went to see this tonight and we both loved it two thumbs up from us
Feb 10 2024,negative,cheesy romantic comedy with sam rockwell playing a typical goofy adventure type role the lead was not believable and dua lipa most disappointing was only in the first five minutes of the movie
Feb 10 2024,positive,found the film very funny very cheesy most of the time you dont really know whats real but defiantly action packed great for older children and funny enough for parents would describe as terribly great

Feb 10 2024,positive,good character relationships
Feb 10 2024,positive,good story but got cheesy at the end
Feb 10 2024,neutral,there was fun action the plot was easy to follow most of the time the villains where too over the top and the surprise reveal at the end was weird also setting the movie in the kings man universe without any references except for the post credit scene was odd however the chemistry of the two main leads was done really well
Feb 10 2024,negative,the first half of this movie is so fun its a spy movie thats not taking itself very seriously    and then it stops taking anything seriously at all and things skate downhill very very fast
Feb 10 2024,positive,silly plot but a whole lot of fun
Feb 10 2024,negative,bryce dallas howard was awful
Feb 10 2024,negative,terrible cringe unfortunate cast non amusing nonsensical just plain waste of your time     the first half of the movie was tolerable and i even saw a glimpse of hope that it could be worthwhile but the jokes did not land the writing was absurd and all the special effects and special skills of the characters were just unbelievably badly put     they did a good job with casting actors because of whom i actually bought the ticket to drive people to the theaters but it was all just a marketing scheme and the movie is not what you would want in return for your money     i seriously hope this movie will be a flop financially so that the writers directors producers and actors will all know that this is not what a movie is supposed to be
Feb 10 2024,positive,excellent movie action pack and very funny a must see movie
Feb 10 2024,positive,this movie was fun from start to finish i thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it and i would highly recommend

Feb 10 2024,positive,loved everything loved the music loved loved loved
Feb 10 2024,negative,piece of sheet worst move i ever seen
Feb 10 2024,negative,the plot was terrible it took almost 2 12 hours to explain a plot that can be told in 30mins sad that movies like this are being produced
Feb 10 2024,negative,argyle is a mess from nearly all angles sam rockwell and bryce dallas howard might be fun to watch in their respective roles but outside of that this movie is a narrative blender the plot is constantly making new revelations twists and turns but none of them are that interesting and just lead to more confusion its not clever it just simply adds to the fatigue the action can sometimes be enjoyable but pretty quickly it gets completely over the top with terrible effects to boot since kingsman matthew vaughn has had trouble walking the line struggling to find that fun tone but still telling a compelling story with kick ass action and argyle is the most recent victim
Feb 10 2024,positive,my wife and thought this was a great flick  we thoroughly enjoyed the movie and it did not seem too long as weve learned with other movies critics often dont know what they are talking about and they take themselves way too seriously if you go expecting to have some fun you wont be disappointed if you are looking for a serious movie with a powerful message go see something else
Feb 10 2024,negative,scrip started out interesting but dissolved into cornish humor which was undeserving of the power of the actors on board  mel brooks would have been challenged on this one
Feb 10 2024,positive,this movie was so much fun and the main characters felt so fleshed out and lovable the action was incredible and everything felt so alive and colorful
Feb 10 2024,positive,not what i expected lots of twist and turns enjoyed it
Feb 10 2024,positive,its a fun goofy movie that doesnt take itself too seriously some parts are a bit silly and far fetched but at the end of the day its fiction really enjoyable and campy
Feb 10 2024,positive,had a really great time a super fun spy movie
Feb 10 2024,positive,awesome instant classic hope they do a second movie
Feb 10 2024,positive,my husband and i loved the movie  it had actionadventure romance comedy and lots of twists    we really want to go see it again  already
Feb 10 2024,positive,i really enjoyed the movie lots of twists you dont expect  i thought is was going to be like the lost city with sandra bullock but it was more my husband enjoyed it as well if you like the kingsman you will enjoy this it has the same director i believe  the end of the movie has an extra credit scene as well
Feb 10 2024,negative,will never watch another movie with china puppet jon cena  watch the video of him apologizing to china just to make money  done with him and any movie he is in
Feb 10 2024,positive,this was an entirely entertaining film with multiple twists  kept the viewer engaged with fun fantasy
Feb 10 2024,positive,i loved this it was a good campy time its like critics forgot that every movie doesnt have to be practical or realistic there were some stunning visuals in this and so many twists that had my jaw drop a really fun funny spy thriller
Feb 10 2024,positive,i liked the movie nice twist after the movie was over and the credits had started
Feb 10 2024,negative,over the top complete mess of a movie
Feb 10 2024,positive,this was a lot of fun it subverted my expectations by actually being good enjoyable entertaining funny and my familys favourite for this year already spoilers its kingsman 4

Feb 10 2024,positive,i loved this movie  it was funny and well done it did feel a little long but otherwise i had a great time
Feb 10 2024,positive,the reviews are so far fetched a fun movie for seeing with your girl or older kids good acting decent fight scenes etc a few cheesy parts but you maybe them comingso many good twists you didnt see coming
Feb 10 2024,positive,super fun great cast fun action scenes lots of twists and turns which makes it stand out from a lot of other action movies idk why some people are giving it a hard time its like they forgot how to have fun or perhaps nothing is as fun for them as complaining anyway see it for yourself before you judge it
Feb 10 2024,positive,loved this fun and silly spy parody came for the cat stayed for the laughs great cast overall a really amusing film for our friday date night oh and the musicsoundtrack is danceable and perfect
Feb 10 2024,positive,was fun and liked the cast skating scene was abit much from metal sparking
Feb 10 2024,positive,hilarious reminded me of a long kiss goodnight meets jason bourne
Feb 10 2024,positive,bad cgi but funny movie for the most part
Feb 10 2024,positive,i went with my fianc and we got the romance action and comedy from it we both liked the movie the plot twists the actors and the storyline were all awesome
Feb 10 2024,neutral,tale of two different movies the plot of the first half was significantly better than the second it was apparent that for the second half of the movie the writers just went bananas and tried to throw in as many twists and overplayed spy movie elements as possible the overly outrageous nature of the second half took me out of it 25 stars
Feb 10 2024,positive,super cheesy just the way i like them
Feb 10 2024,positive,its a good movie if you lean into the campiness very cheesy but worth the escape
Feb 10 2024,positive,my wife and i really enjoyed this one although it ran a bit longer than we thought it had a fantastic cast and was incredibly engaging throughout it had some visually stunning shots as well at the end of the day it was just a fun metaspy movie that didnt take itself too seriously  im definitely down for more
Feb 10 2024,negative,wow i could not believe so many good actors signed on to this terrible project cheesy dialog and embarrassing cgi action sequences fine actors phoneing it in for a paycheck  we should have left half way through but we wanted to see how bad it could get we were not disappointed the ice skating scene was embarrassing cringe worthy awful its something i wish i could unsee
Feb 10 2024,positive,this was much better than i thought it would be  the trailer usually tells the whole movie but the trailer only showed just the first 25 minutes  there were a lot of twists and turns and i really enjoyed it
Feb 10 2024,positive,argylle was one of the best movies ive seen in a while its so good i love the charters plot i like the acting and the action would definitely recommend to anyone its absolutely amazing i cant stress that enough
Feb 10 2024,negative,really bad like the type of bad that you dont laugh until the movie is over because you just wasted over 2 hours of your life bad  probably the funniest part of the movie is the fact that someone actually thought this was a good idea all of the actors in this movie will remember what a mistake it was to be in this movie how can you screw the movie up with actors like this how did the actors think this would be funny or cool
Feb 10 2024,positive,this movie was loads of fun and my wife and i thoroughly enjoyed it  the plot is twisted and interesting  i thought it was a little goofy for the first half hour and then the plot twists kicked in its equal part spy thriller spoof on spy thriller and comedy  weve never seen that mix before and it was great fun
Feb 10 2024,positive,i loved this movie it had a unique storyline that kept my interest the entire time
Feb 10 2024,negative,this movie was silly and stupid dont bother seeing it 32 was gracious
Feb 10 2024,positive,this movie was great its an homage and parody of spy novels and movies while being campy and self aware really a great movie to enjoy in the theaters if you dont like to laugh its okay this movie is not for you
Feb 10 2024,negative,quite possibly the worst movie ive ever seen  silly confusing mess  the dance number in the colored fog was over the top horrible  filthy language totally unnecessary and blowing his nose in his shirt was beyond disgusting and not funny at all  total waste of time and money
Feb 10 2024,positive,it was just fun and clever
Feb 10 2024,negative,good premise that ran way too long  some of the sequences were completely preposterous   i cant believe this many talented actors agreed to make such a boring unfunny movie  zero stars  save yourself almost 25 hours and your money  not even worth wasting your time once it streams
Feb 10 2024,positive,argyle was great   dont listen to rotten tomatoes opinion
Feb 10 2024,negative,nearly unwatchable ridiculous plot chubby female spy had to use a stunt double for a brisk walking scene
Feb 10 2024,positive,it was a good movie there were a lot of plot twists which made it interesting the dancing scenes were absolutely hilarious
Feb 10 2024,negative,this movie was not pretty cheesy and predictable i was bored in the first 30 minutes
Feb 10 2024,negative,i am disappointed with this movie i am a huge dua lipa fan being the only reason i came to see the movie she was advertised to be one of the main characters in the movie and ended up dying within the first 5 minutes i feel distraught and let down i was very excited to see her in a movie where she was in it for more than 5 minutes unfortunately this movie did not satisfy my expectations
Feb 10 2024,negative,the worst movie i have ever seen i feel robbed of my time and money
Feb 10 2024,positive,very entertaining  loved the movie  lots of fun  and action  sam rockwell  and bryce dallas howard excellent  and samuel jackson as alwayswonderfully entertaining
Feb 10 2024,positive,loved the action and silly dancing
Feb 10 2024,positive,best movie ive seen in a long time clean thoroughly enjoyable had me laughing
Feb 10 2024,negative,i didnt expect much but it was even worse than that
Feb 10 2024,negative,if you want to see a good movie with a great script edge of your seat action great fight scene music  and excellent cgi this is not the movie  the music for every fight scene ruined the movie for me and talk about overkill with the new beatles song im not sure what they were going for but it was a train wreck people were walking out of the theater about 30 minutes in we stuck it out hoping it would get better but it only got worse  i usually like spy movies but this just didnt do it for me if you are looking for an escape for 2 hours give this movie a try but be warned its just not that good
Feb 10 2024,negative,yet another esgfriendly commercial masquerading as an action movie pointless
Feb 10 2024,positive,a surprisingly quirky and fun movie i thoroughly enjoyed it and was surprised delightfully at the twists and turns at the end fun fun fun
Feb 10 2024,positive,campy spy movie with some interesting twists entertaining but casting missed the mark howard was a frumpy spy and too out of shape to be believable maybe that was intentional but it was a distraction and took away from the plot she is a good actress but not in this movie the other actors hit the mark
Feb 10 2024,positive,loved the spin and then the next spin and back to the 1st spin very funny it was my birthday so had a good time really enjoyed the movie
Feb 10 2024,positive,kept you guessing fun to watch
Feb 10 2024,positive,argylle is an entertaining film  combination james bond and man from uncle it has plenty of twists that keep you interested terrific cast makes for an entertaining movie
Feb 9 2024,positive,entertaining farfetched spy comedy with many implausible plot twists and overthetop action at times  worth some tongue in cheek laughs great way to spend a cool gray rainy afternoon
Feb 9 2024,positive,i dont ever rate movies but i thought this was a really fun movie i dont get the bad reviews this has received since i havent seen anything this entertaining in a long time it has elements of lost city but i thought the plot of this one was much more interesting if you want a serious spy movie look elsewhere
Feb 9 2024,positive,entertaining good story good acting fun 
Feb 9 2024,negative,boring and overly complex until the last half hour when it became laughable and ridiculous
Feb 9 2024,positive,very entertaining would recommend seeing this movie

Feb 9 2024,positive,screen x was pretty cool
Feb 9 2024,positive,better than i expected hope a sequel coming soon
Feb 9 2024,negative,the first half of this movie is intriguing but unfortunately it devolves into a mess  plot twists make little sense  and this is one of those movies wherein 25 baddies with machine guns cant hit the heroine but she gets them all while wearing ersatz ice skates on an oil slick  my recommendation is that you save your money  this was intended as a spy genre spoof but widely misses the mark
Feb 9 2024,negative,started with promise  and ended with wish i had done something else
Feb 9 2024,positive,an action packed movie some dont like all the twist and a few half developed plot lines but i enjoyed sitting back and going for the ride
Feb 9 2024,negative,big cast  boring predictable film
Feb 9 2024,positive,a little cheesy in parts but good fun
Feb 9 2024,negative,continuity apparently means nothing in this day and age of film making  good cast  especially the cat this movie reminded me of an abc made for tv movie whoever did the hair in this movie should be canned  maybe a couple agents should be let go as well 
Feb 9 2024,positive,silly over the top fun dont take it too serious but i really enjoyed it to the haters maybe you forgot how to sit down and just enjoy a movie
Feb 9 2024,positive,its was a funny silly action movies with lots of laughs and some good plot twists easy to watch and enjoy
Feb 9 2024,negative,money grab this was cheap and routine wrong choices with the actors too  just not worth the time or the money spent
Feb 9 2024,positive,i thought it was a lot of fun  kinda felt like my parents dropped me off at the theater when i was little  and i knew nothing before going in and loved the surprises and twists this movie made
Feb 9 2024,negative,horrible i just liked the beginning with dua lipa and that was it
Feb 9 2024,positive,its like a family friendly version on the kingsmen  it is silly and over the top  great visual scenes the movie will keep you rooting for the cat
Feb 9 2024,positive,an absolute thrill first time seeing a movie in 4d and it was stunning
Feb 9 2024,positive,funny fluff  great escape movie generating smiles and laughs  kingsmenlike if that helps  same director matthew vaughn
Feb 9 2024,positive,you have to go in knowing that silliness is a big element the early almost cartoony action scenes are that way for a reason the later ones are just because silliness    the twistiness was enough to surprise me its good being a simpleton
Feb 9 2024,neutral,the beginning was great loved the concept was great then it just started to go downhill with plot twist after plot twist  it just stopped being enjoyable
Feb 9 2024,positive,i very genuinely liked argyle it was funny it was thriller thats great the problem i have with this move lies in its plot the plot is rather convoluted and you need to keenly watch to remember everything otherwise great movie
Feb 9 2024,positive,while i dont think that this movie is for everyone it is a campy light hearted and well paced romp that balanced comedy action and a solid enough plot to be entertaining for its runtime   some iffy dialogue and obvious plot twists aside 7510
Feb 9 2024,positive,enjoyed the movie  crazy plot twists way over the top but we found the movie to be very fun  we left the movie with big smiles  stick around for the teaser in the closing credits
Feb 9 2024,negative,entertaining plot twists but too unrealistic whimsical and kind of boring was too long dont recommend
Feb 9 2024,negative,entertaining at times overall a big mess
Feb 9 2024,negative,truth this movie is soooooo awful i left after 50 minutes there are many more valuable things to do with ones time than waste it watching this terrible mess    after a slick and fun opening the movie dives and dives and divesway way downwhen bryce dallas howard appears she is horrible one of the worst performances i have ever seen in a big budget movie    what should be performed in a madcap hysterical zany wayis not performed at all she doesnt connect to any of her dialogue her face looks plastered on with just a roll of the eyes now and again we had better actresses in my old high school in missouri    here is nepotism right in front of our faces and its disgusting just because you are born in to a hollyood family doesnt mean you have talent     aside from this gutwrenchingly horrid performance the movie is doa the script makes zero sense so audiences are unable to become involved in even the tiniest amount    the direction and editing are abysmal the rest of the cast including sam rockwell just flounder seemingly just there to get paid    this is an awful awful mess i feel sorry for every audience member who paid to see this and hollywood should be ashamed of itself sending this crud out to steal money from hardworking people who go out to enjoy a couple hoursand instead are swindled    shame on everyone involved with this unentertaining torturous movie
Feb 9 2024,negative,argylle is the what you get when you take an interesting mystery premise haphazardly shove it into a trailer then spend two hours in the cinema explaining away every minuscule ounce of fun from this sad attempt at a story
Feb 9 2024,positive,it is a funny movie that keeps you guessing    is it a little silly    yes   is it fun   definitely    the cast makes you care about the characters   it is a must see if you want to laugh
Feb 9 2024,negative,cgi terrible storyline a bearable pass
Feb 9 2024,negative,it has some good scenes but overall i was disappointed
Feb 9 2024,positive,believe it or not we actually enjoyed the movie went with a group of friends and no one had any complaints it is an enjoyable fun movie to watch it is cheesy and i think that is the point it is not the greatest movie of all time nor do i feel that it tries to be it has its own little flair to it and is intentionally cheesy would watch again or if a sequel came out would love that too
Feb 9 2024,negative,a wasted stellar cast this movie had potential to be an enjoyable entertaining flick and it was for the first half but its overlong runtime ridiculous action scenes lasted an eternity awful cgi could physically see contours of a green screen on ellys hair not to mention the cat and absolutely cringe moments made it lose all its appeal the plot twists become less and less interesting as they keep following a cliché as if the movie had to rely on them to keep going towards the very predictable happy ending all of the action and plot looked like they came from a childrens cartoon
Feb 9 2024,positive,though it does get a bit long and a bit too cheesy especially towards the end its a fun lighthearted campy romp through the genre keeps you in decent suspense and the characters are well portrayed for the most part definitely could watch more than once
Feb 9 2024,positive,lots of action and plenty of twists and turns to keep you locked in
Feb 9 2024,positive,good distraction and great shared universe not sure why the hate it was fun funny and worth theprice of admission
Feb 9 2024,negative,easily the cringiest movie ive ever seen in the theater my instinct was to walk out at so many times this opinion was unanimous amongst the three of us that saw it when i saw the 71 audience score i signed up for rotten tomatoes to share this opinion
Feb 9 2024,positive,very entertaining cheesy towards the end but laughable and fun
Feb 9 2024,positive,u have to be a fan of sam rockwell and the director to get this movie it is not a bond movie even though it is a spy movie it is a farcical movie with great acting and directing to pull it off great unique story to boot 
Feb 9 2024,positive,expect the unexpected 
Feb 9 2024,negative,spy movie or chick flick  either way it sucked  too long
Feb 9 2024,positive,the first half was james bond and the second half jumped the shark and went full austin powers goofy it reminds me of the lost city a little i liked the goofiness though  i was l aughing the movie was very amusing and had some twists and great actors the only downside was the cat was mostly cgi but it is the only way it would work so i get it 
Feb 9 2024,positive,should have ended several times early on 
Feb 9 2024,negative,this is a difficult movie to assess and explains the gap between critics and the audience    it starts off quite well with some interesting narrative techniques but the last hour of the 150 minute film is pretty much ott selfindulgent nonsense much of which should have ended up on the cutting room floor    overall id say it deserves to flop
Feb 9 2024,positive,lighthearted enough to be fun but it has heart it has a lot of heart
Feb 9 2024,positive,its a fun energetic espionage comedy totally in line with the kingsman films i loved it
Feb 9 2024,positive,the story was interesting with a few of surprising twists and there was lots of action

Feb 9 2024,positive,the movie is a fast pace spoof  full of fun and surprises  it is well written and produced we loved it go see a really good fun action packed movie
Feb 9 2024,negative,boring poor script bad acting not worth watching for free
Feb 9 2024,neutral,solidly cast and unique in concept argylle benefits from some of its many entertaining and absurd action sequences however it is an exhausting cluttered and emotionally flat film that loses staying power by the end with characters thats just interesting when theres guns blazing or punchouts
Feb 8 2024,positive,i enjoyed the characters the unbelievable nature of the film and whirlwind this movie took you on however after a while all of the above became quite tedious with the longer run time i think this movie would have benefited from being shorter
Feb 8 2024,positive,shut your brain off and enjoy
Feb 8 2024,positive,lots of fun dont know why expert review is so low
Feb 8 2024,positive,the critics are morons  this movie is a parody from frame one  it does not make any allusions to be serious  i hate it when critics criticize it for being silly  that is the intent  the flaws are what make if funny and there is even a full conversation making fun or the ludicrous plot  i laughed nearly the entire movie it was hilarious plus they did a good job of dialing back the violence from a graphic point of view as compared to the kingsman  even the artwork and advertising the features the cat in a backpack tells you that it is gonna be silly
Feb 8 2024,positive,really an enjoyable movie was pleasantly surprised
Feb 8 2024,positive,the most unique spy film i have seen
Feb 8 2024,positive,not sure why anyone would give this a poor review it was pure entertainment laughed or rears off great cinematography and chemistry between the actors lots of funny twists too
Feb 8 2024,neutral,i was expecting a lot more from this movie it went on wayyy too long and kind of wore out its welcome other then that some very entertaining original scenes  and points for creativity
Feb 8 2024,positive,it was an interesting take on a spy movie  there were some slow periods but mostly it was enjoyable
Feb 8 2024,negative, 3710      when dua lipa was licken that mustard juice and died i heard someone somewhere in the world moan wtf was this i like individual sequences and sam rockwell but its so over stuffed and kinda cringey in execution i can see a bit of the idea behind it and i really like matthew vaughn but this was idk and usually i like that also that hallway color smoke love dance scene was fun grade c
Feb 8 2024,positive,good movie stunning alist cast it was a little janky with the different scenes but overall i enjoyed it even if it was pretty silly and romcom like at times
Feb 8 2024,positive,good at first but got silly at the end like one crazy feaver dream
Feb 8 2024,positive,not the best movie ive ever seen but i  actually liked it better than i thought i would was a very silly take on a spy movie and although it got kind of dumb here and there was entertaining
Feb 8 2024,positive,action action action with wild plot twists
Feb 8 2024,positive,i appreciated that there wasnt gratuitous blood or sex in a feelgood spy movie the acting was excellent from the whole cast the premise was fun and i genuinely didnt expect a few different plot points normally i can see them coming a mile away it was campy and didnt take itself too seriously i thoroughly enjoyed this film
Feb 8 2024,positive,overthetop good clean fun comic book spy thriller with lots of plot twists
Feb 8 2024,positive,roller coaster ride of intrigue thrills and laughter
Feb 8 2024,negative,do not waste you money this was the cheesiest movie ive seen in i cant remember when there was zero chemistry between the leading actors the script was terrible and most of the movie looked it was computer generatedi wanted my money back after i saw it
Feb 8 2024,negative,what a waste there are some cool ideas but really i was bored
Feb 8 2024,negative,good plot twists could of ended a lot earlier was very cringy and even hard to watch in the end third
Feb 8 2024,positive,funny and entertaining as well as surprising i mean the scene in the train funny and amazing absolutely fabulous leading lady just loved it
Feb 8 2024,positive,spectacular ridiculous and a whole lot of fun  while it starts out setting up the story it quickly gets busy and is quite a ride from there i would have preferred less cgi and less ridiculous the film works well enough that at the end you are left saying  more please
Feb 8 2024,negative,dear god  cut 40 of the run time down  ditch the last 50 and its 610    the scene when the gas comes out til the end made it a joke     wished it would end     loved the twist but then it got silly
Feb 8 2024,positive,it had a very unique plot didnt see any of that coming very good casting
Feb 8 2024,positive,so good i would like to see it again  hope they have a sequel
Feb 8 2024,positive,a real curates egg of a movie  some good some bad the twists were fun but the one half an hour before the end undermined the premise of the whole movie its solid entertainment though i dont understand why it was so panned by critics its better than anything that disney marvel has put out in the past couple of years
Feb 8 2024,negative,this film was beyond boring full of cliches and tiresome fight sequences hammy acting certainly didnt help the early train sequence was absurd  vaughn has talent as a film maker and he could have and should have made a much better job of this film
Feb 8 2024,positive,i absolutely loved this movie the film was wellscripted and the acting was great i havent laughed so much while watching a movie in a long time i couldnt not figure out the plot twist until right before it was revealed it was not predictable and it was such an enjoyable movie i highly recommend
Feb 8 2024,negative,just awful  insipid
Feb 8 2024,positive,could have wrapped things up 30 minutes earlier lots of cringe worthy scenes that were not incredibly entertaining definitely a reason for this being a february release
Feb 8 2024,negative,i wanted to watch a good movie in theater i hadnt gone since aug and it looked like a good possibility from the trailers and the cast but this just wasnt for me some of the twists twisted and the humor was there somewhere but the everpresent cgi and awful dialogue felt like it just wouldnt stop spoilers  i love rockwells dancing but four scenes with multicolored gas grenades and the same crouchface dance move the movie made up rules and then ignored them right after guns explosions then suddenly dont dont get me started on using knives as ice skates after slamming your foot down on it my brain hurt from keeping in the screamlaughing
Feb 8 2024,positive,i had so much fun watching this movie i could hear people laughing during the several twists in the movie i left with a smile not because it was a great movie or that it was going to win any major awards which is not but simply because i was entertained    i wonder did i see a different movie than others that are crucifying this movie i know that i am not a movie critic although i was at least 2movies per week since forever and i dont aspire to be one but i had fun and again i was entertained
Feb 8 2024,positive,action packed with many twists kept even the  snoozer awake the whole movie so its a good one
Feb 8 2024,negative,idk but is not my movie in my opinion was a terrible movie with amazing casting i wanted to get out of the movie theater so bad i was bores none of the movie made sense to me all the special effects look like cheap ai i was very disappointed
Feb 8 2024,positive,very good it had a quick pace didnt take itself too seriously and was a fun night out
Feb 8 2024,positive,good silly fun a lot of action just right for relaxed evening
Feb 8 2024,positive,very funny  great bring the girlfriend to a spy movie sam rockwell at his best and bryce dallas absolutely killed it action was enjoyable and believable 55 must see
Feb 8 2024,positive,very good movie full of plot twists a worth watching movie for sure

Feb 8 2024,positive,big dumb fun but a whole lot of fun
Feb 8 2024,positive,a lot of different twist have to pay attention but its great and humorous to
Feb 8 2024,positive,it was a cross between romancing the stone  raiders of the lost arc with a modern day twist  it kept you guessing right up to ty end  great fun
Feb 8 2024,positive,the plot was unbelievable and completely fun
Feb 8 2024,negative,has got to be one of the cringiest waste of my 2 and a half hours absolute horrendous movie where it seems like they got the script writers off wishcom
Feb 8 2024,positive,kinda expected this after my somewhat controversial thoughts golden circle but i loved this the script did have some issues with a handful of cringey oneliners but this was filled with so many twists and so many great action sequences along with bryce and sam being so great in this that i possibly couldnt not love it
Feb 8 2024,positive,amazing film that was super entertaining and exciting  the entire cast was amazing would totally watch again and hope we get a sequel
Feb 8 2024,positive,710 79100  spoilers  called out a lot of the twists to my dad lol that he was her father she was argylle she was a part of the division i should be a spy lol or at least get writing credit
Feb 8 2024,positive,i love this movie the acting was good best thing about this movie was the cat was so funny
Feb 8 2024,neutral,this was a very uneven movie  it did have a headspinning number of plot twists and a creative story   we were looking forward to a jamesbondesque movie and it certainly did match aspects thousands of automatic weapon rounds but the main characters are never hit harrowing escapes and clever technology however there was too much glorification and even romance around killing  i liked seeing catherine ohara who i knew as moira rose in schitts creek playing the heroines mom  i dont know exactly what it was but despite all the efforts and effects the movie fell flat for me  it was more stressful than fun
Feb 8 2024,positive,yes it did go on a bit long but it was a cheerful energetic and fun movie with some good laughs if they could have tightened it up by 20 minutes it would have been even better but definitely not as bad as critics say
Feb 8 2024,positive,this is a movie not getting enough credit as it was a fun story with plenty of twists and turns  great concept that i feel delivered on many levels
Feb 8 2024,positive,ignore the critics this movie is absolute fun it doesnt take itself seriously it is a breath of fresh air in a cinema landscape of reboots and superhero movies
Feb 8 2024,negative,boring and scrambled too much changing up
Feb 8 2024,negative,disappointing we were hoping for a kinsmanstyle movie but unfortunately this was ridiculous there were twists to the twists that went too far and left us glad we only paid matinee prices
Feb 8 2024,positive,argylle was a fun twisting flick sam rockwell and bryce dallas howard were excellent with great chemistry the movie became more of an silly action fantasy movie as it went along i enjoyed all of it it is refreshing when an action movie skips the graphic violence and has consistent comic relief they should make a sequel
Feb 8 2024,positive,i absolutely loved this movie  made be laugh caught me by surprise with all the twist  it was ridiculously fun and light hearted
Feb 8 2024,positive,action adventure comedy plot twist it was great
Feb 8 2024,negative,this movie is ass the plot line is boring the fighting scenes are mid the main character is insanely annoying and the comedy is not funny like at all all in all this is a waste of time i left early couldnt sit through the mediocrity
Feb 8 2024,negative,two and a half hours of imbecility  dont waste your time or money
Feb 7 2024,positive,enjoyed the characters the action very entertaining
Feb 7 2024,positive,loved it laughed really hard
Feb 7 2024,positive,loved all the characters and action it was very entertaining
Feb 7 2024,positive,we really enjoyed this despite the slating by critics great acting funny slick moves we had a fun time
Feb 7 2024,negative,this single worst movie i have ever seen in my 5 decades of life  100 minutes wasted that i will never get back  it was so bad it made me sign into rotton tomatoes for the first time ever just to leave this review
Feb 7 2024,positive,a movie crafted for pure entertainment featuring an interesting spinoff concept but it could benefit from deeper character engagement
Feb 7 2024,positive,i went to see this with a few friends last night and it was such a good movie several ridiculously silly and hilariously funny parts with a couple of twists that we didnt see coming i will definitely be watching this again highly recommend 
Feb 7 2024,negative,terrible how did this movie cost 200 million to make felt like a 30 million dollar movie bad acting not funny except for sam rockwell the only reason i even gave it a chance
Feb 7 2024,positive,it is like comedy spy film and i would say go and see it while its out at cinema
Feb 7 2024,positive,we loved it  had lots of surprises and very entertaining  the cast was amazing  dont miss it because the critics didnt like it    give it a chance
Feb 7 2024,positive,its a blast completely fun from start to finish has a ton of heart and a perfect date film its fast paced stylish unpredictable where it counts and an all round good time if youre a fan of matthew vaughns films this is cant miss cinema
Feb 7 2024,positive,kinda bad  i mean i managed to stay and see the whole movie but not impressed nor would i recommend it  sorry
Feb 7 2024,negative,honestlynot even the cast did this justice bryce just seemed blanked the entire movie i fell asleep twice nothing about this movie kept me wanting morethe bad cgi  horrible backdropsand oh the ending i was begging for it to end while cringing so hard just so i can leave the theater 
Feb 7 2024,negative,the story was excellent and i really enjoyed it however the swear words started right from the beginning  i could kind of tolerate the mild words but then there was a brief lesbian reference  i sat through that because it was not built upon  then towards the end they gave me an f bomb  i was out  i left the theater and was very disappointed  this movie is pg13  that stuff might be acceptable to the rest of the world  but if i want to hear that stuff i would not pick pg13
Feb 7 2024,negative,i was interested based on what some of the actors said about it or lack of speaking of it as they didnt want to give away anything making me think it was really unique and held some surprises but its just a spy film in realm of fantasy it was a bit slow and got weird i almost walked out about 30min in to film i stayed hoping something would happen and there was a twist but it was not an original idea and been done before overall didnt enjoy and was underwhelmed
Feb 7 2024,positive,it was fast moving never a dull moment
Feb 7 2024,positive,a bit over the top at times but otherwise an ok movie
Feb 7 2024,negative,everything from the pacing to runtime to plot twists i use that word lightly are a complete miss in this film nearly every scene is either unnecessary overlydrawn out exposition or style over substance and the style we get is style weve seen a million times before after we get past the 30 minute mark do not waste your time unless youre looking for a film to torture pows with
Feb 7 2024,positive,fun and action packed with plenty of plot twists ignore the critics
Feb 7 2024,positive,i knew this would be a good movie but it exceeded my expectations exponentially dont wait and miss seeing this on the big screen there is so much more to this movie that is unexpected kudos to whoever intentionally didnt even hint at all that unfolded i havent laughed so hard at a movie in years i plan to go see this again next week and i have never gone to see a movie at the movie theater twice in over 60 years
Feb 7 2024,positive,the only disappointment i got from this film is that i wanted to love it and simply couldnt i liked it and had fun with it my recommendation for others watch the trailer if the trailer looks fun to you as it did to me you will enjoy this movie if it looks dumb you will not like this movie it is over the top silly and dumb fun those characteristics are what i went into the theater expecting so for me it essentially delivered what i expected and i had a fun enough time watching it while i had a fun time watching this i could not keep myself from comparing to some of vaughns other films like kingsman which i love it is not near as good as kingsman but it is fun and should be a decent enough movie night 70100
Feb 7 2024,positive,the acting and characters were great the plot and cinematography of the story were very creative and funny however a couple of twists and turns with the movie left me with a strange feeling at the end i feel like the story lost a lot of its originality and traded it for overused tropes overall i would watch it again and any sequels they make but it could have been a little better
Feb 7 2024,negative,this movie is extremely stupid were supposed to believe you can shoot someone through the heart and live do not go to this movie
Feb 7 2024,positive,5 stars as its about art with impossible senarios ridiuclous story vicarious violence but just enough to go ludicrous either laugh and have fun at the jutaposition or discover conceptual semantics acting as casting was spot on which means writing with charactor development and story flow with production quality is top notch suspending disbelief all of this has to be in place for any movie to work relax lower expectations of life escape laugh especially the laugh part not because life is funny but it can go over the top just look at whats presented as news
Feb 7 2024,positive,lots of twists and turns to keep you interested  action and comedy well rounded intertainment 
Feb 7 2024,positive,such a fun and comedic yet actionpacked spy movie very reminiscent of his kingsman movies if youre looking for a fun movie with some very good plot twists and you arent looking to take yourself or the film too seriously then i would definitely recommend this film
Feb 7 2024,positive,entertaining 34 through  end was a bit corny but this movie was meant to be spoofy  good family movie
Feb 7 2024,positive,a fun movie for when you just want to be entertained  you must suspend reality so disengage your brain and go with the flow the smoke bomb scene was absolutely beautiful but ridiculous if you start thinking at all about it so dont the twists was good and fit into the plot well it ends with a nod to a sequel and we hope they get to do it
Feb 7 2024,neutral,sort of entertainingits like when hollywood meets bollywood and fails miserably on both the story was fine the action was fine the comedy was fine the acting was fine but none of anything meshed i kept hoping there will be some kind of satisfying aah good moment but there wasnt any for me not sure what the director was trying to do other then take pieces of this and that from a variety of movie genre and hope no one will notice that they sort of bled at the seams and didnt create a whole
Feb 7 2024,positive,what a great movieaction packed edge of your seat funny great story twist just a great movie all around jodis to the actors producer writers etc must see movie

Feb 7 2024,positive,a fun spythriller film but was hurt by too many plot twists
Feb 7 2024,negative,i felt obligated to apologize to my husband at the end for suggesting this movie should have known when the trailer relied on the cat to provide all the comedy basically rehashed every silly spy trope ever done but took itself too seriously to be campy fun definitely should not have been 2 hours
Feb 7 2024,positive,interesting plot  never know who to trust  shooting scene on the ship was hilarious
Feb 7 2024,positive,a lot of great talent and an interesting and unique story plot but the movie wasnt the wow i thought it would be

Feb 7 2024,negative,did i have a good time with friends yes was this movie is doin too much absolutely theres no way the sequel is happening plot twists galore im still not sure what happened if i paid for the movie i would ask for a refund ruined now and then by the beatles laughed through the entire last 30 minutes it was an action movie the end had too much going on it just kept going finale after finale i just wanted the main character to die by the end but knew that wasnt the vibe

Feb 7 2024,positive,i wasnt expecting as much comedy and was pleasantly surprised bryce dallas howard is fantastic the entire cast was incredible cant wait to see how they unfold this series
Feb 7 2024,negative,the movie was a little slow it was also sillystupidfunny overall it was a little confusing but had a few twists that were fun it wasnt a movie i need to see again but it wasnt awful  some of it was fun the end was better than the beginning
Feb 7 2024,positive,funny entertaining captivating
Feb 7 2024,positive,all star cast shows their goofy side in this wacky funny movie thats a cross between the kingsman the hitmans bodyguard and romancing the stone   original take on a spy story the movie is a bit too long and way overthetop but has amazing action and is enjoyable as well as surprisingly funny  sam rockwell excels in this madcap film all the stars overacted to perfection
Feb 7 2024,positive,so much fun to watch  many twist and turns to the storyline it kept you thinking whats gonna happen next love the cast

Feb 7 2024,positive,good time killing movie could of worked better with cgs and consider some law of physics 
Feb 7 2024,positive,this was a fun movie that had me laughing a bunch it had a ridiculous amount of twists bryan cranston is too funny
Feb 7 2024,positive,it has a complicated plot but you can enjoy a few action scenes which is good if you like plot twists and yes it has the touch of matthew vaugh

Feb 7 2024,positive,i absolutely loved argylle it had me entertained the whole entirety of the movie the jokes had me cracking up and my friend i went to watch the movie with was also enjoying watching it so it was a 1010 experience
Feb 7 2024,positive,this was one of the most entertaining movies ive watched in a theater in some time it has a bit of everything with the backdrop of international locations and quite a few twists and turns matthew vaughn took a familiar spy premise and made it his own theres a reason audiences gave this 74 and critics gave it 31 on rotten tomatoes myself and others i know only read audience reviews on rotten tomatoes because theyre more relatable and authentic these critics dont know how to have a good time they are happier reviewing borefest arthouse and wes anderson types of movies wheres the fun in that watch this in the theater its very worth it
Feb 7 2024,positive,loved it lots of twists and turns kept you engaged with the action  comedy and drama

Feb 7 2024,positive,definitely not a movie to be taken seriously but it is a lot of fun
Feb 7 2024,negative,an all star cast yet one of the worst movies i have ever seen 2 hours 19 minutes of aaaalmost done fightspy solving puzzle scenes but wait theres more and no one knows why rip my brain cells if you want a tedious not quite funny enough movie with an ineedencouragementfromamantofeelconfident female lead character you will love it
Feb 7 2024,positive,argylle is unserious but never really funny and the cgi is distracting despite that it manages to be a semipassable campy spy thriller with some excellent performances doing a lot of heavylifting
Feb 7 2024,neutral,too ambitious for its own good matthew vaughans directing is too extreme to take the film seriously plot twists and a weak script doomed this film
Feb 7 2024,positive,it is worth seeing to formulate your own opinion  it was fun stupid hysterical mind boggling entertaining spoofing spies comedy action packed and a thriller  dont over think it enjoy it worth seeing
Feb 7 2024,negative,this movie was horrible  if it had been 90 minutes i could maybe give it 3 stars but at almost 2 and a half hours it was simply unbearable  the actors seemed to do ok with what they were given but the story a mess  many scenes went way too long and seemed really out of place  i know its supposed to be spoofing spy movies but it just doesnt do a good job
Feb 7 2024,positive,although cheesy and corny at times it was a lot of fun you could see some of the twists miles away but i think its forte is in being able to be watched without taking it too seriously more comedy than spy mystery to me but the spy moments were enjoyable the biggest complaint i have is with the bad and very unnecessary cgi but thats a cancer crippling hollywood in general right now still would watch again with friends
Feb 7 2024,positive,bdh was miscast huge she was unbelievable as an assassin a fit bigger star and this movie would have been a box office hit
Feb 7 2024,positive,i heard a local reviewer say as long as you can resist the temptation to sayridiculous  its a lot of fun incredible unique action sequences
Feb 7 2024,positive,the critics is to hard for a cómic acción movie
Feb 7 2024,positive,very entertaining i enjoyed the twists and turns  a couple surprised me enjoyed the fight scene duets with both fictional argyle and aiden and pretty much all the action the entire cast was remarkable great chemistry between elly and aiden  also glad it was pg13  im not interested in excess blood or sex im very glad i didnt stay away because of the negative reviews
Feb 7 2024,positive,i think its on the director screenwriter and editor to make a story gel so that you can follow it alongin this case i feel they fell shortbutit was a fun romp if you like offthetop ridiculous actionspecial effect sequences andif you can figure out what is really happening without knowing ahead of time the spoilers and reviews then youre really good  i think it was a little too long but enjoyable because i couldnt stop laughing based on the ridiculous effects and that cat  go see it for yourself

Feb 7 2024,positive,i am not sure why this movie is getting so much hate i dont know why some reviewers are saying the plot was muddled because i had no trouble following it at all writing is bit weak and the penultimate fight scene is cheesy but the cast is great and there were some laughs  the actors looked like they were having some fun with the movie  is it an oppenheimer or barbie no   is it a fairly entertaining film to watch in a theater with some friends on a cold rainy sunday afternoon yes

Feb 7 2024,positive,funny and acton packed

Feb 7 2024,positive,my wife and i thought this movie was great action comedy some romance  it had it all except for horror sure there were some cheesy moments but it was a really fun movie if youre a fan of the lost city 2022 youre bound to enjoy this one
Feb 7 2024,positive,some good comedy but overall the movie was kind of dumb  plus a little too long
Feb 7 2024,neutral,not good not too terrible either
Feb 7 2024,positive,loved this movie fun and twisty throughout my spouse and i really enjoyed
Feb 7 2024,positive,this was just pure fun it doesnt take itself seriously and that is a good thing it gave me choreographed dance battles rainbow smoke an absurd amount of plot twists and more it was like i was dreaming and the narrative kept changing it was camp it was absurd it was fun i was giggling the entire time
Feb 7 2024,negative,a poor attempt of a comedic 007 movie
Feb 7 2024,positive,a fun over the top spy comedy this movies doesnt take itself seriously and you shouldnt either  grab a bag of popcorn sit back and relax yes there are moments you will have suspend believe but that is okay and i found it enjoyable  it wont win an oscar but it isnt trying to
Feb 7 2024,neutral,it was a bit hokeysilly
Feb 7 2024,negative,started off okay but too many twists made it feel overly long and convoluted good cast wasted on a poor script

Feb 6 2024,positive,was a pretty good movie with a bunch of twists
Feb 6 2024,positive,started off slow but gradully warmed up to clever and funny
Feb 6 2024,positive,overall a good movie with a somewhat convoluted plot line had some humorous moments but plot was a little jumpy and did not flow smoothly not bad but not an exceptional movie
Feb 6 2024,positive,i was funny and kept you interested to see what happens next
Feb 6 2024,negative,worst movie i have ever seen in my entire life  insulting to my intelligence  i may never be willing to watch the same actors in other movies because this movie still haunts the echoes of my mind
Feb 6 2024,positive,silly movie just what i expected lots of action  i will se the next one
Feb 6 2024,positive,youve got to go in with appropriate expectations its fun some turns are more predictable than others but that doesnt mean its a bad story the dialogue writing however bumped me in places on the cheesey unnaturalistic side but the movie as a whole is obviously meant to not be naturalistic so i tried not to let it bug me what i really loved was bryce dallas howard getting a series of sillypremised yet frankly really cool action sequences that didnt rely on having a tiny waistline and striking oversexed pinup poses    the film as a whole will have you questioning whether its meant to be a parody or not but i think it falls more in the category of a massive wink the love for classic bond so prevalent in much of vaughns work is definitely here too and every tongue in cheek send up is really anchored in a deep love for that genre    i dont know what the bulk of critics were looking for but i went in expecting a fun time and i got it and ill be watching it again when it comes to streaming i resonate much more with the audience score it wont change your life but it ought to give you a laugh
Feb 6 2024,positive,why are movies so long these days this was definitely a great plot that got too confident that it would hold my attention for almost 2 12 hours its a shame there was definitely 3045 minutes of confusion nonsense and quite frankly bad scenes that were totally unnecessary this could have been a really fun and entertaining way to escape winter for an hour and forty five minutes or so but instead it was not only a waste of my time but a waste of some really talented actors too
Feb 6 2024,positive,it was overall a pretty good movie some of the scenes were dull and dragging
Feb 6 2024,positive,sorry to disagree with just about every critic but i loved this silly over the top and i can honestly never have too many twists  plus matthew vaughan just cares so damned much about his movies they are works of art noone makes movies like this anymore love it more please
Feb 6 2024,positive,lot of action and many twist  a little slow at times
Feb 6 2024,positive,fun spoof on james bond writers and a lot of action
Feb 6 2024,positive,entertaining movie  many laugh out loud scenes  a little long as most movies tend to be moves along at a good pace  all the actors do a real good job
Feb 6 2024,positive,this movie will not win any awards but it was so dang funnyyou didnt know what to expect and dont go looking for any synopsis of the movie thatll tell you what the ending and  thatll be a spoiler it was really really funny and it wasnt really meant to be a comedy
Feb 6 2024,positive,it has some funny moments as a spoof of spy movies  very impressive  cast  the movie will provide you an enjoyable 2 hrs but the plot gets a little convoluted  which detracts from its funny moments
Feb 6 2024,positive,it got a little silly for a while but overall was very good
Feb 6 2024,positive,dumb but so much fun and i really enjoyed it
Feb 6 2024,positive,twisty plot and well executed somethings dragged on a little longer than they should have but all and all very satisfying
Feb 6 2024,positive,i loved the movie there was a lot of action and i loved the way the characters were used between real life and her characters in her books the story had humor romance action and kept you entertained and engaged i would highly recommend
Feb 6 2024,positive,fantastic  tongue in cheek thriller that is fun from start to finish
Feb 6 2024,positive,my wife and i saw this opening weekend and loved it  were honestly not sure what the reviewers were expecting  this is a fun movie not a bond thriller or a knives out puzzle  its princess bride for the spy instead of fantasy genre  if you go in looking to kick back and laugh and have a good time definitely go see this film
Feb 6 2024,positive,funny and full of action  loved the plot twits
Feb 6 2024,positive,very well made  unpredictable
Feb 6 2024,positive,a solid 3 theater was 70 full and the laughs were more few and far between a real solid story but not the greatest writing ending looked good but then that was not the ending and it dragged a bit worth the watch
Feb 6 2024,negative,in my opinion that are two ways for a movie to be good it either has to entertain or it has to bring a message a refletion this movie doesnt bring any message wich is forgivable while it also does not amuse or entertain in any way its just boring and empty the scene with the colorful smoke and the skating on oil are so cringe i had to close my eyes i understand that the movie does not take itself that seriously wich in many cases can be a good thing but here is terribly done and feels like a waste of time
Feb 6 2024,positive,we really enjoyed it there were a lot of twist you didnt see coming maybe couldve cut it back a little bit it was an hour and a half but overall we thought it was fun
Feb 6 2024,negative,had to walk out halfway thru acting was terrible especially howard story had to be made up during a drunken stupor disappointing that good actors were wasted on an effort like this after the opening scene this movie totally bombed
Feb 6 2024,positive,original and clever and not a typical movie  it took smarts to come up with this movie
Feb 6 2024,positive,unusual but funny and good love the main characters keep an open mind and just enjoy
Feb 6 2024,positive,silly zaney british action movie i knew what i was getting into and was pleasantly surprised i will be getting it on bluray
Feb 6 2024,positive,just watched it last night absolutely brilliant great action sequences and top notch acting from some of the best actors in the business a nonstop spy thriller that will keep you entertained watched it in the hoyts dbox and was thoroughly impressed dont know why critics bagged the movie it was an exhilarating rollercoaster ride and the best part is the easter egg that its set in the same universe as the kingsman movies 5 stars from me
Feb 6 2024,positive,i liked the movie it was a popcorn flick if you think too hard about it youre just going to rob yourself of entertainment
Feb 6 2024,positive,this was a fun movie saw this with my daughter today  we both loved it
Feb 6 2024,negative,absolutely unnecessary  poor use of cast  wanna be blockbuster  flaky cgi  not movietheater worthy which is sad because the cast is incredible i do not know how they ropped this cast into this piece of art
Feb 6 2024,positive,well written well made perfect cast
Feb 6 2024,negative,so very very bad theres good cheesy and then theres this this film is simply terrible
Feb 6 2024,neutral,a new take on the spy genre with some great and incredibly creative action if only the movie made a little bit more sense the plot is hard to keep up with and the writing is a bit allovertheplace even though the idea at its center is creative and unique
Feb 6 2024,positive,really good fun and some nice twists and turns worth a trip to the cinema
Feb 6 2024,negative,this was such a stupid movie it actually insults your intelligence what a waste of time and money
Feb 6 2024,positive,fun but a large part when they are explaining the obvious puts you to sleep
Feb 6 2024,positive,its fun and thats what the movies are for right so its a confusing story with throwbacks to romancing the stone the manchurian candidate and every spy movie ever made the lead stars seem out of place and try though they might they never seem to fit into the action they are supposed to be doing yet in the end its a cheerfully silly experience the critics seem to hate it but its worth a rainy winter matinee
Feb 6 2024,positive,a lot of fun unexpected turns  visually stimulating but it was missing something cant quite put my finger on it
Feb 6 2024,positive,loved this fun movie
Feb 6 2024,positive,it was amazing loved every second of the film it was top tier media
Feb 6 2024,positive,loved this movie just signed up so i could review it definitely has the kingsman feel for obvious reasons my husband called it the perfect compromise movie part actionspy part comedy part romance i had a great time watching it and am looking forward to watching it again
Feb 6 2024,positive,critics score of 34 hahaha this is why almost nobody respects critic scores anymore completely out of touch with the interests of the mass audience this film was fun and visually beautiful with solid pacing and the usual rockwell charm i suppose the critics were turned off by the goofiness of the plot but for the majority of folks that goofiness was endearing
Feb 6 2024,positive,fun but longer than needed film cute dialogue interesting twists in the story but too unbelievable nd way too long
Feb 6 2024,negative,argylle is an overlong slog of a movie while i did enjoy some laughs early on the movie beat the rest of the humor out of me by the time we get to the ice skating scene i was ready to burn the place down twist after unnecessary twist made the movie drag on to over 2 hours cgi was sloppy jarring and not fun my 12 year old enjoyed it more than i did but even she said it was too long and there were too many capers do not recommend
Feb 6 2024,positive,went in expecting a fun time with a fun cast and was delivered an incredibly thrilling film experience with twists and turns plenty of laughs and left with a smile on my face great film highly recommended especially if you want a great time in the theaters
Feb 6 2024,positive,this was kind of complex spy spoof  wellcrafted script with unexpected twists and turns  good characters  dont take it too seriously as an adventure flick or as a comedy  does a nice job sometimes making fun of itself
Feb 6 2024,positive,funny with lots of action
Feb 6 2024,positive,if you like over the top action movies that dont take themselves too seriously this is a movie for you
Feb 6 2024,positive,lots of fun if it doesnt make you smile then best of luck with your miserable po faced life
Feb 6 2024,negative,the things hollywood spends hundreds of millions on
Feb 6 2024,positive,it was exciting and funny loved the plot twists kept our attention and in our seats
Feb 6 2024,neutral,it was ok and it was a bit cheesy but i guess thats what the directors were looking for to me the cat was the best part of the movie i did like the fight sequences except for the gun dance scene i just thought that was a little ridiculous and i also found it unbelievable that sam rockwell and bryce dallas howard would be in a relationship because they didnt have much chemistry additionally i dont think sam rockwell was the correct choice for this role because hes just not spy material
Feb 6 2024,negative,started off ok for first half hour then got cornier  cornier almost walked out an hour before ending vince get your st together its like it was made up on the spot after the first 3040 minutes   
Feb 6 2024,positive,loved it fun action packed twisty and turny great cast
Feb 6 2024,positive,argyll was hilarious creative silly fun way to kill a few hours it sort of reminded me of kill bill 1 and 2 by tarantino maybe not for everyone but it was funny great characters actors plot great nice break from superhero nonsense films and or remakes im a tough critic but it was good you have to stick with the plot barbie was practically unwatchable
Feb 6 2024,positive,i went to see this movie in spite of all the bad reviews i really liked the story but the religious profanities really turned me off if id have known i would not have gone to see it
Feb 6 2024,negative,the beginning of the movie was very promising but everything went downhill so incredibly fast i can see what they were trying to do but the execution was terrible
Feb 6 2024,negative,i liked the pretty people the plot was dumb the feature films volume was too loud my ears hurt and so did my friends we dont talk during movies by the way  however we would have appreciated being able to have a casual and quiet conversation before the movie started but that didnt happen     the commercials and announcements prior to the coming attractions were deafening my friend and i could not have a conversation because the commercials and announcements were far too loud i dont appreciate being controlled yeswe were prevented from having a quiet conversation before the film startedthats what i call being controlled its time for me to seriously consider streaming movies at home
Feb 6 2024,positive,this thing has a lot of plot twists which gets pretty tiring along the 2h 19m runtime but otherwise its really fun with a lovable cast and original action sequences paired with fantastic songs
Feb 6 2024,negative,ive never seen a movie that started soooooo good and end sooooo bad it was like there were two different directors the first 23 of the movie was absolutely great and then the armory break out scene thats when it just 180d and plowed into the ground colored magic smoke bombs and choreographed gun dancing formal ice skating with bootknives on crude oil to slice up the bad guys a terrible cgi cat scratches the bad guy to death  what in the actual f was that and the ending scene was half hearted and very confusing this movie could have been so amazing
Feb 6 2024,negative,sam rockwell and bryce howard are fun and get the level the material is attempting matthew vaughn brings his normal kingsman style to this project and you will spend the first two acts enjoying the stylings for the most part then the third act comes with its fight scene logic and decisions and all hope is lost shutting your brain off wont be enough for the final act youll need to remove it completely
Feb 6 2024,positive,there was a lot of plot twists but the movie was fun i enjoyed watching it as it was a different type of movie and not something that has been regurgitated
Feb 6 2024,positive,absolutely loved this movie
Feb 6 2024,negative,i am not sure how a script that poorly conceived received a 200 million budget   and how did quality actors agree to be in it    the last half of the movie was unwatchable  inane twists ridiculous plot holes   a complete insult to paying customers
Feb 6 2024,positive,characters were pretty wooden to start plot twists were interesting definitely need to suspend your belief  just like any spyaction movie
Feb 6 2024,positive,argyle had me on the edge of my seat i really enjoyed the action and all the twists along the way i wasnt ever sure what was going to happen next the cat was hilarious i was laughing all throughout in all the right places
Feb 6 2024,negative,im a huge sam rockwell fan and he made it just barely tolerable for the duration
Feb 6 2024,positive,ok  not really my type of movie but it was entertaining
Feb 6 2024,positive,great cast original storylinewas not what i expected  very well done
Feb 6 2024,negative,this movie was not good ok honestly stared out pretty decent but the second and third act just completely fell apart i was disappointed how bad this film turned out to be the end credit scene was ok also but not enough for me to give it another star
Feb 6 2024,negative,the movie takes girl power and turns it up to 11 add to that ridiculous action scenes and enough twists to make twists boring and you have the makings of film that is insulting while also feeling extremely long do not see this movie
Feb 6 2024,positive,its not great but its fun i get why people dont like it but i also feel like everybody takes it too seriously
Feb 6 2024,positive,it was a rollercoaster ride of twists and turns   kept one guessing until the very endfabulous
Feb 6 2024,positive,it was amusing and cute  i was entertained the whole time  the ending fight scenes were a little unbelievable
Feb 6 2024,negative,this movie should have been fun  a talented cast that i usually love  a fun plot device but no it just didnt work the pacing was weird the movie dragged action was dull jokes didnt land it was a major disappointment save your money
Feb 6 2024,positive,it was a good ok movie it actually has a thought out story which is a lot to ask these days it just at times kind of dragged but thennthey got right up their feet its the type of movie you watch with family or friends  great cast btw
Feb 6 2024,positive,good escape reality spy comedy and twisty adventure
Feb 6 2024,positive,a very fun watch enjoyed every minute 
Feb 6 2024,positive,great fun over the top movie the point  is to think outside of the box and enjoy  lots of laughs and great choreography of fight scenes throughout see this movie have fun
Feb 6 2024,negative,i knew it was going to be bad when i heard someone to left of me snoring 35 minutes into the movie somehow it got worse
Feb 6 2024,positive,it was a lot of fun plenty of action and good plot twists
Feb 6 2024,positive,it was so bad that it was good  matthew vaughn pretty much only has one note but its a good one  this one may as well have been the kingsmen iv
Feb 6 2024,positive,a little long but enjoyable from start to finish 
Feb 6 2024,positive,critics were too harsh on this  movie  it is a fun  romp   i had a few out loud laughs and enjoyed the fighting choreographs  critic reviews are not wrong in some of their comments but dont let it keep you away  go in with an open mind and leave with a smile     i hope they make another one
Feb 6 2024,positive,a great balance of fun humor and unpredictable twists it was a refreshing break from serious cinema and was a delightful ride that left me with a big smile
Feb 6 2024,positive,they lost me with the oil bit the transporter would be disappointed in that choice but the rest was fun and the entire world needs as  much sam rockwell in their lives as possible
Feb 6 2024,positive,super fun filled with action and laughter
Feb 6 2024,positive,the naysayers here are looking for tom clancy when what theyre getting is a 5 spoof of tom clancy done in super style with a rocking sound track real humans do amazing aimonster tricks using of course ai the chase scene early in the movie had me in tears of laughter all the casting is great including cranston who is a mindcontrol pseudo dad but he also seems to truly feel fatherly toward his former best employee the violence is so bollywood in choreography that its all funny rather than offensive sam rockwell is so endearing as the spy almost as endearing as samuel l jackson a bballobsessed cia operative hiding in splendor in france
Feb 6 2024,negative,i find it to be boring   wasted my money on that movie   my girl was upset with me because she wanted to see the beekeeper instead
Feb 6 2024,positive,never a dull momentloved it
Feb 6 2024,positive,grab your popcorn bring your sense of humour and suspend your disbelief   fun funny and engaging
Feb 6 2024,negative,previews were deceiving and all the stars in it you would think it would be a good movie notttt  it seems the worse the movie the more awards it gets
Feb 6 2024,positive,great movie ignore the critics of course its not shakespeare if you enjoyed any of the kingsmen movies youll enjoy this
Feb 6 2024,positive,great movie  not deep or meaningful but funny and worth watching  at times you can tell its by the people who did the original kingsmen similarly inane in places which makes it enjoyable  weirdly most of the illogical stuff in the film is explained away semilogically and it all hangs together well and makes a fun experience 
Feb 6 2024,positive,its a fun time at the movies i havent laughed that hard in a long time the chemistry between rockwell and howard is so great definitely reminds me of romancing the stone the lost city  knight  day if you like those movies you will highly this movie
Feb 6 2024,positive,fun concept good way to spend an afternoon  it was too long however for the story it told  action scenes were endless
Feb 6 2024,positive,this movie just didnt flow the beginning was choppy with little chemistry between the cast members i wondered if it was a satire or just a camp take on spy movies better luck next time
Feb 6 2024,positive,awesome movie something different than most current blockbusters something that can bring you the easygoing joy of film watching so cool
Feb 6 2024,positive,for me it was original and funny with a lot of twists and turns yes it was an action based romantic comedy but thats what i really liked about it  the last great movie like this was romancing the stone but this one just took all things to a new level i cant wait for it to come out on streaming so i can watch it again      very very fun
Feb 5 2024,positive,had no expectations going in and found it to be a fun movie  i enjoyed the fact i had no expectation and nothing to compare it too  refreshing to not have a remake and a new story to tell  a great saturday night and even our 14 year old loved it and he is a very judgy teenager     i dont understand why the critics dont like it
Feb 5 2024,positive,i loved everything about it
Feb 5 2024,positive,i really enjoyed it it was very funny and kept me on the edge of my seat interesting plot twists and good acting
Feb 5 2024,positive,loved this movie  great cast  none stop fun from the start to the finish  matthew vaughan does it again 
Feb 5 2024,negative,outlandish plot even by spy comedy standards action was out of a pg movie a bummer of a swing and a miss for matthew vaughn
Feb 5 2024,positive,lively story with lots of twistsbe sure to stay through the credits  dont know why critics were so harsh about this movie  lots of big names made for fun viewing
Feb 5 2024,positive,surprising unpredictable plot and lots of fun completely original
Feb 5 2024,positive,fun funny and engaging the cast is stellar and gives great performances exactly the right amount of absurdity and its a great time at the movies
Feb 5 2024,negative,everyone involved with this movie should be embarrassed i have no idea why these bug name actors agreed to be in this a couple of the ending scenes are so cringe i was squirming around uncontrollably just why why
Feb 5 2024,positive,fantastic action  with twists and turns at the end  scenery is also beautiful and actors were superb
Feb 5 2024,positive,movie was fun lots action comedy and intense moments and plot twists    it was gizztastic
Feb 5 2024,positive,love the quirky mind of matthew vaughn this did not disappoint
Feb 5 2024,positive,while the middle of the movie really drags the beginning and especially the ending save it particularly the smoke fight and the oil skating hilarious
Feb 5 2024,negative,you will face once unshakable question as you depart the theater how in gods name did this movie ever get made  i know it is only february but i will venture out on this limb this will make every critics top 10 worst movies of 2024 list  the plot is so convoluted and inane at some point you simply are exhausted from all the twists  and the talent in this movie is criminally wasted john cena dua lipa sofia boutella and ariana debose must have shot their parts over lunch on a wednesday  i dont know if i have seen a movie where so much talent is given nothing to do  and clocking in at 2 hours and 19 minutes argylle is at least 30 minutes too long  you will be begging for the credits by the end of the movie  movie detritus is typically unloaded in january  that is the case with argylle you will end up dumber and frustrated after watching this claptrap
Feb 5 2024,positive,argylle is a fun watch with friends highly recommend watching it good action scenes while still being playful and silly
Feb 5 2024,positive,just good fun clever cinematography wit and sam rockwells suave leave your brain at the door and youll enjoy it
Feb 5 2024,positive,great amount of plot twist 
Feb 5 2024,positive,it was comedy and drama in one was somewhat unexpected
Feb 5 2024,positive,the ending fight scene where agent r kyle was ice skating on oil and taking down 2530 bad guys was very cheesy as it turned into a dance scene  otherwise i think the movie and plot are entertaining
Feb 5 2024,negative,argyle was a could have been a better movie if the writers had more focus in the story for me it wasnt very funny and the plots and twists piled on one after the other  were poorly done and unnecessary    keep it simple if you cant do a better job hollywood
Feb 5 2024,positive,loved it twists  turns great music funny a light hearted super fiction spy whos hair never messes up ha ha ha  it is bigger that life because its fun  surprising 
Feb 5 2024,positive,i liked this action comedy spy movie not the best but was really amusing
Feb 5 2024,negative,so the first 12 was fine and the storyline was interesting and then just got stupid and the cgi really lame comparing to the kingsman series is kind of an insult i would save your money and wait for it to hit apple tv in a week or so the smoke gernade scene was so bad
Feb 5 2024,positive,this was a fun movie i am not sure why the critics dislike it so much it was a bit campy but definitely entertaining
Feb 5 2024,positive,lots of plot twists  keeps you guessing throughout   good tome
Feb 5 2024,negative,ya think its gonna be a decent movie  good cast good budget etc the story kinda reels you in only to be ruined by some god awful cheesy stuff  you will know exactly what im talking about when the scene arrives it really is a cheap way of insulting the intelligence of the audience sam rockwell is an incredible actor moon  who doesnt love superman but this flick falls short of amounting to anything of substance  it serves only as superficial entertainment 15 stars  ats
Feb 5 2024,positive,a fun take on the spy genre with a twist love any movie that turns a gun fight into a dream dance sequence funny quirky and hugely entertaining loved the move and critics are so wrong on this awesome
Feb 5 2024,negative,its definitely an apple product  cost a fortune but lacks soul
Feb 5 2024,positive,loved this movie i know people are giving it poor ratings there are so many plot twists it wasnt the movie probably thought is was going to be from the movie trailer did they want spoilers instead
Feb 5 2024,positive,very enjoyable visually interesting some good plot twists slightly confusing at one point good performances from a good cast liked the music as well dua lipa is in the movie but does not sing
Feb 5 2024,negative,story line was bad no direction effects were horrendous the trailer fools you into watching this film
Feb 5 2024,positive,perfect storey and wonderful movie adaptation  excellent i would not change a thing and how wonderful to see a normal sized actress portraying the lead as the real argyle    i loved every minute relax and just go along fur the ride    if you live zoolander then i think youll love argyle too  those that didnt get zoolander probably wont get this one either    this ranks up there with bullet train for an entertaining movie experience    well done directors writers producer and all the cast  purrfect 
Feb 5 2024,positive,argylle is very entertaining and has humor similar to the kingsman series  the movie is a fun night out to the movies and it is humorous sometimes silly the main actors do an excellent job and their interactions with each other gel well  a romantic comedy and reminiscent of previous movies with similar setup
Feb 5 2024,positive,dont know much about this movie and i loved it  great chemistry with characters  actors fun storyline and action from the start  highly recommend
Feb 5 2024,positive,dont let anyone make you think this is a bad movie its hilarious and very entertaining the bad reviews are just proof of how difficult some people are to please they just love hating everything its an awesome moviegive it a shot
Feb 5 2024,positive,i really enjoyed all the different twists and turns in this movie i also enjoyed the silly somewhat campy action and romance others have complained that it was too silly or campy but i enjoyed it and found the humor in it i would recommend this for anyone looking for a fun time at the movies
Feb 5 2024,neutral,it was fun and entertaining but had the potential to be so much more
Feb 5 2024,positive,it was a good movie that i enjoyed every moment
Feb 5 2024,positive,it had a great soundtrack was corny but funny not a lot of blood  guts  really had a lot of twists and turns and had me guessing all the time
Feb 5 2024,positive,i really liked the first 10 minutes of the film it was my fav part of the whole film just because dua lipas character is in it and thats something i find dumb everything the trailer shows is all dua lipas characters role is and the last half of the film is complete garbage the part with the smoke and theyre dancing to fucking long and the skating on oil so fucking stupid if they cut the last parts id say it was a good film but it isnt its a decent film to past the time would not recommend only good parts are the scenes dua lipas character is in and the first 2 halves of the film as soon as the smoke comes out it goes downhill also the part when the smoke comes out red reminds me of rouge one when vader enters also agent r kyle is kind of like the winter solider both are controlled by a certain phrase so all in all its a decent film
Feb 5 2024,positive,a little mad but really fun i found the action scenes and romantic elements very engaging sam rockwell is why i loved it so much and why i would watch it again
Feb 5 2024,neutral,it had a very smart and unique premise but then became too silly and confusing the acting was cheesy too but that might have been part of the plan this film sold itself as one thing but turned out to be something else entirely
Feb 5 2024,positive,this movie doesnt do anything innovative but thats not needed for a film like this i think with the story was great other than some problems with the final act but those are minor the cast 100 is great and their chemistry shows but its a movie i wont remember after a while but its a movie when you watch it its enjoyable to pass the time
Feb 5 2024,neutral,the computergenerated action segments ruined it for me am i watching an action movie or a cartoon
Feb 5 2024,positive,i really enjoyed the movie still it reached the ending but at the end squeezes movie act felt like childsh    but i had pretty much fun and 4dx experience was pretty fun and rollercoaster
Feb 5 2024,positive,the critics are wrong as usual  it is so well written  lots of surprises and twist and turns  my only suggestion is to keep the movie to 2 hours and make the chase and fight scenes shorter
Feb 5 2024,negative,somewhat entertaining but rather stupid at times
Feb 5 2024,positive,we thought it was hilarious yes a little silly at times but not that far off from james bond movies we liked it despite the poor review by the times so there
Feb 5 2024,positive,wife and me went to see argyle on saturday it was a fun ride  the movie did not take itself too serious but it was a funny action flick   we both enjoyed it and it was great for date night   things blow up bullets fly no blood no gore no horror a mild romantic comedy what else do you want   without giving it away i would recommend it to a friend   i rather liked the twists and turns it took
Feb 5 2024,positive,people are way too critical hereits a fun movie youll laugh a lot its a little silly and yes missing some of the panache which made the kingsman so special butits still pretty damn fun to watch and everyone in the theater was laughing their ass off
Feb 5 2024,positive,funny and a spoof on spy movies
Feb 5 2024,neutral,a rare complete miss from vaughn the action was so over stylized there were absolutely no stakes at all
Feb 5 2024,positive,the movie was very entertaining and fun to watch  critics are much too harsh on these types of movies  i laughed i was interested the entire time and it kept me guessing  worth seeing for some lighthearted fun
Feb 5 2024,negative,boring not funny at all long we left during the movie
Feb 5 2024,positive,i wasnt sure what to expect when the movie was getting crushed by reviewers but i went anyway  why  well because critics can get things wrong and a 25hour escape from the daytoday life can be nice even if it is a bit outside reality  in fact the beekeeper got pretty respectable rt reviews and i am a jason statham fan but that movie was terrible completely unenjoyable and had a dumber premise  suffice it to say argylle is not the godfather it will not win any awards but it was fun so go see it
Feb 5 2024,positive,remember that these critics bombing this movie are the same critics that enjoyed the marvels this movie is lighthearted fun and deserves youre time critics just hate fun tbh
Feb 5 2024,positive,enjoyed the campy funfilled entertaining cast  it took me on a ride with many twists and turns and left me feeling satisfied  sam rockwell bryce howard maureen ohara bryan cranston and samuel jackson in one film  seriously what could be more entertaining 
Feb 5 2024,positive,if youre in the uk its about 5 to see this at most cinemas definitely if youre sick of the same old super hero film then support films like this its original creative and just fun the plot might be pretty all over the place and not sure of itself but you can definitely see how issues like mental health are touched on in a fun and cool way i do wish they kind of committed to one of the two plots which kind of ran alongside each other but it worked in its own way the fight scenes in themselves are worth going to see the film for theyre absolutely nuts
Feb 5 2024,positive,terrible so terrible it was funny at times but apart from those times it was just terrible
Feb 5 2024,positive,loved the movie fun hilarious and great action caville couldnt be funnier and sam rockwell steals the movie hope for sequels
Feb 5 2024,neutral,so this movie isnt the disaster the pros claim  it is actually enjoyable moves at a decent pace and sam rockwell is great  my main complaint is the casting bryce dallas howard as the lead  she is a good actress but poorly suited for the role  seems like hollywood nepotism at its worst
Feb 5 2024,positive,its a really nutty movie bit worth the time
Feb 5 2024,positive,i thought it was fun it may have been a bit predictable at times but i dont think it was overly long character development was great and i loved all the stars they used in it the only thing i didnt like was seeing amtrak in it haha
Feb 5 2024,positive,argylle great fun and creative but not an impressive example of filmmaking     imagine an overthetop james bond parody mashed up with all of the bourne films in one then give it a climax like a campy bangsnap comic version of the fight scenes in kill bill yes corny and very silly      argylle may not be original but it is creative anyway the humor is nonstop albeit subtle in many places yet slapstick in others you cant enjoy this film unless you abandon the critic in you the acting and directing is okay but the effects and action are cartoonish deliberately i suppose it would be best to watch it on tv because the big screen amplifies its weaknesses    if you can get submerged in laughter at the most ridiculous things if the snickers of others are a contagion to you if you enjoy everything from deadpan to dad jokes then this film might give you sidecramps    i can see why audiences love it i can also see what critics hate it but if you arent a purist if you like mystery science theater 2000 if you enjoyed grindhouse then this might be a film youd love
Feb 5 2024,positive,sam rockwall stood out  bryce dallas howard did not  she did the best she could with a flimsy plot but making her central in this movie was a premature move she doesnt have the charisma to pull it off
Feb 5 2024,positive,it was a fun film not the worlds best but definitely entertaining lots of plot twists just fun way to pass an afternoon id watch it again
Feb 5 2024,positive,it was fun escape for an evening  the movie was entertaining it had action it made me laugh and lots of twists in the plot  i would pay to see it again
Feb 5 2024,positive,i went in not really excited but wanting to watch for the starstudded cast about halfway through the movie though there was a collective gasp from everyone in the theater and i was hooked it is a bit silly and fun but this movie will definitely keep you on the edge of your seat
Feb 5 2024,positive,action packed spy thriller that wasnt really dark cute romcom secondary story line that was a little cheesy near the end but overall we really enjoyed it for light entertainment good cast too the teaser at the end about another movie has us intrigued and wed probably go
Feb 5 2024,negative,this movie needs to pick a lane is it a romcom spy thriller fantasy there were a few fleeting moments that were clever but there were way more inconsistencies the run time is obnoxious the cat was cute
Feb 5 2024,neutral,this movie had some entertaining moments   i loved the character argylle until the movie took a twist with some confusing innuendos   i wasnt sure if i should laugh or be disturbed
Feb 5 2024,negative,sure argylle is silly enough but it rarely made me laugh and was too hard to follow and for a movie thats supposed to be a fun twist on the standard spy thriller i was surprised by how long it was and by how convoluted and drawn out the plot was thats not to say that i couldnt piece it together eventually and that i wasnt still engaged the whole time i just feel like a few less plot elements couldve really helped it which is made especially clear with the skating scene the smoke scene and the music box scene which were all unnecessary
Feb 5 2024,neutral,the movie started out good then it lost it footing casting didnt due this movie any justice didnt like bryce dallas howard as elly they needed a melissa mccarthy type to play elly why would you have bryan cranston play a bad guy movie was just to long
Feb 5 2024,negative,the trailer was better than the movie itself it was 30 minutes too long i was very enthused  to see the movie i was very disappointed with the results
Feb 5 2024,positive,love this film it was refreshing a lot of twists was sad that it was over could watch a few more hours with this one
Feb 5 2024,positive,matthew vaughn is a favorite of mine particularly the kingsman series i had high expectations for argylle and while i will say my expectations were not met it was still a good movie vaughn adds more silly to this effort than usual while im not generally a poopooer of silly the brand used for this film seemed out of place sam rockwell excels as a fun funny and skilled man of mystery who embarks on a sort of rescue mission to save a popular author played by bryce dallas howard from a nefarious group of spies that mimics a criminal organization she has written about the plot is as farfetched as much of this movies ilk so one must suspend their perception of reality to get the most out of argylle this is not unusual for funny spy movies but i found myself grinding my teeth considering how unlikely some steps in the journey were but at the end of the day i walked out grinning im not intending to enter the theaters to see argylle again but i do not regret seeing it there at all
Feb 5 2024,positive,fun movie to take my girls and their sos to mindless entertainment  did have several unexpected turns very silly my only real complaint is how long it was and the too long killing scenes however the oilskating scene was hilarious
Feb 5 2024,positive,it kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time lots of twists and turns and surprises mixed in with lots of humor i would go see it again i highly recommend it
Feb 5 2024,positive,the movie was too silly especially the scene inside the oil tanker
Feb 5 2024,positive,i enjoyed argylle from beginning to end and im sorry so many critics have had their sense of humor surgically removed the plot was ridiculous which is what made the movie funny and just plain fun it isnt great art but its great entertainment
Feb 5 2024,positive,the critics are either not particularly genre savvy or the enemies of fun its a comedy it starts and ends as a comedy the plot is not that convoluted by james bond standards the run time is about 20 minutes long but the action was fine for a comedy and the acting was pretty tight grab some popcorn and go see it
Feb 5 2024,positive,i thought it was fun  the primary actors were all great but alfie was the favorite  i wanted to see more of himl
Feb 5 2024,positive,i was pleasantly surprised usually a movie with this many twists would annoy me but i feel like it was done the right way this movie is self aware meta and is a good way to kill a few hours if you like vaughns other works you wont be disappointed it takes some time to pick up steam but thats okay
Feb 5 2024,positive,funny silly good plot twist  needed more of that cat though
Feb 5 2024,positive,the plot was all over the place but the movie got better toward the second half once you start to figure out whats going on the cat was mostly cgi and kind of didnt serve any purpose
Feb 5 2024,positive,loved this movie went twice to see it in 2 days loved that bryce dallas howard didnt have to lose weight for this movie and she was a normal person with anxiety and issues that everyone else hasgoing to purchase the movie when it comes out i rated it a 5
Feb 5 2024,negative,realllly slow beginning and really dumb and silly at the end it was going for campy but there was no consistency in the tone  the 2h19m run time was wayyyy too long and by the last 2030 minutes we just wanted to know when it was going to be over
Feb 5 2024,positive,i really enjoyed this movie id been waiting to see this  it certainly didnt disappoint great cast  story there were a few twist  turns too that i didnt see coming great movie to start 2024
Feb 5 2024,positive,professional critics are awful this was a fun movie  the movie was done well with good plot twists
Feb 5 2024,positive,i loved this movie could care less what the critics say theyd have me spend my money on something dark  depressing i dont understand why some uk film critics in particular slammed a film that feels original and very british to me i recommend argylle its a fun story with a great cat and loads of great performances its a perfect date movie its great on the big screen  and it will be fun to stream at home
Feb 5 2024,negative,it was nothing like i expected the movie to be  it was a little to ridiculous for me
Feb 5 2024,positive,there were some slow parts but this movie was hilarious  i really enjoyed the action the acting and the story  i highly recommend seeing this movie yourself  screw the critics  it was fun
Feb 5 2024,positive,i honestly do not understand the hat from the critics there moments of oh no this is so cliché but those moments are in my honest opinion so well balanced and able to transmit exactly their intent this movie is great mixed with a bunch of plot twists that make it interesting until the end its just pure fun
Feb 5 2024,negative,this movie was both very stupid and not quite stupid enough
Feb 5 2024,negative,i think kids age 8 would like  its so ridiculous and long  disappointed
Feb 5 2024,positive,tons of twists i didnt see coming
Feb 5 2024,positive,very loud but action packed lots of twists in plot kept me interested for whole movie
Feb 5 2024,positive,this movie is much better than critics give it credit for  its fun and the plot twists keep it interesting  its a nice addition to the spy genre and its certainly entertaining  definitely worth a watch and hopefully we get to see the kingsmen connection unfold
Feb 5 2024,neutral,meh already forgot it
Feb 5 2024,neutral,to me it was a action movie developed more for kids or young adults
Feb 5 2024,positive,ignore the critics its their job to be miserable and criticise their way through life argylle is a fun spy movie that doesnt take itself too seriously if youve seen kingsmen youll enjoy this its in the same vein and so you know what to expect yes its not shakespeare or bond its not trying to be its simply a fun movie the cast is terrific and the story keeps you going i saw some people complain about the length i didnt think that was an issue here because i wasnt spending my whole time looking for things to criticise yes theres a bit of cheese here and there but it goes well with the wine in the movie so just sit down relax and escape for a bit thats what movies are supposed to be after all have fun
Feb 5 2024,negative,this started out good and funny but it went south towards the middle to the point of very cartoonish  think spy kids but with swearing
Feb 5 2024,positive,this movie was so awesome and sick and also funny and also kind of sad me and my mom we loved it 1010
Feb 5 2024,positive,a good enjoyable film
Feb 5 2024,positive,much better than i had expected critics had me thinking i would be bored and want to walk out but the movie was super fun i hope we get a sequel
Feb 5 2024,negative,acting just wasnt great hard to follow i like animation in a films when its good looks good but this movie it looks terrible
Feb 5 2024,positive,it was fine for what it was the twists kept me interested nice postcredit scene as well 
Feb 5 2024,negative,horrible its been a long time since i said a movie was horrible
Feb 5 2024,negative,terrible writing talking for the sake of filling time only second movie ive ever walked out on

Feb 5 2024,positive,to all the professional film critics out there how you experience the first few minutes of this film and not recognize it for what it is eludes me     besides the 30minute exposition dump i had a blast with this film  satire in a satire and nothing more  and everyone in my theatre was rolling on the floor laughing    this is a walk in and turn your brain off kinda film get a bowl of popcorn and unplug for two hours

Feb 5 2024,positive,fun with twist after twist
Feb 5 2024,positive,loved the movie  paid for 4 of us to watch and all enjoyed it  didnt enjoy lights loud speakers or having to wait 40 minutes for the movie to start because commercials were played over and over again  if i had known we would have to wait so long we would have shown up later  we sat for a total of 70 minutes before it started and only because someone went and talked to management to lower the lights  4 disabled elderly ladies were put threw this  shame on you

Feb 5 2024,negative,everything great about kickass and the kingsman is not in this movie at all its not even a fun bad movie it gets hard to watch towards the end sam rockwell somehow has no charisma and bdh acts like a mannequin who occasionally smiles and cries neat idea on paper though

Feb 5 2024,negative,terrible wait for streaming
Feb 5 2024,positive,i dont understand the critics on this if they had rated it accordingly with the movies main purpose  which is entertainment  in mind theyd say it was certified fresh   it doesnt front itself as a cerebral film or anything complex its comedy light entertainment and i absolutely loved it   some cliche tropes yes but no complaints acting was great soundtrack was wonderful left the movie theater feeling good and sometimes really thats all that matters   critics gonna critique
Feb 5 2024,negative,not funny and its a comedy not entertaining the main female actress has no comedic sense  i asked others what they thought of the movie when it ended and most said it was barely watchable   some of the famous actors were good in their rolls
Feb 5 2024,negative,unfortunately this movie felt like it was nothing but plot twists exposition and slow motion it went on way too long trying to keep you guessing but it instead lost that element of surprise because it just kept giving you a twist every 30 minutes

Feb 5 2024,negative,as soon as i realized this was from the creators of the kingsmen it got a little less terrible but only a little
Feb 5 2024,neutral,convoluted yes entertaining also yes it was funny at times but felt like it abandoned its premise at the end of the movie and then the ending just what

Feb 5 2024,positive,totally fun mostly original laugh out loud big action film for those people who said they couldnt follow the plot you are stupid for those people who said that the plot didnt quite work you are too skeptical to go to the movies anymore i really enjoyed it so did the person i went with at one point we turned to each other in the movie and said this is really good what is everybody complaining about this movie is way better than any john wick shootforeverneveroutofammo film i think the problem is that people expect him to keep putting out kingsman films and while this is very good it is not one of those movies
Feb 5 2024,positive,i want to first start out by saying i love the kingsman series and matthew vaughn movies i disagree with most of the critics reviews on this movie including igns i thought the movie was awesome alot of action and some good funny moments also always keeps you guessing and one of those movies you could see more than once to pick up on things you missed the first time i thought the choice of actresses and actors was great its a spy movie but so much more i thought bryce dallas howard did a great job in the movie along with all the others in the movie definately recommend going to see this movie i am so tired of critics just analyzing movies to the point they take all the fun of going to see movies today

Feb 5 2024,positive,very entertaining enjoyed it very much would recommend it to my friends

Feb 5 2024,positive,very entertaining with lots of action and also many plot twists which i and my friend enjoyed looking forward to book one seems like everyone just likes find the negative like the comment one reviewer made that the lead actress was fat  what a dumb statement 
Feb 5 2024,positive,im really glad we bypassed the critics and went to see this one super fun and a great escape was it a bit corny at the end yes but it was also actionpacked unpredictable and a pic you wouldnt feel bad watching with your family we need more of those
Feb 5 2024,negative,slow tortuous with a thin plot over the top campy acting  2 12 hours wasted

Feb 4 2024,positive,its funny and i had a good time not much to say just go see it really funny
Feb 4 2024,negative,the first half was an excellent hook and provided a good build up to the remainder of the film unfortunately the remainder had too many twists was choppy and hard to follow the original idea was so fantastic and unique her moms original thought that book 6 was missing a chapter is similar to the end of the movie
Feb 4 2024,negative,started off good but quickly turned into a predictable nightmare of a movie seemed yo be written by ai hitting all the top hits of interest by gen z 
Feb 4 2024,negative,script clearly written by an ai during the writers strike whole movie is exhaustingly bad save your time money and sanity

Feb 4 2024,positive,this movie was clever and had many plot twists i laughed so hard and enjoyed the adventure this is a must see movie please ignore the critics they can be simple at times
Feb 4 2024,negative,it was the worst film that i have seen in 2024  it not only stretched credulity to its limit the plot was weak in every way  it had the feeling of a movie simply made to be shortlived and nothing else
Feb 4 2024,neutral,its like vaughn put total recall the long kiss goodnight and delirious in a blender
Feb 4 2024,positive,fun adventure loved the plot twists loaded with stars cant wait for argylle 2
Feb 4 2024,negative,nice try swing and a miss
Feb 4 2024,positive,argylle is fun movie with a lot of action and with a great cast it isnt original but that is not a sin for a movie not pretentious as this one
Feb 4 2024,negative,this is the first movie ive walked out of in years it was so hard to watch sam rockwell kept it afloat as long as he could but bryce dallas howard and the awful writingdirecting kept bring the move back down to absurdity

Feb 4 2024,positive,it was a very fun movie it had laughs some good twists and i was entertained though the whole thing
Feb 4 2024,positive,i enjoyed this one and the twist and turns of it all it was action packed and the cinematography of it was very clever at points i expected some of the twist but certainly not all of them i would say that some of the twist were one too many and it did start getting a little silly towards the end but i did not take it down to 3 12 stars like i probably should have because the first 45th was so solid
Feb 4 2024,positive,i thought the movie was great very surprised at the negative remarks
Feb 4 2024,positive,argylle had a great story with so many plot twists i really enjoyed the movie and i was happy to see a series of movies coming from this movie
Feb 4 2024,positive,there are at least 4 outstanding action sequencesthe one with the car on roofs and in the oil slick are real standouts  everyone is charming and although somewhat complicated its twists and turns are actually fun
Feb 4 2024,negative,worst movie i have ever seen in my life made me want to kill myself for wasting my time
Feb 4 2024,positive,lots of action good story but some action segments are a bit overdone  but i liked it  i love alfie
Feb 4 2024,positive,some really new stuff was introduced in this movie gave it an original feel to it sadly theres one scene in the first act that hurts the movie overall it was a really fun movie you come to really care for the characters which adds to the suspense
Feb 4 2024,positive,good movie my son loved it
Feb 4 2024,positive,i was actually pleasantly surprised by how good this movie was my favorite character was definitely alfie the cat it had a great plot twist
Feb 4 2024,positive,the movie was much better than i was led to believe from reading the critics reviews  there a lot of good plot twists and turns and i was honestly surprised by many of them  and the cat was a great actor
Feb 4 2024,positive,fun movie sure theres some silliness but overall we all left entertained and happy
Feb 4 2024,positive,this movie was not what i expected but once i realized what it was i really enjoyed it i laughed more during this movie than any movie i remember in recent history there are academy award winning movies that i love but i might not ever watch again this is a movie that i would be able to watch again and enjoy i absolutely recommend it

Feb 4 2024,positive,this movie was great loved the music
Feb 4 2024,positive,lots of crazy twists and turnsoff the wall action scenes  just gotta sit back and enjoy the crazy ride
Feb 4 2024,positive,pretty far fetched story had a lot of twists which it made it interesting fun movie overall
Feb 4 2024,positive,i had hign hopes but this movie just barely snuck past average for me i will never watch it again for any reason the escape scenes were ridiculous and hurt the movie in my opinion i found myself just rolling my eyes
Feb 4 2024,positive,a convoluted spoof with great twists and turnslaughter suspense and wonderful sites along the way
Feb 4 2024,positive,its more than just a line from the promo tourjust when you think you have it figured out you dont  that was a romp and a lot of fun  plenty of action never really takes itself too seriously and if the editing team arent nominated for awards its a criminal oversight    matthew vaughn never disappoints
Feb 4 2024,positive,anyone who sees a mv movie should be prepared for some over the top frills and stills not chills i love the thrill ride and plot twists and stunts and the cast is stellar as usual and i say its worth the  to see and be entertained
Feb 4 2024,positive,what wasnt to like about the movie greatest actors great twists
Feb 4 2024,negative,argylle was the most frenetic slow movie ive ever seen it is long and takes forever to get anywhere and when you finally arrive its dumb and clumsy anyway so disappointed i was excited to see this movie trailer makes it look 10x better than it was
Feb 4 2024,positive,absolutely loved this movie its your classic escape from reality film with fantastic special effects a great story line funny and some hilarious one liners sam rockwell is a treat and bryce dallas howard just as special if you want to get back to a classic fun cinematic experience then go and see this film some will say its far fetched but isnt that why movies are a so great to watch
Feb 4 2024,positive,entertaining movie a few plot twists and sam rockwell is fantastic
Feb 4 2024,negative,do not waste your time money or sanity on this trash
Feb 4 2024,positive,love the action the lead female actress was great
Feb 4 2024,positive,great twists and i loved the kingsmen references really good action and performance all around
Feb 4 2024,negative,i wish they would pay me back for seeing it
Feb 4 2024,positive,action and funny beautiful
Feb 4 2024,negative,what a waste of time i cant believe so many quality actors agreed to appear in this overly long bore if a film
Feb 4 2024,positive,great cast of characters funny and action packed movie  little bit of mystery to it as well  great ending as well
Feb 4 2024,positive,we loved  argylle great cast funny action  great music too date night or girls night out
Feb 4 2024,negative,sorry to say i fell asleep for about 30 mins during this film  didnt matter great idea but overlong it needed some serious editing shame
Feb 4 2024,negative,embarrassingly bad  what a mess   although dua was brilliant
Feb 4 2024,positive,loved it  sure its a bit convoluted but who cares  highly entertaining and lol funny in parts  a real popcorn movie for a great night out
Feb 4 2024,positive,i love the movie its very funny
Feb 4 2024,negative,oh my actual god that was so bad first hour ok this is fun after that bombed how the cast can keep a straight face in interviews after seeing the final product i have no idea
Feb 4 2024,positive,i liked it when that lady was doing ice skating fighting the bad guys
Feb 4 2024,positive,this movie is purely to entertain and not to be taken seriously  argylle was a lot of fun  there was comedy action suspense and then some cheese  one of the  things i liked was when a cheesy scene came on they were aware of it and leaned more into it i found myself reacting to the screen and i never do that  this is a movie i would definitely add to my collection  movies were originally made for fun and argylle is trying to remind people that  great cast no one was fighting for screen time as most alist bundled cast films tend to do   it does run maybe 20 minutes too long but i left smiling   i recommend this one
Feb 4 2024,positive,could have done with shorter danceshootout scene but other than that a good movie
Feb 4 2024,negative,not funny i actually got sleepy
Feb 4 2024,positive,brilliant campy and funny just when you think you know what to expect they throw a plot twist at you it was everything ive come to expect from this director great film cant wait for the next one
Feb 4 2024,positive,this was a fun silly movie  my family really enjoyed it
Feb 4 2024,negative,the only descriptive word i can think of for this movie is stupid we werent planning on seeing it but we like sam rockwell and brian cranston so after seeing the actors interviews we thought it might be good boy were we wrong it was just ok for about 23 of the movie and then went downhill to idiotic at one point we looked at each other in total disbelief that we paid to see this dont waste your money and instead stream it when available if you are still interested
Feb 4 2024,negative,just cringe the film was way too long and had a terrible ending the cgi was terrible and the plot didnt make sense at all i want my money back after watching this film 25 hours for a terrible movie come on man 
Feb 4 2024,positive,a friend and i went to see argyle and laughed a lot great spoof on spy moves lots of twists and turns never listen to the critics
Feb 4 2024,positive,this movie had me questioning everything and everyone at every moment beautiful cinematography and costumes as well as incredible sets and filming locations while i enjoyed ever moment there were few details that i believe were only made for plot twist purposes and kinda made no sense
Feb 4 2024,positive,good movie got a little cheesy towards the end but in a cute romantic way
Feb 4 2024,positive,i thoroughly enjoyed this movie it was an actionpacked thriller which is just what is needed right now not too cerebral but fast moving enough to keep you entertained  the critics have their own reasons for such a low score but this is a great movie
Feb 4 2024,negative,fat fetched   too long
Feb 4 2024,negative,movie was not without potential but jeez was it longi thought it would never endevery gag would be overused until its no longer fun and after a point it feels like there are no stakes there are about 6 or 7 major plot twists feels like the writers just said yes to every idea they ever came up with so there is no focus to the plot the biggest reason i was rooting for the protagonist was so that the movie could end faster
Feb 4 2024,positive,only the dua lipa scene is worth 5 stars the rest of the movie i would say 0 stars give or take she shouldve acted the whole movie special effects are poor story is predictable as may other streaming originals it is full of scenes wasting time going nowhere movies about writers are like they dont know what else to write so they write about writers and their struggle to write a good story that ends being a bad story thats why i prefer movies based in true events even when you know the end reality is better than fiction i hope to see more movies where dua acts as main character the whole movie
Feb 4 2024,positive,a funny silly movie the twist is interesting just an overall fun movie
Feb 4 2024,negative,could have been good but it really wasnt anything to write home about i agree with most others thought that the twists were a bit excessive some funny moments
Feb 4 2024,positive,sam rockwell  with die hard personality 
Feb 4 2024,positive,it was silly versus funny  great cast but the fight scenes were just too absurd especially the toolong oli skating in gold lame dress
Feb 4 2024,positive,this was 100 fun    me and my daughters enjoyed it a lot
Feb 4 2024,positive,an awesome popcorn flick simple awesome fun if you liked the kingsman movies you will love this movie dont listen to the critics this is just an awesome fun silly action movie
Feb 4 2024,positive,this movie is one of the many reasons i go to the cinema argylle is a fun watch that is meant for the audiences that love to see comedy action and visuals come together in a whimsical and lighthearted way the plot is elaborate and winding which may make it a little difficult to follow but i ended up not caring too much because the journey itself was worth the experience  the action is intense without being gritty comedy is subjective but i found it to my taste and the visuals are unlike any other movie i have seen before  so often people want a movie to meet their expectations and fault it harshly in any aspect in which it fails instead allow yourself a willing suspension of disbelief and see this movie for what it is an entertaining visual journey that can be enjoyed by the general public and leave you thinking about how over the top it was
Feb 4 2024,positive,contrary to a lot of reviews i did not find this hard to follow  it was a fun watch with a fresh plot line
Feb 4 2024,positive,if you go into this not thinking its a serious spy movie you will love it  its definitely more of a spy comedy with multiple laugh out loud moments
Feb 4 2024,positive,a little silly but enjoyable glad the tickets were free or would have streamed it at home
Feb 4 2024,positive,fastpaced entertaining popcorn movie nice to have this type of film during the winter months rather than exclusively to the summer months cast seemed to having a ball
Feb 4 2024,positive,i thought this was a great movie action packed and funny they did have a lot of over the too scenes but i laughed i did not fall asleep so that is a big thinglol
Feb 4 2024,positive,the movie is fun  very good music and some excellent creative editing
Feb 4 2024,positive,argylle was tons of fun and actually better than what i was expecting the main reason is that director matthew vaughn just pulls his magic of blending so many things together to create an entertaining piece and finding the right way to make things energetic and fun great acting to deliver lines character development escalating action and plenty of comedy all blended together and optimized the feelings that vaughn knows how tro bring to life with an engaging pace and just purely entertaining made it worthy of a trip to the theaters however it still had room for improvement the action gradually gets to that exciting  level but starts off a bit stiff in the beginning as the movie finds its footing the twist and pacing needed a bit more sprucimng up to be that perfect balance of storytelling and flair we know vaughn can bring
Feb 4 2024,positive,disregard d critics review this movie has a great storyline n great performance by actors bryce dallas n sam rockwell phenomenal enjoyable movie worth watching for fun not for kids though
Feb 4 2024,positive,a good entertaining movie with some good twists  it was a bit too long for the story though
Feb 4 2024,positive,great riff of romancing the stone with spy romance films the very easy target does a great job of skewering a host of spy flick tropes including the over the top homage to couples that slay together no target is safe from bond films to kingsman and the film doesnt take itself or the genre too seriously  although its a sad commentary when a spoof has a more believable plot than a lot of serious  efforts definitely worth seeing
Feb 4 2024,negative,trope after trope just too over the top way to many twists a bad cgi cat i mean horrible cgi and the worst part every character abused the cat in some way wth why did we have to have a cat i did not add anything to the plot and just pissed me off when not one character likes cats booooo booooo
Feb 4 2024,negative,dont waste your time one of the worst movies ive seen in a long time its a shame because it started out well and continued to get worse 
Feb 4 2024,positive,fun movie good plot twists action  and humor
Feb 4 2024,positive,dont know what the critics are smoking but we absolutely loved the movie   lots of fun with some great twists and just leaves you feeling good when it ends   acting was superb across the cast so go out and enjoy this one
Feb 4 2024,neutral,i dozed off in the middle of this my wife nudged me because she said i was snoring
Feb 4 2024,positive,in a word zany    it starts off strong but its overly long each scene tries to top the last some do well some fall flat great locations and star power but the uneven writing will have you checking the hour     over use of cgi wasnt bad but when sometimes poorly done it will leave you sad production design photography and direction are all killer but the story has way too much filler    allinall a very fun ride we laughed out loud as people died but at the end with our heads filled with zany its a movie best experienced with a friend when its rainy
Feb 4 2024,positive,what a fun movie thesecritics have no sense of humor losses one star for being just a bit too long
Feb 4 2024,positive,funny action comedy great popcorn movie
Feb 4 2024,positive,very fast moving and action oriented  great plot  had a hard time figuring out who was good and who was bad  kept my wife and i laughing
Feb 4 2024,positive,i loved it action and humor from beginning to end took my teenage daughter and she loved the cats role throughout the whole movie cant wait for it to come to show it to my parents
Feb 4 2024,positive,corky funny interesting action sequences that is what this movie did very well the storyline not the best but the action makes up for it
Feb 4 2024,positive,it is outrageously overthetop but the amazing cast sells it  you can trust that sam rockwell bryan cranston and the rest will show you a good time
Feb 4 2024,negative,terrible terrible terrible movie  the second half is almost completely unwatchable and bryce dallas howard was a terrible casting choice
Feb 4 2024,negative,advertised to capture as many early ticket sales as possible this movie stinks despite the big name actors and actresses
Feb 4 2024,positive,i do overall like this movie but there were a few strange parts that i wasnt quite sure there were just parts that were over the top ridiculous
Feb 4 2024,positive,i absolutely loved it so did my mom but i do think its one of those movies were you either hate it or you love it 
Feb 4 2024,positive,ayo 30ish percent critical rating is wild and made me nervous but the movie was cool not a banger and definitely not trash rotten had a good time with the wife i would recommend it 
Feb 4 2024,negative,the movie is one i wouldnt recommend at all very far fetched the dancing routine while on a shooting spree and the ice skating routine were pretty ridiculous sorryi should have checked a little further into it before we spent over 40 on tickets and popcorn
Feb 4 2024,positive,satire is delightful it is like saturday not so serious bouyance from the horrors of life we need cat movies hope for all to laugh
Feb 4 2024,positive,the movie was great until it wasnt twothirds into it the plot became extremely overwhelming and some scenes felt too unserious from what you see from the rest of the movie its entertaining and fun and the actingdirecting was solid too just wished they hadnt gone too over the top by the end
Feb 4 2024,negative,with high hopes i was left disappointed with lackluster plots horrible cgi and a movie that went on far too long id wait until its on a streaming platform i fell asleep in the theaters
Feb 4 2024,positive,it was really funny  just a good old fun movie  a lot of little twist throughout the show
Feb 4 2024,negative,literally the most asinine movie i have ever watched i fell asleep briefly too because it was so long and stupid 2 hours of my life i cant get back
Feb 4 2024,positive,great cast and awesome scenery and action like mission impossible
Feb 4 2024,positive,the movie is just so fun the twist and turns makes us hooked till the end   overall a perfect theatre movie  mathew vaughn doesnt disappoint  sam rockwell and bryce dallas howard chemistry made the movie awesome    waiting for more from the argylle franchise
Feb 4 2024,positive,really thought this movie had a little bit of everything in it and was really entertaining
Feb 4 2024,positive,a bit over the top in parts but thats all part of the fun great plot twists its a pity sam rockwell didnt get more of a chance to really do his own style of dancing as part of his character overall a great popcorn movie see it with friends who love the cast
Feb 4 2024,positive,this was one of the best films of 2024 i didnt like the beginning of the film unfortunately and i will agree some of the plot twists are a little oh my god hell no what the fuck bro in a bad way but other plot twists were really surprising i definitely recommend this movie
Feb 4 2024,positive,taps into the spy genre but is so much more i loved the way the characters from the book were portayed in as their best selves as we would imagined them to be was a little slow mid film after the explosive start but never felt to long
Feb 4 2024,negative,just dont this was one of the worst movies ive seen the sad thing is that it could have been a great movie had there been better writing and none of the silly over the top fight scenes it says a lot when there are multiple lines that were obviously meant to be funny but no one in the theater laughs do yourself a favor and just dont go
Feb 4 2024,positive,dont believe the negative hype i created an account just to comment this is a word of mouth movie theres so much over the top action and a fun story its not perfect corny and over the top but i was thoroughly entertained it knows its campy and embraces it theres also no messaging which is a breath of fresh air just pure action go see it in theater this one actually deserves to be seen on the big screen it feels like an old school summer blockbuster movie   solid b a
Feb 4 2024,positive,this movie was fun and far fetched but totally entertaining   not intended to be taken  seriously just sit back and enjoy the silliness
Feb 4 2024,neutral,argylle is an adequately fun spy caper that struggles to connect
Feb 4 2024,negative,what a mess of a movie bad writing going out of its way to be clever when its just dumb your idiot friends will love this move because itll make them think theyre smart
Feb 4 2024,negative,you got me with the allstar cast the storyline was terrible   the actual main actors were just ok
Feb 4 2024,neutral,this movie starts off strong with a cast of alist actors a few witty jokes and an intriguing premise that draws the audience in only to leave them confused and frustrated in the end the directing was a saving grace with the fight scenes being a well blended balance of action and comedic relief perfect for an overthetop spy thriller the writers seem to get carried away with the plot of the movie as the twists get more exhausting than entertaining the actors do well to try to keep the audience captivated while we cope with the fact that some of us are going to need to ignore logic and just go with the flow    it seems to be a clear cash grab with a lot of the fanfavorite actors having only 10 minutes of screen time despite being placed in the center of the movie poster the only thing that could have made it worse was if they started singing their way out of trouble
Feb 4 2024,positive,mindblowing the plot twist you didnt see coming id definitely watch it again
Feb 4 2024,positive,fun and kept you wondering just cut out the dancing and skatng action scenes or at least make them very very short at the end and itll be much better
Feb 4 2024,positive,edge of your seat action with so many twists and done with great humor the actors were superb i cant say more about the plot without giving surprises away my husband and i loved it
Feb 4 2024,positive,it was a lot of fun  we didnt take it too seriously and just had a fun time with a great cast its a fun escape for a couple of hours
Feb 4 2024,positive,its wacky its hilarious sometimes even childishly idiotic thus all in all a lot of ridiculous fun for anybody who enjoys nonsense action movies i had a great time sam is perfect as in most of his other movies just as well as bryce unfortunately bryce had gained a many dozen kilos of weight which made her completely lose that hot sexappeal she had in times of her first jurassic park movie she still has her charming captivating smile but her attractiveness is mainly gone thus said she naturally does not convince in the fighting scenes even the ones insanely over the top simply because of being way too fat to allow those moves there is good action plenty of jokes and even some nice landscapes to enjoy 810 points
Feb 4 2024,positive,i liked the lead actorsbecause they were not the lead actors advertised
Feb 4 2024,positive,the writing was below par but the movie overall was entertaining i wouldnt recommend but i didnt hate it

Feb 4 2024,positive,exciting movie with a clever concept likable characters and terrific special effects
Feb 4 2024,positive,i honestly enjoyed this movie and gasped at every twist and turn  its regrettable that the critics are hating on this movie so hard because argyle was fun and fresh as it cherry picked from every spy movie to become the ultimate spy mashup
Feb 4 2024,positive,funny movie if you dont think top hard about realism
Feb 4 2024,positive,this movie is a great fun for family its funny with lots of twist i really enjoyed it its a kind of feel good movie when you leave the theatre would highly recommend

Feb 4 2024,positive,fun silly spy movie great story great acting fun special effects suspend disbelief open up the popcorn and have a good time
Feb 4 2024,positive,the non stop action definitely kept me glued to my seat i didnt see the plot twist at the end coming nice surprise it really is a must see film
Feb 4 2024,positive,great  movie all around
Feb 4 2024,positive,the movie transitioned into stupid fight scenes that were ridiculous
Feb 4 2024,positive,i went in prepared not to enjoy this movie because id read so many negative reviews i couldnt have enjoyed it more argylle might be a popcorn movie whatever that is to some reviewers but i found it was everything i go to a movie for it has action comedy romance and surprises the actors are all terrific especially sam rockwell and bryce dallas howard they have great chemistry and theyre both funny and badass which is a tricky combination to pull off the movie looks beautiful the dialogue is smart and the action scenes are epic it was fun its like a cross between kingsman and romancing the stone and i havent enjoyed a movie so much in years
Feb 4 2024,negative,predictable plot twists with a cgi cat  nuff said
Feb 4 2024,negative,just not good the beginning is not bad but it declines in quality every minute and the finale is just stupid simply too long too many twists horrible cgi good cast wasted and bryce as the main lead is annoying and not believable especially in the second part of the film
Feb 4 2024,positive,loved it  funny interesting i was glad to watch a different type of action movie with  plot twists an amazing movie for the family
Feb 4 2024,positive,fun movie enjoyed itwas it the best movie ever no nobut pretty good saturday night fun and enjoyable movie parts of it where ridiculous but still fun in the grand scheme and good for a laugh the train scene in particular  was highly enjoyable
Feb 4 2024,positive,fun funny thrilling exciting colorful gripping and fresh
Feb 4 2024,negative,i think its funny how they tried to bring in the swifties with the cat but theres nothing fun about watching a cat from the inside of bag for 2 hours straight still love bryan cranston terrible movie cheesy scenes and plot twists that you have wondering when it will end
Feb 4 2024,positive,dont believing the critics
Feb 4 2024,positive,its a good fun family friendly spycomedy movie with more plot twists than a turkey twizzler  if you are going to the cinema to be entertained then i think this film hits the brief if you want to come out having been profoundly moved go and see something else  if you like cats also worth seeing the film didnt see a disclaimer that no cats were hurt during the filming though
Feb 4 2024,positive,crazy fast comical weird and a great cast loved it
Feb 4 2024,positive,absolutely a blast to think this anything less than a great time shows that youre not there for a great time
Feb 4 2024,positive,all of the bad reviews were from people who wanted it to be mind numbingly serious what did you expect from the trailers it was a great movie and met my expectations
Feb 4 2024,positive,great spy movie with a corny feeling and lots of twists to the story highly recommend
Feb 4 2024,positive,forget realism and watch this its an another amazing matthew vaughn movie
Feb 4 2024,negative,it was only ok up until the dancing scene then it got completely out of hand  sam rockwell must be regretting agreeing to be in this movie although i assume the payday w as worth it  this is the worst movie we have seen this year and we are regular cinema goers
Feb 4 2024,positive,first and foremost it was too long it felt like they stuffed every spy movie idea ever but not like in a satirical manner actually being serious after so many twists you kind of stop caring what happens next the performances were solid given what they had to work with the cinematography and production value was high as usual for a vaughn film which helped as well its 100 a popcorn movie but i dont know if its worth the length
Feb 4 2024,positive,excellent movie  kept my attention lots of surprises and interesting things you find out throughout the movie
Feb 4 2024,negative,what happened to matthew vaughn the action the twists the directionall mediocre the ice skating scene was the only vaughn trademark but making it pg13 just made it meh this is as bad as apples ghosted but at least i could turn that off because that stayed on streaming
Feb 4 2024,positive,really enjoyable good twists
Feb 4 2024,negative,more stupid than the new fast and furious movies good directing though
Feb 4 2024,positive,one of the best movies ive seen in years twist after twist keeps you guessing i laughed like crazy great action scenes a little romance and funny all around outstanding cast loved it
Feb 4 2024,negative,sam carries the movie as per usual as a picture its out there if you walk in expecting a solid story with any real meaning it becomes exhausting if you walk in there expecting just a visual fanfare of madness then go for a laugh id wait for a stream a free one
Feb 4 2024,positive,twists are well executed action is gloriously silly the sarah connorkyle reese style plot is enjoyable ive seen complaints about the visuals but i thought it looked quite good and was generally welldirected
Feb 4 2024,positive,i really had high hopes for this film but it fell flat about halfway through the actors involved are all industry elites but it feels like the 2nd half of the movie was rushed and tired the action was fun but got long winded the movie should have been 30 mins shorter but was good to pass the time however our local cinema charged 18 per person i would wait the 34 weeks until this movie is on some sort of streaming service
Feb 4 2024,negative,worst movie i have ever seen so bad you have no idea  wanna be james bond but misses the mark by 1000 miles  terrible cgi on top one to avoid  i have warned you
Feb 4 2024,positive,i really liked this movie it had comedy action and a little romance and the whole cast was fantastic
Feb 4 2024,positive,twisting tale with surprises loved it
Feb 4 2024,positive,good fun and clever plot think whimsical and dont overthink and youll have a raucous good time this isnt rocket science but an antidote to a tough day
Feb 4 2024,negative,more poop from hollywood  save your money and skip this one
Feb 4 2024,positive,i dont know why this movie is getting so much undeserved hate  its got a bunch of good moments great cinematography has an awesome cast lots of action some intriguing twists and is all around enjoyable  its absolutely worth seeing in the theater  go give it a chance
Feb 4 2024,positive,fun entertaining and great escapism a risky and different take on action comedy similar to the last action hero you can either go with it or hate it
Feb 4 2024,positive,better than the rotten tomato score an entertaining first watch ill watch it again on video
Feb 4 2024,positive,this was a good movie but sorta cheesy at times but really great actors and i love how they featured the last beatles song
Feb 4 2024,positive,great acting all around bryce dallas howard and sam rockwell are particularly good together funny and action packed  perhaps a bit too long is the biggest criticism
Feb 4 2024,positive,this was the best movie ive seen in awhile i expected it to be fairly generic but the plot surprised me more than once a couple of the fight scenes had very impressive choreography   the comedic timing was impeccable     i have never done a movie review online due to not caring but this movie is worth talking about i hope it is incredibly successful and i am able to see more like it in the future
Feb 4 2024,positive,sam rockwell  the cat two actors  cgi generate a smile with laughterbut nothing else works
Feb 4 2024,neutral,slow and a little unbelievable for even matthew vaughn
Feb 4 2024,negative,i loved mathew vaugns kingsman movies but this one i would summarize in one word cringe
Feb 4 2024,positive,i dunno whats with all the negative reviews on this film just saw it and it was a lot of fun lots of laughs and a ton of twists and turns entertained the entire time
Feb 4 2024,positive,based on critics reviews i had lowered expectations but came away happily surprised yes it got a bit cheesy but was still fun
Feb 4 2024,positive,what an amazing frolic for the senses totally enjoyable laugh out loud moments wonderful cast who obviously dont take themselves too seriously like the critics  a must watch and get caught up in the spectacle of entertainment 
Feb 4 2024,positive,cast was great in this movie action sequences were choreographed well story bit over the top but it was definitely an entertaining movie and good time only complaint is the visuals in certain scenes or certain things rendered in scenes couldve have been better
Feb 4 2024,positive,this movie is well written and the casting is superb my wife and i loved seeing this in the theater it is so much fun
Feb 4 2024,positive,the kind of fun action movie thats entertaining throughout loved it
Feb 4 2024,negative,incredibly disappointing
Feb 4 2024,positive,i loved the twists and turns and campy humor
Feb 4 2024,positive,funny and action packed i loved this take on a spy movie so many legendary actors and bdh was awesome as the lead i highly recommend if youre looking for a fun date night movie
Feb 4 2024,positive,very entertaining loved the movie
Feb 4 2024,positive,i happened to watch this movie on an unusual rainy day in the bay area without any particular expectations the opening scene had that classic james bond vibe or rather more like last years fast x both sides of the chase racing through a beautiful old city    as expected the plot began to twist and turn then twist some more reminding me of a chinese film lost in the stars 2023 similarly i eagerly anticipated more plot twists however i was left waiting for a more logical development crafting a compelling twistfilled narrative requires logical storytelling and the director and screenwriter must possess intelligence to execute multiple plot twists that appears to be quite challenging    nevertheless this movie had me bursting into laughter especially when the leading lady took up figure skating be sure not to miss that scene
Feb 4 2024,positive,just gets crazier and crazier every 15 minutes some might like that type of story telling but its kinda too goofy for my liking
Feb 4 2024,positive,i loved everything great actors excellent plot that kept you wanting more and had all kinds of twists   would watch over and over
Feb 4 2024,negative,the worst film i have seen in the last 365 days  and i have seen at leas 52 films at the theater dont waste your time or money this was horrible
Feb 4 2024,positive,i loved this film from start to finish while ive seen some who didnt feel them same i went for the cast the director and most of all for the fun boy was i excited that all three exceeded my every expectation i felt every character worked as much as the rapid fire twists and turns the music was also ten and finally the cat was every bit a player not just a sight gag or random prop ill very be seeing argylle again to catch all of the many fun things i missed in my first viewing
Feb 4 2024,positive,super fun action movie it runs about 15 minutes too long but other than that its totally entertaining from start to finish be warned its very over the top very campy so if you cant get on board with the impossible then this movie isnt for you but if you love gleefully over the top action then this is the movie for you
Feb 4 2024,positive,argylle is a very fun movie that really clicks bryce and sam are great together and of course catherine ohara is amazing as always
Feb 4 2024,positive,its a silly fun action comedy and thats fine it has solid performances a good soundtrack and is just a wild 2 hr ride with a lot of twists some unexpected and some obvious you will either love it or hate it no in between
Feb 4 2024,positive,if you are in the right mood this is a must see movie made my night
Feb 4 2024,positive,sam rockwall john cena dua lipa and bryan cranston were great  love the new beatles song too
Feb 4 2024,positive,interesting premise good actor choice
Feb 4 2024,negative,i love matthew vaughn layer cake is in my top 10 films and his library has been solid all the way throughuntil this i paused the film and made sure it wasnt some alternate version like 5 times it is truly painful awful use of such a talented roster its not even entertaining its not satire or being sarcastic on purpose its just so cringe and hard to watch the twists arent even the smallest bit cleverat all and eventually im shaking my head thinking not another awful twist but it quadruples down again and again it makes me wonder how anyone could have watched a cut of this and thought oh wow this is funny or entertaining its truly sad every actor is far better than the work thats put forth its like watching very talented people do a life time movie with larger scale im stunned at the very least the pure talented cast could weather bad writing with charm and gags not the case at all its just bad truly awful i feel bad embarrassed and im unsure how anyone involved doesnt
Feb 4 2024,positive,fun movie with great twists and neat action sequences
Feb 4 2024,negative,sometimes you see a movie and think huh thats a good plane movie this movie didnt even meet that bar it was 2 hours too long featured characters you never learn anything about and felt like it was written by ai if this is trying to satirize action movies maybe dont do that if you have to rely on tropes of action movies in order to prove your point  and then to top that off employ those strategies worse than action movies themselves oh also if youre going to make a cgi cat  can the cat at least wink that was actually maybe the hardest thing to suspend your disbelief on that a cgi cat could not wink     sam rockwell does all the heavy lifting and is so good  there are moments you think do i hate this as much as i thought and then hes offscreen again and you think ah yes i do bryan cranston catherine ohara ariana debose dua lipa sofia boutella and samuel l jackson do a great job with the terrible material theyre given  which is just a testament to how good of actors they are not that the script redeems itself    it was pretty and seeing anything in imax will always feel special so theres that at least thank you imax and thank you sam rockwell
Feb 4 2024,positive,it was a very funny movie with good action scenes
Feb 4 2024,positive,this is a stupid movie with horrible acting waste of time and money
Feb 4 2024,negative,not my favorite i regret spending the money to see this along with buying the book i really hope there is not another one coming out wait of a movie budget by far
Feb 4 2024,negative,argylle started with an interesting narrative but somehow managed to turn itself into a two and a half hour goop that dragged more than a lowrider plot twists every 5 minutes had me more confused than looper and frankly made it incredibly easy for me not to care anyone an hour in for a movie about a writer this ironically has been the worst written movie i have ever watched for the first time in my life i took a nap and scrolled through my phone while the movie was playing argylle might have saved itself if it had sliced off an hour of filler and futile story progression dont waste your money or time on this garbage
Feb 4 2024,positive,it was absurd and hilarious and happy
Feb 4 2024,positive,solid matthew vaughn movie acting is good and the action scenes are on par with kingsman
Feb 4 2024,positive,argylle was so much fun the tongue in cheek humor as well as all the twists and turns kept me laughing bryce dallas howard and sam rockwell were great together
Feb 4 2024,neutral,movie was cool lots of interesting clues  little cheesy fight scene but overall was entertaining
Feb 4 2024,negative,worst movie ive ever seen   terrible plot   horrible acting
Feb 4 2024,positive,awesome fun movie a few great plot twists but the dancing scene could have been way shorter all in all i definitely recommend it
Feb 4 2024,positive,im not understanding all the dislike for this movie i thought it was a pretty entertaining action movie i would probably see it again and wish there would be a sequel
Feb 4 2024,positive,this movie is just the right blend of comedy and action with some really nice plot twist to keep it engaging and enjoyable every minute of it
Feb 4 2024,positive,like cheese movies is one watch
Feb 4 2024,positive,lots of twists and turns and actionpacked
Feb 4 2024,positive,first hour was fun liked the plot but then it went overkill cheesy drawn out i fell asleep for a bit towards the end it was something like 220 hrs i would have loved it if theyd cut it down to 130145 hrs loved the dolby version sharp visual
Feb 4 2024,positive,funny moments  good plot twists sometimes dragged
Feb 4 2024,positive,i like this movie and so glad i watched instead of  listening to other peoples opinions different approach for a spy movie kept me guessing throughout with twist and turns had an interesting dance scene not typical of a spy movie but maybe a hallucination scene i enjoyed it tired of the same old formula for spy movies i highly recommend watching and forming your own opinion
Feb 4 2024,positive,fun nonstop rollercoaster loved the cat special effects might have been small screen level but many laugh out loud moments made theater experience worth it
Feb 4 2024,neutral,argyle was fun but much longer than it needs to be  it was slow in places  im not sure what was broken in this film but i tried to like it since it had a lot of great actors
Feb 4 2024,negative,this movie was absolutely terrible 41 for tickets popcorn and soda wasted such a disappointment from a stellar cast sam rockwell samuel l bryan cranstondid they even read the script or was this just a chance to make some paper the cgi was terrible plot twist was all over the place bdh is a wonderful actress but this was not the movie for her the best parts were the scenery and even then was mostly green screen ugh
Feb 4 2024,positive,hilarious movie wasnt expecting much but left greatly impressed
Feb 4 2024,positive,fun overthetop spy movie we all liked it lots
Feb 4 2024,positive,actionpacked great comedy
Feb 4 2024,positive,entertaining and fun
Feb 4 2024,positive,solid film with some twists and turns throughout the film has a similar feel to the kingsman series also created by vaughn in most cases there isnt a whole lot to separate it from other entries in the actionespionage genre if anything it suffers a little from this at times it feels like it could be a parody of the genre but others like its trying to take itself a bit too seriously and not embrace what is in effect a very hokey plot idea but overall its a solid film to just sit back and be entertained
Feb 4 2024,positive,a true popcorn flick with some laughoutloud moments and mostly amusing all the way through it is a farce to be sure the writerdirector put in every plot cliché possible because it was after all about a spy novelist trying to come up with a fitting final chapter for her fifth book in the series lots of switcheroos in identities fabulous supporting cast sam rockwell as the longsuffering one who knows the truth from the beginning is excellent bryce howard is the novelist wouldbefemme fataleamong other things with an alter ego that looks an awful lot like superman with an auburn buzz cut like the summer vacation you could never afford to take long running time breezes right by well scored well choreographed stay for the credits very enjoyable at an adult level appropriately rated pg13 on purpose by the director
Feb 4 2024,positive,cant wait to watch again
Feb 4 2024,negative,this is probably one of the worst movies i have ever seen i cannot believe that somebody wrote this might be worth watching as an exercise in how horrible cinema can be
Feb 4 2024,positive,my wife and i saw it thursday night  we both thought it was very good and entertaining 4 thumbs up for mathew vaughn and team
Feb 4 2024,positive,action drama and comedy
Feb 4 2024,positive,very fun and entertaining movie loved that it had action without all the blood and guts 
Feb 4 2024,negative,so much wasted potential interesting not necessarily in a good way action pieces that looked cheap bad cat cgi occasionally funny the audience i watched with laughed out loud several times i wasnt sure why
Feb 4 2024,positive,after hearing the reviews i did not have high expectations however after the journey of twists and turns through out  i was pleasantly surprised with how much i liked it   you will be continually surprised
Feb 4 2024,positive,original and very entertaining i dont understand the bad reviews i liked it a lot
Feb 4 2024,positive,was ok funny very silly at times
Feb 4 2024,neutral,cheesy extremely gooey and cheesy i was robbed by how little of an actual appearance dua lipa and sofia boutella have in this movie boo they had more screen time in the promotional trailers than in the film
Feb 4 2024,negative,im still not sure of what i just watched it seemed like it lasted for 4 hours ugh
Feb 4 2024,positive,i liked this movie was good and funny kept you on your toes with action
Feb 4 2024,negative,holy moly this was terrible like so bad youre embarrassed to be in the theater and you look around to see if you should leave or just tough it out
Feb 4 2024,positive,it was exactly the the lowlogic highstyle movie i expected
Feb 4 2024,positive,the many plot twists kept it interesting and the humor  some of it very tongueincheek  was funny and well timed   go see it
Feb 4 2024,positive,funny  many unexpected twists definitely recommend
Feb 4 2024,positive,amazing movie  so much fun  we are going again tuesday
Feb 4 2024,negative,argyle sets out with ambition but unfortunately falters at nearly every turn delivering a viewing experience that leaves much to be desired one of the most glaring issues is the acting which ranges from unconvincing to overthetop failing to ground the films more outlandish elements in any sense of reality the direction doesnt help with an overreliance on cheesy spinning camera angles that seem more disorienting than dynamic detracting from the narrative rather than enhancing it    the scenarios presented throughout argyle stretch believability to its breaking point with plot points that feel more contrived than compelling this suspension of disbelief is further challenged by the films choreography during action sequences which often comes across as awkward and poorly executed breaking any immersion the story might have cultivated    stylistically the film makes some questionable choices particularly in terms of outfit selections that range from jarring to simply inappropriate failing to add depth or authenticity to the characters coupled with a soundtrack that often feels mismatched to the onscreen action the film struggles to establish a coherent tone or mood    moreover argyle makes the dubious choice to include unnecessary cleavage and sexualization which feels not only gratuitous but also tonedeaf overshadowing the potential for strong character development with cheap sensationalism this choice undermines any serious themes the film aspires to explore reducing its potential impact    in conclusion argyle misses the mark on multiple levels from its unconvincing performances and visual missteps to its lack of narrative coherence and poor taste in character portrayal the film could have offered an entertaining or even thoughtprovoking experience but instead settles for a collection of cinematic clichés and missed opportunities
Feb 4 2024,positive,really fun and unexpected twists
Feb 4 2024,positive,best movie ive seen in a while
Feb 4 2024,negative,absolutely garbage i do not recommend this movie at all completely wasted my time

Feb 4 2024,positive,i enjoyed this movie it was very funny and entertaining it also had some pretty great twists too
Feb 4 2024,positive,this was a fun and entertaining movie if youre looking to be entertained i highly recommend
Feb 4 2024,positive,it was a fun movie as long as you turn your brain off and just go with the flow    it was absolutely visually ridiculous but if it was any more serious it would be a terrible movie  its ridiculous is the fun
Feb 4 2024,positive,my family and i throughly enjo7ed this film sam rockwell was hilarious and his action sequences were well choreographed dbh was spot in as the neurotic damsel in distress intil she wasnt     the mix of of present past and parallel story lines really helped move the film along     not sure why critics are so down on this film   it was great fun to watch and id recommend it to anyone
Feb 4 2024,negative,almost 2 12 hours long and felt every bit of it  felt like it didnt know if it wanted to be a hokey comedy or an action movie  it failed at both imo
Feb 4 2024,positive,a really good plot twist mid movie with a few hammy goofy moments but overall very entertaining would recommend
Feb 4 2024,positive,a cheesy actionpacked spy thriller is what you need from matthew vaughn it has a lot of twists in which it can be tiresome
Feb 4 2024,negative,sam rockwell and bryce dallas howard do their best to make it watchable but its just such a smug mess overall and the most only convincing supervillains in this end up being the filmmakers themselves  compared to other recent attempts at spy pastiche it might be marginally better than ghosted but less fun than spy by a long long way
Feb 4 2024,negative,too long and too weird
Feb 4 2024,negative,really bad cgi one of the worst i have ever seen i am just suprised i stayed until the end of it
Feb 4 2024,positive,loved it  very twisty and fun  shot beautifully but if you have a short attention span skip it
Feb 4 2024,positive,i havent had this much fun in a long time in the theater
Feb 4 2024,positive,sam rockwell is really good dallas bryce howard seems miscast the movie is a bit too ridiculous with some overlong and repetitive action sequences
Feb 4 2024,positive,average not terrible and not great some scenes were silly
Feb 4 2024,positive,hilarious spoof on spy movies at first you think wait this is a bit off then you realize  its a parody that goes over the top great comedic actors having fun we loved it

Feb 4 2024,positive,as long as you can sit through the first hour the rest will be worth it starts slow but ends in a fun  entertaining way
Feb 4 2024,positive,it is funny and action packed pure entertainment and escapism sometimes its nice to just to watch a movie with absurd plot twists that doesnt take itself too seriously
Feb 4 2024,negative,absolutely awful save your money and watch something else
Feb 4 2024,negative,the only silver lining in this movie is that the budget was 200 million and it wont make back 25 of that that should lead to the producer  writer and director never getting near another major movie again i actually felt pain when it just kept going and going gawd awful avoid
Feb 4 2024,positive,its definitely in the style that matthew vaughn established in his kingsman movies but coming from another angle you will enjoy it for enjoyments sake the trailer is a bit misleading but once you get past that itll be a fun ride there is a midcredit scene so stick around for that you will enjoy it
Feb 4 2024,positive,such an amazing storyline love the cliffhanger at the end hoping for a second movie 1010 recommend i also love the plot twist also sad in some parts too and is really cute i just love the movie so much so happy they kept the cat too

Feb 4 2024,positive,one of the best who done its ive seen in a while i loved all the twists and turns and quirky comedic scenes such a good movie action packed a touch of romance and comedy who could ask for more cant wait to see all the books come to life
Feb 4 2024,negative,i made an account just to post a review about argylle because i felt obligated to let people know this was genuinely one of the worst films ive ever seen and ive seen a lot awful plot pacing cinematography visual effects acting apart from maybe sam rockwell who really is just being himself basically anything that makes a movie good is done in the absolute worst way possible use your wallet to tell hollywood we do not want more of this slop matthew vaughn should retire from directing entirely hes created an embarrassment for everyone involved its not even so bad its good its just truly dreadful so much so that i actually feel sorry for the cast and crew who had to work on this garbage do not give this film your money
Feb 4 2024,negative,great actors boring script constantly flashing back to the writer was irritating
Feb 4 2024,negative,cleaver idea poorly executed it opened with a wildy unrealistic spy caper dance and chase scene only to reveal we were watching the scenes from a novelist perspective i thought cool the problem was they were often unrealistic in the real life scenes too the contrast was barely acceptable and towards the climax it went all the way off the rails into god awful rediculous
Feb 4 2024,negative,critics nailed this  an uneven mess which is only partially saved by a talented group of actors  some fun and good twists in the first half were completely negated by a ridiculous second half which had confusing and unneeded plot twists and action sequences which were so ludicrous walkingout crossed my mind    please skip this movie so hollywood doesnt waste its time making sequels or similar movies
Feb 4 2024,positive,loved all the action the storyline had a great twist at the end and overall very good a little cheesy in a couple of spots but good funny parts
Feb 4 2024,positive,i was really impressed with this original story not once was i able to predict what was coming next had many loud laughs as well
Feb 4 2024,positive,great action sequences and comedic instances kept me awake for sure
Feb 4 2024,negative,chaotic difficult to follow cgi bad felt like it was being written while filming and just making it up as we go
Feb 4 2024,positive,fun flick lots of twists  turns 
Feb 4 2024,positive,i was interested in this movie first bc of the possible association to taylor swift  i realized pretty quickly it was likely not her but i was going to read the book anyway  i found the book to be pretty entertaining and largely didnt want to put it down  the movie i realized was going to be quite different with the book as only a backdrop which turned out to be very true  some of the movie bordered on the ridiculous which my kids loved even if i found them somewhat cringy but i took it in stride much the way we did austen powers so many years ago now  it definitely seemed like a cross between that and a james bond film in many ways  so many twists and turns definitely kept us guessing  having read the book did shed some light on the ending especially if you stay for the midcredit scene but isnt necessary to enjoy the movie  it made for a fun afternoon with our teens but i wouldnt recommend for younger kids as there is a lot of fighting and death though not bloody   suspend your disbelief and just enjoy
Feb 4 2024,positive,action packed  likable characters
Feb 4 2024,positive,it was fantastic gray cast good plot with a very cool twist music was awesome and i highly recommend you go see it

Feb 4 2024,negative,sam rockwell acting phenomenal as usual please god another charlies angels  but other than the rest of the movie was a bit cringe a lot of different movie inspiration all into one but definitely wouldnt watch again
Feb 4 2024,positive,it was fun and had some great twists and turns
Feb 4 2024,negative,it was always silly but by yhe end it was downright ridiculous  my kids and i kept glancing at each other wondering what was going on hard to believe adults thought filming these scenes were a good idea
Feb 4 2024,negative,way too long too much cgi too much fighting totally unreal stunts and for a comedy way too little things to laugh about  oh and why put john cena in this picture well known as a terrible actor
Feb 4 2024,negative,save your money you will thank me later    this was the most boring movie the plot kept on switching every time  it didnt make any sense especially with the ending     i wish i had walked out sooner lol    i would never never recommend this movie to anyone

Feb 4 2024,positive,hilarious overthetop action with an amazing cast we had a blast watching the very selfaware absurdity of it all like a kingsman film taken to new and crazier levels mixed with the irreverent humor of deadpool its just plain fun
Feb 4 2024,positive,super enjoyable movie  howard plays her character well and overall the action pace and tone make for a good time  could have done without the rainbow dance killing spree or the skates of death but otherwise a good time
Feb 4 2024,positive,amazing best i have seen in months great actors
Feb 4 2024,positive,i dont understand all of the negative reviews this movie was clever fun and entertaining it ran a bit long toward the end but i loved it otherwise
Feb 4 2024,negative,the first half of the movie was an absolute snoozefest the middle got pretty good and it got my hopes up then it completely went off the rails with too many outlandish plot twists even for a matthew vaughn  it was an okay movie but id paid full price and not the matinee price for this ticket i would have been really annoyed
Feb 4 2024,positive,people who are you liking this movie are taking it too seriously its a comedy and its merv enjoy it for what it is
Feb 4 2024,positive,is it a little silly yes but its also completely enjoyable its a fun little spy movie and has a few surprising twists

Feb 4 2024,positive,such a fun and exciting movie the music the action everything perfectly choreographed amazing cast i absolutely loved it and do not agree with rotten tomatoes rating everyone should give this movie a chance you will not regret must watch
Feb 4 2024,positive,this is fun movie to watch if you pay no attention to the seemingly unbelievable car stunts  it is a great cast and they all make the movie work  it has some plot twists that i didnt see coming  i want to go see it again and i highly recommend it
Feb 4 2024,positive,i liked it all have nothing  bad to say
Feb 4 2024,positive,fun movie and characters silly but great if your looking for a spy movie that is just pure fun 
Feb 4 2024,positive,a funny lighthearted take on a spy movie i enjoyed it alot and it definitely made me laugh
Feb 4 2024,negative,argylle started off with an interesting premise that unfortunately just didnt hit its mark and is sabotaged by its own run time the film follows author elly conway as her life is flipped upside down when the books she has written become reality while having an intriguing concept argylle feels more like a parody rather than an actual espionage film which is totally understandable during the scenes depicting the moments of the book otherwise it just didnt work although argylle has more of a fleshed out story i would much rather watch the beekeeper starring jason statham once again that film with how unrealistic the narrative and action was felt more grounded than argylle the other thing that just made me not enjoy argylle as much is its unnecessary run time there were moments that wouldve been the perfect ending however just when you thought it was over something else would develop or there was yet another twist i believe that if 30 minutes were shaved off from the runtime it probably wouldve been perfect unfortunately i would not recommend this film at least while its in theaters this is definitely one you should just wait for it to stream it is one of those movies that you can just throw on while you are getting other stuff done
Feb 4 2024,neutral,movie was pretty good but the disruptions in the theatre kept me from actually enjoying it
Feb 4 2024,positive,very entertaining a little long on the rom con  scenes but really like it
Feb 4 2024,positive,great action fantasy spy movie as they go i normally like true life or more realistic movies better  however  it was well acted and a terrific spoof on the spy  genre  kept my attention through out most of the movie  didnt like when it turned almost into a dance musical piece in the duet shoot out toward the end  but though i think the movie wouldve been better without that scene it did serve to   fantasize some of the violence in the movie
Feb 4 2024,positive,doesnt take itself seriouslyeven cheesybut i like cheesy especially with the tension in real life nowadays  fun action sequences except for the 2cnd to last fight had me laughing though that keep you guessing  some twists i didnt see coming which makes me like this more    the only reason i didnt give it 5 stars was the lengthbut that is also a big plus i mean after all the chance to look at bryce dallas howard for 2 hoursworth it
Feb 4 2024,neutral,the critics  got this one right its downright silly  it looks like disneys low inspiration  infection is spreading to paramount maybe they can stop it in time too late for disney  they should look to mgm which produced the beekeeperon time  btw who cast bryce dallas howard victorias secret
Feb 4 2024,positive,overall great story line
Feb 4 2024,neutral,first half of the movie was fairly entertaining then it became silly and not very good
Feb 4 2024,positive,it started out slow and somewhat predictable then corny and funny
Feb 4 2024,positive,really fun ride great unexpected plot twists that werent gratuitous gotchas like some directors feel the need to do one spot near the end seemed really over the top but i wont spoil it just remember that one of the main characters is an author and very imaginative
Feb 4 2024,positive,excellent plot that keeps you guessing as long as you are ready to be taken for a fun ride funny in many spots and keep in mind that the main gal hallucinates now and then it will put the movie in perspective loved this
Feb 4 2024,positive,an extremely entertaining time at the movies
Feb 4 2024,positive,i really enjoyed this movie and all the characters in it for me it was a feel good movie very refreshing and funny it has a few plot twists which always keeps things interesting although i hoped to see more of henry i wasnt upset at all because the rest of the cast delivered i went with my little sister and we had a blast absolutely loved this moviee this is a movie i will definitely rewatch over and over it is my kind of movie for sure
Feb 4 2024,positive,i thought the movie was a lot of fun the multiple twists were fine not sure why it has such a low rating but i suppose to each their own    fight scenes were great especially one particular over the top scene and one with skating did not feel long at all per the rotten tomatoes summary id see it again
Feb 4 2024,positive,loved it it definitely keeps you on your toes and it is satire so its ridiculous but i really enjoyed it great cast 
Feb 3 2024,positive,the movie was a pleasant surprise with lots of twists   it was an irreverent and funny tale of spies and love  totally entertained

Feb 3 2024,positive,terrific action film with lots of comedic elements  great cast  looking forward to the rest of the trilogy
Feb 3 2024,negative,very cute movie was going well in the beginning but then i felt that towards the end it just got a little too silly and dragged on
Feb 3 2024,positive,loved the first half the movie drags after that the style and type of film i really enjoyed what they were going for and the story however all the twists and turns and the inconsistencies that started popping up at the end i felt as if the movie ended 30 minutes earlier it would have been good     i would likely not see a second adaptation because the final act just felt like too much i felt like i had enough of the film that said if youre looking for something nice and funny to watch with your girlfriend this spring i recommend
Feb 3 2024,positive,great movie has a lot of laughs
Feb 3 2024,positive,apart from one action sequence that indulged in cheeky weirdness perhaps a little too much this was a fun little escape
Feb 3 2024,positive,great characters good action scenes interesting twists loved every minute
Feb 3 2024,positive,meh   not worthy of a full review   this could have been a fun romp but ended up being more silly   back half is a little better with the plot moving along a bit more but confess i did nod off during this one    better editing might have saved this one but it is what is it    wait for cable
Feb 3 2024,positive,loved this movie it was very entertaining without anything too gruesome andor perverse
Feb 3 2024,positive,such a fun movie loved it
Feb 3 2024,positive,this movie was surprisingly funny we really enjoyed it
Feb 3 2024,positive,must see so interestinglove it all the way through
Feb 3 2024,positive,i dont like spy movies shoot em up movies or tense movies i had low expectations but went at my daughters request we both loved the movie the storyline was so far out there that it didnt relate to real life and therefore didnt spook me out it was madcap silly and campy fun and the actors are all wonderful in their roles a day later im still laughing about all the crazy imaginative twists and turns i was completely entertained
Feb 3 2024,positive,i hate fighting movies but there was a lot of silliness and absurdity to offset
Feb 3 2024,positive,you get exactly what is promised a fun movie great for date night  john cenas best performance to date silly over the top good action sequences without a bunch of stupid car chases its not shakespeare but it is well written and well performed
Feb 3 2024,positive,movie was very campy and a lot of fun to watch lots of twists and turns  a tiny bit long at end but really enjoyed it

Feb 3 2024,positive,if you are a fan of the kingsman movies as i am you will really like this movie
Feb 3 2024,positive,the most fun movie i have seen in a long time  just pure twist and fun  like a great roller coaster

Feb 3 2024,positive,the movie was great and hilarious the cast was brilliant its worth seeing 
Feb 3 2024,positive,you know what loved it its a moviehowever weird it is its fun lighthearted kind and just a good time
Feb 3 2024,positive,argylle was an interesting concept but i felt it was trying to be too many things the first half of the movie felt like a mission impossible movie then the second half got progressively sillier and switched between silly and serious i like both halves separately but together they dont work the best scene of the movie was the fight scene with the colorful smoke it was wonderfully choreographed and was the right amount of silliness if youre looking for a fun time with the family argylles a good choice otherwise its not really worth the time 610
Feb 3 2024,positive,silly funny a bit interesting lighthearted dumb liked it for what it was
Feb 3 2024,positive,i found the movie to be a fun lighthearted spin of a spy spoof

Feb 3 2024,negative,boring and long  actress too fat
Feb 3 2024,neutral,full of action it was really good overall
Feb 3 2024,positive,i thoroughly enjoyed this  i also enjoyed all of the kingsman movies  so it makes sense that i would like this too  im not sure where the disconnect between critic and audience reviews is but there is one  my wife thought the movie to be silly but with a good start and a good end i thought it was good the entire run  i heard plenty of laughs from the few that were in the audience with me and what more can you want out of a spy spoof    bottom line  if the kingsman movies were enjoyable to you you will love argyle too
Feb 3 2024,positive,would have given 4 stars but the story lagged midway and the ending was a bit over the top i went in with low expectations though so it was better than i expected 
Feb 3 2024,positive,this movie was very different from anything out there lots of humor action and romance
Feb 3 2024,positive,loved it  there is some over the top silliness so you have to enjoy the spy  espionage genre going in to appreciate the spoofs but its quite brilliant
Feb 3 2024,positive,loved it very entertaining dont understand the bad reviews from the critics
Feb 3 2024,positive,the most fun ive had watching a movie in a theater in a long time  loved it  where else are you going to see skating on crude oil
Feb 3 2024,positive,absolutely wonderful some of the most fun ive had at the movies since the original kingsman movie  matthew vaughn at his finest and bryce dallas howard was amazing
Feb 3 2024,neutral,argylle has fun moments and the cast does an admirable job giving the movie life not to mention a great soundtrack structurally the film is a bit of a mess and ranks among director matthew vaughns weaker efforts
Feb 3 2024,negative,i want my time back with all these stars shouldnt i laugh at least once maybe even crack a smile i really wanted to like this movie but no save your time dont even watch if it is free
Feb 3 2024,positive,i thought it was funny and entertaining i had a great time watching i loved the choreography for fights and dances too
Feb 3 2024,positive,despite the lack of character development on supporting characters and having too many twists argylle is still an entertaining spy film with exciting action scenes that succeeds thanks to rockwell and howards chemistry and vaughns creativity and direction
Feb 3 2024,negative,a few clever spots that were overwhelmed by the ridiculous
Feb 3 2024,positive,absolutely loved the movie if you are going to have a good time and enjoy some good old action and twiststhis is the movie for you loved every bit of it and enjoyed that the female character was the central hero of the plot just go and have some fun and enjoy the caper dont go expecting seriousheavy drama  or to critque or question why things are happening if you enjoyed indiana jonesromancing the stone or even everythingeverywhere all at once give this movie a shot
Feb 3 2024,positive,dozens of laughoutloud moments

Feb 3 2024,positive,pretty good movie with a few plot twists  slow in three parts  the opening sequence was fun
Feb 3 2024,positive,genuinely one of the dumbest things ive seen that being said it was incredibly entertaining and its constant silliness made it a fun watch despite some of the dumb logic like rachel being able to ice skate on fucking oil i still enjoyed myself this movie will definitely be sticking in my memory so i have to give it credit for that
Feb 3 2024,positive,just a fun movie dont overthink it
Feb 3 2024,positive,this action comedy is amazing funny action packed and acting is really good plus writing and direction to it is also done well and locations are done beautifully plus do like it that very self aware kind of movie and which do like too there are three cons are 1 it way to long 2 not enough action and too much explaining what is going on 3 finally too much twists and if not paying attention you easily miss it cause whatever the twist is that use that for next scene and yes some of it you can see coming but hopefully next movie is a straight spy acting comedy movie and that what i like would you see all in all is a and definitely recommend and must watch in theaters 
Feb 3 2024,positive,a fun actionpacked twisty spy romp which goes beyond the basic premise of the trailer and delivers surprises unexpected twists and amazing choreographed action scenes all star cast and a movie that you will definitely enjoy avoid spoilers before you see it and youll enjoy it even more
Feb 3 2024,positive,amazingly creative but stupid fight scenes were too much
Feb 3 2024,positive,very good movie i think everyone should see it that being said the movie is a little long but it is very very good 
Feb 3 2024,positive,the movie was an entertaining fun popcorn film  the ending did drag out a little too long but it does a fantastic job of poking fun of the spy genre but from a place of love    dont expect anything really serious just have fun with it monster cast that you could tell had fun making this movie

Feb 3 2024,positive,the movie was really good enjoyed it from start to finish had a few laughs
Feb 3 2024,positive,i liked that it was fastmoving and you didnt know what was true or fiction until the end
Feb 3 2024,negative,there are very few things to like about argylle its too wacky and weird this movie was nothing like its trailers and marketing half the actors on the poster and trailer barely even show up so far its not only the worst movie of the year but also the most disappointing the movie should have been about the book
Feb 3 2024,positive,argylle is a lot of fun the first 34 is exactly what i wanted from this film escapism thrilling heroics humor then theres a bit of a slog requiring massive suspension of disbelief and it comes back with a good ending sam rockwell carries the film but the whole cast delivers enjoyable performances
Feb 3 2024,positive,very fast paced great soundtrack overall very enjoyable
Feb 3 2024,negative,too long and not enjoyable
Feb 3 2024,positive,good old popcorn movie funny very witty and some cool moments not a blockbuster but a solid enjoyable movie

Feb 3 2024,negative,this movie is just so disappointingly average that its actually kind of depressing with so much talent both in front of and behind the camera to release a final product this mediocre is just sad  full review youtubevosgatagwegsizdurzs58fobc7xl
Feb 3 2024,positive,just over the top ridiculous fun

Feb 3 2024,negative,absolutely dreadful bit like the lost city but a lot lot worse which is saying something not often i walk out of a cinema but no way i could sit there for 25 hours to watch that cant believe this actually made it to the big screen
Feb 3 2024,neutral,if youve seen any spy thriller before chances are youve seen something like argylle

Feb 3 2024,positive,the trailer was better than the movie  sam rockwell and catherine ohara did it for me  not horrible not great but cheesy at best 
Feb 3 2024,negative,just a bad movie save your money
Feb 3 2024,positive,movie was fun clever funny and full of slapstick  sam rockwell is amazing he always is but playing some of the other characters had to be a hoot for the actors  there are more twists and turns than you can keep track of but thats part of the intrigue  bryce dallas howard amazingly works for the part given the typs of slapstick movie and was really nice to see her in another leading lady role  lots of bullets and crazy smoke scenes that will have you giggling your way to the end  it is not a movie you can take seriously  so worth it to see it on the big screen
Feb 3 2024,positive,so much easy to watch fun much like kingsman lots of action and entertainment yes there are silly plot holes but every action film has them and its not supposed to be real best film of the year so far
Feb 3 2024,positive,my daughter and i saw this friday afternoon we both liked it the fight scenes with the music were really fun and engaging multiple twists that kept the movie going my daughter loves cats and loved the cats part in the movie he really was a third character more movies like this are needed
Feb 3 2024,positive,i liked the interesting story line with all the surprise twists and the acting
Feb 3 2024,positive,while the movie is not going to win any academy awards and it was a little long for the subject mater it was a fun movie  action music laughter what else do you need from a good popcorn movie
Feb 3 2024,positive,you could definitely see kings man influence on this film wasnt sure what to expect but i do know i really do enjoy seeing dallas bryce howard on screen thoroughly enjoyed it thought it came together well lots of laugh out loud moments so much so that the person in the row in front of me moved one row further forward
Feb 3 2024,positive,so much fun  entertaining and keeps you guessing until the end  and henry
Feb 3 2024,positive,really liked it funny and cute
Feb 3 2024,positive,if you enjoy the kingsman movies youll likely enjoy this watch it with no expectations and youll have a good time
Feb 3 2024,positive,it had some slow parts where i wondered where the movie was going but when the plot started to thicken i was very entertained and laughed much  i love movies with a creative plot which this movie had  worth seeing
Feb 3 2024,positive,epically fresh and layered like an onion
Feb 3 2024,positive,its absolutely amazing my family was laughing so hard at some of the antex and scenes we also were very into the story line plot and character development we were on the edge of our seats trying to figure out what was going to happen next we will definitely be seeing it again
Feb 3 2024,positive,may the real agent argylle please stand up please stand up
Feb 3 2024,positive,fun movie and we enjoyed it
Feb 3 2024,neutral,comedy spy thrillers are a pretty mixed bag all things considered the idea of trying to both tell an engaging labyrinthian story and keep your audience laughing its a pretty tough ask because leaning too far into either element can come at the expense of the other and so it is with argyll matthew vaughn made something fairly special when he did kingsman which was both funny and interesting with all the spy movie bells and whistles youd expect argylle exists in somewhat the same universe at least according to a midcredits sequence it does which if true makes for some serious continuity errors the film itself feels like matt vaughn trying to recapture the kingsman magic by doing a similar thing again but while kingsman had a plot that was easy enough to follow argylle is all over the place its so twist happy and desperate to pull the rug out from under you that the surprise reveals just become tedious like theyre thrown in when the action is getting stale a lot of them make no sense if you actually stop to think about them and its so packed full of spy and action film cliches including some of my most hated in movies that any appeal it has wears think by the end an ending which comes about 20 minutes after it should by the way the soundtrack feels wildly out of place the cgi is bad and while the leads have good chemistry i never bought them as a couple the script lacks jokes and the storyline lacks consistency but if youre just going to the cinema to enjoy bright colours over the top action sequences and attractive people in expensive clothes then argylle definitely has you covered
Feb 3 2024,positive,this movie was so fun dont think to hard just enjoy the humor our 19 year old loved it and is seeing it again with friends our older parents loved it and laughed out loud simple and fun just a good time out would recommend to those who just want some laughs and dont want to overanalyze a movie but just enjoy some fairly clean fun
Feb 3 2024,positive,so much fun would give it 10 stars plan to see it again silly story yes but better than most movies that take themselves seriously 
Feb 3 2024,positive,i have a basic criteria   if i can be entertained for a few hours im happy and this movie was entertaining
Feb 3 2024,positive,all in all it was a fun movie would recommend it if you like actioncomedy
Feb 3 2024,positive,we loved it the action sequences are over the top but thats the point   the cast was amazing best movie we have seen in a while
Feb 3 2024,positive,not sure why critics have a problem with this  its just a fun thing
Feb 3 2024,positive,some scenes where just too long and goofy
Feb 3 2024,positive,there are very few new movies nowadays that after i finish watching i want to watch again but since the movie ended i cant stop thinking about it it was so good
Feb 3 2024,negative,sam was terrific and his normal character db howard was fun to watch however the film kept falling flat to me no question although on the screen for a combined 5 minutes both dua lipa and ariana debose totally cannot act and ruined the flow the moment they go on screen why are producers hiring these two way too long at 2 hours 20 minutes but the fighting scenes were inventive and protected the stunt performers very matthew v so you have to be a hard core fan of his cinematic style
Feb 3 2024,positive,i liked it parts of the movie were throwbacks to 60s style espionage flicks like our man flint which i think threw some reviewers off but i enjoyed it
Feb 3 2024,positive,super fun movie  lots of action comedy and plot twists
Feb 3 2024,positive,i took the kids and we all really enjoyed it of course it is ridiculous but in a good way the fight scenes as either screwball comedy or musical numbers were a different twist on the usual and speaking of twists the lurching of the plot was not subtle but it was entertaining as ever sam rockwell made me laugh a lot there is a fair old gap between the drubbing it has been given by the critics and what audiences say about it so hopefully it will get some word of mouth and we get to see some further adventures of agent argylle i for one will be tuning in
Feb 3 2024,negative,the story was a mess sam rockwell is a great actor though
Feb 3 2024,negative,wish i could have that time back feel sorry for the usually brilliant actors who said yes to this thing dont bother with this one
Feb 3 2024,negative,argylle pretends to have as firm a grasp on the spy genre as its protagonist but lets the cat out of the bag due to an unwieldy screenplay and undisciplined action
Feb 3 2024,negative,mrs recommended to go to the cinemas to watch this movie as it had a good cast didnt review the movie beforehand or knew what the synopsis was what a mistake horrific car crash of a movie i have never contemplated leaving the cinema early because of the movie being soo poor this was the first if it was to be a comedy it was not funny at all only stupid the type of people that would enjoy this type of movie is the type of people that find fart jokes funny one word aweful
Feb 3 2024,positive,this is a very silly romp with some unexpected ridiculous sequences plenty of laughs and an ending that will leave you oo    im not sure its good i could have done without all the extraneous cgi effects and more practical effects     i still had a great time at the theater and would watch a sequel
Feb 3 2024,positive,i found it entertaining with good action scenes it had my attention for most of it but the last 2030 minutes probably hurt this films potential bryces charms carried it to the finish line though
Feb 3 2024,positive,the film has a very good cast however the story get quite hard to follow towards the last 40 minutes and has many plot twists and somewhat ruins the film however the camera angles and shots taken are pretty good could be improved and audio is excellent but overall harder to follow towards the end
Feb 3 2024,positive,ignore the critics thoroughly enjoyed this movie lots of different characters confusing and surprising plot twists worth the money
Feb 3 2024,negative,im up for most anything that features a cat however this quickly devolved into sheer ridiculousness about 12 way through we had to hold our heads and say what the hell is even happening right now not to give the awfulness away for others who might have the time to waste but there was ice skating on oil and shooting while dancing amidst heartshaped gas i do wish i could have the time and money i spent back to do literally anything else that said i did liked the main actress and hope this movie doesnt sully her career enough that she cant get better roles in the future
Feb 3 2024,positive,it was an enjoyable movie overall and im not sure why the critical response has been so meh did it need some editing to get rid of some of the tooridiculous aspects fighting dance scene im looking at you yes was there too much going on in the third act absolutely yes would it have been nice if the stakes had been been more complex than what was in the silver bullet sure but it embraces the craziness of its own premise in ways that are fun its a tongueincheek love letter to the spy film genre that is willing to skewer that genre and laugh at itself while doing so it never claims to be cinema or an oscar contender but its goofy fun and there should be a place for that in the movies
Feb 3 2024,positive,movie starts good looses steam about a hour in lead actress was fine until they dressed her up and died her hair she looked bad and i think she gained weight i mean a lot of weight through the movie so my recommendation is go to the gym not this movie
Feb 3 2024,positive,it was a fun spin on the spot thriller
Feb 3 2024,negative,ive never before taken the time to review a movie  but this was soooo bad that i felt a moral responsibility to warn others off    i love apples products and have been a devoted user for more than 30 years and i cant help but imagine that if steve jobs were still alive this never would have been made  at least not like this    i love sam rockwell too  and expected him to have free reign to improvise and express his endearing nonsensical style of humor  for which there were plenty of opportunities     but he seemed constrained at least i hope that was it by the incredulity of not so much the plot that could have worked but the directing and the nauseating creative danceshootout scene near the end     id comment too on the end but frankly i walked out  something i cant recall ever having done in a 50 years of moviegoing     so please unless youre taking someone you simply hate or need a good purgative dont go
Feb 3 2024,positive,a fine experience vaughn is the saving grace of this film keeping the spirit alive with his camera movement and action style through some slow and straight up badly written scenes and sequences
Feb 3 2024,positive,matthew vaughn manages to drag a mediocre to at times pretty bad script over the line making it at most a decent time at the cinema some creative action sequences are slightly hindered by some strange cgi and editing but the intent is still there the story drags unnecessarily and leaves you lingering in weird slow pockets too often in between some pretty decent stretches which made it slightly frustrating to get through by the end but it does enough with its important beats to remain interesting and fun enough til the end credits
Feb 3 2024,positive,such a fun and light movie no blood sex or vulgar cursing it renews that faith that movies are means to escape life too many have forgotten what it is like to just be entertained thats what this movie does entertain
Feb 3 2024,positive,fun family movie  rockwell is awesome as usual  my kids loved this movie
Feb 3 2024,positive,a campy hilarious kooky entertaining spy flick that pays homage to spy films that came before this movie is perfectly aware of how ridiculous and fun it is and im a big fan sequel please
Feb 3 2024,negative,walked out halfway through
Feb 3 2024,negative,very creative concept   overthetop action

Feb 3 2024,positive,great action and the movie keeps you guessing throughout well put together a lot better than i expected
Feb 3 2024,positive,this is a fun clever whirlwind of a film very enjoyable beautifully filmed creative and lots of laughs twists and turns
Feb 3 2024,positive,great light entertainment with lots of off the wall action i liked the chemistry between dallas bruce howard and sam rockwell and the interesting plot twists throughout bryan cranston and catherine ohara played their villain rolls well this is a movie you cant really take seriously reminds me of some of the no way action scenes from mission impossible films there will be haters for this movie but for me it was great and was pretty much what i expected from watching previews
Feb 3 2024,positive,great movie and the cast is excellent few cheesy parts but the end credit scene ties it all together so good
Feb 3 2024,positive,great spy thriller with amazing color intrigue and funny as hell
Feb 3 2024,positive,it was a good movie but certain comedic bits were way too drawn out would be a great movie if they shaved the time down
Feb 3 2024,positive,its def a must see my mom and i couldnt sit still in our seats while watching you will not want to miss a single second of it lighthearted at times and action packed for most you and your family will not want to miss it
Feb 3 2024,positive,its the type of movie i really enjoy  funny imaginative top flight cast crazy story lots of action and overall pretty ridiculous in a good way clearly inspired by the long  kiss goodnight confessions of a dangerous mind romancing the stone and the avengers tv series  i didnt like all the carnage but though plentiful not gory  45 skates out of 5
Feb 3 2024,positive,it was a good movie a lot of action and it kept you trying to figure out who was the bad and good guys entertaining it could have been better with maybe different actors
Feb 3 2024,positive,great cast  a bit cheesy now and then but overall an enjoyable movie  howard rocks
Feb 3 2024,positive,a bit too corny in parts gave us a few laughs
Feb 3 2024,positive,not sure what the critics who disliked this movie were missing  obviously made to entertain it worked on this level with good performances by all several twists that worked including how a novelist could predict future effort events an unspoken body positive message and a crowd pleasing ending  perfect  of course not  good for what is was trying to accomplish  you bet
Feb 3 2024,negative,the first half was pretty good the second half got stupid and silly with a huge dancing while shooting scene with multi colored smoke all over the place ridiculous it was just like the nutty scene in kingsman it ruins the whole movie at that point too bad
Feb 3 2024,positive,this movie has an amazing cast the action is so insane the mystery is all over the place
Feb 3 2024,positive,if you liked kingsman the secret service youll love this one typical matthew vaughn over the top nonstop action and at times i was laughing so hard i was crying the plot of the movie has more twists and turns than 40 miles of bad road  the big fight scenes were like the church scene from kingsman  on steroids  fun fun movie
Feb 3 2024,negative,wasted potential some comedy pieces were needless slapstick this was overall goofy not in a good way
Feb 3 2024,positive,seeing this movie was a lastminute decision if it wasnt time and place i wouldnt have gone out of my way to see it i am glad i did it was nothing but a good time even though i got a bit confused about the plot at certain points the action was nicely placed without being overly done and the comedic timing was great i had fun but wouldnt needwant to see it again i would want to watch the sequel
Feb 3 2024,negative,i was so excited to see this movie because of the star cast and was extremely disappointed to see the execution terrible dialogues slow paced and zero excitement  what happened to the actors looked weird in his outfit and the lead actress looks so different from jurassic park nothing was gripping we had  to leave the movie after an hour
Feb 3 2024,positive,it took many unexpected turns i loved it action romance mystery  everything
Feb 3 2024,positive,loved the campy action scenes  loved that the movie took place all over the world   super entertaining
Feb 3 2024,positive,mindless entertainment is a must after a busy week for anyone this movie delivers that  haters are gonna hate but id say the movie was worthwhile entertaining and fun  lets not expect william shakespeare when we paid for a ticket to disney go enjoy and ignore the hate
Feb 3 2024,negative,an action movie where the lead actress looks like the only running shes done in the past year is for a stanley cup in target bryce dallas howard is not an actress in the slightest so seeing her leading an action blockbuster feels wrong and is certainly due to rampant nepotism in hollywood and not much else this movie concept had potential  a wild comedy spy thiller but was weighed down with a script that didnt make any sense and below average performances from walmart owen wilson samuel l jackson and others there were some fun moments and scenes littered throughout and the director had a clear vision but the execution was lacking and it was moreso trying to seem clever than actually being witty or funny basic shlock but i imagine some will come away from this being entertained particularly cat ladys
Feb 3 2024,neutral,the last 30 minutes was so bad really hard to sit through good twist towards the end then it just got stupid
Feb 3 2024,positive,perfect valentines date night moviepure movie joyignore the joyless criticsgo and see for joy and laughs brilliant vaughan psychedelic action vaughan and rockwell should do more together rob delaney sam jackson cranston o hara  genius   go see it it will make you smile
Feb 3 2024,positive,fun adventure and an interesting script  i enjoyed the movie a lot and had fun   bombs and explosions but not heavy made me enjoy and have a great time
Feb 3 2024,positive,a just plain fun movie james bond ala blazing saddles
Feb 3 2024,negative,too much makebelieve  acting was soso
Feb 3 2024,positive,harry potter meets james bond brilliant
Feb 3 2024,negative,the acting and direction was weirdly off from the very first scene and i couldnt stomach it and trust me i love all kinds of comedy and slapstick stuff and all but i dont know what was wrong with this one it was so bad from the very beginning that i had to leave the theater halfway sorry the comedy was not natural and seemed forced and cliched the cgi scenes seems so fake that you can easily spot and wonder how ridiculous it is to be so amateurish at a budget like this and the starcast  i am in 30s and this is the first time in my life i left the movie theatre halfway
Feb 3 2024,negative,shouldve saved the money
Feb 3 2024,positive,it was worth seeing but went off the rails towards the end
Feb 3 2024,positive,the plot twists were good but too long
Feb 3 2024,positive,love love love   great action music love psychedelic hearts  love the action scene with the coloured gas its brilliant   sam rockwell steals the movie   amazing   ignore the joyless critics go see   its pure joy 
Feb 3 2024,positive,my grandson and i viewed argylle last night and we really enjoyed it fun movie with absurdity that is expected in mvs films which i find endearing true fans of the kingsman will enjoy this yeah mv packed a lot in hear and i think it was intentional to keep people thinking
Feb 3 2024,positive,a quirky funny action movie lots of twists and turns takes you a few minutes into the film to begin the understand the story a good break from other predictable movies
Feb 3 2024,negative,one of the most  awful movies ive ever watched
Feb 3 2024,positive,great entertainment  fun to watch
Feb 3 2024,positive,hilarious the acting was well done loved all the twists and unexpected turns
Feb 3 2024,neutral,i cannot in good conscience recommend this movie first half was good overthetop cheesy at some points but matched the storyline make no mistake the actors did great and were perfect picks     ooooooh but the storlyline in the second half either the writers and directors silent quit or they got their jobs outsourced to chatgpt trite and lacking soul and unnecessarily long runtime
Feb 3 2024,positive,one of the best fun movies this year great sound track especially electric energy lots of twist and turns and plenty of action packed fun movies should also be entertaining and fun not just serious  loved it
Feb 3 2024,positive,wish it was 25 mins shorter otherwise it was over the top fun and a good escape for 25 hrs
Feb 3 2024,positive,i dont know why critics are piling on the hate all i can think is they missed the part this is clearly a comedy had a blast watching it the show was hilarious and entertaining people have seemed to have lost their ability to just enjoy things and have 
Feb 3 2024,positive,absolutely loved the thrilling adventure in argylle with my entire family the cinema echoed with laughter adding an extra layer of joy to this actionpacked masterpiece eagerly anticipating a sequel to this fantastic film the captivating plot and stellar cast make it a mustwatch for audiences of all ages two enthusiastic thumbs up
Feb 3 2024,positive,sam rockwell and bryce fantastic  but efforts wasted intelligent screenplay but very unentertaining and tiring movie  very easily over half hour overweight  yet story actors worth a sequel
Feb 3 2024,positive,great movie started to drag a little at the end but overall really entertaining and funny
Feb 3 2024,positive,it was laugh out loud exciting  i plan to watch it again
Feb 3 2024,positive,this movie was escapism with some twists it was totally making fun of itself the whole time people were laughing out loud in the theater me too critics are too uptight for this one i guess its a parody loved the casting very creative again making fun of traditional casting  all makes you think while laughing and thats hard to do
Feb 3 2024,negative,it was a waste of time
Feb 3 2024,negative,the trailer is as deceptive as the confused mess of a story line buried somewhere in this movie i went to the cinema to watch this and left confused and disappointed theres glimpses of a good action movie at times with occasional well choreographed fight scenes but unfortunately the excessive use of horribly implemented cgi ruins any enjoyment seriously the cgi in this movie is so bad it would make the average youtuber embarrassed to use it save your money and watch this when it makes its way to apple
Feb 3 2024,positive,im not one who likes scary shoot em up movies so the idea of it being a spy moviecomedy was intriguing this movie is so fun and keeps you guessing the whole time i loved the cast and all the surprises my 13 year old daughter really liked it too
Feb 3 2024,negative,just so dumb and frankly boring
Feb 3 2024,positive,me and my couple friends saw the movie argylle this was my first movie viewing of 2024 at the movie theater i had the best time seeing it with them i loved the trailer so did ben and all three of us decided to go his girlfriend included here is my initial thoughts coming out of the theater with ben himself aka swegzy i will be making a full spoiler review coming out next week our rating is a 910 i loved the action that matthew vaughn puts in the film the cast is stacked and the music is great as well composed by lorne balfe
Feb 3 2024,negative,just not good so overdone story even if its trying to be about a book vs real life hard to follow
Feb 3 2024,positive,it was very funny kind of silly but fun to watch and kept your attention
Feb 3 2024,positive,im surprised by the negative reviews i quite enjoyed argylle is it particularly original not really but i had great fun with it rockwell  howard make a nice couple the action scenes are fun and there are some interesting twists in the story     ive seen a million worse films and this is well worth a watch
Feb 3 2024,negative,a few different times i noticed how bad the makeup was yes that is when you know a movie is terrible i could go on to criticize more but im not wasting another key stroke on this movie  even for the period at the end of this sentence
Feb 3 2024,negative,unfortunately this movie was a huge disappointment and when i say huge i mean colossal this from the guys that wrote the kingsman personally i think they miss cast the lead role with bryce sam was actually great but there was zero story for him to sell hard to believe it had everything going for it and it was so poorly written and directed it was a complete boremy husband the action junky actually fell asleepsave your money
Feb 3 2024,positive,we really enjoyed it  loved the plot twists
Feb 3 2024,positive,i read the critics reviews prior to seeing argyle and not every movie has to be an oscar contender for movie of the year nothing wrong with that im not sure why all these critics expect every movie to be an instant classic     argyle was fun different entertaining and worth the price of admission not the type of film thats going to change your life but as a workaholic as is my wife it offered an enjoyable two and a half hour break from reality
Feb 3 2024,neutral,entertaining but also vacuous at times with little humour or charm  the plot was standard spy shlock but went on far too long with obvious plot twists and nothing aweinspiring  the overall style was good and it was never boring but the visual set pieces were too little too late and the music didnt suit those scenes at all  the fight scenes were ok and the acting and cast of characters were good but the cgi looked cheap
Feb 3 2024,positive,i really enjoyed it and was smiling the whole way through and left feeling good
Feb 3 2024,positive,its not kingsmanlevel great but it does have that fun spy action dna from matthew vaughn and i had quite a bit of fun watching
Feb 3 2024,positive,fun popcorn movie yea its a bit silly and over the top but still a fun ride 
Feb 3 2024,positive,its a very good movie very fun and very entertaining i really miss this style of movie thank you to the director and actors everyone did a great job  ps i want kingman and argyll to be in the same universe wait and see
Feb 3 2024,positive,i was so very happy that i decided to go see argyle   argyle was fun  it was fantastical  yes the plot had never ending twists and turns  the cast was amazing  bottom line argyle was a blast to watch i needed argyle an awesome roller coaster ride of escapist fantasy
Feb 3 2024,positive,incredible film funny  crazy wacky genius cant wait to go see it again
Feb 3 2024,negative,the movie was kind of a mess samuel can do better than that he doesnt need to be in films like this one and dua lipa was barely in it but you could only see from that alone that she needs desperately acting lessons looked like she was reading her lines from a giant cue card
Feb 3 2024,positive,the first half part is very funny and attractive the second one lost something a became a different movie in the complex id raccomend the movie
Feb 3 2024,negative,the movie is a scam apple commercial gimmicky and poor animation    scam  this move is a scam because all the commercials and facebook ads show dua lipa dua lipa is in this move at the very beginning for like 2 min if you blink youll miss it they make it seem like dua lipa is a main character her level of action was not in line with the rest of the movie which was odd i feel like 2 directors did the move they make it seem like dua lipa is in the whole move its not fair    apple commercial gimmick  a lot of the angle of the shots with the zoom apple signatur and especially the scene with the colored smoke  it all looked like an apple commercial the product placement was there too but i enjoyed the style    poor animation  as a father of 2 cats the cat animation was a joke and took away from the movie also they treated the cat poorly animation was trash especially the cat attack scene    worst move i have watched to the point that it was fun to watch because of the different levels of bad it was high budget but so clear the flaws the move felt very synthetic
Feb 3 2024,negative,2 hours and 19 minutes that ill never get back oh my god was it bad  this movie is made for people that are entertained by pretty colors and loud noises and not much else its dumbed down for a reason because they know the audience theyre going for   my girlfriend dragged me to the movie and when we were walking out she apologized for picking such an awful movie she even said she couldnt believe how bad it was
Feb 3 2024,positive,very entertaining well acted some great action scenes clever plot twists  some very creative funny scenes too  interesting  light hearted but enough bad guy stuff too
Feb 3 2024,positive,it was fun light hearted enjoyed it
Feb 3 2024,positive,i thought this was a fun movie with a great sense of humor
Feb 3 2024,positive,i loved it so much fun and great soundtrack
Feb 3 2024,positive,its a super fun and refreshing movie entertaining and trippy
Feb 3 2024,positive,movie couldve been much better if written by a better writer acting was well done especially by rockwell too many things dont make sense and movie was drawn out way too long
Feb 3 2024,positive,its a silly satirical spy movie just like any other spy movie but they go all the way    just fun ow and nice fight scene
Feb 3 2024,neutral,didnt really expect much for this movie the 2 main characters have decent chemistry with their screen time sam rockwell kind of carried the film on his back tbh however the movie was a gettin a bit boring in the last half and lost my attention throughout it
Feb 3 2024,positive,argyle was a roller coaster ride of great plot and twists catherine ohara was a revelation and she should be in more movies
Feb 3 2024,positive,when it comes to argylle im of two minds on the movie for most of the movie i couldnt tell if was plainly one of the worst movies ive seen in a long time or just dumb fun my verdict     argylle is a very very goofy but undoubtedly fun film what can i say its dumb but i kinda liked it  its a celebration and sendup of the spy genre but taking things to overthetop extremes  its excess is its biggest asset and also its biggest liability as a certified kingsman fan i had some hope for argylle was it fun at times sure was it also convoluted and sluggish absolutely it lacked the charm of your usual vaughn film  frankly everything i loved about vaughns style seemed to either be missing or just feel lifeless and hollow here for instance the action looks like what we have come to expect from vaughn but has none of the stakes intensity or emotion instead we get a tonal mess where i wasnt sure whether i was supposed to take the movie seriously or not it just felt like a lot of wasted talent at times argylle is fascinating because its a decent movie wearing about four other movies worth of baggage theres a super fun energetic scene followed by a huge lull a great twist followed by a long exposition etc it felt both overproduced and undercooked at the same time wildly uneven much too long but still enjoyable enough it worked for me despite not being fantastic it fits in alongside forgettable streaming films like red notice ghosted and the gray man even down to its bland visuals but this is certainly the most entertaining of the bunch at least for me basically  if you liked the trailer you should have fun if you thought it looked too goofy youll think the movie is too goofy for most as much as i love the theatrical experience this movie will work better once on streaming unfortunately it really is what youd expect from a matthew vaughn streaming movie    to end on a positive note i know this is technically a bad movie but i liked it to some extent so here is my unapologetic final thoughts on argylle    argylle is a film thats both dumb and smart at the same time its pure silly spy shenanigans but also has some deceptively smart subtext about the writersprocess its vibrant playful humorous sexy and ridiculously entertaining it is a super fun slick subversive action romp never taking itself seriously its fantastic cast absolutely let loose loved sam rockwell there are so many twists and turns most of which are somewhat predictable but still managed to be fun i just wish the reveal of who the real agent argylle is wasnt spoiled for me by a 3yearold tweet announcing the production of the movie    so did i like it yes did i think it was terrible and really dumb at times also yes  sorry guess im not much help for this one    oh also can matthew vaughn please make kingsman 3 already
Feb 3 2024,positive,a great romp  entirely in keeping with matthew vaughans previous work this movie should not be taken seriously it certainly doesnt take itself seriously its outlandish  ridiculous and just straight out great fun
Feb 3 2024,positive,its ridiculous but in a fun and awesome way
Feb 3 2024,positive,lots of fun action sequences it was a movie like none i had seen before and so surprised me in a lot of ways although i could guess what might happen in some parts there were other parts that had a unique twist throughout the first half hour i was saying to myself i love this movie  then i told myself to stop and just enjoy it so i did
Feb 3 2024,negative,this movie goes out of its way to ruin a fairly interesting premise
Feb 3 2024,negative,great cast wasted  started out cool then it went silly then it went off the rails  not good meh not rewatchable in my lifetime unless i get amnesia
Feb 3 2024,negative,the definition of cheese genuinely the worst move i have ever seen overrun with plot armor and marry sewage a self insert to rival the gods the action scenes are so garbage the entire theater booed save your money for something better like cats

Feb 3 2024,positive,fun movie great plot twists
Feb 3 2024,positive,i dont usually like these types of comedies but i really liked this movie and yes  its not realistic its just good fun sometimes its nice to step into a theater and forget about the real world for 2 hours love the cat 
Feb 3 2024,neutral,the premise had promise but the execution was disappointing the spirit of jokes were better than the writing delivery and timing of them the cat was wasted on lame moments bullet train also a spy spoof did so much better for much less money i really wanted to like this movie but walked out seriously let down and let me just say i have always liked bryce dallas howard but watching her as elly was like watching a jardiance commercial
Feb 3 2024,positive,fantastic movie with a good story line and twists beautiful vfx
Feb 3 2024,positive,wonderfully funny and great action sequences i loved it i chuckled all the way through it
Feb 3 2024,positive,loud silly and a bit dumb but very aware of itself and very fun dont take it seriously and youll have a good time

Feb 3 2024,positive,a must see  loved it
Feb 3 2024,positive,this movie played on the tropes of all the spy movies without taking itself too seriously the twists were very unexpected but to be expected at the same time so that was a fun journey definitely recommend this movie especially the action scenes towards the end loved those
Feb 3 2024,positive,it does not take it self seriusly  it is a good fun movie cant wait to read the book and se movie number 2
Feb 3 2024,negative,the biggest waste of money in my life
Feb 3 2024,positive,expected a sophisticated thriller with a story of intrigue  instead this movie was cartoonish predictable and ultimately silly  not great disappointed
Feb 3 2024,positive,it had the coolest twist funny as heck great storyline the movie was fantastic as long as you dont take it too serious if you take it serious then you will be disappointed
Feb 3 2024,positive,absolute must see very creative and has you on the edge of your seat lately movies havent lived up to expectations but this one exceeded its own lots of twists and turns you wont expect the directors did a great job and the acting even had me second guessing if it was just the part theyre playing or if theyre that good
Feb 3 2024,positive,fun date movie kept my wife and i cracking up
Feb 3 2024,negative,the movie had a great plot it just turned into a hot mess wait for it to stream for free
Feb 3 2024,positive,this is a good entertaining movie that doesnt take itself too seriously i liked it
Feb 3 2024,negative,it was really a rough movie to watch the main character was annoying the cat never looked real and the amount of plot twists was absolutely unreasonable it felt useless and bizarre not something i would want to watch again in fact wish i hadnt watched it at all
Feb 3 2024,negative,this is the worst movie i have seen in recent memory besides the perpetual writer masturbation dallas whomever brings down every scene she is in like an area effect she made her supporting actors perform worse by her presence     lets not spend all day talking about the absurd length it is obscene that you can tell so little story in25 hours    this movie deserves every razzy for every category in addition to several honoraries this year and in perpetuity until i get this angry at another movie again    the assman
Feb 3 2024,positive,its 30 spoof 30 comedy 30 outrageous action scenes 10 spy thriller it makes this clear from the outset i loved it but if you were expecting a different movie cocktail you could hate it
Feb 3 2024,positive,saw it tonight and found it original and entertaining just the right amount of cheesyness for me
Feb 3 2024,positive,entertaining and clever
Feb 3 2024,positive,this movie is hilarious from beginning to end with great performances from bryce dallas howard and as always  sam rockwell  people seem not to understand that so many elements of it are parody  its bonkers in the best way and made me laugh so hard i had tears running down my face two separate times  cant remember the last time i had this much fun at a movie
Feb 3 2024,negative,starts off great then gradually gets dumber and dumber i left the theatre 34 of the way through
Feb 3 2024,positive,action romance funny
Feb 3 2024,negative,horrendous i want the 212 hours of my life back that this movie stole from me it was like shards of glass in my eyes for 212 hours absolute waste of time couldnt wait till it ended 30 minutes in negative 5 stars
Feb 3 2024,positive,lots of twists and good fun
Feb 3 2024,positive,amazing movie hilarious great plot loved the characters watch it
Feb 3 2024,positive,this was a fun entertaining movie
Feb 3 2024,positive,it was decent but full of twists and turns and trying to be overly comedic just like the kingsman movies it was decent
Feb 3 2024,positive,starting out as a wellcast blend of a spy spoof and stranger than fiction but not having enough ideas of its own to stand strong against its exhaustive length argylle is a knowinglysilly thriller with plenty of twists for those who dont demand much
Feb 3 2024,positive,so much fun people dont seem to realize this movie is meant to be ridiculous it did not have a solid plot line acting was okay but its satirical ludicrous and hysterical plot line was a blast
Feb 3 2024,negative,worst movie ever stupid and waste of time
Feb 3 2024,positive,this movie was so much fun  the cast is amazing
Feb 3 2024,negative,awful movie dont waste your money
Feb 3 2024,positive,plot started out strong then went downhill not recommend ed
Feb 3 2024,positive,its a really silly spy movie with a ton of twists and goofs its honestly such a treat to watch there are a lot of points where i thought all of my assumptions throughout the movie were wrong to the point that the twists got a bit difficult to keep track of hence a slight loss of score for me otherwise it was a blast great music choices too if you watch this movie go into it with a mindset of spaceballs rather than star wars
Feb 3 2024,positive,keep an open mind and sit back and enjoy the humor and absurdity of some of the scenes very funny
Feb 3 2024,positive,very good movie we are sure to see a second one
Feb 3 2024,positive,i laughed from the beginning to end there were a few corny scenes but thats what made it funny it had action and at the end there was a twist id see it again
Feb 3 2024,positive,clever funny dialogue good story
Feb 3 2024,negative,one of the worst movies ive ever seen
Feb 3 2024,positive,very cute and entertaining
Feb 3 2024,negative,not gonna lie not good characters not believable  acting not great at times the movie made fun of itself albeit appropriately because it was laughable would not recommend
Feb 3 2024,positive,i absolutely loved the movie it was hilarious plus i was clueless on how the ending was going to turn out  you really need a vivid imagination to get it
Feb 3 2024,negative,i liked the reclining seating of the theater the pretzel bites were a bit overdone the movie finally ended no idea what was intended perhaps the film was loaded out of order perhaps someone spiked the diet mountain dew these directors chose chaos
Feb 3 2024,positive,a fun movie watching experience exciting story lots of laughs and twists
Feb 3 2024,negative,seriously the worst movie i have ever seen inspired me to send in my first review ever on rotten tomatos
Feb 3 2024,positive,if the movies deadpool and john wick had a love child it would be named argylie    first good entertaining thing i have watched in 8 years
Feb 3 2024,positive,great entertaining silly action comedy and drama wrapped into 1 movie
Feb 3 2024,negative,fun idea for a movie done super cheesy kinda dumb over the top
Feb 3 2024,positive,movie kept us on the edge of our seats  lots of twists and turns and some bits of humor scattered throughout im looking forward to the sequel
Feb 3 2024,neutral,i think it was fun and a silly ending of sorts but then it never asked you to expect more of it during the movie  action was goodconcept was goodand unless you were expecting an oscar winner well worth the popcorn  if you liked the kingsmen films you would probably like this too
Feb 3 2024,positive,very good plot twists some graphics can be fake looking at times acting and storyline was good
Feb 3 2024,positive,one of the best spy  comedies ive seen in years like get smart and the kingsmen had a baby
Feb 3 2024,positive,the movie was not bad not good either but overall it was a goofy spy film that did have a good little twist at the end id watch it again
Feb 3 2024,positive,i was entertained and i enjoyed this the bad reviews almost kept me awayand you have to suspend believabilitybut its a movie not a life lesson enjoyable date night movie and i recommend it best dance fights ever
Feb 3 2024,positive,the cat in the backpack was hilarious some parts were silly interesting storyline
Feb 3 2024,negative,probably the worst movie ive ever seen in the theater
Feb 3 2024,positive,awesome movie absolutely loved it
Feb 3 2024,negative,overly long poorly written terrible chemistry between the leads neither howard or rockwell could sell spy regardless of the spoof nature of the film tonally all over the place and ultra budget cg round out a lame waste of 140 minutes
Feb 3 2024,positive,matthew vaughns best film yet and thats saying something this is what im assuming is vaughn at the height of his powers but i would happily be wrong because it feels like only he could convey all the information needed and still have it feel adventurous  fun
Feb 3 2024,positive,ehh its ok gets really goofy in some areas
Feb 3 2024,positive,it was fun    and funny    completely and appropriately overthetop    hope to see a sequel andor a crossover with kingsman    
Feb 3 2024,positive,it was so cheesy but sooo fun to watch all in all it was a great movie definitely recommend watching
Feb 3 2024,negative,this movie went from a 35 to a 2 or less during the final fight scene which was so absurd i went to the bathroom to happily missed the last 15 min of the film the first hour and a half was decent entertainment
Feb 3 2024,positive,it was unpredictable and nonstop lots of fun only not giving 5 stars because i was stressed about the cat
Feb 3 2024,negative,not funny not clever one of the most inane action sequences ever horrible movie
Feb 3 2024,positive,i thoroughly loved this flick dont believe the critics it was a fun action packed funny flick
Feb 3 2024,negative,this was not that good script and story were terrible i truly wander if this was a ai influencedgenerated script 
Feb 3 2024,positive,i saw the critics reviews for this and was hesitant to even go see it but got over that because of the big names in the movie i often disagree with the critics  i wasnt disappointed  it wasnt without its cheesy parts but it nonetheless was a very entertaining ride with a few great twists  sam rockwell stole the show to be honesti loved his character  all in all its far from a flawless movie and the runtime is on the longer end but if you realize its half comedy and half action youll enjoy it
Feb 3 2024,positive,definitely a good movie worth the money
Feb 3 2024,negative,not even kidding this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen i believe some of it was supposed to be so bad it was funny but its hard to tell what is what just wait til the last 20 minutes
Feb 3 2024,negative,worst movie ever  a fking scam  i wish i can give it a negaive 10 stars
Feb 3 2024,negative,i want my money back
Feb 3 2024,positive,totally awesome spy movie with lots of twists and turns
Feb 3 2024,negative,not worth the time or effort  what started out interesting turned into a weird musical with smoke bombs  absolutely horrible
Feb 3 2024,negative,i blame marketing on this it didnt show any of the crazier scenes just some cgified cat that led is to think its a comedy but with serious spy movies undertones but with romance but with who knows what else it ends up as a collaged mess of films weve seen before that are done much better once you see the smoke dancing scene youre free to leaveunless you want brain damage the rest of the film dont say i didnt warn you
Feb 3 2024,positive,great movie   all kinds of twists and turns until the very
Feb 3 2024,negative,i tried to enjoy this movieby the end of it i was just ready for it to be over
Feb 3 2024,positive,funny and different than classics action movies very good plot twist
Feb 3 2024,positive,actionpacked movie unbelievable story but still enjoyable we were in a 4dx theatre we loved the sensory stimulation not an oscar winner so that is why we never felt bored surprises in the scenario which are welcomed my husband and i loved our evening at the movies it is a no brainer sit back and watch
Feb 3 2024,negative,literally the worst movie i have ever seen in my entire life horrible acting crazy plot just stupid
Feb 3 2024,negative,its so cringey its funny
Feb 3 2024,positive,we really enjoyed this film and found it easy to follow the different venues needed to cover the action  fun interesting plot
Feb 3 2024,positive,i almost let poor ratings keep me from seeing this movie but im so glad i went anyway it was delightful highcamp fun it had a quirky premise outrageously original choreography stunning cinematography and excellent performances cranston  ohara were entertaining howard deftly handled a tricky role and rockwell was sublime all the haters seem to have failed to keep their tongues in cheek bc this movie was a fun ride with a multitude of laugh out loud scenes highly recommend
Feb 3 2024,negative,disappointment  after dua lipa made her short appearance the jumbled mess of  a movie went down hill   have to give credit to the ice skating scene though  was expecting more after seeing the kingsman movies
Feb 3 2024,positive,it was a touch too long but honestly it was what you expect just chaotic amusement matthew vaughn doing what he does sam rockwell doing what he does its kingsman on ice skates 
Feb 3 2024,positive,lot of action but too cheesey
Feb 3 2024,positive,lots of twists  turns loved it
Feb 3 2024,positive,great twist in this movie that i never saw coming
Feb 3 2024,positive,fun spycomedy film the dialogue editing and script couldve been tighter but i enjoyed it overall 
Feb 3 2024,positive,critics are dumb i dont think they understood what this movie was supposed to be this isnt a spy thriller its a mockucomedy its supposed to be silly and fun and it does that to a t  matt vaughn is a genius
Feb 3 2024,neutral,this movie is basically  a romcom disguised as a spy movie the movie wasnt bad but it was quite corny and cheesy at times
Feb 3 2024,positive,loved the plot twists and moral of the story
Feb 3 2024,positive,what a fun movie definitely the best romantic movie since romancing the stone
Feb 3 2024,neutral,shame good cast and good plot and twist  but just didnt do it for me
Feb 3 2024,negative,worst movie ever  first 15 minutes was bond like action however it absolutely fizzles out to pure nonsense  bryce dallas is unbelievable in her role as a spy character save your money
Feb 3 2024,positive,i thought it was funny with lots of action  music was good too  fun story line and i liked the characters  actors did a great job
Feb 3 2024,positive,ill edit this review slightly later to add more thoughts     nonetheless my review its not terrible its not bad i like this film slightly better overall than the beekeeper which wasnt that good yet passable entertainment this argylle film is slightly better entertainment may not really need a theatre viewing for most of the film yet there are some scenes that will just be better in theatre on a large screen so its a decent streaming film     i actually didnt feel the films runtime much however the theatre i was in was quite empty so i did from time to time look at instagram during some scenes that slowed down in pace which happened quite often there was sort of a subtle wave of that up and down pace the cat in the film isnt garfield its a cat doesnt do really anything however this isnt to say the story overall is boring     the writing isnt awesome yet sort of different in just how much it plays on twists and turns often a play unto the genre itself honestly these twists and turns that occurred often did at least bring my attention back to the film when it was getting dull which like i stated before the many waves of action intrigue dull twist action rinse and repeat the twists arent super stupefying but they keep the film chugging along and thats sort of what a one word term could be almost to describe this film a caboose     the film from the get go goes and technically can keep going on its wavey formula aforementioned obviously a prequel or something could also occur using the same wave formula the cgi though can be noticeable in terms of the people being in front of green screens yet this is that type of bad cgi which could be easily ignored if you sort of just ignore that fact notable fact the cgi explosions in this film are not as terrible as they are in the bee keeper and the expendables 4     overall it is sort of a ridiculous plot but ive seen and chosen to ignore watching films or media that are much worse if you go to the film to just see what its about and let the film unfold it may be better time its nothing astounding though its meant to be a fun time i think which is subjective anyway i dont really care to see more of this argylle universe meaning if it happens it happens but if it doesnt i dont care one bit yet i feel the same way about most media so when its original andor unique to a degree i dont mind watching a film sometime if its decently entertaining if a sequel or prequel or mixture of the two occurs or whatever i know what its formula will be likely so hopefully it is brought forth with original ideas and maintains a sense of fun and entertainment
Feb 3 2024,positive,it was entertaining but i thought it had a lot of gratutious violence and no chemistry between the two main characters
Feb 3 2024,negative,this movie was disjointed confusing contrived and just plain dumb skip it
Feb 3 2024,negative,idiotic awful script poorly acted deliberately and monotonously annoying characters pointless
Feb 3 2024,negative,storys convoluted to the point that its hard to follow let alone swallow
Feb 3 2024,positive,i like  this movie better than other films i have learned knowledge something from the movies and services that people are really good and thankful to see them again
Feb 3 2024,positive,in all honesty i liked it just enough to accept that the flaws does carry this movie a little from some parts that were okay while others doesnt  it was okay for this movie being its own spy movie when it isnt 007 or bourne but some of the action effects doesnt work well too much as some of the parts that the actors were having a good time especially the shoot out scene with the gas bombs which i thought it was both funny and entertaining  the acting ranges from okay to eh  the story does feel like a little messy with some of the editing and some of the writing but some parts like the plot twists were actually favorable and clever as this story goes on from start to finish  not a terrible movie but not great either  its an average movie that i can only recommend if youre a diehard spyaction fan  510
Feb 3 2024,positive,action and kept your attention
Feb 3 2024,negative,incredibly disappointing  i loved kickass and the first kingsmen  i love sam rockwell he deserves better  such a waste of a great cast  matthew vaughn has definitely lost his mojo  i cant remember so many people coming out of a screening shaking their heads and apologising to whoever theyd conviced to join them  its bad
Feb 3 2024,positive,it was an interesting story love the actions and the interpretation with some sort of fun   well put together
Feb 3 2024,positive,great music fast moving  reminded me of 007 bond movies and mission impossible flicks a little too long  but pretty cool and entertaining
Feb 3 2024,positive,you can see the threads of a great story but falls flat in the third act ironically they talk about copouts for writers but then use one themselves to get out of a plot hole bryce dallas howard shines and love the personality she brings but on a 200 million budget expected more
Feb 3 2024,positive,if you were looking for a james bond meets benny hill spy movie satire then walk do not run to your nearest theater plex for a wellcast movie whose talents may have been sacrificed for a paycheck the premise being that a female writer who specializes in spy novels is being pursued by foreign agents because her spy novels have been able to portend actual cataclysmic spy events their belief being that she has the ability to write of future clandestine fictional events which become reality and will ultimately lead to their demise or capture it is impossible to verbally describe much of the wildly imaginative spy dispatching anticks that have been well choreographed using all of the cgi technology available the reality being that the silliness of the entire movie becomes the most charming aspect of the film in the end who wins or who survives becomes irrelevant to waiting for the next slapstick or imaginatively creative method of dispatching some bad guy spies to the netherworld of fire and brimstone the creativity of the bondlike wildly adventurous opening of the film will set the tone for your next two hours of playful misadventures  rating s  c  b  f  silliness can be funny
Feb 3 2024,negative,this movie is an absolute atrocity  the casting was wrong the acting was cringeworthy and the storyline went along like a dog chasing a butterfly  save yourself some time and money by avoiding this one  not even samuel jackson can save it
Feb 3 2024,negative,really a shame how badly they botched the script they obviously put a lot of money into the production but the story was trash
Feb 3 2024,positive,pacing was off in the thrid act but it is so exuberant i let it slide
Feb 3 2024,negative,fartgylle a very boring watch
Feb 3 2024,positive,this was a really fun movie with an engaging story it was as believable as any other spy story and i have to wonder why critics seem to have a stick up something about it i look forward to watching it again when it comes out on a streaming platform
Feb 3 2024,negative,this movie was terrible  the plot was uninspired  there were so many goofy looking sequences  the cgi at the beginning chase was comical and phony looking  the directors style was too over the top  i can see the resemblance to kingsman but it didnt work here  the ending fight scenes with all the colored smoke and dance choreography were awful the skating on oil was preposterous  the worst thing was bryce dallas howard her acting is simple minded her voice is awful and she was way too fat  she was not believable in the part at all
Feb 3 2024,positive,it was very campy it was fun
Feb 3 2024,positive,best movie this year imo
Feb 3 2024,positive,it was a very fun spy movie not to be taken that serious throughly enjoyable
Feb 3 2024,positive,argyle a fun wacky movie just dont take it serious and youll have some fun
Feb 3 2024,positive,silly fun escapist and entertaining just what movies should be it is a tongue in cheek spoof of spy flicks with a plot twist that keeps you guessing if you want a serious action movie with a serious plot and lots of revenge killing see the beekeeper  if you want to see a dancing gun fight a hero cat and oil slick ice skating with knives then argylle is for you
Feb 3 2024,positive,great movie both action and comedy kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time
Feb 3 2024,negative,unbelievably predictable spy movie with great actors and terrible writing tried to copy the overthetop style of the kingsman movies and produced a sad facsimile
Feb 3 2024,negative,seriously i fell asleep
Feb 3 2024,positive,knew in advance what i was getting into going to see this movie and it delivered mightily on all counts a fun romping action comedy adventure with some amazing scenes and a great cast
Feb 3 2024,positive,lots of surprises in the movie  a few of the cgi scenes were a bit over the top the cgi cat was a bit creepy  there were some predictable moments bit dont let that stop you good for a fun escape for a few hours to live vicariously through spies
Feb 3 2024,negative,thank god for my cineworld subscription as if i had paid top dollar to see this tripe i would have been fuming  its beyond derivative its insulting     poor script runs out of steam 10 minutes in not even sam rockwell could save this  i can only surmise that this was devised during lockdown when people overindulged with drink and drugs there was no content and we set our bar low the story arc must have sounded hilarious over the dinner table eating cheese grapes and pinot noir    give it a miss if not dont say i didnt warn you
Feb 3 2024,positive,this is a fun and outrageous spy romp have a good time watching it and dont let the naysayers spoil it for you
Feb 3 2024,positive,silly brilliant and so so so funny the all cinema was dying laughing by the end also you dont want to miss the last scene i had such a great time
Feb 3 2024,positive,it had some interesting plot twists and turns in some places it was a bit silly
Feb 3 2024,positive,brilliant sam rockwell never disappoints loved every minute of it
Feb 3 2024,positive,another complete miss on the critics reviews they really are getting more out of touch with every movie they bomb  argyle is a great spy comedy film with plenty of twists some of which are actually unexpected  if you like films like austin powers or kingsman youll enjoy this film
Feb 3 2024,positive,dont listen to all the people that take life too seriously and give this a one star ill give it a five because it was original had a good story was ridiculously funny at parts and a lot of plot twists seriously i really dont understand people and their reviews sometimes i had a great time watching this movie and would watch it again if you want to be entertained and can suspend reality which by the way is why we go to movies then i highly recommend this film
Feb 2 2024,positive,very quirky  interesting mix of comedy moments and spy suspense
Feb 2 2024,negative,a cheesy mashup of the 1983 movie cloak and dagger and the 1993 movie the last action hero
Feb 2 2024,positive,great movie not what i expected lots of twist and surprises
Feb 2 2024,positive,i actually liked it alot sure it can be over the top some times i think it will boil down to either youll love it or youll hate it personally i belong to the first camp i recommend you go see it for yourself regardless of what critics say who knows you might end up in the loveitcategory as well
Feb 2 2024,neutral,a fun and creative idea that is surpassed by too many dance scenes and the dumbest ice skating scene ever despite its twists and turns it is overshadowed by trying to be too big but it was nice to see a normal sized actress on screen for a change versus a stick insect with a head
Feb 2 2024,negative,the trailer making this look like a good movie is definitely the biggest lie     the movie was a very typical and recycled spy story but had a fun introduction with sam being a cool action star however as the story progressed halfway through it was becoming overly silly with repetitive and predictable plot twists that only got more ridiculous till the very end of the movie which dragged on for way too long     majority of the actors in this movie were wasted and the action scenes from matthew vaughn were sadly laughable hardly many fight scenes and when they do appear its cartoony and far too silly to enjoy due to its overuse of cgi     honestly the only thing that peaked my interest was the after credits scene but even after watching the movie i would have to say this being matthew vaughns most downhill action spy flick makes me less enthusiastic on the future of his movies
Feb 2 2024,negative,movie should be scrapped because they think its funny to abuse kitty cat
Feb 2 2024,positive,music was bad story started out ok then got just hard to tolerate overweight main character and only good thing was sam rockwell
Feb 2 2024,positive,the story line was good but the action sequences were ridiculous near the end
Feb 2 2024,positive,i have never been more entertained  the critics consensus couldnt be more off base  if you liked kick ass and the kingsmen films you will love argylle  silly fun thats well paced and action packed  and has sam rockwell ever been anything but great in everything he does  and dallas bryce howard takes off her high heels when she needs to run   prove the critics wrong and get in file for argylle
Feb 2 2024,negative,a good premise but completely swung and missed it started well with a campy deliberately overdone bond movie idea with a couple of great twists then it went utterly downhill went on an hour too long threw in a couple of extra completely pointless and unnecessary twists and took the bizarre style choices into cringe definitely a rotten tomato
Feb 2 2024,positive,i like this movie it was good i enjoyed the comedic element to it mixed with good action sequences however i found some parts of the movie overthought and unnecessary so it made for some boring momentsalso at times the plot was confusing and hard to follow along so i had to be really focused to be able to understand the development but i loved the actors that played in the movie they did a great job it is definitely worth watching but i wouldnt watch it as often as other movies
Feb 2 2024,negative,ok at first then silly then dumb 
Feb 2 2024,positive,lol stupid from the camp fight scenes to the murderous cat who doesnt love an alfie
Feb 2 2024,positive,so many twists like every one of my favourite spy novels hilarious scenes that were genuinely laughing out loud just as funny on the second watch and so many great easter eggs
Feb 2 2024,positive,a fun movie with an all star cast it runs a little long so pee before it starts
Feb 2 2024,negative,very boring the script was terrible  the cast tried their best noting lands action and comedy dont hit their mark  the film felt like a drag
Feb 2 2024,positive,nowhere near perfection but a genuinely good time at the theater standout performances from the whole cast but especially the effervescent emmy winner catherine ohara who just oozes campy perfection also flowers for the magnificent soundtrack and original songs by boy george and supporting star oscar winner ariana debose
Feb 2 2024,negative,bad cgi and the cat was annoying
Feb 2 2024,negative,couldnt and didnt wait for this movie to end worst movie of the year so far
Feb 2 2024,negative,over stylized unfunny spy movie absent of any suspense or believability contain your curiosity and wait for streaming 
Feb 2 2024,positive,chaotic and entertaining over abundance of plot twists but really fun and playfully over the top
Feb 2 2024,positive,a little silly id call it a girls action movie i really like sam rockwell so that was worthwhile 
Feb 2 2024,positive,good stor with twists  also funny  fast two hours
Feb 2 2024,positive,as you can see i gave this movie 5stars and i believe it deserves it if you go into this movie thinking you are going to see a serious heavy duty mature spy film then shame on you i can only imagine that must be the people who are hating on this movie this is clearly a spoof film with a great cast having fun making an entertaining movie     there were many lol scenes and plenty of eye candy in the special effects i totally enjoyed it and had no problem with the extra length     just go and have fun
Feb 2 2024,positive,i very much enjoyed this movie the cast is great there was also some great humor and great action scenes i also loved all the twists and turns
Feb 2 2024,positive,this is that kind of movie when you just sit down and turn off your brain
Feb 2 2024,negative,probably in the top 10 worst movies ive ever seen the acting started off terrible but it was meant to be but then it just stayed terrible for the entire movie it was way too long and way too boring it wasnt even funny the concept was okay but the execution was not it
Feb 2 2024,positive,it is a silly and fun spy caper  suspend your disbelief and enjoy this great cast tell a fun story
Feb 2 2024,negative,it just dragged after a while kept wondering when it was going to end
Feb 2 2024,positive,best movie ever lots of plot twists funny campy thoroughly enjoyed it
Feb 2 2024,negative,the movie had a decent start but got worse the longer youd watch it they really put too much effort for it to become really cringe the blink scene ended me  dont watch this unless you want to burst out laughing from how bad it is the actors are cool tho
Feb 2 2024,negative,the movie is too long and the build up to the plot twist was horrendous this movie is extremely cheesy and a very hard watch do not recommend the only redeeming factor was the plot twist had potential but then it went downhill very quickly after that
Feb 2 2024,positive,different twist very entertaining
Feb 2 2024,positive,this movie was so funny over the top in many places but i enjoyed every moment we laughed and gasped at the twists my family enjoyed the whole thing i kinda wanna go see it again it gave me everything and more than i expected from the trailers
Feb 2 2024,positive,super fun movie a breath of fresh air
Feb 2 2024,negative,i have walked out of three movies moulinrouge avatar2 and now argyle
Feb 2 2024,positive,fun and entertaining excellent fight choreography and for once a female action hero who goes through an arc isnt an instant mary sue and is believable shows that with good writing female action stars can be believable  you have to remember that at times we see things through the fictionalised eyes of our heroine  some reviewers have missed that point when reviewing the latter third  it is about 20mins too long
Feb 2 2024,negative,worst movie i have seen in years  simply awful  save your money
Feb 2 2024,positive,too long  kept thinking it was over and then something else happened
Feb 2 2024,negative,terrible movie we left theater halfway through too hard to understand couldnt make sense of it disappointed
Feb 2 2024,negative,possibly the worst movie i have had the misfortune of watching in the past 3 years utterly absurd  astonishingly dire would be putting it mildly the acting is terrible and the whole movie is an utter mess from beginning to end the idea behind the movie was pretty good but the execution was far from accomplished the special effects were tacky at best and laughable at worst do not waste your money going to see it and use the two hours of your life that you have saved doing something more interesting like cleaning the toilet
Feb 2 2024,positive,movie was fun its definitely over the top but its clear the characters know the premise is silly and the cast is great ignore the critics if a movie isnt oscar worthy they tend to give low marks     if you want to watch a fun movie without thinking too much this is the movie for you
Feb 2 2024,positive,fun silly and lots of twists   blazing saddles as a spy movie
Feb 2 2024,positive,i was not expecting much cuz of initial bad critical reviews i enjoted it
Feb 2 2024,positive,i dont get all the negative reviews as long as youre going to the theater to watch something fun and exciting and have the ability to suspend disbelief this was a great roller coaster ride that touches the absurd at times but still delivers in the end
Feb 2 2024,positive,had a great time watching this film delivered exactly what i was expecting a fun 2 hour film that made me laugh at its ridiculousness  will definitely watch again
Feb 2 2024,positive,it had a lot of humour and a surprising plot
Feb 2 2024,positive,it was fun sometimes  i found myself having to suspend disbelief and anything close to reality skating in crude oil with knives on shoes  really and the cgi was not strong especially in the oil skating scene    as silly as it was the scenes where they are shooting their way out with all the multicolored gas was really quite beautiful    i did enjoy some of the plot twists and the cast are really great catherine ohara was especially great  its a fun popcorn action flick but dont expect to leave the theater thinking about anything except maybe where to go have dinner
Feb 2 2024,positive,fun to watch a little slapstick
Feb 2 2024,positive,i loved this movie it was awesome other people are saying this movie sucked dont listen to them i recommend seeing it
Feb 2 2024,positive,absolutely enjoyed the hell out of it but then i write so maybe only those who write will enjoy the hell out of it
Feb 2 2024,positive,the first half is vastly better than the second which is a sea of missed opportunities ultimately though this film has been done before in total recall which was better in every way and had arnie
Feb 2 2024,negative,great cast and thats about it
Feb 2 2024,negative,wow that was really not good the trailer made it look like it could be a cute sort of update to the romancing the stone movies of the 80s it did not work the story was convoluted the over the top outlandish action sequences didnt work and i am sorry but bryce dallas howard was the wrong choice as the lead while she may have been believable as the shy writer the top assassin role didnt suit her the only bright spots were sam rockwell and samuel l jackson just because i like both this one will be out of theaters in a week
Feb 2 2024,positive,its an amazing movie and it was worth every minute of my time i enjoyed it so much it was so much fun definitely will watch it again
Feb 2 2024,positive,just a fun time over the top and lots of kitty featured  would definitely recommend seeing on the big screen
Feb 2 2024,positive,it was fun had a vibe of spykids meets the kingsman  good twists and action scenes a little silly at times but the 2 hours plus went quick
Feb 2 2024,positive,great movie although some of the comedy was either unnecessary or just not funny the action was great and there were so many twists that it really felt like a mystery movie
Feb 2 2024,negative,it wa spike they threw a bunch of ideas about spy movies into a  hat then whatever they pulled out they wrote into a  movie kinda fun but mostly dumb strange directorial choices too  like a high schooler made this film
Feb 2 2024,positive,intentionally cheesy i love cheese but its no parmesan or roquefort some very nice scenes not laugh out loud funny but raised a smile
Feb 2 2024,negative,i found the trailer to be misleading if i wasnt a fan of sam rockwell i wouldve probably left after the first 10 minutes
Feb 2 2024,positive,extremely entertaining my entire family love it
Feb 2 2024,negative,this movie started off great i was super entertained but i quickly started to dislike the movie because it had too many twists the movie lasted too long and i wanted to leave near the end the ending was horrible
Feb 2 2024,positive,laughed lots a nice experience would watch it again
Feb 2 2024,negative,a huge swing and miss here
Feb 2 2024,positive,it was a little confusing but a lot of fun
Feb 2 2024,positive,a very cute twist on the spyromance genre with a lot of over the top cartoonish action enjoyable for a onetime watch with a few laughsoutloud moments but left me looking at my watch during several stretches
Feb 2 2024,positive,probably the most matthew vaughn film matthew vaughn has ever done its weird goofy absurd cool stylish and beautiful all at the same time its a hell of a mix for a wonderful experience with an incredible cast a lot of heart was put into it and you can see and feel everyone was having fun doing it it isnt for everyone but this is the kind of original film that we need more of its bold and never generic nor bland   matthew vaughn needs to keep doing his thing because hes excellent at it
Feb 2 2024,neutral,way too many plot twists some dont even make sense overlong and just bonkers the fight scenes were cool and it was nice to see sam rockwell as an action star but the script was a mess
Feb 2 2024,positive,my family is a fan of the kingsman movies and we loved the trailer for argylle so we were disappointed when started to see the critic reviews come in for it  we had a free night and decided to take a chance on it  it has been a long time since we all came out of a theater with smiles on our face  this movie is terrific  sure it is a bit manic at times  yes it is a hair too long  but in the end it was entertaining and that is all we can hope for with a movie  my teenage boys absolutely loved it  plus sam rockwell is great as always  if youre a kingsman fan definitely see it  if you enjoy spymission impossible movies go see it as well
Feb 2 2024,positive,i want to love this the trailer was awesome but the movie i received didnt match some good ideas scenes and performances dont take away from terrible cg and a sloppy convoluted story
Feb 2 2024,negative,ughwhat a hodpodge of a mess and to think there are two more to be made in this trilogyyuck matthew vaughn as director cannot save any of this dreck well over two hours you keep wondering what were they thinking when they wrotelet alone filmed this twist and turns and surprises that you could care less about the film steals from everywheretrying to decided what it is there is an art to making campy fun silly filmsand this wasnt it when you steal a whirlybird dancing shotnot oncenot twicebut three times from the brilliant film airplane you know it is in trouble bryce dallas howard just looks totally out of place as the heroine writer sam rockwell who was brilliant in tvs fosse was just annoying here it felt like a looooong forced episode and not funny of the long ago tv series moonlighting but even those episodes at times were fun this thing tries tooooo hard period i think the feline pet got the most laughs in this james bond wannabe ahem comedy
Feb 2 2024,positive,solid cast movie is hilarious with a twist around every corner sam rockwell bryce dallas howard and bryan cranston stole the show this movie was quite enjoyable to watch just a good time and nothing more it doesnt take itself seriously it does drag a little bit but in the end i love this movie and will be watching it again
Feb 2 2024,positive,this was a blast from start to finish  its exactly what the trailer promised twisty plot silly spy capers overthetop action  great popcorn flick  hope theres a whole new franchise out of this
Feb 2 2024,positive,all the fun jokes and ridiculous of kingsman with a mission impossible twist
Feb 2 2024,positive,went into it unsure thanks to poor reviews from critics but once again i find myself in disagreement with them this movie was awesome an absurd action comedy and just what you expect from a film with matthew vaughn at the helm enough wacky twists and turns to keep it entertaining but still with it all coming together in an awesome conclusion
Feb 2 2024,negative,absolutely shocking movie by the end i just wanted to remove my brain and give up completely on life
Feb 2 2024,neutral,good plot unexpected twists good laughs man did it get a bit wacky in the last 3035mins movie went from good to what the heckok lol
Feb 2 2024,positive,absolutely loved it i had very high hopes from the trailers and it still exceeded my expectations some mystery and a lot of action i definitely dont want to let the cat out of the bag but it was great
Feb 2 2024,negative,would be a no star with rockwell who shinedthe rest is a lifeless awful cgi mess of a movie and acting
Feb 2 2024,positive,love the comedy and plot twists before i saw the movie this isnt my genre but it blew me away the actors were amazing too
Feb 2 2024,negative,one star goes to sam rockwell the rest of the film was hot garbage i shouldve walked out bc it was so boring honestly hard to sit through wouldnt waste your time if you want to see it so bad stream it 
Feb 2 2024,positive,i loved argylle so so much ridiculously brilliant  i cant wait to see if they make another all the cast were fabulous and the cat is adorable 
Feb 2 2024,neutral,argylle the latest spy riff from matthew vaughn is overstuffed to the point of exhaustion as it hurls a seemingly endless barrage of twists at the screen which would make even m night shyamalan blush      full review  
Feb 2 2024,negative,no chemistry not funny way too long actioncomedy scenes are bad and unnecessary so all we have left is the worst movie in 2024 and is just the beginning of the year and are you trying to imply that a sequel is coming please dont stop
Feb 2 2024,negative,this is literally the worstworst and the worst movie ive ever seen in years not even captain marvel can goes against this movie thats just how bad this movie is a complete waste of time do not watch
Feb 2 2024,positive,enjoyable to watch lots of laugh out loud moments the acting and fights scenes were very good 
Feb 2 2024,positive,while the critics did not like this movie i thoroughly enjoyed it lots of action i thought all the stars did a great job with their roles i loved sam rockwell  absolutely outstanding bryce dallas howard also outstanding i would recommend seeing great twist also tiny post credit scene at beginning of credits nothing after that
Feb 2 2024,positive,sold cast and brilliant story lines there was lots of twists and turn which you didnt expect some parts did drag on but a awesome movie
Feb 2 2024,positive,awesome argylle is a fun movie i really enjoyed it thank you matthew vaughn for changing my mood
Feb 2 2024,negative,what a mess of a movie
Feb 2 2024,negative,i rank this movie in the top 10 worst movies ive ever seen it is only loosely based on the equally terrible book of the same name none of the characters get fully fleshed out and the plot twists are so numerous that you give up trying to follow it halfway through by the last fourth of the movie i was trying to figure out how it ever made it past test audiences i wish i could get my money and the two hours and 20 minutes of my time back
Feb 2 2024,positive,honestly i enjoyed every second of this movie the plot is really good and when you feel you know whats going on something changes the whole thing you must go see this movie its really worth every second
Feb 2 2024,negative,the opening scene with dua lipa the only redeeming value plot so thin and insipid bryan cranston and sam rockwell cant even save it really bad almost walked out and i like movies so much ive only done that once before wait to stream and then turn it off once dua lipa is done 
Feb 2 2024,positive,i love everything matthew vaughn dreams up  argylle is the most radical and hilarious lucid dream
Feb 2 2024,positive,i went into this movie just hoping to be entertained my wife and i loved it this movie is a rollercoaster with so many twists and turns that genuinely surprised us its intentionally over the top and so much fun a great night at the movies definitely go see it
Feb 2 2024,positive,it was the best absurd comedy ive watched in a long time
Feb 2 2024,negative,this has got to be the worst movie ever whowhy would you waste time energy and money on this i cant get that 2 hours and 19 min back i did get some good sleep though do not waste your precious time or money dont even watch it for free
Feb 2 2024,positive,if you enjoyed kingsman i am sure you will enjoy this movie    it is true that this one has bit more of comedy vs shooting action and that is why has four stars and not five but liked almost every moment and did not think in checking my phone at any moment of the movie which for me is always a good proxy    if you like fun action easy to watch movies dont trust the critics and just go to the cinema by some pop corn and enjoy
Feb 2 2024,positive,good movie with good action and funny parts   the middle of the movie got to be a little stale due to trying to setup the ending  but worth watching
Feb 2 2024,positive,the movie was awesome one of the best fun movies i watched for so long it gives the early 2000s movies fun vibes
Feb 2 2024,negative,i knew nothing about this film when i bought my ticket i looked at the cast and it is an impressivesounding cast but in spite of a couple of moderately and i mean moderately funny lines and a plot that is reminiscent of a couple of big spy franchises which i thought might in fact make it an entertaining spoof dont worry theyll be obvious enough to you it was not funny to say this was the worst movie ive ever seen might be a slight exaggeration but honestly i dont know how it ever got made i can confidently say it was not good i actually wondered more than once if the script was generated by ai and wanted to get up several times to leave but kept trying to give it the benefit of the doubt better in theory than in practice im afraid i saw it in a pretty small theatre and about four people laughed at a couple of points but sadly the rest of us seemed to be sitting there wondering why we had wasted our time and money on this film i really dont like to leave negative reviews and i am a fan of several of the actors but this was not a great project apologies to those involved
Feb 2 2024,positive,a very well written movie and great way they moved from author to character the middle was a bit over the top but the overall movie was excellent this is one of a few movies that must be seen in a theater
Feb 2 2024,positive,entertaining in spite of its toolong run time and questionable casting
Feb 2 2024,positive,matthew vaughan is a mad man a brilliant genius but mad as this was a great feeling good popcorn movie just good clean fun take all your favourite spy tropes mix in a large blob of kingsmans light heartedness and just a hint of austin powers silliness     i hope they make a second one
Feb 2 2024,negative,i want those 2 hours of my life back
Feb 2 2024,positive,this movie was more interesting and entertaining than i expected what made it fun was that all the actors were perfectly cast for their parts
Feb 2 2024,positive,kingsman with a romance and a huge twist rockwell is hilarious just see it
Feb 2 2024,positive,made an account just to give this movie the rating it deserves my jaw was on the floor for most of it its redonkulous i was entertained what more can i ask of a movie
Feb 2 2024,positive,a riot of  bonkers fun action and twists great couple of hours escapist entertainment
Feb 2 2024,negative,really enjoy matthew vaughn but this was not it convoluted way too long and bryce dallas howard was completely unbelievable in this role what a shame
Feb 2 2024,negative,the plot was so far fetched it lost me half way through if not in the beginning this movie is ridiculous you almost laugh at whoever wrote this 
Feb 2 2024,negative,worst movie ive seen in the past 12 months maybe ever an amazing cast with the worst script and story developments of all time i really tried to like it and im such a fan of all the actors but it was just awful
Feb 2 2024,negative,couldve been a 1 hour 45 minute movie
Feb 2 2024,positive,while the film has questionable factors and filmmaking elements argylle is still an enjoyable and entertaining theater experience offering a blend of action and humor
Feb 2 2024,positive,absolutely love this movie had an awesome time with this great audience in the cinema with everyone laughing lots its a really wild ride with amazing performances 1010  definitely will go see it again in a few days
Feb 2 2024,positive,movie had multiple twist and turns action comedy and keeps you at the edge of your seat different storyline and very entertaining
Feb 2 2024,positive,the opening scene left a bit of a bad taste in my mouth why did dua lipa need a cgi motorbike    but once this film gets going its good fun solid performances from the cast shout out to sam rockwell for once again stealing every scene hes in mean youre rarely bored even if some of the action sequences feel a bit padded its a fun movie that doesnt take itself seriously and you shouldnt either    i really liked the concept and the scene with the smoke was very enjoyable the plot just about holds up if you dont look too hard but ultimately this film has one goal in mind to keep you entertained and it achieves that goal
Feb 2 2024,positive,loads of fun lots of great humour lots of great action loads of twists and a great cast  choreography is brilliant too
Feb 2 2024,neutral,it started out fine but then it got too unbelievable sam rockwell did a great job  i dont think bryce dallas howard was the right choice for this movie  i didnt believe the chemistry between the two of them  all in all it was too unbelievable too convenient for the plot and had the potential to be better
Feb 2 2024,negative,lame outdated unnecessary plot twists weird outdated stereotypes and horrible acting what even is the arabian peninsula name a damn country or city and stop using outdated dumb stereotypes the acting was cringey and bad the plot was just lame to say predictable is an understatement probably one of the worst movies ive seen
Feb 2 2024,positive,its campy and doesnt take itself seriously a fun time
Feb 2 2024,positive,like other vaughn films its a really good time a bit long but the twists and turns are enjoyable dont think too hard and youll have a great experience action and choreography are great again
Feb 2 2024,positive,i absolutely love sam rockwell
Feb 2 2024,positive,this movie was excellent with decent action scenes and a surprising plot twist its a recommended watch for kingsman fans
Feb 2 2024,positive,great spy movie lots of fun
Feb 2 2024,positive,argylle was amazing and fresh it felt good to not have anything spoiled in the trailers and kept me on the edge of my seat along with all the continuous laughs no spoilers but i hope they keep it up over the top and loved every second of it
Feb 2 2024,neutral,matthew vaughn is a director i genuinely appreciate and i think his films have always been a lot of fun for me even when they are underwhelming it is unfortunate that argylle is probably his weakest film to date this movie has moments of fun with some infrequent cool action scenes and some decent twists the problem is that a lot of it is also just kind of boring and the movie is not paced well i am all aboard for a selfaware and silly movie but it needs to be a lot more enjoyable than this movie is able to be the cast is doing a fine job but no one is able to save this movie from mediocrity overall it is the first time a matthew vaughn movie has gotten bad reviews and i actually kind of get it and think it is the first real disappointment of 2024
Feb 2 2024,positive,this is a valentines day movie and you cant tell me otherwise i thought this movie was funny the cgi kinda took me out it just because there was so much of it not a cgi fest but most scenes had a little obvious cgi in it the performances are good but what youd expect and i do like the mystery from the teasing of the trailers but even though i love the cheekiness of the 3rd act it is a little too ridiculous even for me haha definitely a movie to bring a date to the mid credits scene has me intrigued and the musical soundtrack is perfect for this movie it is maybe 2030 mins too long but damn i still had a good time watching if argylle was really a series of books id definitely read it
Feb 2 2024,positive,this is a valentines day movie and you cant tell me otherwise     i thought this movie was funny the cgi kinda took me out it just because there was so much of it not a cgi fest but most scenes had a little obvious cgi in it the performances are good but what youd expect and i do like the mystery from the teasing of the trailers but even though i love the cheekiness of the 3rd act it is a little too ridiculous even for me haha     definitely a movie to bring a date to the mid credits scene has me intrigued and the musical soundtrack is perfect for this movie it is maybe 2030 mins too long but damn i still had a good time watching if argylle was really a series of books id definitely read it
Feb 2 2024,positive,it was exactly what the trailer provided a cheeky spy movie funny electric music and very entertaining we go for the movies for a good time and this movie is a good time
Feb 2 2024,positive,plot twist but beautiful movie
Feb 2 2024,positive,i enjoyed the movie
Feb 2 2024,negative,really good in the beginning but went downhill once the twist twisted lol cat was the only best thing in it 
Feb 2 2024,positive,i thought this was a very fun movie  you could see from the trailer what type of movie this was going to be  i expected to laugh at the action sequences so it gave me what i expected and i thank them for it
Feb 2 2024,positive,the blonde made it all worth it 
Feb 2 2024,negative,movie is horrible save your money its waste of money and time
Feb 2 2024,neutral,silly but entertaining i would really want to watch it again when it becomes available on streaming 25 stars
Feb 2 2024,negative,eeeeek  it just didnt glue well and fell flat
Feb 2 2024,positive,while certainly being quite lengthy for an action film and maybe a little too overthetop for the liking argylle is surrounded by a great cast that runs the show
Feb 2 2024,positive,dont want to spoil anything for you if you liked matthew vaughns other movies like the kingsman series you will like this    theres some things the critics reviews are completely missing that if you watched and enjoyed those other movies will click theyre not seeing the full story being told in this movie it has layers beyond what is overt
Feb 2 2024,negative,the one star is for sam rockwells excellent performance  the missing 4 stars are for everything else in the stupid movie
Feb 2 2024,positive,for its best its fun its no kingsman for sure but its cast is outstanding 810
Feb 2 2024,positive,i wanted to enjoy this movie alot more then i actually did i have seen worse but it wasnt great
Feb 2 2024,positive,great fun and creativity a little goofy and hokey but you have to love it anyway
Feb 2 2024,positive,if was a fun movie but too long  sam rockwell steals much of the movie  so many twists and turns it leaves your head spinning
Feb 2 2024,positive,dear universal apple and matthew vaughn    now that ive seen your stupid movie which was fine can you promise that i never see the trailer for it again ive seen it so many times that i was fully expecting it to play prior to the actual movie itself and when lets dance or whatever its called played in the actual film it made me shudder     thank you for your consideration
Feb 2 2024,positive,lots of action fun movie though we were a bit confused with the end
Feb 2 2024,positive,i dont care what the critics are saying about this movie  if you like the genre you should like this  over the top a couple of times but all in all pretty entertaining which is why i go to the movies for anyway  there is a short midcredit scene if you want to wait a couple of minutes after the movie ends
Feb 2 2024,negative,rockwell was outstanding    as for the rest the fact that their song for five years was the lost beatles song the one never made and then put together by apple and others along with ai last yearand that made more sense than most of their other plot choices says all you need to know about this film
Feb 2 2024,negative,it was okay it started getting more exciting when it was discovered she was an agent
Feb 2 2024,positive,not the worst did get the ick at least once but somehow i left the theatre attracted to justin hammer so that happened
Feb 2 2024,positive,while a lot of people didnt like this movie due to its lackness argylle is a good action movie for action and cat lovers alike
Feb 2 2024,positive,its fun to watch but it comes really cringy at the final scenes i really think if mr vaughn toned it down a lot maybe it comes more enjoyable to watch and more balanced because in the beginning everything is so nice and then it goes bananas oh and the cgi doesnt help at all it makes that the movie looks so fake this is more for a sunday evening with the larger bucket of popcorn that you can get and thats it
Feb 2 2024,positive,fun and full of action lots of twists and turns
Feb 2 2024,positive,1010 amazing movie dont listen to bad reviews i cried laughing twice if you like kingsman you will love this if you hated kingsman this isnt your movie
Feb 2 2024,positive,argylle is epically campy very creative and flat out dorkily fun the surprise twists and goofy fight scenes make for a fun watch if you are expecting a serious action flick this is not for you if you want something that will make you laugh here you go
Feb 2 2024,negative,started like the previews looking fun with action but quickly turned into a goofy comedy with stilly twists and turns
Feb 2 2024,positive,lots of fun this movie is what is sets out to be  funny entertaining and a little zany not as good as mr right but worth watching and never a dull moment
Feb 2 2024,negative,terrible dua is hot so that got me through 5 min the next hour plus i the red headed girl was so annoying with her screechy voice i tried to watch it but left after an hr and 20 min because she was unbearable and the plot was bloated anyways
Feb 2 2024,positive,it was ok but a lot cornie not as much action as i was thinking it would have kind of slow in places
Feb 2 2024,negative,way too long spy thriller that doesnt measure up to the level of entertainment expected in this type of genre
Feb 2 2024,positive,great movie great twist
Feb 2 2024,negative,i want my 139 minutes back
Feb 2 2024,positive,anybody expecting this to be a serious spythriller has obviously misjudged this film   this is a parody of the genre right down to questions being asked at ellys book launch at the beginning and the very tongueincheek pokes at the spy tropes themselves even as they are playing them out right in front of you including some unexpected twists also typical of the genre that it plays the clichés just the same  while this is from matthew vaughn dont go in expecting kingsman otherwise youll be disappointed  while kingsman comes with a bit of campiness on its own its still more serious a film on the genre than argylle ever intends to be  this is campy its cheesy and its fun  thats all it was ever meant to be  if you dont understand that from some of the action sequences in the later half of the film you are then missing the point   this films tone is intended to land somewhere between austin powers but being less insulting to the audience with its comedy and kingsman being less serious take on the genre and it makes that landing just fine   expect some overthetop sequences a bit of foolishness and just go for the ride and youll enjoy this film a lot more
Feb 2 2024,positive,great movie lots of fun full on action comedy
Feb 2 2024,positive,solid 710 movie tries too hard to be complex at times but really good action sequences and sam rockwell is just charismatic and steals his scenes movie got some genuine laughs from me though it wasnt as good as id hoped but still worth watching when it hits streaming for the rest of you
Feb 2 2024,positive,i have no idea why this is getting review bombed by critics charming characters a heterosexual couple dynamic which is shockingly refreshing
Feb 2 2024,positive,i have been looking forward to watching this movie since i saw its trailer months ago it definitely did not disappoint in fact it honestly surpassed my expectations it was funny witty unpredictable and just a great allaround movie i dont know why the critics didnt like this movie but i would recommend people with an actual personality to watch it p
Feb 2 2024,positive,super fun escape and engaged from beginning to end  if you liked romancing the stone you will also love this action adventure romance humor international locations and fun cameos  highly recommend
Feb 2 2024,positive,a lot of twists and turns  made me laugh  in its unbelievability
Feb 2 2024,positive,argylle is unique whatever critics or audience scores say if you have a vague interest in this movie check it out it will surprise you the movie i went in to see was not this film but in the end its like a chameleon changing its pattern of what you see and know about it the turns this movie took surprised me the most in a long time if you have a partner and are interested go see it i think this is this years valentines movie i hope this movie does spawn some offshoots because man it is something i hope my review will encourage you to give it a chance one last thing it stretches and goes on another level of crazy at one point so enjoy the chaos stand outs being sam bryce and brian we need cranston in another villain role stat maybe the next kingsmen villain
Feb 2 2024,positive,much better then i thouight it would be
Feb 2 2024,positive,what a romp  so what if its beyond realistic or anywhere near factual  this is a fun movie run on the energy of sam rockwell   if you want to have a good time  see argylle  funny adventurous and action packed
Feb 2 2024,negative,the story took its twists and turns at full speed ending headfirst directly into a brick wall to understand the humor takes a kindergarten level mind while the plot requires a masters in screenwriting the films only redeeming quality came in the form of a cat whose survival throughout the movie coincidentally was about as reasonable as the plot
Feb 2 2024,positive,boring and predictable not worth the price of admission
Feb 2 2024,positive,funny and entertaining bdh is great in the movie
Feb 2 2024,positive,fantastic lots of laughs and surprises all the way to the end end credit was great
Feb 2 2024,positive,hilarious love the ending
Feb 2 2024,positive,the ending fight scenes were super cringe otherwise it was really good  there were legitimate twists to the story that i couldnt see coming  good but the ending could have been a bit better mostly for the last fight scenes though
Feb 2 2024,positive,very funny and entertaining cinematography also beautiful a little long but it was worth it
Feb 2 2024,negative,stupid  overtly long not much action very unfunny in parts
Feb 2 2024,negative,its mehhh  the whole premise of it is good but the execution makes me feel like watching an ai movie soo much cgi like watching the cat in the hat movie and all the actors look like acting in a spoof movie thats below their standard
Feb 2 2024,negative,the biggest waist of time about 25 hours i cant get back
Feb 2 2024,positive,for the most part argylle was a fun and entertaining action packed film but i feel they attempted to do too much so it doesnt all work for me as ridiculous in a fun way as it is throughout it gets taken too far in the final act on an individual level bryce dallas howard and sam rockwell were great as leads but i never felt their chemistry completely all of the actors were great in fact
Feb 2 2024,positive,not predictable at all very entertaining it is a mess but a super fun mess i plan on watching it again
Feb 2 2024,positive,a fun movie with plenty of twists and turns to keep you guessing as to whats really going on
Feb 2 2024,positive,amazing both the book and the movie are phenomenal i cant wait for more
Feb 2 2024,positive,twist and turns finally a nice movie
Feb 2 2024,negative,its just a bit stupid  dont really know how else to describe it the tone of the movie is all over the place the plot is quite obvious but they keep putting in twists thinking itll be clever its not should be 30mins less best bits are in trailer sam rockwell  bryce dallas howard have zero chemistry the fight scenes are just weird towards the end matthew vaughn loves to have fights with slow music  colours and its just getting a bit old and tiresome now was fun in original kingsman         spoilers ahead       the fight sequence with the dancing colourful smoke is just laughable   the crude oil fight  cant shoot so ill ice skate on knives but at the end shoot them all anyway and render the whole sequence pointless   the deux ex machina at the end with the dead spy friend is terrible   shes meant to only barely remember how to use her skills yet can shoot the heart with pin point accuracy
Feb 2 2024,positive,its a great escapist movie with a proper budget and talented cast that killing spree ballet was inventive and funny skating sequence reminded me of te thre at level midnight  really fun movie overall
Feb 1 2024,positive,its a fun movie full of laughter we really need this type of movies to let our stress of life behind for 2 hours as a change and enjoy our time highly recommend
Feb 1 2024,negative,not at all what i expected going in nothing like vaughans kingsman series cgi is not very good at all a good cast wish is very misused this could be due to poor writing maybe more appealing to a younger audience however there is a lot of unnecessary twists
Feb 1 2024,positive,argylle isnt your usual spy movie while it fellows curtain spy tropes its story set its apart sure theres a lot of twist and turns but isnt that spy and mystery movies all about  if you want fun moive with hot guys a relatable female lead and an adorable cat i highly recommend
Feb 1 2024,positive,pure fun a crazy ride of entertainment and the dance sequence near the end was sublime
Feb 1 2024,positive,if you enjoy going to the cinema to be entertained by glorious smart action scenes tongue in cheek laugh out loud gags excellent visual effects be surprised by clever plot twists and you appreciate the style of comic book action thrillers brought to life in the style of kick ass and the kingsman films then argylle is definitely for you    simply it is pure accelerated adrenalin fun pieced together masterfully by matthew vaughn and his highly accomplished team    excellent and fun loving performances from all the cast    good vibes and great fun all round    anyone who cannot appreciate the tongue in cheek comic book aspect is clearly a morose person that loves being sad    see argylle if you want to laugh smile and feel good
Feb 1 2024,negative,i started screenloveaffaircom because i love movies i love video games and tv too but movies are definitely my biggest passion the name i settled on was meant to reflect that love and passion theres nothing quite like staring up at that big screen and going on an adventure whether its an emotional rollercoaster a thrilling blockbuster or a nailbiting horror movie i love it all    nothing has ever been able to impact me as much as cinema has    unfortunately none of what i just said applies to the movie i saw tonight    this made me love cinema a little bit less a nearly two and a half hour action comedy that only made me laugh in disgust at how bad what i saw on screen was    this was the film equivalent of a story someone tells a group of people at a work party that goes on way too long and only musters a pity chuckle from one of the unfortunate souls who had to endure it    well this is getting no pity chuckle from me    the action scenes were some of the worst ive ever seen the entire movie had a fake cgi look to it and perhaps the most important detail is that sam rockwell is without question one of my favourite living actors and not even he could save this movie    we will learn a lot about audience appetites from how well this movie performs but this had absolutely everything bad that movies have been able to give us lately i pray to all the different gods that i dont believe in that this planned trilogy never comes to fruition    my friend said i havent seen a movie ive hated that much in a long time    i couldnt have said it better myself
Feb 1 2024,positive,really fun unusual full of action good scenes great story
Feb 1 2024,positive,i enjoyed the movie till the third act and then then the movie became to goofy and the unbelievable became to unbelievable the performances were fine some good action sequences movie is 20 minutes to long
Feb 1 2024,positive,argylle is an absolute delight  such a fun and lighthearted movie that had me smiling from start to finish honestly not sure what the critics are on about i loved every bit of it an incredible cast too bryce is amazing in the lead role
Feb 1 2024,positive,325 stars  got the chance to see this a couple days early and there were parts about it that were very surprising in a good way the trailer only scratches the surface of whats really doing on on he flip side there were some sequences that were a bit too goofy for me to enjoy your mileage may vary of course and it certainly wasnt enough to make me dislike the film but it did bring the rating down a notch be sure to stick around for a quick easter egg midcredits scene video review youtubehscmzlmbgl4
Feb 1 2024,positive,it was really crazy at times made no sense twists at every corner i absolutely loved it
Feb 1 2024,positive,again the critics are wrong again   it was a really fun ride to watch to movie
Feb 1 2024,positive,goat spy movie for sure
Feb 1 2024,positive,a great start to the year with a great line up of actors making it a true standout for a action comedy it delivers what it promisies with a great mix of brutal action mixed with light humour that will have you smiling throughout the whole movie its a movie i would go back to watch again
Feb 1 2024,positive,so i like this movie i think its the best thing ive seen in my whole life
Feb 1 2024,positive,argylle is a very good film but the action still doesnt feel too tense its a bit bland but there is still a lot of interesting and stomachchurning action especially with the appearance of cats in this film which really caught my attention
