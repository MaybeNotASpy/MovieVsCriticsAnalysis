Jul 11 2022,negative, a cheap sexual fantasy designed for mass consumption fifty shades of grey approaches the otherwise risqué subject of bdsm and neuters it rather than fully explore the dark realms of sadism or even adequately investigate an unhealthy abusive relationship this adaptation retreads clichés in a format best suited for the dullest of mainstream viewers having not read el james first or second or third book in her trilogy my view on the phenomenon and controversy may be limited but after enduring the film i can write that any fuss made about the exploitative nature of director sam taylorjohnsons adaptation hasnt considered what a tedious completely dismissible film lies before us heres a film that is offensive only in how inoffensive it proves to be it transforms what should be a complicated lurid relationship between a dominant and submissive into a laughable formula about an innocent girl and her mysterious man shes an awkward bookworm hes a wealthy control freak mix these stereotypes together with a bondage fetish and you get something akin to pride and prejudice with kinkexcept neither romantic nor erotic nor even boundarypushing with much lowerlipbiting to cornball effect dakota johnson plays the mousy anastasia steele the resident elizabeth bennet a virginal college student fond of classical romances by jane austen no less when she interviews christian grey jamie dornan for her college newspaper shes immediately taken by his steely intimidating presence erudite and formal the young billionaire runs an ambiguous communications company where he only hires women who look like robert palmer dancers and avows that he exercises control in all things in addition to a few other warning signs christian grows fascinated with ana and begins borderline stalking her and perhaps because shes inexperienced in such things shes charmed by his creepy attention then comes the moment when any sane person would walk away from his courtship he asks her to sign a nondisclosure agreement before he touches her along with allusions to his singular sexual proclivities the fact that he wants her to sign a contract and she actually considers it is part of what makes this an absurd fantasy it turns out christian likes to tie women up in his playroom and punish them though he claims to enjoy such acts only if his submissives are getting as much pleasure from the experience as he does nothing about the seemingly smart certainly reserved ana and her very normal life suggests that she would be game for a little sm so why when all of the signs point to christian having major issues does she stick around that question is never adequately answered in the film and remains glaring and because of that fifty shades of grey is nothing more than surfaces colortimed in muted grayscale shades polished up with just the right amount of nottoooutthere erotica that wont offend mainstream crowds audiences witness hands tied blindfolds on feather tickling light spanks and whipping nothing too scandalous indeed bondage has never been so boring or felt so commoditized each of these acts is filmed like a music video and set to pop music by more often than not beyoncé she contributes two titles to the soundtrack theres one sequence where each thrust is timed with a beat and each beat coincides with a cut from one shot to another and the nudity in these scenes is almost exclusively onesided with johnson baring far more and more consistently than her male costar but ultimately these scenes are no more erotic than watching monkeys mounting one another at the zoo none of this would matter if interesting characters inhabited fifty shades of grey but there are none to be found questions about anas motivations bother us until we remember shes very inexperienced in relationships to be sure any selfrespecting woman would have run far far away from christian at the first mention of an nda not to mention christians later domsub contract so what does she see in him christian is bland robotic but goodlooking enough i suppose without an interesting dimension beneath his exterior layer the irish actor plays him unemotive from behind a rigid american accent hes broody and as ana observes on multiple occasions unable to articulate his feelings when she asks why he must punish her to achieve pleasure he responds this is how i am how does such a poor communicator preside over a billiondollar company but because shes naïve she overlooks his utterly deficient personality in favor of his fancy cars posh apartments helicopter rides and glider flights or maybe she just enjoys how he showers her with gifts a firstedition copy of tess of the durbervilles a new laptop and an audi by the time ana confesses her love for christian we cannot help but wonder what shes fallen in love withtheres nothing there many have questioned the sexual politics and implications of the book and film the material brings into question female submissiveness as it relates to gender roles throughout history and you could argue that it perpetuates violent relationships against women although she leaves him in the end quite abruptly suggesting that such relationships are not condoned by the filmmakerauthor however debating these serious topics in relation to this material gives it too much credit theres nothing the least bit insightful or insulting about this product it has been tailored for the lowest common denominator demographic many of whom filled the theater during my screening the largely middleaged crowd of women whispered and giggled their low hum of chatter barely subsided for the films 125minute runtime they were no more affected or offended by what was happening onscreen than they were during twilight seven years ago had fifty shades of grey been nc17 rated and really pushed the limits of mainstream sexuality in film its doubtful that it would have been received with such widespread commercial enthusiasm if theres a dangerous sociological consequence to the film it resides in how topics that should be significant are presented in such a fluffy way that when left to its target audience they can be damaging if only for the ignorance with which its received but fifty shades of grey manages to be a nonissue and quite often boring which is surprising given the swell of passionate negative reception and controversy about the book in some circles outspoken feminists authors and news outlets grant the material far too much credit by suggesting it has any significant meaning beyond supplying sexually bored readers and viewers with a look at fringe sexuality through a clichéd lens to expend any energy getting mad about its possible but mostly nonexistent subtexts is a waste of time for bdsmbrand controversy seek out tie me up tie me down 1990 bitter moon 1992 the piano teacher 2001 secretary 2002 or even nymphomaniac 2014each of these films respects its audiences enough to at least attempt to provoke the viewer watching these other films you might find yourself offended or pushed to the limit even unable to watch others might find themselves turned on for me fifty shades of grey accomplishes almost no reaction whatsoever except for being so bland and programmed that its laughably dismissible and where bdsm in cinema is involved the film isnt doing its job if it isnt somehow stimulating
Feb 2 2021,negative, remember when valentines day was about fancy chocolates dozens of long stemmed roses and cupid targeting lovers hearts with his trusty bow and arrow with the release of the softcoreporn soontobeblockbuster fifty shades of grey this year cupids arrow isnt aimed at the heart based on the erotic thriller by e l james the movie stars irish actor jamie dornan as handsome ceo and slapandtickle enthusiast christian grey and dakota johnson the daughter of don johnson and melanie griffith as ana steele a literature student sent to interview grey only to find herself under the spell of the businessmans exotic proclivities according to the young impressionable woman he is polite smart and really intimidating showered with gifts like a first edition of tess of the durbervilles she submits to his charmshes wealthy good lookingallowing him to go all atype on her in and out of the bedroom i exercise control on all things miss steele he says a character trait he expresses through bdsm bondage discipline sadism and masochism i dont do romance my tastes are very singular ill cut to the chase there are sex scenes there is nudity and yes virginia there are whips and chains but dont expect the smutty stuff from the books director sam taylorjohnson has whipped the material into mainstream theatre shape shaving the rough edges off the novels explicit kinky sex scenes the randy pair spend more time talking about their sexual liaisons than actually getting horizontal or suspended or anything else they blabber and negotiateim not going to touch you he says not till i have your written consentyammering on about submission domination and safe words till even the marquis de sade would nod off from boredom but for all the talk we never learn anything about why grey is disposed to liberally mixing his pleasure with pain its the way i am he says he doesnt go to dinner or movies he simply wants her to earn his devotion by being his submissive this is communicated simply with a combination of sweet talk if you were mine you wouldnt be able to sit down for a weekand predatory behaviour that if not for his billions would land him in jail for stalking or worse the psychological introspection on display here makes dr phil seem like friedrich nietzsche of the two leads dakota johnson seems ripped from the pages of the book her gamine innocence and girlish giggle convey the emotional rawness necessary for the character to work she is naked emotionally and physicallyunlike her costar who for all we know is as anatomically correct as a ken dollwith a propensity for drunk dialling and permanently dewy look about her that betrays the confusion and attraction ana feels toward grey dornan has the thankless role his grimfaced christian grey is an unemotional cipher a bubbling cauldron of unexplored trauma and dornan plays him straight faced which much have been tough while delivering unintentionally hilarious linescall it a domination comedy or dom comlike roll your eyes at me again and i will take you across my knee his delivery is just as sexy as that time your cranky old grandfather said it to you when you were ten his burning passion is conveyed by his intense gaze which often looks clinical as if hes examining her naked body for irregular moles fifty shades of grey feels like an elegantly madethe cinematography and score are top notchnight time soap opera its a cliffhangerexpect the inevitable sequel to pick up exactly where this film leaves offand the kind of rrated movie that feels more like a cold shower than a hot romance richard crouse shares a toast with celebrity guests and entertainment pundits every week on ctvs exciting talk show pop lifesaturdays at 830 on ctv newschannel midnight on ctv
Dec 4 2020,negative, frumpily dressed anastasia steele dakota johnson compensating with a 40 gpa and english literature romanticism heads to seattles grey house to conduct an interview with wealthy telecommunications magnate christian grey jamie dornan shes substituting for her sick roommate kate eloise mumford who has prepared a series of hopelessly dull questions that become just the start of anastasias unpreparedness clumsiness and flustered attitude nevertheless the cool collected intense grey is fascinated by the young woman just as she exhibits an immediate infatuation herself the following day christian surprises anastasia at her hardware store clerk job setting in motion a collection of flirtations and interactions that lead to repeated visits to his luxurious apartment its there that she reveals her inexperience with men and he alludes to his own dark secrets  namely whips and chains though one of the spelledout rules of dominancesubmission is consensual participation fifty shades of grey instantly breaks its own rules with christian attempting to coerce anastasia into a role shes not comfortable with  and vice versa as she hopes to taper off his extreme sexual preferences for the more standard wooing habits of a dinner and a movie oddly their lack of chemistry seems fitting in a romance between a carnal novice and an emotionally damaged robot with all the advertising and hype its difficult to remain completely oblivious to the main attraction of fifty shades of grey which is the sadomasochistic dalliances and insinuated supercharged eroticism and what turns out to be a lot of graphic nudity bondage is certainly not something regularly explored in mainstream cinema here the dialogue makes frequent foreshadowing hints at greys unusual predilections inspiring decent laughs for those aware of the subject matter youre the complete serial killer jokes anastasia as grey purchases cable ties masking tape and rope  in fact tools for his singular playroom were it not for the publicity surrounding the picture the first act could have established a typical teen romantic comedy unfortunately the coquetries start to resemble bella and edward banter which is not surprising considering the projects origination as twilight fan fiction the similarities stop there however as the fantastical romance something of an edgier pretty woman morphs away from commonplace cinderella reveries and into the story of o or the many emmanuelle movies and their copyrightcircumventing laura gemser derivatives using the name emanuelle sans an m i dont do romance insists grey even though hes prone to rescuing steele from her own drunkenness or taking her on thrillseeking dates later the mention of genital clamps and anal fisting also drives a wedge between the juvenile origins in a particularly cheap premise the leading man is a billionaire capable of offering helicopter rides fancy cars and opulent dwellings this clouds steeles motives as audiences can never be sure of the degree that endless riches influence her choices the temptation for promiscuity transitions to one of financial possibilities grey also has plenty of time off to have sex all weekend long for equilibrium bits of unaffecting humanism are thrown in such as a prying mother and stock siblings along with a brief history of the cause of greys sexual deviance glimpsing the marginally interesting psychological metamorphoses and manifestations of abuse the whys of bdsm are likely the most engrossing aspects of the behavior the notion of freedom from responsibility and making decisions is comparably piquing but the painaspleasure idea is hard to swallow outside of the cinematic realm of hellraisers cenobites at least the film goes out of the way to show the use of condoms but regardless of the themes or the boilerplate that replaces original character designs the most unforgivable aspect is the ending since this is the first part of a trilogy fifty shades of grey isnt even a marginally complete story this entire first chapter is just the introduction  resulting in something grossly less than a competent movie designed by mike massie   20062024 gone with the twins  all movie related images  their respective owners articles on this site may not be distributed or reproduced without written consent
Sep 7 2020,negative, if you would weave together a pinch of the softcore stylings of red shoe diaries a dab of the hyperstylized playboy videos and ever so slight hints of the naughtiness meets psychosocial intrigue of secretary or maybe 9 12  weeks then you may very well have an idea of what to expect from fifty shades of grey the adaptation of british author el jamess bestselling novel of the same name already having garnered its fair share of controversy thus adding fuel to its inevitable boxoffice fire fifty shades of grey centers around anastasia steele dakota johnson 21 jump street and need for speed a sheltered english lit major on the verge of college graduation when she meets attractive young billionaire christian grey jamie dornan televisions the fall and once upon a time whose attraction to anastasia is surpassed only by his need to control absolutely everything about absolutely every human relationship hes in in case youre still wondering this means that christian is a dominant a bdsm term indicating a role of control within a sexual scene or lifestyle this also means that christian is not seeking from anastasia a traditional dating relationship after all he doesnt do romance but is instead seeking for her to be his submissive a role in which she would essentially surrender herself to his wants and needs without question there are some particularly those within the faith community who are already protesting fifty shades of grey loudly the protests grew even louder after the films hyperstylized trailer played during this years super bowl and triggered accusations that the film promotes sexual violence domestic violence and the glorification of violence against women alternately there are some who defend the film just as loudly by stressing the mutual consent within the relationship and quite simply the fact that bdsm is both widely popular and widely misunderstood there are also those who consider the film as a true depiction of bdsm or even rape fantasy the latter being an admittedly darker yet existing sexual practice amongst more experienced and extreme practitioners of bdsm the simple truth at least in my estimation is that the notion of being swept away remains an intense fantasy in fifty shades of grey being swept away by this attractive dominating and filthy rich man is completely enveloping because it touches on the desire to be protected controlled safe and financially secure  the books also at their very essence tap into that very basic idea that true love heals everything the curious thing at least to those whose minds work critically is that practically anyone would openly tell you that fifty shades of grey and its companion books are horribly written this isnt meant as a slight to james who has clearly written works of great popularity and cultural relevance but merely as an observation that a book that started out as twilight fan fiction doesnt have a particularly brilliant story and does in fact contain some of most incredibly insipid dialogue one could possibly imagine now then im not completely convinced that youre here to actually read a review of fifty shades of grey mostly because im not 100 convinced that fans of fifty shades of grey can actually read however i suppose my film criticism code of ethics demands that i at least attempt to express the experience to be had while watching fifty shades of grey  to her credit el james did not write a book that glorifies violence against women or rape or domestic violence there is a difference between these things and bdsm though certainly there would be those practitioners capable of drawing a line between the two definitely existing within the world of erotica and fantasy jamess novels more fully explore the myriad of issues present within the complex relationship that exists between anastasia and christian christian is in his own words 50 shades of fed up and incapable of anything resembling a mutually satisfying relationship within the relatively short span of a two hour film it is impossible to fully explore what created christian and as a result we are left to watch a man whose behaviors border on sociopathic easily cross the line of stalking are unfathomably controlling and exhibit more than subtle hints of domestic violence do i believe this is the filmmakers intent or the films meaning nope that doesnt matter the simple truth is that jamie dornans performance is so incredibly weak that without a full context his christian grey comes off as sociopathic rather than seductive controlling rather than dominant and frightening rather than fantasymaking there was never a moment in fifty shades of grey when i bought into this relationship nor did i ever buy into dornans grey as a man capable of creating a business empire or commanding anyones attention let alone their bodies in fact id dare say that for someone supposed to be a dominant that dornans grey is almost painfully submissive johnson on the other hand fares modestly better as anastasia oozing vulnerability and yet believably portraying a more confident and ill say disciplined young woman than is ever brought to life in the book johnson the daughter of melanie griffith and don johnson gives the film nice moments of lightness and even humor a welcome touch given that it becomes apparent early on that the hints of darkness will never become more than hints the biggest problem here however is that johnsons character shifts so quickly and plays off dornans so badly that anastasia ends up looking and feeling like a woman with a raging personality disorder whose backandforth histrionics are more erratic than empowering theres a surprising lack of sex in fifty shades of grey the films sensuality defined by a handful of scenes that are vividly brought to life by seamus mcgarveys lensing but that are surprisingly devoid of the books more intense scenes we get a few nude shots of anastasia not surprisingly coupled with a couple butt shots of christian a handful of full body scenes from behind and one hint of pube in other words its fairly typical hollywood sex with the modest addition of some whips straps etc the scene that may very well be the sexiest is actually devoid of sex a wonderful backandforth experience involving christian anastasia and a conference table the truth is that if fifty shades of grey wanted to really work then taylorjohnson and crew needed to commit to a darker edgier and more compelling film dornan whom i cant stress enough is miscast here desperately needed to tap into greys darkness or he needed to pull a charlie hunnam and just back out of the project at several points i found myself picturing the suave and sophisticated sociopathic behavior of christian bales patrick bateman a characters whose sociopathic nature certainly dominated yet a character who had that edginess that christian grey so desperately needs here the films portray of dominance and submission is flaccid at best with dornans grey being an ineffectual dominant whose techniques reveal vast inexperience despite his claim of the number of women who have been in what he calls his play room the contract has several major practical flaws and far too often chooses faux style over substance it also doesnt help that the chemistry between dornan and johnson is woefully lacking making their flirtations unconvincing and their dominance and submission border on downright creepy and disturbing the two actors whom reports have said didnt actually get along during film simply arent strong enough yet within their craft to overcome a lack of chemistry and this lacking creates an unbelievable relationship made more unbelievable given the extraordinary circumstances the great thing about a film like 50 shades of grey which seems destined to take the boxoffice crown this opening weekend is that you as the moviegoer should be pretty clear on whether its a film for you theres no disguising what it is and what to expect with the folks at universal pictures trying to sell the film as a valentines day weekend spicy alternative fifty shades of grey wont likely fulfill any of your deepest and darkest fantasies but it may actually remind you how good you already have it
Jul 16 2020,negative, now i dont claim to know anything about bdsm but from what i can gather people choose to participate through a mutual understanding and respect the submissive is getting just as much out of it as the dominant what disturbs me about anastasia and christian is that consent is never reached throughout anastasia contemplates recoils and flat out turns down christians advances about the contract while looking up the word submissive online anastasia is repulsed by the pictures she sees yet christian still ends up persuading her to go through with it theres something just wrong about that what im guessing is meant to be a womans sexual blossoming comes off more as a twisted characters obsession to control someone physically and emotionally el james novel kelly marcel screenplay and sam taylorjohnson director have crafted a disturbing story under the guise of romantic fantasy christian grey is a mysterious playboy that every girl wants to be with but in reality hides demons that make him a sociopath after their first encounter anastasia is smitten beyond belief but theres no basis for that reaction jamie dornan inhabits christian as a steelyeyed montone no nonsense character for someone whos supposed to be sexually irresistible christian simply doesnt sizzle his mannerisms push us away instead of pull us in and it only gets worse once his real desires come to the forefront for a role thats supposed to smolder like a young marlon brando christian grey has more similarity with patrick bateman in american psycho 2000 dakota johnson does her best with anastasia shes effective at being the comedic klutz tripping over things never grasping the double entendres etc she gets a few good oneliners in whether were supposed to laugh with or at her but anastasias motivations toward christian do not make sense what is it about him that attracts her it clearly isnt his charming personality is it his wealth when he brings her into his playroom why doesnt she run away in terror every time she bites her lip i wondered what the hell she was so fascinated with if she cant handle looking at pictures online what makes her think she can handle it in real life since this is a fantasy anastasia has the mindset of being that one special person who can change christian even when he tells her how many women hes had in the same arrangement because a person like him would keep count she still continues along this is a strange dynamic where anastasia  under the false belief that she has ability to influence  allows herself to be tied up beaten and controlled by christian in an effort to make him fall in love with her oh how romantic the sex which im sure everybody will be eager to see is dreadfully not sexy oddly  given that the author screenwriter director and the main protagonist are all female  its anastasia who bares it all not much is seen of mr grey except for the rare bum shot while theres a good amount of sexual encounters theyre all photographed and edited the same way with soft lighting and quick dissolves showing a body part here and there theres nothing all that sensational graphic or titillating its about even to anything youd see on red shoe diaries or late night cinemax if you have an interest in watching other people getting it on there are other cheaper ways to do it besides this this film unnerved me and not in a good way seeing a girl getting tied up whipped and sexually humiliated is not my thing and this is set to be a box office hit christians pursuit of anastasia is downright creepy this is not the same as say hitchcocks vertigo 1958 where the relationship is meant to be disturbing theres an ambivalence here that feels irresponsible it doesnt take a stand as to how christian and anastasia are meant to be perceived the things he does tells us no matter what a girl says or how unsure she is as long as you take her on a helicopter ride youll be allowed to do anything you want with her if you admit you had a bad childhood thatll give you the keys to the goods gimme a break and she wants him becausewhy again if anything fifty shades of grey can function as a barometer for societys weird fascination of all things kinky at my screening it was packed to the brim with people taking selfies to mark the occasion afterwards some waited in line to grab a poster what is it about this story that struck such a chord with popular culture is it because it started out as twilight fan fiction and is enjoying the remnants of that success is it the result of the massive ad campaign or do people just want to see trashy things on screen because in terms of story and character this film is in desperate need of a safe word
Apr 10 2020,positive,overlong too clinical in design and based on lowest common denominator entertainment or so im told fifty shades of grey still manages to be engaging funny and unexpectedly human
Nov 26 2019,positive,given that this is her second film sam taylorjohnson directs the film with taste and care by focusing on the interactions between ana and christian rather than the sexual side of the story and the film looks stunning
Nov 12 2019,negative, first of all i know im not the target audience for this movie having said that i gave fifty shades of grey like all movies i watch a fair chance with an open mind  the first half hour was the only portion of fifty shades of grey with any sort of character anastasia steele dakota johnson is a humble shy girl finishing up college who does pretty much nothing to prompt the interest let alone garner lust from an eccentric billionaire who always gets his way however christian grey jamie dornan takes a sudden interest in her when she steps in for her ill roommate and embarks on a 10minute interview with the head of grey enterprises whatever that might actually be once they get past the introduction the film dives into exactly what you would expect based on everything youve either read or heard about from the novels it completely loses any heart it had for the next hour and a half christian and anastasia play a manipulative game of nationwide hide and seek that includes lots and lots of sex the entire bout feels completely meaningless because the characters hadnt been developed at all the movie takes many liberties by assuming you know what happened in the book and leaves itself open for audience to point out plot holes why does anastasia steele have a thing for christian grey in the first place your answer is probably as good as mine i have no idea it seems like no reason other than the fact that he has a ridiculous amount of money outside of that he borders being an abusive stalker with a personality or lack there of that no one would fall for but a gold digger which ana didnt really strike me as i wonder what the trailer would have looked like if characters from the book werent so commonly wellknown the movie relied way too heavily on prior knowledge of christian grey and his unique tastes in the bedroom which werent unfathomable for a mature audience take any nicholas sparks movie remove some plot and pull out any character development and replace those elements with as many sex scenes as you can before getting an nc17 rating and you have fifty shades
Sep 19 2019,negative, playful marketing provocations heralded by the succinct tagline curious standing out beneath black and white production stills somehow manages to be the most titillating aspect of the highly anticipated film adaptation of el james erotic novel fifty shades of grey which like many of its romantically inclined counterparts only proves that watching people fuck or fall in love is generally only interesting to those involved directly thats of course discounting voyeurs and james core audience of straightlaced sexually repressed hausfraus who have never taken an opportunity to explore base tendencies it is their embrace that has resulted in this pop culture fixation in a superficial sense its enthralling to see that a studio production so clearly addresses notions of sexual pleasure but fears of censorship have reigned in director sam taylorjohnsons visual freedom and considering the subject matter this is shockingly conservative not unlike say that rihanna music video for her sm track that clearly has no idea what more alternative sexual tendencies look like whats more curious is how the film has been mostly positively received with those who havent read the source material already having a garbled telephone game grasp of expectation though were all familiar with its basic premise this is the first chapter in the sexually charged saga of one anastasia steele dakota johnson a collegiate lit studies major who meets billionaire playboy christian grey jamie dornan by chance hes attracted to her and draws her into his palatial seattle home where he draws up a contract that specifically outlines what the nature of their relationship will entail the virginal anastasia has a limited amount of time to research greys specific sexual preferences and decide if shes able to handle his potentially pleasurable lucrative offer grey belongs to the lowest common denominator of pop culture phenomenology with james texts receiving a similar critical reception as that of stephenie meyer much like twilight will forever tarnish the resume of director catherine hardwicke grey lands with the same thud on another promising female directors filmography while sam taylorjohnsons marriage to younger actor aaron taylorjohnson snagged more headlines than their work together on her 2009 film nowhere boy its a far cry from the banality presented here though there was no chance shed be able to mutate grey into her own vision the end product takes itself so insanely serious that frequent audience titters cascading throughout its screening had nothing to do with discomfort toward potentially awkward material oh the line from which the title is birthed is a stumpy bit of comedy too as the titular billionaire dornan seems entirely too slight his dialogue a series of forced utterances spoken with the prowess of a soap opera star as anastasia johnson daughter of don johnson and melanie griffith though thankfully shes sans that peculiar kitten lilt owned by griffith and grandmother tippi hedren fares a bit better and when shes not sharing screen time with dornan shes actually an engaging intelligent presence but once in the midst of her tryst with grey johnsons anastasia becomes an irritating composite of girlish silliness as if the script cant find a way to avoid treating her demeaningly johnson plays her with a believable balance of naivety at least as concerns a young persons introduction to the torrid and tawdry practices of the sexually experienced but the film becomes a maelstrom of repetitive silliness her dalliance with a man obviously looking for something different than what she has to offer marks her as another throwaway stereotype the scandalous sm subject matter is treated without due deference and youll cringe every time the words dominant and submissive are used as it seems no one involved in the making of this had any way to make this sound less contrived but it begins with lofty allusions to classic literature and greys red playroom even recalls a place of punishment for jane eyre not only is bronte mentioned but anastasia is aligned with her favorite literary heroine tess of the durbervilles from thomas hardys famed novel the reference is troubling for those familiar with the text which concerns a beautiful young ingénue caught romantically between two men ending disastrously professional award winning actresses appear as their respective mothers including marcia gay harden and jennifer ehle supposedly on hand simply to validate the films existence hardens introduction is exquisitely laughable arriving without warning at her sons immaculate home only to leave moments later with the same awkwardness one sees a matriarchal figure treated in something like tommy wisseaus the room elsewhere budgetary constraints also seem to plague the exterior shots of grey with seattle and portland existing basically in skyline for anyone who isnt the target audience ie privileged largely white middleaged heterosexual women fifty shades of grey plays like alternative pleasure practices 101 at the films dramatic crux when anastasia dares christian to release his worst punishment the result is a mere whimper of a sequence yes its great to see sexually acknowledged adult subject matter on the big screen but grey to use a demeaning term is what rough trade would refer to as a cock tease with the powers that be inexcusably pussyfooting by depending solely on the specter of titillation if lars von triers nymphomaniac is equally shackled to contrivance due to centuries of puritanical methods of sexual representation at least he wasnt afraid to get his hands and other parts dirty over a decade ago we had the playful and laudable secretary 2002 which understood that a degree of silliness goes a long way towards making an impact with taboo sexual subject matter funny that no one seemed to understand in the making of grey that watching two vaguely defined characters engage in ceaseless rounds of conservatively filmed grimaces and stifled moans that lip biting bit is eye roll worthy gets tiresome quickly decades earlier japanese auteur nagisa oshima gave us in the realm of the senses 1976 which is still effectively shocking perhaps those that gobbled up el james prose wouldnt mind reading a few subtitles and seek that out instead los angeles based nicholas bell is ioncinemacoms chief film critic and covers film festivals such as sundance berlin cannes and tiff he is part of the critic groups on rotten tomatoes the los angeles film

2019 cleveland international film festival
Aug 2 2019,negative, the marketing campaign for the highly anticipated film version of el jamess erotic romance says simply curiousunfortunately the only curiosity that should drag most discerning film lovers into the theater is seeing how the filmmakers removed so much of the original steam and made it so pervasively boring regardless of whether the book was literature or smut well written or not there is no question millions around the world embraced the trilogy passionately what in the books captured the imaginations of so many who were formerly ignorant of the ins and outs of the world of bdsm and dominantsubmissive sexual relationships was the fact that sexually can take many forms while still allowing for deepening love and commitment this is a powerful message and arguably freed fans to express themselves sexually in new ways without self judgment all this is lost in the film the story of anastasia steele and christian grey how they meet and change each other their sexual exploration and their conflicts is made not only vanilla but has no fire dakota johnson as anastasia lacks the star power to explain christians fascination lip biting is not an acting style jamie dornan a perfectly fine actor in tvs the fall is slumming here but he also does us no favors by mistaking inscrutability for smolder female director sam taylorjohnson inexplicably chooses very traditional camera angles due one assumes to mpaa requirements for ratings as usual we see more breast than at a la leche league convention but only the occasional male bum cheek there is little more critical than to say a third of the film had people laughing at dialogue and the other two thirds wiggling in their seats not from discomfort or innervation but from boredom
May 17 2019,negative, the preconceptions about this film equalling little more than a pile of cinematic manure could cloud collective judgements in the strong opening 15 minutes however the skepticism is disappointingly proven correct in the ensuing dull 100 minutes dornan and johnson perform well but the remainder is overwhelmingly mediocre and poor the script cinematography and direction capped by a dreadful  to the point of distraction  top 40 soundtrack all combine to neuter all sex appeal or edge
May 16 2019,negative,nice as it looks this movie tastes bad
May 10 2019,negative,most of the actual sex has less erotic value than what can be found on late night hbo and it certainly doesnt hold a candle to the graphic content of the novels or the eroticcharged hype surrounding the film
Apr 17 2019,neutral,   as longawaited as that elusive orgasm is todays cinematic release of fifty shades of grey starring dakota johnson as virginal college graduate ana jamie dornan as mogulfetishist christian grey and our own vancouver as vancouver wa and seattle as usual   nope you didnt if you had wanted story you wouldve picked up tolstoy or something above a sixth grade level you wouldve put the book down after reading the characters name on the third page anastasia steele puhlease if you had any interest chaste or otherwise in the books go see the movie   of course you did if you were like most consumers of el james books you were keen to be titillated but not as jazzed to be recognized by your dentist while browsing the erotica section of your local bookstore which has been stocking similar and better softcore porn for years this book was stocked in full view everywhere so you could grab it  preferably afterhours when your dentist was at home flossing after dinner  tuck it under a copy of the economist magazine and flee the scene after paying of course   always a better bet especially in this case not that you wont be able to follow the plot such as it is but the film offers a watereddown version of the story which tells how sweet ana johnson falls into an sm relationship with hot and powerful executive christian grey dornan a man with a tortured past the sex is necessarily tamer of course  though johnsons nipples should get their own billing we see them so often  but the chemistry between the leads is also lacking add to this a rushed history of how the couple enters into their kinky relationship and christian just seems like a creep any selfrespecting virgin would run a mile and because he seems creepy we feel pervy for sitting there watching them its one thing to read the books in the relative privacy of the carpool lane but quite another to watch the film beside a middleaged guy munching popcorn the whole time trust me plus the film like the first book has a cliffhanger ending and is a direct tiein to the sequel fifty shades darker 2016 youll be able to tell which moviegoers havent read the books theyre the ones sitting there wearing wth expressions when the credits roll   actually she is quite good injecting the film with some muchneeded wit and shes a dead ringer for mom melanie griffith when she giggles thankfully we dont have to be subjected to that terrible internal monologue that plagues the books with lines like my inner goddess is doing the meringue with some salsa moves what we do have are plenty of slowmotion climactic scenes in the playroom that made me wish for meg ryans fake orgasms circa when harry met sally instead   true but no more so than what they are getting from the internet the airbrushed cover of that magazine in your mailbox music videos awards shows all programming on the cw social media and everywhere else dornans christian is a dominant though more vulnerable than he cares to admit and ana asks for all that shes given meaning that its a more level playing field than it initially appears only you can fill your daughter in on how awkward and wonderful and occasionally boring sex can be so do that you can hide your kindle and the car keys if you want but frankly the story of a virgin meeting a handsome sexually adept billionaire who has his own helicopter is one shell probably risk getting grounded in order to see laters baby
Apr 4 2019,negative, el james fans waiting with bated breath need not be disappointed by sam taylorjohnsons fifty shades of grey 2015 a perfectly anodyne mills  boonincuffs adaptation of the authors serially denounced book anyone else however might need to be handcuffed to their seats and wonder how something so wildly popular could be so stiflingly unerotic or why all the characters have a sixyearolds vocabulary or whether jamie dornans hunky christian grey who seems able to turn on at any given moment should get help for what is surely erectile dysfunction keep your hands where we can see them  this is sadomasochism for the multiplex generationdakota johnson is anastasia steele a gormless virginal college senior whose least vacant expression is to bite her lip while she struggles to think of what to say next when her flatmate eloise mumford falls ill she steps in to interview hotshot 27yearold billionaire armani suit christian grey dornan for the college paper with excruciating dramatic irony christian says he likes to exercise control on all things and that outside business he enjoys various physical pursuits but their interaction sparks something deep in christians secret place that means he simply must be around her he follows her to where she works  a hardware store no less  where he shops for rope tape and cable ties it would be grounds for harassment if it werent all so romantic christian we learn has singular tastes and when he brings her round to his swanky seattle apartment el james incidentally has never been to seattle he introduces her to a subdom contract he can do what he likes in his red room of pain and in return in his words all she gets is him its so weirdly curiously set up with creepy pauses pinter would have discarded as overextended that the whole scenario cant not be vicariously inviting in christians world love means never having to say youre sorry its a spank instead bdsm films have plenty of precedents from pauline réages the story of o to last years nymphomaniac 2014 and mainstream arthouse audiences has seen much more explicit sex in blue is the warmest colour 2013 but even cynics will recognise this as a real development in major studio release johnsons ana is naked frequently the bondage is upfront and although we get nothing out of dornans genitalia hes at least a strong competitor in cinemas rear of the year and in his dom position it actually makes sense that we may not see his member dornan and johnson speak about boundaries with an upfrontness thats refreshing  her boundaries end at anal fisting she says and lets make that vaginal too but any real character development remains firmly a mystery  fifty shades of grey is feeling its way through virginal territory just as much as ana does and goodness even an improvement on james barelyreadable novel cant help kelly marcels script which segues from one wooden exclamation to another i dont make love says christian on an early encounter i fuck are we meant to be laughing the actors stumble from one sentence to another in just trying to speak the script a fact that cant have been missed by taylorjohnson whose nowhere boy was a promising debut a storyline with christians birth mother hes adopted of course is brought up with groaninducing clumsiness there is a reason for his sadism ana cries and while the first half has a brisk upfront approach the final hour is gobsmackingly dull  with emphasis on the smacking danny elfmans score crunches when dornan moves his hands down to her nether regions and much of the more atmospheric moments are ruined by incessant mainstream pop from beyoncé or ellie goulding but the funniest music moment is the opera playing when we first enter greys plush apartment it instantly reminded of tom hanks opera scene in philadelphia 1993  a film about hivaids but far more pernicious than any of the sexual provocations of fifty shades of grey is a fetish for wild riches while we never learn what grey enterprises does other than communications christian owns a helicopter various fast cars and most irksome a glider when christian explains that he works towards ridding world poverty through his companys initiatives in africa couldnt he start helping by ditching his private plane when christian brings ana to his apartment he makes her sign a nondisclosure agreement  scared what he reveals about himself will be an embarrassment for a public figure for the same reason filmmakers should staff the multiplexes and on their audience force the same arrangement

Nov 10 2018,negative, cigarettes 0  chardonnay 0  light beatings 1  lip bites 5  boob shots 5210 a good day saw daniel last night as he wanted to practice some knots he first learnt in the scouts says he wants to whip me into shape very excited as presume this means hes going to lend me his personal trainer sadly 50 shades of grey  which i watched today in preparation for going to see the sequel 50 shades darker  is not just unsexy but also quite dull it starts off with virginal anastasia ana steele dakota johnson  who we know is guileless and naive as shes wearing emily blunts frumpy cardigan from the girl on the train but must have an inner core of steel because thats her name  heading off to interview billionaire sex bomb christian grey jamie dornan for the student magazine first she falls into his office then she asks him questions in a boring monotone including whether hes gay and doesnt even react when he answers entirely in platitudes like many people born into a life of privilege it turns out his success is actually down to simple graft the harder i work the more luck seem i have he also exercises control in all things and hashtag sad some people dont think he has a heart at all yet for some reason he totally falls for her and she him its like an episode of the undateables but with people who really are undatable as they are so boring it always helps to be able to identify with the protagonist though and luckily for me although i have an aversion to both frumpy cardigans and light beatings ana turns out to be a thomas hardy fan for people unfamiliar with him he was an author who lived in dorset in 19th20th century england while a brilliant writer his books start off depressing melancholic and miserable and then get even sadder even the nice men turn out to be rape apologists flocks of sheep bought with lifesavings throw themselves off cliffs and women are slutshamed with village processions grey could learn a lot from hardys social commentary but doesnt ana works in a hardware store and grey turns up there to see her leading to a suggestive conversation about coveralls being naked for diy and cable ties a conversation which is cringy rather than wittily bantering and therein lies one of the problems with this film it just isnt funny its perfectly possible to make a film about sex that people dont laugh at but can laugh along with but even the funny lines of which there are a few fall flat anas pranking of grey when she gets birth control pills claiming shes not allowed to have sex for 4 weeks after starting them could raise some laughs but dornan plays grey as so humourless that they just sound embarrassing grey talks in banalities and truisms and likes to come out with ponderous utterances that are meant to mean something but have clearly been thought out hours before ready to drop into the conversation he also keeps answering questions in the wrong order or that ana hasnt asked yet so its like the film was edited by yoda and as one of those people for whom words matter i was profoundly irritated when he put her to bed after she vomited ana is concerned he might have done something to her but he replies that necrophilias not my thing shes asleep christian not dead what can i say im an exeditor ill put up with as much bdsm in movies as you like until they erroneously put an apostrophe on the drawer marked butt plugs there is a storyline involving an official contract that lays out exactly what grey the dominant can and cant do to ana the submissive but there is no subplot a subplot is the unsung hero of a film  and like cleaning a house its something nobody notices until its missing they never do sign that contract as by then its redundant but he still wants to punish her its when she asks why he wants to hurt her that we finally we get the films real title straight from the horses mouth 50 shades of fucked up still i can nearly always find something to like in a movie even if its just that one of the characters has a nice kitchen christian is good at knots ill say that for him and he can also plait hair who doesnt love a man who always has a condom and a hair bobble about his person the big playroom scene once things really get going is quite erotic when compared to the rest of the film with a sloweddown version of crazy in love playing in the background and hes got a nice kitchen but without giving what is basically a sexwithaddedstoryline flick too much influence the underlying themes are of a kind that need to be handled carefully although ana does get to amend their contract its still a hugely unequal power relationship and much of his behaviour is stalkerish which isnt romance grey is surprisingly unsexy even when his chopper makes an appearance he even has his own helicopter the script does dornan no favours johnson turns in the better performance once we move past the lipbiting  though she does a lot of throwing her head from side to side to indicate how turned on she is the nudity is very tasteful with lots of boobs and bums would i go to see the sequel if i didnt already have tickets probably not but im going now and yes i will tell you all about it
Aug 22 2018,negative, the good news is that its better than id expected the bad news is that its not as good as enraptured fans hoped it wasnt much of a stretch for fifty shades of grey filmmakers to create a movie that is superior to the books from a quality perspective even the most ardent fans acknowledge that the trilogy is awkward and poorly written at best but they loved the novels for the boundarybreaking sizzle and steam unfortunately those two elements are oddly lacking from the film okay i dont think followers of the franchise expected full frontal nudity or detailed cinematic play by plays of the sexy submissivedominant scenes but a few handcuffs spankings and a whole lot of sighs moans and lip biting hardly do the source material justice christian greys famous red room of pain must have at least a half a million dollars worth of accouterments in it yet he only uses a couple of them the most excited reaction i heard from viewers at the screening i attended came when christian took a bite out of a piece of toast the entire palate of the film was cool and gray which doesnt do much to incite passion and i dont think we should blame the actors dakota johnson as anastasia steele was actually adorable and endearing if jamie dornan as christian grey was a bit too aloof and dispassionate i think thats the fault of director sam taylorjohnson best known for nowhere boy an excellent film exploring john lennons teenage years she opted for a long slow pace with little drama or suspense its quite the challenge to make a boring movie from one of the hottest and most controversial book series to come along in decades but taylorjohnson seems to have been up for it oh the film looks good unlike the first twilight movies that just felt skimpy and cheesy the production design of fifty shades of grey shows that real money and effort were spent and a danny elfman score twilight never had it so good comparisons between the two franchises are inevitable since fifty shades of grey was originally written as twilight fan fiction a phenomena that escapes me in case its escaped you too fan fiction consists of ardent readers making up their own stories based on characters and situations in their favorite books in this case el james originally wrote christian and ana as edward and bella as a writer its beyond me who has time to write that sort of thing let alone read it but apparently el james is knows better than i because her efforts banked her hundreds of millions and counting fifty shades of grey will doubtless be a box office smash and ill have to sit through at least three more movies theyll divide the last book in two as you do these days and if it adds a little valentines day ardor to the economy and our lives who am i to complain products recommended by at home in hollywood are selected by our editorial team we often receive free samples of these products some of our features include affiliate or sponsored links if you buy something through one of these links we may earn an affiliate commission or other compensation
Aug 22 2018,negative, fifty shades of grey is that hot date you bring home to discover shes a cold fish between the sheets its that online hookup that gets you all hot and bothered with dirty talk on the internet and then turns out to be an uptight clean freak who asks you to take a long shower before doing the nasty and thinks bodily fluids are yucky in short its a stiff  for all the wrong reasons the longawaited screen adaptation of the first entry in novelist e l james insanely popular erotic trilogy is also very very gray the film opens with an unimaginative literalminded montage that kicks off with timelapse images of very gray clouds before salivating over every item in the titular characters possession neatly rolledup ties in his drawer custommade business suits hanging in his closet luxury cars parked in his garage theyre perfunctory glimpses of testosteronetinged affluence in what is ostensibly a femmedriven tale of a burgeoning sm relationship the sequence is a succinct introduction to studly magnate christian grey irish actor jamie dornan faring better than i expected and his blandly posh lifestyle its also all too representative of the film that follows glum astonishingly straitlaced yet also agreeably glossy working from a screenplay by kelly marcel director sam taylorjohnson nowhere boy also kills any mystery about this reserved billionaire when it should be withholding any peek at him rendering him a mundane master of the universe before he even gets an opportunity to introduce himself to us and our surrogate that would be english lit major anastasia steele dakota johnson the daughter of don johnson and melanie griffith who agrees to drive from the campus of washington state university to greys sleek seattle offices shes scheduled an interview of the 27yearold entrepreneur for her college newspaper something shes doing as a favor to her roommate kate eloise mumford who had scored the enviable sitdown after an inopportune cold takes her out of commission as meetcute devices go the oneonone is perfectly adequate to establish the power play that ensues which makes the way taylorjohnson bungles the scene that much more dismaying from a journalistic standpoint anastasia is all thumbs but were distracted more by the stilted staging than the characters awkwardness which is neither cute nor charming granted marcels dialogue which i gather from colleagues who have read the books was either taken verbatim from james prose or is otherwise faithful to it is all too willing to play all this silliness straight with some tonedeaf levity thrown in but theres still no reason why this crucial first encounter between the protagonists ought to feel so flatfooted its not just anastasia who literally trips her way into christians cushy office it takes considerable skill to handle subject matter this salacious in such chaste and decorous fashion and as such james softcore romance has been distilled into the easylistening equivalent of sadomasochism a slick coffee table book of a film for lapsed twihards ready to move on to the next level by the next level i mean a courtship that doesnt take three movies and change to get to actual intercourse and which doesnt fade to black once it reaches that milestone but the film flows along regardless thanks in large part to dornans intense gaze  think mr darcy by way of patrick bateman  and production designer david wascos impeccably assembled interiors the big black hole sucking all the life out of this watereddown conspicuously tame foray into sexual obsession is johnson the tv series ben and kate who overplays the ingenue routine in a way that makes it very difficult to buy her as a worthy standin for the films target audience think of the young charlotte gainsbourg then take away spine and moxie i could never fully surrender to anastasias journey of selfdiscovery because she fails to strike a balance between her inexperience in matters of the flesh  and the heart  and her romantic ideals at one point christian asks her if she considers herself a romantic and she replies im an english lit major you kind of have to be one a remark that a true romantic would never say where is her inner life what is it about say thomas hardys writing that made her want to study literature taylorjohnson and marcel leave us hanging in this regard and as a result johnsons anastasia is ultimately too much of a blank slate readers familiar with the novels know exactly how much of a blank slate she is but i will refrain from delving further with college graduation looming on the horizon christian comes into anastasias life at a significant crossroads but the film is too preoccupied with ensuring its surfaces are shiny and seductive to place her growing attraction toward this secretive suitor in the context of the transitional juncture shes experiencing even more disappointing the filmmakers have zero interest in exploring the class difference between the lovers an aspect that by all means should seep into their relationship but which is reduced to innocuous wish fulfillment one bright spot here marcia gay harden getting her grande dame game on as christians mom then theres fifty shades depiction of sm which ought to feel taboo and titillating but is anything but its a pipe dream of course to expect a truly adventurous filmmaker like catherine breillat or jane campion would have scored this directing gig but taylorjohnson should have done well to follow their lead in the way those directors use their characters body language to convey the shifting dynamics of their bond by comparison taylorjohnsons sex scenes even when theyre supposed to be kinky are generic and dull victorias secret photo spreads with peekaboo glimpses of pubic hair surfaces matter in an undertaking like a movie version of fifty shades of grey but there needs to be something resembling an erotic charge fueling those pretty images and this is what makes this such a perplexing letdown its telling that the films strongest scene is a business meeting which frames anastasia and christian at opposite ends of a conference room table negotiating the terms of whats deemed permissible in christians singular sexual predilections like the film theyre on its antiseptic and formal the cinematic equivalent of a firsttime job seeker embellishing hisher résumé in order to pass off as a pro but who are we kidding here this humorless flavorless concoction is smut and even worse its smut that thinks its high art an overeager date

Aug 21 2018,positive, well hello there mr grey i came saw and wouldnt mind seeing you again in part 2 jamie dornan and dakota johnson star as christian grey and anastasia steele in the film adaptation of 50 shades of grey did you even bother reading the book well if you did wow you have stamina and if you didnt you will be pleasantly surprised by what in my opinion was a poorly drafted trilogy of fan fiction turned into a visually aesthetically beautiful film with an above par soundtrack the story is that of billionaire christian grey interviewed for the college newspaper by sweet innocent virginal anastasia steele she falls for him and he tells her thats not his thing but shows her his playroom  not an x box in site but a myriad of whips rope etc he wants her all to himself but will she sign up to his version of love the direction is incredible along with the cinematography although there are too many rainthunder metaphorsthe scriptwriter deserves a medal and sam taylorwood directs with a firm hand showing that sexy doesnt have to mean naked bodies and sexual organs flailing all over the place for a film that is all about bdsm dominance and control the sexual tension and innuendos actually made me think back to old hollywood and an affair to remember  less is more and sometimes the viewer doesnt need to see everything to be turned on the weakest part of the film was in fact the character of christian grey jamie dornan didnt bring enough of that dark psychopathic brilliance from his time in the fall and beardless he just isnt very sexy consider this film as part 1  a familiar entrée  youve had it before but cant quite remember where and not as spicy but still tantalises the tastebuds part 2 and there will be a part 2 will bring the spice to awaken all your senses or at least that is the hope this is worth going to the cinema for leave your expectations behind and relax and enjoy a visually beautiful film 50 shades of grey is on general release everywhere in the uk we hope youre enjoying brwc you should check us out on our social channels subscribe to our newsletter and tell your friends  brwc is short for battleroyalewithcheese ros is as picky about what she watches as what she eats  she watches movies alone and dines solo too a new trend perhaps  as a self confessed scaredy cat ros doesnt watch horror films even goosebumps made her jump in parts
Aug 21 2018,negative, fifty shades of grey is one of the most highly anticipated valentines day films in history this film based on the book of the same name by el james according to entertainment weekly has already sold more advance tickets on fandango than any other rrated film in history with more than 100 million copies of the book sold the literary fan base is expecting a lot as is always the question can the movie version live up to the book and our imaginations james had input into who would adapt her first of the trilogy of what has been coined mommy porn using a female director sam taylorjohnson and a female writer kelly marcel this team of women attempts to tell the steamy story of anastasia steele and her dominant and powerful boyfriend christian grey for those of you all two of you out there that havent read the book heres the basic premise sweet innocent and virginal college senior anastasia meets the young handsome confident and successful christian grey an immediate attraction is evident but behind closed doors grey shows many shades of red the two find themselves in a relationship with sadomasochism at the core living out many womens fantasies with any relationship there is emotional baggage and the balance with this type of relationship can be devastating the movie version of fifty shades of grey follows the content of the book exactly although it does leave out some pretty steamy and provocative scenes such as the dinner party at greys parents home but following the book exactly doesnt make for the acceptable adaptation with millions of people having read the book the perfect anastasia and christian grey need to be cast while anastasia dakota johnson fits the bill grey jamie dornan does not anastasia embodies the virtues of sweetness and innocence with the willingness to lose her purity and this flows from the pages and onto the screen for all to see there is also a palpable chemistry initially between the two main characters grey jamie dornan is no doubt gorgeous with his chiseled body but his command and confidence is lackluster this confidence and dominance in the book is what sets him apart from everyone else and when you are missing that you are missing the entire point of the film the ambiance situations and descriptions of homes and rooms yes the red room are an identical representation their interactions in varying situations are also identical but the intensity behind these interactions although erotic become a bit mundane by the end yes the film borders on pornographic but modestly uses suggestive camera angles and cuts to keep it in the safe zone admittedly fifty shades of grey is not a literary masterpiece what it is is a vehicle of escapism for women of any age the film attempts to bring the book to life but sometimes your imagination is far superior and much more creative and fun that what can be acted out in the reality of a stage or a film while fifty shades of grey follows the book it lacks the intensity and rationale behind both of the characters dakota johnsons performance is adequate but dornans could have been replaced by a cardboard cutout as his interpretation was rather dare i say stiff did he read the book did he understand his character i dont think so you are going to see this film if youve read the book but be warned that it just doesnt live up to your imagination as one patron who screened the film early stated as we walked to the parking garage it was good enough yes it was good enough and the box office intake will be good enough i am sure to give a green light to starting production of the second film in the trilogy fifty shades darker
Apr 23 2018,negative, here that magical force is christians shady kink hes not into love hes into contractual relationships where pleasure is derived from a kind of pain and sense of control and virginal anastasia who seems to have spent her college years reading jane austen and emily bronte while avoiding marquis de sades more descriptive writings prefers even just the littlest bit of emotional bond while in bondage  fifty shades of grey is famous for its steamy bits however if there is one exchange of dialogue that sums up the basic allure of the film it is the one delivered by the frustrated lovers while in one of their protracted arguments about their indescribable relationship  in reply christian nonchalantly declares that it is not him who is changing her but that she is the one who is changing him this is the ultimate fantasy of many a lover to mold one person from one stereotype to another to melt the stoic and unfeeling hero into a puddle of vapid sweetness in a way sam taylorjohnson seems to be the perfect director for the job of visualizing this fantasy her most famous work entitled crying men a series of photographs of various famous actors shedding tears is enchanting mainly because of the way it breaks hollywoods veneer of masculinity by passionate imagery this is exactly what she does to christian she commits to turning the character into this caricature of macho mysteriousness only to emphasize how anastasia who seems to be the epitome of ordinariness can turn his world of strict and specific desires upsidedown the sex is really just there to separate the romance from the rest it is the spectacle to the veil the superfluous the forbidden cherry on top of the runofthemill pastry  unfortunately it is in the portrayal of this spectacle where taylorjohnson clearly falters the sex scenes in fifty shades of grey are tepid at best visualized and edited to look and feel like music videos for the corny pop songs that dominate the films soundtrack  they have the glossy quality of those romance book covers merely suggestive of the libidinous intent but safe enough to be seen by curious kids prancing around the bookstore taylorjohnson has done more risqué work her contribution to destricted 2006 entitled death valley had a man pleasuring himself to climax in the middle of the titular desert all in the name of blurring the line between art and pornography  it seems that taylorjohnsons brush with a more mainstream material that targets a wider market has forced her to be more careful with regard to sexual expression turning her adaptation of fifty shades of grey into erotica that has been blandly adorned by tastefulness it truly is a problematic film probably even more problematic than its divisive source material which makes it such an intriguing aberration fifty shades of grey has all the makings of a bad film its good parts are always tempered by mediocrity for example johnsons heartfelt performance is always accompanied by dornans wooden showing its drama feels oddly humorous but its sexy bits which could have been salvaged by a bit of comedy are abysmally devoid of humanity the film simply never gets anything right despite that fifty shades of grey succeeds in getting you hooked thus when the leads enigmatically call each others names as the elevator door closes separating them until the next awaited instalment one cant help but understand the audiences collective gasps and shrieks of disbelief and disappointment
Mar 17 2018,negative,among the many mindbogglingly implausible fantasies fifty shades of grey sells the one i think that most accounts for its popularity is the promise that shame of sexual sin can be alleviated by surrendering to it more fully
Jan 26 2018,neutral,the second half of the film devolves into something that resembles tedious melodramatic daytime tv
Jan 12 2018,negative,grey is not a character but a cluster of clichés full review in spanish
Jan 12 2018,negative,its superficial its manipulative its offputting and embarrassing but theres no denying that this says something about the moment in which the book was published and the movie released
Dec 2 2017,negative, not even five minutes into fifty shades of grey is a scene where anastasia steele trips and falls entering christian greys fancy meeting room and it just has to be symbolic that this entire movie will unravel as a disaster of cataclysmic proportions within a matter of minutes the ravishingly young rich business magnate becomes inexplicably fascinated with the young socially awkward college graduate and that right there is the biggest problem in a film that has multiple crippling flaws none of this erotic romance feels natural plausible or mentally healthy from a behavioral standpoint its actually appalling that some women find a film that glorifies submissiveness and pseudorape empowering and something worth fantasizing about all movies need a character with a plight to invest in and root for whether its a goodie twoshoes protagonist or a gripping antihero yet here any attempt at constructing even the most basic narrative is absent fifty shades of grey is just two hours of one girl experimenting all sorts of sordid sexual activity with a corrupted mind that repeatedly states he doesnt enjoy love but rather dominance and abusive control if the movie actively tried to explore greys mental deficiencies occasionally it does but every time it is just a one line in passing that is never expanded on and paint the picture of a man truly broken on the inside in need of healing maybe it would be easier to buy into annas sympathies then again maybe it wouldnt because jamie dornan cant even property deliver the minimal emotional dialogue that does exist without sounding like a robot the story is simply far too concerned with going from sex scene to scene instead of doing something that would make audiences care speaking of those for a movie that is based on an erotic novel that steamrolled to mainstream adoration because of its kinkiness the adaptation is tame and safe with its depiction of greys fun many of the more risqué scenes are outright cut from the book leaving us with a litany of monotonous sex scenes that all just boil down to anna getting tied up and spanked with something essentially if the core demographic is coming out in droves for titillation theyre probably going to be leaving extremely disappointed jamie dornan doesnt even show his dinker donker but dakota johnson is admirably game to bear all if anything the movie is more stimulating for men with the hots for dakota realistically though it is a given that the narrative to fifty shades of grey would be complete trash considering the novel started out as twilight fanfiction but how the absurdity would actually translate to the screen though was always going to be an interesting discovery basically that too is a mess since the script is abysmally bad filled with shakespearean dialogue such as i wont touch you until i have your written consent and i dont make love i f hard worse is that the the acting from everyone involved is played deadly serious also coming across unintentionally hilarious the comical aspect quickly dissipates too though as the movie descends into relentless boredom whats baffling is that despite how horrific everything else is the movie does have some imaginative set design for greys office and penthouse decorating the rooms with various artdeco paintings a piano beautiful white walls juxtaposed with black floor tiling and more director sam taylorjohnson also isnt afraid to get creative tinting different scenes with color nudity isnt the only pleasant sight here as fifty shades of grey is actually directed with competence and is nice to look at you can credit sam taylorjohnson for not taking the easy paycheck and giving her all to inject some life into this abomination but at the end of the day she was tasked with adapting shallow trash you can polish a turd gold but you cant remove the smell robert kojder  an aficionado of film wrestling and gaming he currently writes for flickering myth we got this covered and wrestle enigma follow me on twitter

Nov 8 2017,positive, if it appeared on mens doorsteps would it resemble something they know and like or would those fleshy fantasies be terrifying  or worse make them feel small in all senses of the word student journalist anastasia steele dakota johnson interviews enigmatic billionaire christian grey jamie dornan they are sexually attracted to each other but he speaks of his dark secret coming between them eventually he opens up telling her that unless she becomes his submissive in a sadomasochistic relationship they cannot have a relationship grey jamie dornan of grey enterprise holdings is a billionaire industrialist pilot pianist and philanthropist your everyday batmanelon musk combination but much much more betterlooking so put a check mark next to the box marked intimidatingly outsized the amount of luxury porn on display here aircraft servants gliders limos apartments the size of olympic villages makes rap videos look pauperish director sam taylorjohnson nowhere boy 2009 and writer kelly marcel make clear that steele dakota johnson is not too feminist soak up the pampering the way into steeles heart and elsewhere on her body is by sweeping her off her feet literally with a helicopter ride over the city judge her for her shallow wants but the films visual style states that this is a fantasy as much a fairy tale as cinderella or sleeping beauty butlers and chauffeurs hover invisibly they couple sweatlessly his fingers are magical sexwands these scenes left unmarred by the media development authority thank you mda are long and by singapore cinema standards boundarypushing they are vital to the story without them this film would be about 30 minutes shorter and make much less sense like its source material the novel of the same title and its inspiration the twilight series the movie draws on very old stories about innocent girls dark forests and big bad wolves with sharp teeth so there is an awful lot of rosetinted nostalgia here for a time when women sat passively while powerful men threw wealth at them but the interesting difference here is that the power dynamic between red riding hood and the wolf shifts steele knows her own sexual power she negotiates she questions greys assumptions that his pleasure comes first and hers will flow naturally from it that backandforth depicted somewhat literally as a dance is sexualised and director taylor makes it work
Oct 30 2017,positive, i had to travel all the way to berlin for a preview screening of fifty shades of grey and it was there in the city of weimarera decadence and cabaretstyle naughtiness that i discovered three things  first that anastasia steele the innocent young vancouver student who falls for the fatally charismatic billionaire christian grey no longer says holy cp or holy cow as she so tiresomely seemed to every second page in e l jamess raunchy bestseller this is a definite improvement although she does still provocatively bite her lip a lot second that there is surprisingly little sex in this otherwise fairly faithful adaptation of a book that has sold more than 100 million copies largely on the back of its explicit scenes of deflowering instruction and socalled bdsm bondage discipline sadomasochism sex  on screen we wait the best part of half an hour for anyone to get their kit off at all although we do get to see anastasia sucking suggestively on a pencil bearing the name grey it gets a laugh this sex shortage is definitely unexpected and the conventional modestypreserving shooting of what scenes there are is likely to be something of a disappointment particularly for men dragged along by wives and girlfriends but also perhaps for some of the women who make up the books predominantly female fan base  the notorious tampon scene for instance is conspicuous only by its absence in a film which far from breaking new boundaries is actually heavy with the whiff of what james would dismiss as the vanilla this is a film that has been made to be seen rather than shock but the third and final thing i discovered is that shortage of exotic shenanigans apart artistturneddirector sam taylorjohnson has delivered a decently acted and technically wellmade adaptation of what remains a fundamentally silly and at times simply rather unpleasant story  perhaps to stop us noticing this too soon taylorjohnson who made the john lennon biopic nowhere boy employs music particularly effectively  think annie lennox singing i put a spell on you ellie gouldings love me like you do and perhaps inevitably beyoncés crazy in love and you get the general hotunderthecollar idea the overall effect is likely to be divisive if you liked the book  and tens of millions of women seemed to  this is not just the faithful film of that book but also a film made by women for women  if it lacks the sort of sexual content that would have turned it either into hardcore pornography or a 21st century version of emmanuelle its because taylorjohnson screenplay writer kelly marcel and james herself who has had a handson role as one of the films producers decided that it should only the box office will be able to prove them wrong if you havent read the book however i cant see the film version doing much for you particularly once the giggles of the first half hour  ok rope tape cableties youre the perfect serial killer  make way for the tedium of the endless contract negotiations between greys dominant and the submissive role he wants anastasia to adopt as a voiceover launched into the complex terms of that contract i have never seen more people in a cinema audience suddenly decide it was time to go to the loo you could tell theyd read the book more girlnextdoor pretty than hollywood beautiful blessed with a neat real body rather than a hollywood fantasy one and certainly helped by marcels finetuning of anastasias character she brings a lowkey naturalness to a role that almost redefines the word challenging one minute anastasia is in a smart dress graduating from college the next shes starknaked handcuffed to a metal frame and being whipped with a riding crop in other directorial hands  male hands for instance  this could easily have been exploitative but you can see that taylorjohnson has looked after johnson both onset and in the editing suite  the northern irish actor jamie dornan has a tougher time as grey not least because hes playing such a preposterous figure  the billionaire businessman philanthropist helicopter and glider pilot and concertlevel pianist who dances like a dream and is a fully fledged sexual deviant of course  shorn of the beard he wore for the fall on tv he played the sexually motivated serial killer so 50 shades definitely makes it two creeps in a row dornan looks like a younger colin firth but doesnt yet have his screen charisma  but then he is playing a damaged controlfreak im 50 shades of fup who is seeking to embark on an abusive relationship with a younger and less experienced woman so its hardly dornans fault that we end up not liking grey not least of course because anastasia is heading the same way films about sadomasochism are always difficult  secretary from 2002 was a decidedly awkward watch and lets not even mention madonna in guy ritchies muchvilified swept away  but given the problems presented by the original material taylorjohnson can walk away with her head high knowing she has done a decent competent job if not necessarily a great one 
Oct 18 2017,positive, there are so many conversations we could potentially have about fifty shades of grey the film adaptation of el jamess wildly popular romance novel we could talk about its roots as twilight fanfiction and whether or not publishing a derivative work that originates as a free piece of fan service is right or not it isnt but so far ive only seen it happen in genres where demand outweighs supply like romance and young adult so i understand why it happenspublishers are desperate for material for enormous markets or we could talk about the extremely fucked up sexual politics at the center of the story except other people are already on that or we could talk about the hopelessness of adapting garbage source material except i dont believe in that every movie regardless of its source has the potential to be good whats more we should want them all to be good rooting against a movie being good is insanewhy bother liking movies at all so lets just talk about fifty shades of grey for what it isa mediocre movie its not that bad at times it drifts into serious secondhand embarrassment territory and it is not anything id defend as high art or even particularly interesting if you want to see an interesting thoughtful exploration of female sexuality and power dynamics please see the duke of burgundy but it isnt terrible ive seen way worse movies aimed at men and boys so i think everyone can chill out about a mediocre movie aimed at women take away all the external issues referenced above and what youre left with is a middling movie about a young womans sexual awakening whose biggest problem is bad dialogue and a sometimeslacking male lead jamie dornan the fall stars as christian grey the debonair billionaire with a bdsm kink and while hes handsome enough to carry off the suits and glamour of greys world his performance is too stiff and lacks the confidence necessary to believe hes an irresistible sex god there are moments when dornan manages authenticity particularly when he finds out that the object of his taboo affections anastasia steele is a virgin and he is horrified that he just showed her his bdsm playroom incorrectly assuming she had a foundation from which to understand his fetish but at almost every other moment dornan physically struggles with his irish accentseriously filmmakers just let the accent thing go unless its absolutely necessary to cover it the narrative even establishes that grey is adopted so having an irish accent would be perfectly acceptablehe does not have to sound like the rest of his family but the accent is only part of dornans problem hes clearly not comfortable with the material to make something like fifty shades worka cinderella fantasy dressed up in fetish gearyou have to commit to the premise dornan fails to commit his female costar however does not dakota johnson was wonderful on the shortlived sitcom ben and kate and the sparkle and wit that made her a delight on that show is in full evidence here she manages to turn a basic mary sue into an actual person and better johnson endows anastasia with more agency and selfawareness than she has in the source material there is still a problematic element to anastasia and greys relationshiphis highhandedness is outright stalker behaviorbut johnson puts enough well steel into anastasia to sell her willingness to explore greys world as well as her disastrous exit from it its depressing that we have to ask that the female lead in a movie about female sexuality not be a victimized doormat but it does feel like a small victory that anastasia doesnt come off as a victimized doormat director sam taylorjohnson nowhere boy and screenwriter kelly marcel saving mr banks deserve a lot of credit for making fifty shades work at all taylorjohnson doesnt do anthing revolutionary but her direction is more than serviceable the only thing that falls short of acceptable is the lighting which is flat and boring taking the grey theme too far the cold lighting leaches all depth from the scenery giving the movie a cheap tv look despite its real estate porny settings and highend product placement the only scene with any visual dynamism is the conference room scene in which anastasia and grey negotiate her submissive contractthanks to a deep red lighting schemeand johnsons sly intonationsthat scene pops with energy would that the rest of the movie had similar verve
Sep 20 2017,positive, the skinny literature undergrad anastasia steele johnson is swept off her feet by handsome billionaire christian grey dornan she soon learns that her dashing beau has a secret obsession that will require her to submit completely to his whims can she find true love with such a demanding paramour can he learn to accept her independent streak just what are they getting up to hear me now and believe me later johnson and dornan have huge scientifictype beakers full of it hes hydrogen sulfide shes nitric acid and when you mix them together they explode off the screen basically fifty shades of grey is a sort of companion piece to the twilight movies as you may or may not know the author of the fifty shades books el james started off writing twilight fan fiction as a huge twilight fan i was tickled to see all the ways this story of a dumb little chick in lust with a billionaire mirrored the story of bella and her sparkly vampire boyfriend edward for starters johnson and dornan look a lot like stewart and pattinson beyond that the development of anastasias and christians relationship is almost comically similar to bellas and edwards which reminds me  this movie has kinky sex not having read the books i was expecting fifty shades to be tawdry exploitative and dumb but its anything but it also helps that this is one of the most beautifullyshot films ive seen in a while  its shot like one giant commercial for itself this dude has shot everything from atonement to the avengers and the flick is worth seeing just to bask in the beautiful images he has created its not politically correct but it mines a deeper sort of truth women do fall for men like christian  rich handsome and wicked how could anyone possibly deny it leave the kids at home and have a ball with your partner or your pals i went with my date jeanmarie and we giggled the whole way through set to an achingly sensuous remix of beyonces crazy in love it revealed such a brief yet seductive taste of the fifty shades universe i was instantly fearful the actual movie wouldnt be able to match up while devouring the book trilogy before the movie was cast i was imagining robert pattinson and emma roberts  who were both rumoured to be involved  in the lead roles on all the occasions theyve had to appear together to promote the movie they have looked like theyd rather be anywhere but standing next to each other even though an arsenal of apparatus like floggers ropes handcuffs and belts from christians red room of pain make cameos the supposedly controversial sex scenes are thankfully far from graphic which explains why the film was passed uncut and deliver the right amount of eroticism it explores and unravels a complicated disturbing dominantsubmissive relationship involving issues of control trust rewards and punishments where there is no black and white only  you guessed it  shades of grey the abrupt ending may come across as anticlimactic but it will whet fans appetites for the sequels to come the only torture here is in the waiting
Aug 16 2017,neutral,the retention of the style of the book and its settings merges with a cinematic story more focused on buildup than execution
Aug 14 2017,positive, for a film about a dreamy billionaire christian grey jamie dornan who persuades the virginal anastasia dakota johnson to become his submissive in a domsub relationship fifty shades of grey is far more interested in anastasias thoughts and conscious decisions than it is in developing christian into someone with even a semblance of a personality at every step of their budding relationship director sam taylorjohnson nowhere boy emphasizes anastasias choices her curiosity and her control she may agree to be spanked but its more about her genuine sexual curiosity than bending to her lovers will the films a hell of a ride often a fun and thoughtprovoking one even though its all such camp but theres so much talent here  between johnson taylorjohnson and the excellent but underused supporting cast of jennifer ehle and marcia gay harden  wasted on an often stupid script thats unintentionally funny as frequently as it is intentionally funny the first half of the film is effectively a subversive romantic comedy he is a fantasy she is a real person they meetcute at the headquarters of his business empire where shes been sent in her roommates stead to conduct an interview for the school newspaper his formal manner tailored suits wealth and taste for modern design are meant as standins for some kind of sophistication that his vocabulary belies he finds anastasias clumsy open schoolgirl demeanor  insisting he call her ana when he addresses her as miss steele  and probing questions disarming so he makes sure they meet again  being a beautiful billionaire though were expected to excuse his borderline creepy stalker behaviour his advances are certainly welcomed when he just so happens to find himself in the hardware store where she works  he purchases hilariously rope and ties  sparks start to fly with flirtatious banter christian is the king of mixed messages insisting he doesnt do romance while constantly making big romantic gestures  whether its sending englishliterature major anastasia a first edition of her favourite book or taking her on an impromptu helicopter ride he even plays the knightinshining armour rescuing a drunk ana from a bar before tending to her vomit and hangover he spends the other half of their time together pushing her away telling her hes bad news that they cant be together anastasia is always calling him on it  apparently she never learned that you should listen when people tell you who they are  questioning the rules he insists she play by and ultimately kickstarting their real romance by drunkdialing him to scold him for his hot and cold behaviour his predilection for bdsm means he claims he wont touch her until she signs a contract but even when she asks for a business meeting and we can see her practically vibrating with the desire to have him ravish her she maintains control and walks out if he wants to have rules shes going to have a few of her own although its only a sortof sexy film  nothing in it comes close to the eroticism of laundering lingerie in the duke of burgundy  and a fairly tame one for bdsm at that  there isnt even a human toilet  its a very tactile film when were not watching closeups of characters faces flushed with emotion or pleasure were usually seeing something being touched up close a hand grasping a teacup a whip caressing the skin before being cracked or christians hands sliding up and down anastasias body their first sex scene is backlit to emphasize her golden skin and leg hair every hair is standing up every graze registering the image of anastasias hands being bound during sex  whether with a silk tie or leather cuffs  is not a degrading one physically unable to participate to give him pleasure means everything is about her ecstasy as she throws her head back and bites her lip even when not bound he wont let her do so much as caress his back so deeprooted are his intimacy issues then again this spares her having to do any work  another part of the fantasy although how she can ever fall in love with him given theres nothing twosided about this relationship is a little hard to swallow  no matter how many orgasms he magically gives her without instruction or serious feedback their relationship seems to involve little more than frequent sex and expensive dinners they never actually talk even as anastasia begs christian to open up christian is an outdated stereotype  the stoic damaged rich tall dark tortured and handsome figure  who can only be changed by the love of a good woman all we get are some burn scars on his chest and a short sob story about his crack addict birth mom who died when he was four to explain his kinky proclivities he is as miriam bale put it the male manic pixie dream girl in a day and age when we should be celebrating men who actually express emotion that crying and sharing is sexy christian is practically don draper minus the obvious intelligence or playfulness or complicated emotional issues why cast marcia gay harden as his adoptive mother if youre not going to give her a fighting chance to help give him depth part of christians appeal of course is that only anastasia can break through his bad boy defenses  its supposed to be an honour but in real life its a sign to run the hell away yet his stereotypical blandness is a useful role reversal isnt this how were used to seeing women portrayed which we accept without batting an eye but people are likely to get more upset about a twodimensional oldfashioned stereotype of a man perhaps this will generate a useful dialogue about this doublestandard for female and male parts in mainstream movies its still a missed opportunity though with a woman this interesting she deserves a man who can keep up with her and challenge her outside the bedroom yet this is never christians film dont be fooled by how frequently anastasias nipples or tuchus are on display while we never get more than a bit of pubic hair and bare chest from christian this is anastasias film shes the threedimensional character we identify with the one with feelings whos genuinely confused and shes the reason christian finds himself confused breaking half of his silly and delusional rules because he secretly craves intimacy with this woman but hes so lacking in selfawareness that he doesnt understand how hes selfsabotaging or that he can be intimate without sacrificing his stupid sense of identity  is being emotionally stunted really something worth holding onto the countless times that taylorjohnson shows anastasia emerging from or entering into an elevator throughout the film had me frequently thinking back to the season two finale of the good wife when the titular alicia florrick finally decides to sleep with her boss but first she steps onto an elevator in the hotel on which all the buttons have been pushed every time the elevator stops at a new floor its an opportunity for her to leave to turn back she has to keep making the decision to go forward with her plan over and over and over again and its ultimately alicia who has to open the door to the hotel room theyre headed toward its all about alicias consent and agency similarly taylorjohnson is persistently giving anastasia an out a door to walk through that she must deliberately choose to enter or open even when she first walks into christians office she has to open the door herself as christian starts to insist more and more that bondage and sm become part of their bedroom experience  or rather their sexual exchanges in his allred playroom filled with sexual props  theres a playfulness to it he offers her a small taste checking first that she agrees and then wont proceed until she asks for more the second half of the film when the couple start to get serious about their bdsm is when things fall apart she keeps pushing him on why a domsub relationship is so important to him and the way she chooses to have him explain it to her is beyond idiotic and absurd theres no denying that hes opened her up to parts of her sexuality she may not have otherwise explored but if the reason for it is because he  and he actually fucking says this  is fifty shades of fucked up how is that a valuable service why must the film insist that she cant enjoy this in a healthy way christian seems to believe that deflowering anastasia shouldnt involve a domsub relationship but something gentler and sweeter they appear to make love even though he claims he only fuckshard if hes got it in him and hes attracted to her because shes forcing him to feel these things called feelings why is he so insistent on pushing anastasia to be his well consenting property his behaviour proves erratic but we never really get a sense of personal conflict that maybe hes being forced to do emotional work he cant cope with i guess you have to wait for the sequel if you want to see actual character growth and its a shame because what johnson brings to the part is not just a believable innocence and pluck but playfulness and emotional maturity when christian first ties up her hands with one of his grey silk ties she giggles at the roleplaying shes submitting on her terms aware that shes still got control even though christian is such an insufferably emotionally controlling guy i suppose part of the point of the story is that christian is such a cypher but when they go flying in a glider much like the one pierce brosnan piloted in the thomas crown affair i couldnt help but wonder how much more alive and enduring the film could be if christian had half the wit of brosnans thomas crown even taylorjohnsons direction is playful consider that all the secretaries in christians office dress in grey shirts and even emails and text messages get sent on a grey background how much better could the film be if there was this kind of humanity on display more frequently in their relationship from both characters after all it really does take two to tango and one of them cant be holding the camera

Aug 1 2017,negative, theres not much of a point in reviewing fifty shades the movie outside the context of fifty shades the phenomenon i dont want to condemn what other people get their jollies from and i think its remarkable that media has the power to change audiences perceptions of their own sexuality unfortunately fifty shades conflates sexuality of any kind with agency and as much as id like to think that everyone viewing or reading it does so with critical distance that seems awfully optimistic when i remember how 19yearold carolyn didnt think twice about christian greys patently abusive behavior or when i consider how the littletwilightfanficthatcould has created an unhealthy and inaccurate popular perception of kink sure there are people who enjoy aspects of fifty shades while also criticizing its glorification of domestic abuse but there are also people who will pay 12397 to get the christian grey experience to recap the christian grey experience depicted in the books and to some extent in the movie includes but is not limited to stalking gaslighting manipulation forced alienation from ones friends and family and rape threats none of those behaviors are part of bdsm none of those behaviors are acceptable in a relationship fifty shades the movie presents a less explicitly abusive dynamic than the first fifty shades book but thats in no way an endorsement of the film if anything that just makes its influence scarier ive gotta hand it to dakota johnson thoughgirl does a really good job of making something out of nothing el james ana is basically just a placeholder but johnson is funny warm sympathetic and smart i cant wait to see her in a more deserving movie the book insinuated that ana was a prude for hesitating to indulge her mans singular tastes but johnson as an actor seems so obviously critical of the movies message that her reluctance actually makes christian look a little bit like the unattractive jerk he is if theres one redeeming grace in fifty shades the movie that the book was lacking its that johnsons surprisingly awesome performance allows the audience to look at ana and see an actual woman an actual woman whose boyfriend punishes her for visiting family an actual woman who has her house broken into because shes reluctant to sleep with a man an actual woman guilted into thinking she has a duty to fix her abuser jamie dornan is fine i guess its hard to critique his performance when the character as written doesnt do much aside from fume and wear the worlds lowest jeans dornans core however is clearly vying for an oscar the man has a back like a bag full of snakes about that nudity although the human cheesegrater stays safe in his magical floating pants for most of the film ana is naked more often than not you could argue thats illustrative of the pairs subdom relationship but since as roxane gay puts it fifty shades is to bdsm as mcdonalds is to real food its more likely that anas physical exposure is just another indicator of the dangerous double standard upon which the entire franchise and twilight before it is built if fifty shades of grey was about a woman who surprised her boyfriendofseveralweeks by flying out to his parents house or breaking into his apartment it wouldnt have been made into a movie or at least not one released on valentines day a toxic woman is a scary or funny trope men with the exact same behaviors are deemed romantic the movie spouts a lot of fuckedup misinformation about bdsm and for a movie thats ostensibly prosex it sure is obsessed with abstinence but more than anything else its a reminder of how easy it is to be a man  fifty shades of grey is so much smarter than its source material but smarter in this case doesnt mean better not where it counts at least the movie is savvy enough to know how to use el james terrible prose as a comedic device but just because the film wants its audience to recognize the ridiculousness of laters baby doesnt mean that christian himself is supposed to seem anything less than ideal thats where the scary potential of this adaptation lies it initially presents itself as an ironic so bad its good experience but when the shit hits the fan it hits hard without any point of comparison anas abuse can seem like part of the joke or worse unremarkable theres a scene near the beginning of the movie where christian tells ana he had no choice but to undress her while she was unconscious before putting her to bed because sleeping in your streetclothes is deadly i guess but he had a choice and so do you dont see this movienot because it isnt sexy enjoyable and fun but because its businessasusual misogyny in insidious beefcake packaging and because space bees nothing says valentines day like space bees right
Jun 27 2017,negative, another distraction sometimes welcome sometimes not the squealing toddler in the row behind  she was there with her parents and an older sibling who looked to be about 7 or 8 odd family outing but who am i to judge  i once made a boyfriend take me to see how the west was won on valentines day anyway if youre one of the few who doesnt know about fifty shades its based on an erotic bestseller which subsequently spawned two sequels about awell see a few paragraphs above her name notwithstanding anastasia steele dakota johnson is a pliant young woman who meets mysterious zillionaire christian grey jamie dornan when she subs for her flustricken roomie who was supposed to interview him for the school paper or something like that  it hardly matters  what does matter is that the two enter into a sexual relationship that involves literal ties that bind among other things as this sort of thing goes in movies i think mickey rourke kim basinger and the contents of a wellstocked fridge had a lot more heat in 9 12 weeks poor dornan was a lastminute replacement and he plays grey well  as a lastminute replacement hes a powderpuff pretending to be a wrecking ball perhaps his next career movie will be a turn in the bachelor something about him suggests that doeeyed heroines  nonanimated version  dont come much doeiereyed than johnson  dressed in the 21stcentury equivalent of librarianchic her huge eyes hidden by an introverts bangs shes just fine whats important is that she understands completely how the character must function and she embracesrather than condescends to   the role  harder to do than you might think lineage could be the key though bestknown as the daughter of don johnson and melanie griffith johnson has more steel in her veins than you may realize she is also the granddaughter of tippi hedren the woman who survived alfred hitchcock not once but twice  a little bondage in the bedroom is not likely to do her  or her career  in harder to do than you might think  hilarious  i suppose sooner or later every actor finds themselves in a role that begs to be condescended to and must resist that temptation  a little like the old joke about the dialogue between a masochist and a true sadist  hurt me i refuse saportareport founded in february 2009 is a trusted voice in metro atlanta through the years we have become atlantas authoritative civic website our readers are engaged in atlantas most pressing issues and want to hear directly from leading companies and nonprofits in the region we give those organizations a platform to share their messages and interact with informed atlantans
May 31 2017,negative, a film that captures the moment and goes on to become something that women will love for ever it lodges in the heart as a fivestar classic a fourhankie weepie an unforgettable experience for the audience fifty shades of grey is not that kind of film despite the hype and the sex scenes filmed in fullscreen buttockarama the most anticipated release of the year is not much more than a spanking great bore fans were promised lashings  literally  of passion and piping hot sex from this adaptation of the multimillionselling erotic novel by el james who attended the world premiere in berlin last night with the movies director and stars yes this fifty shades of grim might have its titillating moments but it just goes on and on and on for no good reason before ending in an abrupt and unsatisfactory way  the very definition of bad sex not good part of the difficulty is the lack of sexual chemistry between the two leads this is a particularly acute problem in a tale of two lovers exploring a relationship that takes in the wilder shores of bondage submission dominance and terrible dialogue sitting through the turgid and tedious sm melodrama that is fifty shades of grey may feel like its own form of torture those looking for hot kinky sex will be disappointed fewer than 15 of the movies 125 minutes feature sex scenes the dialogue is laughable the pacing is sluggish and the performances are onenote worst of all the chemistry is nil between jamie dornan and dakota johnson dornan spends most of his time frowning while johnson stares vacantly and bites her lip it has stripped away the fun and settled on palatable there have been perfume commercials with more depth and story arc we may have been curious going in but by the time the credits roll theres another question that springs to mind is that all there is fifty shades is a lot tamer than it could have been dornan a god on earth with a wobbly american accent is forced to play the same notes over and over which i dont mind watching him do but he begins to seem bored the films plotlessness becomes a burden in the last 20 or so minutes when something like a climax is needed but all the film can muster is yet another argument this is a turnoff  every time a sex scene comes on some lady starts singing a big whooshy sex scene song hello beyonce    it will work better as home entertainment when each viewer can race past the blahblah about how well christian plays the piano and pause on the fleeting image of the man minus his pants both actors do strip    but anyone hoping the movie would really push the sm envelope may find christians tastefully shot toy room a little    vanilla we see a whip here a handcuff there but nothing that would shock even newcomers the mediocre plot bland characters and tepid tone dont do any favours the result is a boring drawnout call to a sex dungeon that takes an indeterminable time to arrive they tear through this tale of raw passion like a couple of drippy teens with neither party exhibiting the kind of dark sensuality needed to make this romcom with extra dom even halfway believable im not exactly jumping at the opportunity to get whipped and chained in your red room of pain ana chirrups at one point as if contemplating tidying her knicker drawer that was nice she says after taking a bit of a thrashing from grey nice youd think hed just given her a halfhearted peppermint foot rub meanwhile greys eyes are supposed to blaze with seething lust all the time but he just looks as if hes suffering from trapped wind nurse fetch the tums it is true that this hollywood adaptation is not as bad as the books even their most devoted fans would probably admit they were often clumsily written teenstyle steamy fiction british director sam taylorjohnson has sliced through the worst of the dialogue but overcompensated by making the film all too tasteful and ponderous like an empty collection of slightly pervy but beautifully shot perfume adverts poor dakota  the daughter of actors don johnson and melanie griffith  is often naked with a high nipple count lots of buttock shots and occasional flash of front bottom jamie gets to keep his jeans on a lot which hardly seems fair or feminist although we do get to see his impressive bottom rippling with muscles like a bag of walnuts of christian greys fabled manhood which features so much in the books there is no sight greys only hardware on show is his monogrammed helicopter his glider and his collection of fancy cars still what else could sam taylorjohnson do the film of fifty shades had a difficult inception with a number of actors directors writers and key personnel all being changed at short notice british screenwriter patrick marber was drafted in to beef up the script then author el james threw out all his work and reinserted her own dialogue she is famously proprietorial about fifty shades  and why not despite the fact that the books have little literary merit she knows what her readers want sex  and lots of it exploring the world of bondage domination sadism and masochism bdsm might seem daring but to be honest the mass market appeal of 50 shades is strictly old fashioned the books struck a chord with women who want that timeless fantasy  to be swept away from their humdrum lives by a tide of passion over which they have no control these are presumably the kind of women who see beyonce and madonna turning the simplest pop song into a leatherclad psychosexual performance and perhaps want some of that too but might it be the case that this story is not really about sexual desire but about the desire to be dominated by a handsome rich prince charming what el james has written is cinderella retooled for a more sexualised age anas pumpkin coach is christians helicopter her glass slipper is his silk blindfold there is even a postcoital scene in the film where ana is happily frying bacon wearing one of his shirts with her hair tied up in a fetching topknot how many times have we seen that before are your xboxes in there she wonders the red room of pain where the tyingsup take place  infamous for those who have read the books  looks like a pilates gym designed by smythson all sleek cherry leather and shiny clasps there are mysterious instruments hung on the walls whips and manacles yes but what are the rest  squirrel tails that feather duster from downton abbey a paddle two bread boards meanwhile there is some hanky panky with ice cubes and a bit of ever so tasteful slowmotion peacockfeathertickling that will remind many women not of their libido but the fact that their mantelpiece could do with a dust and in the end of this modern sexually adventurous load of nonsense the hero throws the heroine over his knee and gives her a good spanking
Apr 26 2017,positive, if you go to a lot of hollywood screenings you know theres a special trembling in the air when the audience expects the movie to be good but the air couldnt have been deader at the fifty shades of grey preview last night at the arclight yes you heard a few scattered female whoops when the film finally started but until then every person you talked to had a bad feeling wed all heard reports that stars dakota johnson and jamie dornan had no chemistry wed heard that director sam taylorjohnson didnt see eyetoeye with e l james the author of the original books as if that werent enough the whole enterprise seemed ripe for disaster at the best of times its hard to adapt a popular novel for the screen and here was a massive bestseller stuffed with scads of bdsm actionthis in an era when hollywood movies have become all spandex and no sex small wonder we were all on flopwatch critics prepared their snide jokes in advance id already worked up a riff on the history of lousy sex movies then the lights went down and guess what fifty shades of grey turned out to be not just entertainingat least until the clunky exasperating final minutebut it also knows exactly what its doing as youre doubtless aware its the story of a virginal romantic english major anastasia steele dakota johnson who gets involved with a handsome uptight controlling billionaire christian grey jamie dornan who doesnt do hearts and flowershes into handcuffs and floggers whereas the novel treats their relationship with a seriousness others might reserve for bible study taylorjohnson and screenwriter kelly marcel see whats funny in this fetishistic scenario the couples early encounters possess an unexpected lightnessjohnsons got a wonderful comic touchand when steele and grey negotiate the written contract hes prepared stating exactly what he can do to her body the scenes absurdity is saved by the filmmakers droll awareness that its absurd even when the two of them get down to the de rigueur sex stuff most of which is generic rrated businessyou know ice cubes sliding down torsos the obligatory bare breasts and bumsthe movie doesnt submit to the dominance of dark eroticism like a vintage fifties melodrama it takes lurid material cleans it up gives it a high gloss and turns it toward heady and healthy emotion you see whether james knows it or not the original fifty shades of grey is essentially a ya novel with bondage for all its dirty bits its not actually about anastasia experiencing the joys of rough sex though she does get off on some of it its about how she redeems the psychologically twisted greyits not for nothing his first names christianby teaching him how to love in part by meeting him halfway in his desires this is beneath it all corny stuff but what makes it engaging is johnson an actress of ineffably awkward charm who pulls off the trick of bringing a thinly drawn character to vibrant life while dornan gets better and more complicated as the film goes alongat first he displays all the erotic voltage of a taller ryan seacrestjohnson is great all the way through channeling both her father don johnson and her mother melanie griffith she manages to do two opposite things at the same time even as she finds greys style and sexual tastes rather amusing in this she is the audiences surrogate her every expression and gesture reveals shes also really turned on by him you can never really predict these thingswho couldve guessed robert pattinson would become bigger than kristen stewartbut with fifty shades of grey it looks like dakota johnson has just made herself a movie star by signing up you agree to our user agreement including the class action waiver and arbitration provisions our privacy policy  cookie statement and to receive marketing and accountrelated emails from architectural digest you can unsubscribe at any time this site is protected by recaptcha and the google privacy policy and terms of service apply

May 28 2016,negative, oh id let jamie dornan tie me up absolutely my friend and i were having coffee at the starbucks around the corner from the amc lincoln square where wed just come from an allmedia screening of sam taylorjohnsons adaptation of el james fifty shades of grey and we were hashing out the movie id asked her to come with me for one simple reason because shes the closest person i know to anastasia steele the books heroine shes young attractive intelligent and by her definition at least a submissive what she thinks about this movie is way more interesting than what i think about it but heres the thumbnail traditional review for the record your film editor wishes it had either been much better or much worse its not as you mightve heard this years showgirls a deliciously terrible sobaditsgood retelling of the notorious novel there are some interesting scenes some strong supporting performances particularly by marcia gay harden who breezes in for a couple of scenes and really classes up the joint and a flatout terrific leading turn by dakota johnson who knows this material is basically ridiculous and plays the comedy of it to great effect but its also too flawed to recommend  much of the dialogue is irredeemably goofy the sex scenes are straight out of red shoe diaries dornan is a cipher and the slickedup portrait of the lives of the rich is straight out of an early90s michael douglas movie not one but two sequences amount to flying porn theres my two cents my friends take is a bit more complicated she is first of all not precisely the same kind of sub that christian grey is trying to turn anastasia steele gawd those names into im never in a situation where im saying yes sir no sir she explains its not that traditional its not that formal for me its more giving up physical control its saying i am willing to be 100 percent physically vulnerable in front of you and to allow you to push the limits of that vulnerability  because i enjoy it and you enjoy it and me in that moment but its never a situation for me personally where its punishment but that but is where things get scrambled when youre talking fifty shades of grey where the concerns of kinksters merge with those of antiporn types and sexpositive feminists and people who are generally sensible because even someone like me someone not in the scene can feel something going horribly askew the deeper we get into this narrative which eventually crosses over from normalizing kink to arguably normalizing abuse my friend is inclined to give a lot of leeway here his tying her up and hitting her with a flogger or a whip isnt abuse she said yes she gave him permission and he did not cross a line with her but whats tricky she says it what it takes to get her to that point he coerces her she may be into it she may find that she enjoys it but her initial shock and dismay at his proposition thats honest and he then coerces her growing up my friend read enough romance novels to understand the fantasy the shy innocent girl who doesnt know how beautiful she is meets the worldly man who is famous or wealthy or in some position of power and he sweeps in and he changes her mind but she changes his heart but whats harder for her to swallow is how fifty shades makes it clear that a bdsm relationship is not for christian grey a kink but a requirement and a requirement borne out of a past of abandonment by a mother who was no kidding a literal crack whore and abuse in other words the book and the film promote the notion that youd have to be broken in some way to get off on this stuff for me personally what makes this hard to dismiss is that  and this is going to sound melodramatic  in some real way el james pulling this general perception out of the air that everyone who does this wants to just hurt people and is doing it because of some deep psychological trauma that makes it harder for someone like me to negotiate my own life she says because what if i meet some great guy whose mom or sister or exgirlfriend has read these books and raved on an on about them and given him the bits and pieces and whats formed his idea about women like me is a combination of fifty shades of grey and the shit thats out there  thats legitimately 100 percent abuse walking around with a bondage sign on it  on porn sites does it raise my hackles a little bit yeah and this makes it easier for the bad people to take advantage of submissives who are inexperienced or maybe dont have as firm a grasp on what their own limits actually are and this when you get down to it is the fatal flaw of fifty shades of grey that it wants to be edgy and kinky and titillate us with a scene but only to the degree that it can smash that scene into the traditional beats of a good girltroubled guy romdram dynamic thats as old as the hills shes honest and good and hes gorgeous and troubled and has to be fixed ultimately james and taylorjohnson want to have their cake and eat it too to revel in the sexiness of a fetish while simultaneously looking down on those who partake in it as in some way damaged goods
May 15 2016,negative, save yourselves the book is better than the film i thought the film would be much better because it was directed by sam taylorwood of nowhere boy but alas the film was much worse fifty shades of grey opens predictably there are lots of grey things  grey clouds grey buildings grey clothes dramatic music plays in the background as we watch christian grey jamie dornan put on a shirt while standing in his walkin wardrobe grey is super goodlooking and also super rich he is ceo of some firm named after him anastasia dakota johnson is a timid college student she bats her eyelids a lot and wears floral blouses her housemate kate works for the student paper and has an interview with grey but is sick so she sends anastasia instead with a list of questions the meeting between anastasia and grey which occurs in his office is supposed to explode with sexual tension it sort of did this in the book it didnt do this at all in the film anastasia sits down and looks confused we see a shot of greys desk and are able to admire the fact that he has a series of lead pencils lined up with his firms name on them why does the ceo only write in lead pencil did he never get his pen licence i cannot recall this detail from the book and i cannot understand the significance of it in the film perhaps it is symbolic of the fact that anastasia is going to be able to change him much of the film revolves around anastasia and grey arguing about her signing a contract presumably using a pen anyway back to the initial meeting anastasia has forgotten a pen because she is a battler damsel in distress she also cant ask questions in a smooth way perhaps this is supposed to be because she is so turned on by grey so lovestruck so discombobulated by his charm if so this was unconvincing mostly because despite being blessed with model good looks grey has as much charisma as a doorstop we first met dornan in sofia coppolas marie antoinette where he had an appropriately minor role before that we met him in an advertisement for calvin klein underwear throughout fifty shades of grey dornan acts like he is still shooting that same advertisement at least twilight had palpable sexual tension there is no sexual tension at all between anastasia and grey we see a lot of closeup shots of their faces greys face always looks the same because dornan has one facial expression  frowning with his eyes slightly squinting as though he is trying to telepathically communicate with someone in a nearby room anastasias facial expressions change more regularly  she smiles she looks coy she cries the film is not good but many scenes were particularly bad in the book much of the communication between grey and anastasia takes place over email i was wondering how this would translate to the screen it translates in a very literal way the emails are shown in the top righthand corner of the screen they are on a grey background of course neat and the first email is at the top of the screen then future emails are listed below them until we have a veritable stack of emails taking up the righthand third of the screen in a way this was useful because grey and anastasia are better at flirting over email and so this rather literal and experimental filmic technique actually contributed quite a lot to the few morsels of sexual chemistry the film offers in terms of aesthetics however it was like being hit over the head with a brick the main issue i had with the film was that it was entirely unconvincing this is because dornan is so weird and abrupt as grey that it becomes difficult to understand why anastasia would stay with him he doesnt let her touch him and he refuses to share a bed with her he doesnt like to talk about his personal life when she presses him he relents but in a nonsensical way while she is asleep he comes into her room and says the woman that gave birth to me was a crack addict and a prostitute this is different to the book and less concise where he says the woman who brought me into this world was a crack whore obviously anastasia is asleep so greys past remains a moot point that is never discussed again at times the film is humorous though it is unclear to me whether this was intentional or not there is a scene where we see a photograph of grey and anastasia in the local newspaper and anastasia has her mouth open and looks both uncomfortable and sultry at the same time when this photo came on screen the entire audience burst out laughing the scene where anastasia and grey negotiate in an orange room is also pretty funny they are sitting very far away from each other and suddenly they both have sushi rolls when anastasia says cross out anal fisting the audience burst out laughing again she says what are butt plugs and the audience again started laughing the sex scenes are done well i was under the impression that 50 of the film would be sex scenes but really there were only three sex scenes as far as sex scenes go they are unremarkable they are like stock sex scenes with bells and whistles i say they were done well because during them no one in the audience was laughing also as in the book there are many references to safe sex it was novel to watch the characters tear open condom packets and discuss the oral contraceptive pill just to reiterate fifty shades of grey is a terrible film it was too long and too repetitive amazingly the characterisation was even shallower than it was in the book likely attributable to the fact anastasias voice is sustained throughout the book while the film is told from an objective perspective this is a pity the loss of anastasias perspective strips the film of any excitement in the lacking of an engaging subjectivity the narrative of sexual awakening falls flat
May 12 2016,negative, when the first instalment of el james concupiscent trilogy was thrust into the literary world in 2011 few could have predicted that despite its lascivious content and perceived glorification of sexual exploitation the novels would go on to sell over 100 million copies worldwide a vehement critical backlash however deemed its substandard literary qualities more offensive than its erotic content its lowcultural value merely providing pabulum for the gendered masses whilst the character of the submissive ingénue is hardly unfamiliar in literature or contemporary cinema steven shainbergs 2002 film secretary based on mary gaitskills novel bad behaviour springs to mind the success of james novels has piqued such intense global interest in the film that its cultural significance cannot be underestimated dakota johnson stars as demure and diffident student anastasia steele who is sent to interview handsome publishing tycoon christian grey jamie doran for the college newspaper despite having little in common they are attracted to one another but anastasia soon discovers that the brooding billionaire conducts his private life on the sexual fringe and that she is merely a conduit for his priapic fantasies adapting the novel for the big screen director taylorjohnson has had to navigate a high wire between its hardcore pornographic elements its global popularity criticism of its sexual violence and film as a profitable commercial venture attempting to strike a balance between all four taylorjohnson focuses on the development of the emotional relationship between the protagonists rather than an exploration into the world of sadomasochism which steers the source materials narrative as a result of such diluted text the sexual content is pallid and restraint neither sexy nor risqué by moderating the driving force within the core narrative and littering the film with sexual metaphors in its place leaves the film with very little in the way of plot development and it has simply nowhere to go it is left to johnson and dornan to rescue what they can from such sexual oblivion and whilst johnson is a revelation as the innocuous student turned sexually curious mistress dornan struggles to connect with dual characteristics of grey failing to strike a balance between charismatic businessman and sadistic dominant the restructuring of the films narrative evidently hinders dornan and while anastasia steele is emotionally more rounded the psychologically complex christian grey is premised upon excess domination and obsession and by moderating these characteristics anastasias desire for an impenetrable grey becomes less plausible in spite of the unbalanced lead performances the stylistic elements of the film complement the shameless absurdity of the plot and the polished production design exudes glamour and indulgence underpinned by an erotically charged music score the sophisticated production values fail however to conceal the lack of chemistry between the lead characters and dornans struggle to connect with an egregious script overwhelms any attempts by the films design to compensate for its nonsensical plot while the film is arguably no better or worse than its literary source it does shatter the fantasies of sexual desire and sexual pleasure constructed within the novel fifty shades of grey is a book premised upon the attainment of sexual pleasure and fulfilment through the dark and sinister practices of sadomasochism subverting the very elements in which the narrative is structured upon and supplanting it with an anaemic love story brings a certain morality to the film that is absent in the novel and it is doubtful that taylor johnsons film adaptation of fifty shades of grey will satisfy even its most ardent fans
Apr 26 2016,negative, if hype likes and advanced ticket sales are any indication of success box offices around the world will get a boost this weekend with the release of the much anticipated adaptation of author el james mummy porn phenomenon fifty shades of grey a softcore erotic film about a 27 yearold billionaire who attempts to seduce a demure college student with spanks whips blindfolds and handcuffs the synopsis for fifty shades of grey sounds more likely to come from the porn industry than a glossy hollywood film except the james trilogy has sold more than 100 million novels worldwide so it was only a matter of time before this saucy franchise cashed in on its remarkable success by bringing the smenhanced love story of anastasia steele and christian grey to the big screen loyal fans and those curious to see what the fuss is about will discover a film tamer and lighter than the source material  erotic rather than pornographic its not as sexually explicit or psychologically dark its to be expected theres a difference between what youre comfortable reading in privacy at home and what youre comfortable watching with a group of strangers at the local cinema theres also the sense with two more films to follow were being eased into the more provocative parts of the story while the casting was reportedly fraught for both filmmakers and fans of the novel the decision to go with lesser known faces was a good one the lack of screen associations mean dakota johnson and jamie dornan have the chance to truly own the roles of ana and christian and they both push their characters beyond what could have been just two dimensional clichés don johnson and melanie griffiths daughter is surprisingly good as anastasia shes warm funny and as natural as you can be when your boyfriend is asking you to sign a legal contract to be his submissive sexual partner the narrative of fifty shades of grey is largely just one conversation about the boundaries of their relationship but johnsons anastasia grows throughout slowly wrestling power from christian who at this point in the trilogy remains more of an enigma in general her nicely buffed square jawed costar has a harder time of it but its not entirely his fault screenwriter kelly marcel saving mr banks has kept the novels cringeworthy dialogue to a minimum but its dornan who gets what does remain as well as the majority of the unintentionally funny cheesy scenes honestly the postcoital piano playing has got to stop red flags would have gone up if you saw the lack of chemistry between johnson and dornan when they presented an award together at the golden globes but while there are moments that dont sizzle as much as they perhaps should for the most part when naked they seem to get on just fine which brings us to the sex british photographer and indie filmmaker sam taylorjohnson was a smart choice to direct she was never going to be allowed by a controlling el james and fans to make this juggernaut anything more than mainstream escapism for a girls night out but she does her best to make it about more than just sex it is after all a film about two people opening up and trying to understand each other in a mills and boon for the 21st century kind of way she makes us wait a good 40 minutes before the clothes come off completely and another 35 minutes before the spanking starts none of it is quite as shocking as youd expect christians red room of pain like the rest of the art direction is tastefully decorated and its amazing how quickly you become accustomed to the nudity sm gear and the sighs and gasps some scenes are hot and steamy and some frankly a little dull but theres nothing to make you feel embarrassed or uncomfortable that is unless youve chosen to go with your mother or on a first date    there was even a nice feeling of camaraderie at the screening i attended there was plenty of laughter and with an excessive running time of just over two and a half hours a few yawns too there was a sense we were in for something a little naughty and thats what we got a guilty if not particularly memorable pleasure
Apr 10 2016,positive,funny often intentionally ferociously unsexy and roundly entertaining from beginning to end
Feb 23 2016,neutral, author el james should be ecstatic that the crazy fervor surrounding her trilogy of bdsm propelled it towards a movie deal because now artists more qualified to bring her kinkiness to life can get their hands on it im not saying shes a bad writerill let the myriad commenters on the interwebs too haughty to accept someone who turned a pornographic twilight fanfiction into a worldwide bestseller do that talent aside james hit the jackpot she touched a raw nerve in female readers desperate for an injection of unbridled sex no matter what adjective for penis was used now with fifty shades of grey the film her faults can be improved im talking quality though not relevancy personally while director sam taylorjohnson has crafted a very attractive work with the help of cinematographer seamus mcgarvey i still dont quite see its necessity the women for which the mommy porn moniker was made get very little besides christian greys jamie dornan bare chest and ass in lieu of anastasia steele dakota johnson baring all softcore porn is back on the big screen despite the novel being of the hardcore variety so fans expecting more than a couple extended closeup sex scenes will be disappointed but if kelly marcels adaptation is exacting perhaps there wasnt much sex involved in the first place steele gets undressed often and grey slides riding crops along her curves to supply a lot tension without much release perhaps thats the point if so kudos to all involved however as someone going in to judge the movie plain and simple theres not much below the surface is it supposed to be about a virgin college graduates sexual awakening is it perhaps a manifestation of a female fantasy to fix a broken puppy of a man in this case a rottweiler taking control merely because no one ever questions him either way its a warped disturbingly abusive adult fairy tale from start to finish with plastic people dressing the background a billionaire prince offering a hand and a shy hopeful everywoman yearning for happily ever after rather than have to overcome an outside evil blocking her way this disney princesss sexual prize doubles as her romantic villain theres this whole will they wont they aspect at the heart of the hedonism where she wants love and he explains it isnt in his vocabulary but every time she pulls away he covets more breaking his own rules to be with the girl unknowingly seeking to be his dominant when the contract on the table is for the exact opposite theres of course a tragic backstory as to why this cardboard ken doll has such a frozen heart in his chest one with details to explain his being aroused by anas teasing she only has to bite her lip to trigger a pavlovian response in his libido and despite her giggling at the silliness of everything shes being exposed to you cant help wondering whether shes been in control from the start with silly theres no better word to describe the whole endeavor from my brain wanting to project twilight onto the actionwith victor rasuks josé standing in for jacob being the most glaring exampleto the way moments that should arouse are painted as a verbal manual instead of spontaneous pleasure this is why a movie like the duke of burgundy is more effective at doing the same subject matter justice it puts us into the game without knowing who the submissive is reversing the roles when we least expect it and always showing the ecstasy of their labor fifty shades of grey is more worried about us understanding dynamics that its actions become clinical and precise what should be hot is merely a construct to position steele and grey for their finale that climax is surprisingly well done if only the series ended after one book with the final shot of the movie hanging over our heads like a longawaited delightful release of tension the filmmakers could have had more fun with what came before knowing that im going to get answers in subsequent installments to questions only intriguing in their ambiguity ruins the joy i experienced in the theatrewide gasp accompanying the cut to black what happens isnt a surprisesteeles stubborn attempts at love and greys constant softening demeanor throughout make the eventual endgame obviousbut it does show the expert visual precision taylorjohnson had over the material cut a good thirty or forty minutes of fat away and this could be a taut little sexcapade add more sex and the overblown controversy might make sense too presently the bloat is simply too much to endure why must we meet christians brother and sister why must we spend time with anatasias divorced parents when the words she speaks about them add more to their purpose than the time theyre onscreen i bet the push and pull between ana and christian would be at full flight onstage in a twoperson show of dominant and submissive each encounter slowly chipping away at the others resolve until roles overlap by dedicating so much to the world outside the bedroom and red room the film often loses momentum in lieu of redundancies we understand ana and christian from their first meeting some of the foreplay afterwards worksthe business meeting to discuss their sexual contract is funbut the majority proves a monotonous drone you know boring like dornans performance he does an adequate job when angry and impulsive but his line delivery under the guise of faux nice guy is awkward at best taylorjohnson more than competently directs the proceedings certainly more than the material deserves but she fails at giving christian life i get hes closedoff tortured whatever that doesnt mean hes a robot johnsons natural playful counterpart only exacerbates his stiffness through her perfect mix of innocence curiosity and adventure she is having fun and dare i say embracing the joke of the whole fifty shades hoopla the girl next door every guy in the audience will desire clothed or unclothed her hidden underlying confidence

Feb 10 2016,negative,certainly there is an audience out there for this kind of story and with any luck neither you nor i will ever have to interact with it
Jan 1 2016,negative, lets start with what its not its not the worst film in the world to an extent it has been rescued from its lowly origins like its enigmatic billionaire antihero christian grey as a trilogist el james has been all about inflicting the wrong sort of pain visiting bruises welts and assorted aches upon the english language her instrument of abuse is rogets thesaurus that the world has willingly submitted to the dull thwacks of her prose  and to dan browns cloth ear  suggests both a vast market for masochism and the mass failure of the education system the good thing about kelly marcels script visualised by director sam taylorjohnson is the wholesale absence of jamess sentences if not her sensibility instead its dakota johnsons job to embody anastasia steeles surrender in writhing shivers and shimmering squeals and other sundry liquescences she does it creditably shes a beautiful flirt too who  and this is a very oldfashioned concept almost as oldfangled as anastasias prelapsarian complement of unwaxed pubes  knows how and when to say no while grey is busy seducing her into his little boys toy room she is seducing the audience vulnerably gnawing her lower lip and doing the coy doeeyed diana look thing if you care about anything in this film stuffed to the gunwales with planes and fleets of purring motors with apple product placements and a fuckoff property portfolio then its the girl a lovely innocent on the ageold path into the dark wood but we need to talk about christian a walking stalking erection with a platinum credit card and a knowledge of knots put together from papiermâché and ply and vacuumwrapped in a plucked epidermis of lotion and ripples he is a fatal nullity as a dramatic character dornan does whats required with grey but hes a real noone boy who just happens to have a massive chopper his desire to dominate but inability to love is the conundrum the film seems to task itself with unpicking its the way i am he says there is no rosebud beyond a cockamamie backstory about some sort of crack whore for a mother told to anastasia when shes sleeping the story has no interest in investigating its own mystery several years in analysis would sort him out alas the film hasnt got the time or the curiosity or more likely permission from the plot dominatrix el james to dig deeper in dramatic terms fifty shades ejaculates early invoking its own safety word at precisely the point things might have got interesting it brings things to a juddering halt and lops off the third act entirely boy gets girl boy loses girl beauty doesnt tame the beast thats it instead there are surfaces loads of them  sheeny chrome and glass stainless steel and polished wood and yes lashings of comely skin even christians redwalled playpen is mostly for show hes got enough instruments of torture to tool up the spanish inquisition but a bit like most of his car pool they mainly stay parked the films cinematic forebear is the straighttovideo softcore sex thriller which may explain the quantity of floppycock rock freighted into the soundtrack direct from the 1980s this is a wannabe tragedy with whips about the knightly failure to commit to the maidens romantic narrative of course its good that he doesnt get his way but on the whole this is fifty shades of grrr
Dec 30 2015,positive,fifty shades of grey delivers however ponderously on its promise of pop transgressiveness
Dec 30 2015,negative, only a couple minutes in its clear that fifty shades of grey will be ludicrous anastasia steele dakota johnson gasps out loud at the seattle skyline like shes never seen a city or seattle before even though shes driving there from portland wrapped in a stupid cardigan woven from the sad blue dna of the kind of awkward women that primarily exist in movieswhich looks nothing like anything shell wear at any other point in the movie mindshe proceeds to fall flat on her face while entering the office of selfmade billionaire christian grey jamie dornan johnson plays nervous by talking really slowly and leaving lengthy spaces midsentence dornan plays charismatic bytaking off his shirt a lot later in the movie its a meetcute where they fall immediately in love her because hes handsome him because she forgets a pen to write with the problem if youve never heard of the el james novel on which this is based is that christian is a bdsm enthusiast who doesnt do normal relationships or vanilla sex annie lennoxs i put a spell on you plays if you havent already been knocked unconscious from the dropping anvils  whats your solution screenwriter kelly marcel and director sam taylorjohnson deal with this problem by renovating anas character though its not a full renovation ana now owns a broken computer at least but her phone is still from 2001 she still allows christian to lecture her on drinking too much at an after finals party and shes still a virgin the movie slightly modifies that last point by having her clearly state that this is because she has not met the right partner yet of course in both versions she doesnt believe shes desirable despite the reams of chiselchested men in her life who want to knock boots the most important change she is if not explicitly feminist positioned as an independent force against christians overbearing desire to have her submit to his will she calls him on his shit not in an interesting way mindthis movie isnt actually engaging and shes still in lurve with himbut she does call him out in one sense its not a bad solution and parts of the filmthe ones that consequently depict christian as a creep who refuses to listen to the desires ana clearly and repeatedly expressesare better than they have any right to be at the same time this movie isnt supposed to be the story of an emotionally vacant dom who is crappy at communicating what he wants to a woman of whom hes asking a lot so the tension between the plot of the book and the films conception of ana creates a movie that doesnt make a lick of sense the story and the marketing are based on a simple idea that ana will be a vanilla audiences portal into the sexy world of bdsm and that her initiation into this world will be titillating even for people who have never considered bdsm play before in this sense the movie fails entirely ana does want christian but only as what she keeps vaguely referring to as a normal boyfriend shes fine with light bondage play but shes not really down for a serious lifestyle change that involves becoming christians fulltime subwhich is the reason she keeps refusing to sign the contract how is the audience supposed to be excited or titillated about anas initiation into the world of bdsm if there hasnt really been any formal mutual consent and it is abundantly clear to everyone except christian grey that shes just not that into the idea  this issue doesnt just manifest in the script but in the films production in the few bdsm scenes we get the camera shies away tight closeups obscure christians whips and chains and instead focus on christian caressing anas body for a few moments before having fairly straightforward sex with her the whole artistry of bdsmthe patience the anticipation and the blurring of lines between pain and pleasureis erased whats the point why is this film about bdsm scared of the very thing its actively marketing to its audience dornan does his best with this material but christian doesnt just come off like a creep hes a completely ineffective creep at no point does he offer a sustained explanation of what ana might enjoy about being a sub instead he just gets her a computer and commands her to so some research after their first serious bdsm session ana decides to go visit her mother which like every other thing she does in this movie provokes christians jealously he flies to savannah telling her his bdsm mentor advised him to come fight for her so just to be clear your bdsm mentor advised you that the best way to deal with a potential sub who is clearly chafing against the constraints you keep trying to impose upon her is to chase her down to remind her of those constraints  whats worse amidst this confusion about how were supposed to take christians clumsy advances fifty shades of grey ends up taking a fairly offensive position against bdsm at several points ana demands that christian explain why he wants to hurt her christian keeps telling her that its because this is the way i am ana insists there must be a reason and christian eventually suggests there might well be a reason in a monologue he delivers while ana is asleep that bafflingly suggests she might remind him of his crackaddicted mother at no point does the movie consider the idea that christian might be into bdsm because he is into bdsm instead there is only the everpresent hint that something must be wrong with him and because christian is as he himself puts it 50 shades of fucked up we shouldnt accept anything he has to say about the potential pleasures of bdsm at face value  couple this with how elements of bdsm are also exploited for laughs the filmmakers already know we know what christians secret is so before ana becomes aware of christians predilections he is saddled with a bunch of double entendres at which the audience is clearly supposed to chuckle later on negotiations over the contract in which ana dismisses anal and vaginal fisting as potential activitiesand then asks what a butt plug is showing the shes both really done a whole lot of research into this potentially lifechanging decision and also this lit major apparently doesnt understand how words workare also played for humor is bdsm sexy or funny maybe it can be both but not if its never taken seriously in the first place fifty shades could have been a film about ana coming to terms with the fact that she isnt sexually compatible with the man she loves which would require the writers to find a reason she is in love with him or you can have a film where ana meets an attractive man who inducts her into a sexual world shes never contemplated before the film tries to be about both and the result is that the sexy scenes are flaccidbut fortunately too tame to be really uncomfortableand the dramatic scenes are boring and repetitive ultimately fifty shades of grey spends two hours describing a relationship that is bound to fail and doesnt even seem all that fun while its occurring here are two people who are suspicious of each others intentions but also in love becausebecause they are sexuality isnt deviance love isnt this magical and christian grey playing sad songs on a piano after sex isnt endearing even with his shirt off mark abraham sometimes teaches history in toronto is sometimes an editor at cokemachineglow was at one time the cofounder of the damper and is always a bedazzler aficionado you can follow him on twitter
Dec 30 2015,positive,fortunately the two leads have real chemistry dornan makes christian less creepy and more angsty than on the page and johnson brings a surprising depth to anastasia they also know how to play certain scenes for laughs making the film come alive
Dec 30 2015,neutral, i had zero interest in reading fifty shades of grey or writing a review comparing the movie to the book now if someone tied me to a bedpost and forced me to read it while lightly flogging me with cinnabons id be so into it our beautiful love story commences when anastasia steele dakota johnson volunteers to interview 27yearold billionaire christian grey jamie dornan for her roommate kate a journalism major whos battling a cold anastasia shows up at greys office wearing an outfit that looks like maria von trapp made it out of curtains while her body language screams timid on the other hand she does have a 40 gpa pouty lips and big blue eyes so theres that christian greys dazzling office is completely staffed by women who look like they were hired by a nordic headhunting company specializing in victorias secret models when we first meet grey hes standing in his office before floortoceiling windows overlooking seattle its stunning shot but also makes grey  dornan actually  seem far less intimating than hes meant to be hes clearly a handsome fella but i had a difficult time with his physicality especially in the scenes when hes being a dominant but first lets discuss what works greys initial odd but endearing courtship of anastasia is amusing he unexpectedly shows up at the hardware store where anastasia works and asks her to help him find cable ties masking tape and some rope the audience is in on the joke but anastasia isnt and johnson plays it like a pro dornan however as the handsome confident and mysterious suitor gets by at this point on his natural charm hes still not quite the presence he needs to be the two are falling for one another thats a problem for grey because as he tells anastasia he doesnt do romance he has a singular interest  one that involves floggers nipple clamps spanking paddles handcuffs and an adorable rabbit named mr peanut fine theres no rabbit christian explains to anastasia that hes whats called a dominant and he would like her to be his submissive it requires signing a contract with very specific rules about how shes supposed to behave and take care of herself anastasias supposedly conflicted about whether to sign but theres never really enough doubt shown to make it believable and while greys conflicted about his feelings toward anastasia feelings that may extend beyond his dominantsubmissive relationship it generates almost no dramatic tension its boring its fair to say the sensual nature of some of the bdsm scenes in this movie isnt something youd normally find in a mainstream film but based on the mythology surrounding the fifty shades of grey novel or at least the media narrative about it the sex scenes are rather timid dornan whom im sure both women and some men alike will find appealing when hes mostly naked wasnt particularly convincing in those scenes he seemed uncomfortable not like the bdsm veteran grey is supposed to be what may be more surprising than the sex scenes is some of the dialogue particularly greys response to anastasia when she asks him if hes going to make love to her now im not going to spoil it for you but then i believe the sex is just window dressing for the real fantasy here anastasias ability to change christian lets talk about dakota johnson the daughter of melanie griffith and don johnson is easily the best thing in fifty shades of grey as anastasia steele shes the perfect blend of innocence and confidence a stealthy heartbreaker who at first comes across as mousey and innocent but suddenly and convincingly becomes confident and coquettish on the other hand as christian grey dornan does everything hes asked to do but hes just not the intimidating confused tortured presence hes supposed to be director sam taylorjohnson couldve done better with pacing and creating more dramatic tension her best work comes at the end of the movie punctuating a film that had been largely devoid of dramatic tension and drama with a wellconstructed emotional moment that almost had me wanting to see what was next
Dec 29 2015,negative, with its simplistic storyline about a naive heroine drawn to a dark brooding hunk who conceals monstrous desires fifty shades of grey is twilight with riding crops and plush furnishings editor lisa gunning gently caresses each glossy sequence of writhing appendages to the strains of danny elfmans score or a soaring ballad from annie lennox and sia as a favour to her fluriddled roommate kate eloise mumford english literature student anastasia steele dakota johnson interviews handsome billionaire christian grey jamie dornan for an article in the university newspaper im incapable of letting you go confides christian as he introduces wideeyed anastasia to his secret world of domination and submission which didnt get uk censors hot under the collar passing the film uncut i was more aroused by the immaculate shine on christians piano than anything in his boudoir of bondage a set designer must have spent hours buffing those ivories kelly marcels script fails to flesh out the protagonists christian remains an enigma and dornan gamely keeps a straight face as he barks ropey lines
Dec 7 2015,negative,rather than anything to do with sexual connoisseurship or philosophy in the bedroom all that comes across through fifty shades of greys absence of erotic heat is a lust for the appurtenances of luxury something thats more commonplace than singular
Nov 23 2015,negative,its cheap misogynist z grade exploitation masquerading as the romance of a woman trying to tame the ultimate man who by all accounts should be alone left to his own demented fantasies
Nov 19 2015,positive,its not overstating the case to say that dakota johnson achieves stardom with this role she mines moments of humor that help offset the soulsearching and weeping and shes appealing without being impossibly beautiful
Oct 14 2015,negative, at least someones getting excited about the pic because anyone actually seeing it will be bored to tears dakota johnson watchable stars as the virginal english lit major anastasia who falls in love with the fabulously wealthy christian grey jamie dornan problem is hes a proud practitioner of bdsm  the dominant one of course  and he has a big red dungeon to show for it anastasias so taken with the guy that shes game to try out a few whips and chains for one thing this film adaptation doesnt eroticize anything very little actually happens on any level the pair dont kiss until 45 minutes in most of the notevensoftporn sex is of the vanilla variety and when the handcuffs come out the violence is seriously softpedalled crucially  contrary to jian ghomeshis claim which his accusers deny in his famous peremptivestrike facebook post that his tastes are just like greys  the dominant partner here is a longtime practitioner of bdsm who takes prior agreements very seriously an essential plot point of this first instalment is all about whether anastasia will sign the contract so they can finally get it on an interminable scene features the two negotiating things like whether fisting can be on the play list im an antipornography social critic who believes porn is a deeply problematic sex educator im a longtime critic of the mainstreaming of sexual violence and the media images that promote it and am passionate about ending woman abuse im ready to campaign against anything that gets in the way of that goal but 50 shades of grey the movie is not that in fact there are many things about it that could trigger an important conversation about sexual violence for example i dont think the desire for pain in sex comes out of the blue and is just a random happenstance and i dont think abusers come out of nowhere i think we should talk about that analyze it the 50 shades narrative takes that into consideration grey is plainly a messed up guy whose sexuality has been compromised from an early age he admits hes 50 shades of fucked up whats appealing and seductive about that in fact anastasia is bent on changing him that doesnt happen in this movie but from a feminist perspective this film has a happy ending as for submissive partners in the second and third books  and presumably the followup films  anastasia enters greys sexual universe and gets into it some might say this is deeply problematic that it promotes the idea that every womans turned on by violence  you just have to give her time and shell love getting the shit kicked out of her but the 50 shades narrative is a little more complex anastasia is a virgin sexually groomed by the guy she loves into doing what he wants that happens even when its fullon actionable sexual assault young sexual abuse survivors even incest survivors often report having orgasms during repeated abuse and have talked about how their sexuality has been moulded by the experience this movie is a mess its glacially slow boasts a laughably clichéd soundtrack  beast of burden anyone  and is plainly a cashgrabbing setup to promote a full trilogy if youre going to boycott do it because it sucks
Oct 14 2015,negative, through an act of fanfiction gone amok twilight stephenie meyers tedious ya vampirecumromance series about restraint and crossing over got spun into a worldwide mustread that transposed characters and tropes into the carnal taking of a fetishdriven business tycoon some might call them vampires too all the while butchering any sense of literary craft to an unconscionable degree sadly i can attest that fifty shades of grey the movie is better than the pages on which el james swapped out fangs in favor of butt plugs  and all in time for valentines day make no mistake the insipid light whipping of sm porn that sparked a wildfire among soccer moms and other unlikely segments will rake it in big at the box office and for those saying its a cheap misogynistic fantasy keep in mind its written by a woman and directed by a woman yes theres tons of nudity but erotic no nine 12 weeks lived in an equally campy and tawdry place when it came out in 1986 but there the stars mickey rourke and kim basinger actors recognized by the academy over their careers under the sweaty pandering eye of adrian lyne conjured up something titillating even human albeit inane  and there was far less nudity here director sam taylorjohnson who made the wonderful young john lennon biopic nowhere boy has leads dakota johnson the offspring of don johnson and melanie griffith and irish actor jamie dornan he doesnt act he just poses and looks good doing it get naked as often as possible  but theres little fire much of what goes on in the boudoir or greys playroom a bdsm antechamber feels like a softcore model shoot for a tiertwo gentlemans mag and someone decided to let the camera roll and capture the tedium in between the postured highs as far as the love story at the heart of shades the aloof thinly inked title character christian grey dornan a reclusive billionaire doesnt do romance ostensibly because he has intimacy issues as a result control and spanking are all that gets him through the night its a chance encounter with the young virginal anastasia steele johnson during an interview for her school paper shes pinchhitting for her sick roommate and armed with probing canned inanities such as are you gay that ignites christians hope for a new submissive and sets the stage for jamess reimagined pairing of bella and edward grey turns out to be a bit of a stalker throwing gobs of green to get the gal but hes got rules and dark secrets youll have to bear through later installments to find out and a niggling contract he wants ana to sign before they can fully consummate she strikes fisting from the lengthy list of sex acts ana on the other hand resists just enough to keep the manic mogul on the hook and begins to sway him from his detached closeted predilections james began her opus on a fan site under the pen name snowqueens icedragon and called the series master of the universe ancestry matters because it trickles down hopefully the two quality actors caught up in this fetid fetish folderol marcia gay harden and jennifer ehle as the lovers mothers collected sizable checks for their troubles and tarnish the dialogue is beyond insipid im 50 shades of fucked up or i dont make love i fuck hard and the timing and chemistry is nonexistent johnson borrowing much of her mothers leftofcenter sexuality gives as pleasantly a nuanced performance as one can when the role requires moans pursed lips and an uneven mix of pushback and naive ingenue dornan is merely a wooden prop about the only one who comes away unscathed is johnson shades will likely launch her career but then again look what happened to elizabeth berkley after showgirls the other johnson in the picture the one behind the lens went from a must see what shell do next to a hack and given there are more grey films in the works the door on that now seems closed tom meek is a writer living in cambridge his reviews essays short stories and articles have appeared in the boston phoenix the rumpus thieves jargon film threat and open windows tom is a member of the boston society of film critics and rides his bike everywhere you can follow tom on twitter tbmeek3 and read more at tbmeek3wordpresscom
Oct 14 2015,positive, since 2011 when the first book in e l jamess trilogy was released we have heard endlessly about how readers primarily women were consuming jamess novels even though they were written in a style that might be called word salad with litebdsm dressing the words were meant to make you blush  and keep reading chapter after chapter like a competitive eater reaching for the next set of chicken wings it comes as a surprise then that the filmmakers went in a completely opposite direction the first fifty shades movie is a surprisingly hilarious piece of cinema thats equal parts scifi and romantic comedy what began as a tale of a young woman falling in love with an older gentleman with kinky tastes has morphed and twisted in the hands of director sam taylorjohnson into a story that involves a young weathermanipulating woman who falls in love with a teleporting incubus whose greatest weakness is the banal pleasure of contract law our heroine anastasia steele is played by dakota johnson as mumbly and mousy physically were meant to see this weather witch is awkward because she sports a set of unbecoming bangs and has a penchant for dressing in a fashion that seems to be openly combative to the occasion on the night shes supposed to go out for instance she wears a tshirt but she also apparently has superpowers throughout the film the weather reflects anas mood when she cries the storms pour when shes happy the seattle clouds separate and golden hues drape the city and when shes sexually aroused the sky blesses her with a gentle drizzle its unclear whether steele is aware of her weathermanipulating properties in the same way it is unclear to what degree johnson is willfully satirizing and subverting the story one things clear though her deadpan delivery of lines like are you going to make love to me now or what is a butt plug is hilarious in the books nascent stages they were twilight fan fiction ana was originally that series terminally bland protagonist bella but johnson gives ana gory bits of humanity in a deeply funny amusingly awkward performance that recalls of all people michael cera in superbad johnsons comedy is further enhanced by her paramour jamie dornan plays the strange billionairecreature known as christian grey the two actors often feel like theyre stuck in different films dornan spends much of the movie furiously knitting his brow and glaring with his cold eyes while johnson comically fluffs up the pensive scenes dornan tries to ground though christian has an extended family and though he is seen driving cars and doing things normal humans do it all just appears to be an elaborate cover as he is really a glamorous shadowy specter who exists beyond our comprehension there are multiple scenes in which grey manifests himself out of nowhere he is not seen or heard entering houses hardware stores and hotels through conventional means like doors its not readily clear that christian even knows what a door is christian offers telltale signs that he typically lives in shadows for starters he rides shotgun with his manservant taylor everyone knows you sit in the back when being driven by your manservant further christian doesnt seem to eat a full meal in the film though there are two semiimportant dining scenes and there is one scene where he is able to communicate with ana while she sleeps just by talking out loud in the same room grey also has the ability to text and drive at the same time without causing accidents on human roadways christian having a paranormal nature would also explain why he has singular tastes he seems bound to our world by a magic document called the contract like the sea witch in the little mermaid his document  needs anas signature and until its signed it binds grey forbidding him to inflict harm upon others in pursuit of pleasure for himself the enduring power of this document is what the movie wraps itself around there is so much negotiation all jokes aside this alien quality is what makes dornan so effective as christian humanity seems foreign to dornans christian which makes sense for a character who could be completely empty there are other signs steele and grey are living in a dystopian future google does not exist ana uses a flip phone and at one point shes given a new computer but not a new phone perhaps signaling that smartphones have gone extinct street parking is relatively easy to find a possible sign that cars have gone extinct too grey mentions african charity work possibly alerting us to the idea that africa is one giant supercountry now were these touches intentional its impossible to know we do know that taylorjohnson and james didnt get along perhaps taylorjohnson has created one of the most elaborate slowbaked revenge plots of history by injecting comedy and weird almost scifi touches into what was meant to be a filmic adaptation of a tooselfserious pulp novel and if those touches were intentional it makes the film all the better a surprising success seen through the lens of a scifi romantic comedy about a man whos barely human and the awkward woman who comes to love him fifty shades is a masterpiece of subversion and dark humor  and much much better than anything our kinky minds could have imagined        we believe that everyone deserves to understand the world that they live in that kind of

Aug 31 2015,negative, el james erotic novel fifty shades of grey which has been described as housewife porn is now a movie and it arrived just before valentines day weekend film critic neil rosen filed this review now that is good advice to keep in mind especially if youre one of the unfortunate souls who gets dragged to this film by your partner or date for those unacquainted to the plot it is about anastasia a virginal naive college student being pursued by christian grey a hunky millionaire corporate titan who has a thing for sadomasochist sex the bulk of the storyline revolves around christians attempts to get anastasia to sign a written contract that document will give him permission to do all kinds of kinky dominant activities with his new submissive slave the book was trashy but the movie tries to elevate that content to high art and is so vanilla that the results are a disaster the filmmakers have watered down both the tone and racy sexual content of the source material to such a large degree that people attracted to the sexual aspect of the novel will be sorely disappointed romance fans are also out of luck as the characters are undeveloped and cartoonish so is the story line and the two main actors have little chemistry we care nothing about their fate dakota johnson the real life daughter of melanie griffith and don johnson has a certain spark and she occasionally rises above the awful material but jamie dornan as christian grey does only perfunctory work one day it may become a bad moviecult classic  the kind of film that people go to laugh at like showgirls but for now its so boring it feels endless and with two more sequels probably on the way the only people getting truly tortured here is the audience
Aug 17 2015,negative,the film is about the best adaptation that could have been drawn from this rather dull source material  at least until it slows to a crawl on the deathly serious and dull home stretch
Aug 17 2015,positive, at the preview screening guests were given special ice creams coated in greytinted chocolate  but once you bit down the ice cream was vanilla apropos  want more junkee in your life sign up to our newsletter and follow us on instagram twitter and facebook so you always know where to find us it isnt difficult to argue that fifty shades of grey is better than the book el james excruciatingly bad prose sets an extremely low bar but the silk purse crafted out of that sows ear by director sam taylorjohnson cinematographer seamus mcgarvey screenwriter kelly marcel and stars dakota johnson and jamie dornan is unexpectedly delightful fifty shades the movie is playful  and not just in the sense that its title character maintains a playroom stocked with toys while it incorporates many of the moments that fans are fetishistically anticipating  the micromanaging author made sure of that  the film treats them skeptically its best creative decision was jettisoning the books moronic interior monologue and observing its characters with wry affection despite the prerelease speculation that stars johnson and dornan hate each other onscreen theyre charming enough together dornan is left largely to brood while johnson sparkles but together they produce something disarmingly funny like a comedy of capitalist manners fifty shades is best compared to 1990s pretty woman a repressed billionaire tycoon proposes a business agreement with a freespirited woman to provide escort services for a week holy shit she cries once the deal is sealed aided by discreet henchmen to an eclectic pop soundtrack he showers her with expensive gifts and spirits her away on surprise excursions he confesses his childhood psychic wounds and she rescues him right back the similarity even extends to a scene where the tortured hero expresses his feels via melancholy midnight piano playing only to be seductively interrupted when the heroine trails out of bed like pretty woman fifty shades collapses the corporate and the corporeal the libidinal and consumer economies that capitalism turns every human experience into a commodity to be traded  and that we already know and live under these conditions  makes this a conservative rather than a subversive story its audience appeal is based on capitalist fantasies about using ones wealth to dominate others not subcultural fantasies of finding freedom through sexual surrender how the tycoon christian grey dornan actually produces his wealth remains hazy the film is only interested insofar as it allows virginal anastasia steele johnson to interview him awkwardly for her college newspaper replacing her sick housemate kate eloise mumford in a classic screwball meetcute ana stumbles across the threshold of christians office and blithely quizzes him on whether hes gay its the best satire on interviewing since notting hill johnson gives ana an almost somnolently diffident voice and an engagingly startled gawky physicality peeping from under a shaggy boho fringe fifty shades began as twilight fanfic but unlike that story in which a creepy stalker inexplicably decides a boring teenager is special we instantly grasp why ana might intrigue christian to this prematurely jaded businessman her innocence is a greenfield worth tapping yet her alert selfreliance warns us  and teases christian  that she wont meekly take his punishment taylorjohnson and mcgarvey shoot the luxurious bubble  or prison  in which christian dwells in a glamorous impersonal way fresh from an interiors magazine his vast office peopled by greyuniformed babes and his splitlevel seattle penthouse done up in marble leather and satin amplify the films signature colour to the point of absurdity  although i couldnt help noticing that christians bedsheets are the same colour as those of michael fassbenders sexaddict character in shame however in a welcome departure from the books fawning surrender to commodity fetishism ana is wary of christians unsolicited expensive gestures  especially the way he summarily replaces her quirky volkswagen beetle with a new audi the colour of a popped cherry the films mcguffin is the binding contract christian wants ana to sign their negotiations are mischievous exercises of equal agency rather than a hostile takeover a business meeting sequence beautifully shot under redtinged light in christians office had my preview audience in stitches as various sex acts are duly noted and ruled out with phallic grey pencils at the screening i attended guests were given special tiein ice creams coated in greytinted chocolate once you bit down though the ice cream was vanilla surrounded by a layer of treacle its apropos this isnt really a bdsm story like secretary the piano teacher or nymphomaniac its not interested in why someone would freely choose sexual submission instead the contents of christians red room of pain seem to function as abstract symbols of anas sexual awakening theyre sex toys in the same sense that christian is a billionaire and ana is an english literature major rather than offering specific sensations they merely communicate that something kinky and unusual is afoot what people seem to love about the fifty shades story is the much more conventional fantasy that a woman can redeem and tame a damaged man christians sexual inclinations are explained purely as residual trauma from his exploitation by unseen cruel older women even david cronenbergs flawed a dangerous method doesnt resort to such easy psychoanalysis and its unconvincing i dont make love avows christian i fuck hard yet its striking how comparatively mr whippysoft the sex scenes are theyre well within hollywoods mainstream erotic vocabulary of elevator clinches silhouetted kisses heads ecstatically thrown back a tasteful butt shot or two and fingers and tongues trailing down naked torsos all soundtracked to swooning power ballads filmed montagestyle the sex scenes are cunningly edited to suggest far more than they actually depict and taylorjohnson and mcgarvey do wring out a few striking moments the hairs on anas thighs silhouetted golden in the light seattle rain from christians apartment windows projected sinuously on the wall behind the couple but while the camera feasts on johnsons nudity pleasingly ana actually has pubes it refuses to make a similarly voluptuous spectacle of dornans apart from one tantalising flyunzipping shot christians lower body is almost always shrouded in denim mystery perhaps this is intended to represent the control christian exerts in all things but its also easy to read as a denial of the female gaze viewers will find themselves instead fixated on dornans extremely handsome face and penetrating greyeyed gaze his performance is cold controlled and kind of dull  except for two scenes one perhaps the films most touching has christian and ana take a euphoric glider joyflight unseen by each another they surrender to their joy as the glider loops gracefully through the sky the second christians climactic dealbreaking whipping of ana may be held up as problematic by those who argue fifty shades glamorises abusive relationships thats not quite fair as the filmmakers carefully emphasise the consensual nature of everything depicted including this and its the first time we see christian truly indulging his own pleasure aroused from both icy capitalist cliché and solicitous tenderness quivering gasping and perspiring as he wields the belt that this is represented as a bridge too far annoys me since its the films most interesting moment awakening new power and determination in ana and making christian vulnerable in a way no moonlit piano jams and bedside confessions can do as readers will know this is only the beginning want more junkee in your life sign up to our newsletter and follow us on instagram twitter and facebook so you always know

Aug 11 2015,negative, ive only read enough of the book to appreciate the awfulness of el james writing still as youve heard unless youre completely cut off from the culture the book is about englishlit grad student anastasia steele dakota johnson meeting telecom billionaire christian grey jamie dornan and discovering the taste for sadomasochism lurking behind the young moguls carefully groomed façade okay i think i know why this caught on even though its crap this is the fairy tale about a damsel being rescued by a rich handsome prince only to discover that the prince is actually a severely damaged little boy deep down inside and he needs some saving himself its childish fantasy but if theres one thing ive learned about movies its that they wouldnt exist without childish fantasies the way this film works its archetypes is reasonably clever though i would point out that pretty woman worked exactly the same way 24 years and 11 months ago  one of the good things about the fifty shades fever is that it has made lots of people dig up steven shainbergs 2002 film secretary and pointed out all the ways its superior to the current movie secretary is a masterpiece of a unique sort its the only movie ive ever seen that made me feel like i understood more about what bdsm practitioners get out of their sexual practices the characters in that film are also majorly messedup people but their sm relationship seems to fill their psychic needs and heal them in some way the male character in secretary is also named grey interestingly enough the movie also has the strangest masturbation fantasy sequence ive ever seen i mean office documents are involved sadly i couldnt find it online i googled secretary masturbation fantasy you can imagine what came up the other movie that this reminded me of is a dangerous method a talky piece that i nevertheless found interesting and one that features michael fassbender spanking keira knightley until she achieves orgasm id recommend that movie over this one fifty shades is surprisingly funny in a way that the book is not the first hour or so plays like a romantic comedy to a large extent christian surprises anastasia by turning up at the hardware store where she works and its funny when she gasps in surprise on the other hand the fourth time it happens the joke has gotten old funnier still is the early scene when she gets a call from him at a nightclub and drunkenly makes fun of his moodiness come here i want you no no go away still the moment when anastasia walks out into a rainstorm after her first meeting with christian and takes a deep breath in while getting pelted by the rain thats when the alarm bells started ringing in my head theres no chemistry between the actors and i think its on dornan he seems to miss the neuroses that drive this man anastasias early description of christian is really intense and intimidating and i got neither of those things from the actor dakota johnson the reallife daughter of don johnson and melanie griffith and whom you saw as the stanford girl introducing justin timberlake to facebook in the social network falls short in some of the more emotional scenes but she still shows enough that id be interested to see her in nongrey material  the sex scenes dont interest me actually most sex scenes in movies dont interest me but thats another issue director sam taylorjohnson who previously made nowhere boy fumbles the first one severely switching between shots of anas head lying at the left of the screen and shots of her head at the right of the screen with no reason its a challenge to make a film interesting when so much of it is taken up with sex scenes and taylorjohnson seems to sense it she tries to introduce character developments with successive ones they dont take though hard to say what anastasia sees in christian i mean hes ridiculously handsome and rich sure but he also has no sense of humor and fears spontaneity what fun is this guy call him a jerk or a commitmentphobe or an abuser or a bad bdsm practitioner but as a fictional character hes something worse than all of those things hes a bore and thats probably why the film intensely bored me during its latter half what else damn did anastasia and christian really spend all that screen time negotiating the terms of the sex contract he wanted her to sign and did it all really end with them deciding that the contract didnt matter what a waste of time also theres two postcoital scenes where christian goes to his grand piano and plays pieces by bach and chopin these are cheesy enough as it is but as a classical music guy i also noticed that jamie dornans attempts to mime playing the piano are really bad the way he bobs up and down on the bach piece is totally fake on the bright side i saw a bunch of trailers for femalecentric movies coming up some of which i was excited for pitch perfect 2 some i was intrigued by aloha and some i was depressed by the longest ride seeing so many films about women promoted in one place was a refreshing change from my usual moviegoing experience
Jun 27 2015,negative,when christian sweeps the demure anastasia off her feet and into his world of penthouseandhelicopter luxury and sadomasochistic sex what lies in store is two hoursplus of glossy tedium
Jun 9 2015,negative, tantalizingly not terrible for the first hour or so director sam taylorjohnsons adaptation of el james literary atrocity will presumably shatter box office records and launch a thousand thinkpieces over this coming weekend the fact that fifty shades of grey is not unwatchable is a massive credit to the films creative team spawned as this all was from a floating internet chunk of pervy twilight fanfiction by a writer calling herself snowqueens icedragon before professional publishers showed up with a sevenfigure deal and then your struggling neighborhood bookstore lived to fight another day just because everybodys mom was suddenly cool with being seen reading porn in public hey whatever works personally i prefer my erotica penned by someone at least slightly conversant in the english language but as that old album title boasted 50000000 elvis fans cant be wrong besides i spend fiftyone weeks a year watching and reviewing infantile male fantasies about a bunch of dudes dressing up in spandex punching andor shooting each other at least the rare female counterpoint has some fucking director sam taylorjohnson  a renowned photographer and installation artist one might consider above helming this sort of livejournal smut  seems to have had the semibrilliant idea to play fifty shades for the most part as a rather happy horny comedy shes got a remarkable lead in dakota johnson offspring of sonny crockett and melanie griffith who assays the thankless lead role not as the empty wimpering simp of james socalled novels but instead as a delectably awkward natural born comedienne coming sorry into her own as a sexual being and digging it for those lucky enough not to have aunts who drink too much and tell you about these dreadful books all the time dakotas anastasia steele is a shy virginal college senior attracting the attention of twentysevenyearold billionaire christian grey jamie dornan awful during a botched student newspaper interview he falls madly in love whisking her around seattle even the locations in this movie are lowrent in his private helicopter boinking a bit while withholding true intimacy babys got a secret christian has a bad past and hes also got a rather hilariously outfitted porno batcave torture chamber in his house the only way hell keep seeing anastasia socially is if she signs an amusingly plainspoken contract agreeing to live there as his sex slave under consensual stipulations anal fisting is off the table we sadly learn during the negotiations this is all bugfuck insanity and much to the credit of johnson and johnson see what i did there they play it as such dakota has inherited her mom melanie griffiths goodhumored sexuality with a head for business and a bod for sin she seems down for anything buzzfeed and other outlets are harping on the fact that she actually has pubic hair im old enough to remember when everybody did but i was more taken with the way taylorjohnson shoots the big deflowering scene  because of course anastasia didnt shave her legs that morning you dont see that kind of detail in many movies theres a really funny sexy comedy in this bigscreen version of fifty shades of grey that would probably have been wonderful were it not also stuck with being an adaptation of the loathsome novel fifty shades of grey after anastasia finally asserts her dominance over christians headgames and allows him to take her in his torture chamber on her own terms a theoretically heroic sequence neutered by so many sleazy dissolve shots it looks like an off episode of red shoe diaries the film sheepishly backs away and makes everything bad like scolding puritanical bad it gets all ugly and betrays anastasias character as she chastises christian calling him disgusting at the cliffhanger finale nothing about the last half hour matches up with the rest of the film and it keeps with el james craptastic illiteracy and lack of understanding about whatever it was she thought she was writing about if she thought about it at all youre suddenly being taunted for everything you came here to get off on and being a good sport enough to try and roll with this movies absurd fantasy earns you the wagging finger of shame one hears horror stories about notalent el james barging around this set of this film and yeah the internet really has ruined everything francis ford coppola gutted more than half of the godfather to make one of the greatest movies of all time but these days twitter fans would be complaining that he left out lucy mancinis vagina operation mary harron and guinevere turner upended american psycho into a kinda brilliant satire while clint eastwood performed some insane alchemy on the bridges of madison county  a wonderful film that was handsdown the worst book id ever read before i read fifty shades of grey
May 30 2015,negative, the el james bestseller fifty shades of grey is famous for bringing bdsm sex into the trashnovel mainstream but this adaptation from director sam taylorjohnson nowhere boy is just a sleek and dull piece of lifestyle porn taylorjohnson seems far more interested in fetishizing sports cars and tailored suits than whips and chains and the vanilla sex scenes quickly become monotonous and familiar offering the same oblique candlelit tracking shots of undulating body parts that weve been getting for decades this isnt the next basic instinct its the next sliver dakota johnson stars as virginal lipbiter anastasia steele and jamie dornan plays the mysterious christian grey a seattle tech billionaire who entices anastasia to become his sexual submissive both actors are trapped by the rigid banality of their characters and they fail to manufacture any chemistrywithout that heat this is just a story about a contract negotiation db
May 7 2015,negative, its one of those phenomena that seemed to come out of nowhere all of a sudden there was a book called fifty shades of grey and everyone was reading it basically thought of as something of a naughty book it quickly gained a reputation for being rather raunchy with its depictions of unusual sexual acts and thus it became the topic of gossip in a multitude of literary circles with such popularity its hardly a surprise that someone would snatch up the film rights and try to bring the worldwide sensation to the screen taking a rather big risk in the process where does one even begin when trying to adapt a novel that is known primarily for its sex scenes into a film fans of the book would no doubt think of this question almost immediately though it would hardly stop them from wanting to see the end product however for everyone else it just might have been an early indicator for just what kind of film that end product would be as the film opens we meet anastasia steele dakota johnson a literature major who is conducting an interview with millionaire christian grey jamie dornan for her sick roommate kate eloise mumford the interview is a little awkward to say the least as ana is a little intimidated by christian but he is taken with her almost immediately visiting her at work and rescuing her from a bar he finds any excuse to be near her she is hesitant at first but she too finds herself wanting this relationship to happen as the two spend more and more time together ana finds out just what kind of relationship that christian is into he doesnt do flowers cards movies dinner etc but rather something else altogether that many would find completely offputting however ana ends up being somewhat intrigued by the odd physical nature of what it is that christian likes to do but how far is she willing to go to make it work there are no doubt many who wanted to see this film come to fruition if only to see how on earth it could be done however in trying to bring this story to the screen the filmmakers seem to have ignored the fact that fundamentally the film doesnt work in the first place due to there not being an actual solid plot to move it along keep in mind im strictly discussing the film as im one of the few who did not read el james novel it appears to want to be about the relationship between these two people who clearly have some major issues that need to be worked out but if this was the original intent then having them be nothing but flat lifeless characters that could have come from any cheap romance novel off the supermarket shelf doesnt do it any favors  for its twohour runtime we never get the sense that we are watching actual people but rather cardboard standins that are perfunctorily going through the motions of these sexual acts aside from this if the filmmakers are looking to elicit sympathy for these damaged characters having them be into some rather disturbing behavior is not the best way to go about it sure there may be a small niche that finds that appealing but its more likely to push away the majority of the audience even more so what is it that fifty shades of grey truly wants to be a romance theres not much of anything that you could call romantic throughout the film especially as you get into the later scenes a character drama such a film requires character development an element this film sorely lacks or at the very least a reason to care about what these two are going through another aspect which the film fails at what were left with is a film that is little more than a string of sex scenes thrown together in hopes of scintillating the audience  this result may be enough for those who were looking for nothing more than a soft porn flick but anyone looking for even the slightest bit more than that is doomed to be disappointed again ive never read the novel so perhaps it has a lot more plot and character development to it but if were to believe that this is an accurate representation of it then it would appear that it was best left on the shelf or perhaps in the hands of fans who at least got a little excitement from reading it whether the problems sprung directly from james book or whether something got lost in the transition this is an adaptation that simply doesnt evoke any of the emotions that it so desperately wants to convey fifty shades of grey makes its bluray debut in a 2401 1080p high definition transfer that features a perfectly crisp and clear picture which allows you to see everything youre intended to even for the darkest and most explicit of scenes the 51 dtshd master audio is also flawless giving everything from the dialogue to the soundtrack in excellent quality overall theres not a single complaint to be had in either area the world of fifty shades of grey a collection of short featurettes that explore the characters actors and more featuring interviews with the cast and crew if youre interested in going deeper into these areas then you might find it of interest at the very least you get a good chuckle when they try to discuss how complex the characters are behind the shades a making of featurette that includes lots of interviews with the cast and crew who discuss the process of bringing the movie to life whether you end up liking the film or not its still pretty interesting to watch el james  fifty shades a brief look at how the novel first came about and its transition to film special note james mentions that her inspiration for writing came from reading stephanie meyers twilight let that sink in for a moment fifty shades the pleasure of pain a look behind the scenes of the film with the bdsm bondagedominationsadismmasochism consultant again if its an area that interests you you may find it worth exploring when you take a close look at fifty shades of grey it becomes painfully clear that its basically a plethora of sex scenes strung together with a bare minimum of support however even within that support we see only random reasons for these two characters to find themselves together continuously granted this film was most likely not put together with things like plot and characters being primary concerns but because of that the filmmakers need to take responsibility for the resulting product which is a soft porn flick with nothing else to offer surprisingly enough there are two more of these films on the way so perhaps that is where the characters truly come alive or we could simply be getting more of the same only time will tell as this directionless sexual odyssey continues

Apr 13 2015,negative, i cant believe i watched a movie based off this twilight fanfiction i read a few years ago its a bit surreal but mostly ridiculous that fifty shades of grey has turned into practically the same worldwide phenomenon as twilight and just like twilight it raises controversy and starts hot debates on feminism abuse sex and more the tyf staff will be getting more into the nittygritty of fifty shades of grey in our fourplay discussion of the film later this week theres a lot to address there and its not something ill be getting too indepth with in this review rather this will be my thoughts of the technical aspects of fifty shades of grey if youve been living under a rock for the past year fifty shades of grey follows anastasia steele and her relationship with a young billionaire ceo christian grey from the moment she walks into the building anas homely appearance is a stark contrast to the perfect sleek world of grey enterprises but christian is fascinated by her and shes definitely fascinated by him so much so that shes willing to deal with his standoff behavior and mysterious past what she doesnt bargain for is that christian isnt interested in a normal relationship if theres one thing this movie proves to us its that dakota johnson is a natural she plays ana to the t wideeyed quiet and inquisitive even in some of the bondage scenes which i can only imagine how uncomfortable those can be she gives it her all i found that johnsons portrayal of ana made the character more intriguing than the book ever did as for christian grey well i knew whoever took on that role wouldnt have an easy time with it grey is pretty polarizing and some of the stuff he says is so ridiculous that i cant imagine any real person saying his lines without dying a little inside by how grossly cheesy and pseudointense they can be unfortunately jamie dornan doesnt muster that right kind of intensity on the big screen sure hes attractive but the stuff the nonsexual stuff that is that had readers swooning was absent onscreen its not so much dornans fault who proved hes a capable actor with his incredible work on the fall if the script only deviated from source material a better movie would have resulted nothing about the film is spectacular the script which follows the book too closely doesnt allow the story to play out effectively were stuck with el james mundane plotting and frustrating characterizations what makes it even more disappointing is that director sam taylorwood gives the film no visual or stylistic flair not only does it have a boring script but the directing was too its rare when a movie is better than a book but in this case only because this movie is better than its source material doesnt mean its good theres a lot going on in fifty shades of grey but this movie doesnt skim the surface of it its as shallow as the book and its sort of odd that a movie as unromantic as this one is dominating the valentines day weekend box office after seeing this movie ive had some great conversation with friends and fellow moviegoers about it if theres anything truly good about fifty shades of grey it has people talking about important and serious issues the staff will be diving into these issues this coming week stay tuned gabrielle founded the young folks in 2010 with luciana villalba since then she has served as editorinchief and oversees the staff and editorial content on the young folks she recently graduated from northwestern university and is now working on her masters degree at the medill school of journalism
Mar 27 2015,negative,if they added foreboding opening and closing monologues by david duchovny the whole thing could easily be mistaken for a longlost episode of red shoe diaries
Mar 18 2015,negative,johnson brings some wonder and vulnerability to her part but even with a listenable soundtrack the song that most comes to mind is peggy lees is that all there is
Mar 16 2015,positive,grey may be crass and calculated but johnson saves it from being completely forgettable
Mar 7 2015,positive,without the baggage of having read the book the synopsis or even the films wikipedia page fifty shades of grey unspools as a surprisingly engaging story about sexual naivety concepts of consent and ultimately power
Mar 2 2015,positive, i like various physical pursuits purrs a graysuited man behind a sleek expensive desk christian grey looks unblinkingly into the eyes of his interviewer a bashful english lit major with a flowery blouse hidden under a blue sweater and a navy skirt draped casually over the edges of a pricy chair anastasia steele stumbles through the rest of her interview before meekly retreating through the reception area and into the corporate elevator mr grey mentions something about seeing her again but then elevator doors close between them cutting their gaze this is one of the opening scenes to the wildly popular big screen adaptation of el james book fifty shades of grey call them starcross or contractuallybonded lovers selfmade millionaire grey falls for steele shortly after their fateful office meeting he cant and wont let her go as he becomes extremely possessive and demanding steele reciprocates the attraction and begins to fall for him that is until grey reveals his darker sexual urges  the virginal steele must now decide between trying out kink with her rough new lover or walk away the film trims its former twilight fan fiction sources 514 pages to a svelte two hour and five minute movie although much of the racier content may have been discarded for ratings sake much of the cringeworthy dialog remains intact opening shots channel the great gatsby differentiating anastasias middleclass millennial normalcy from christians obscene wealth and luxurious lifestyle when their worlds collide ana is easily absorbed as everything from her personal style car and laptop are replaced to christians standards apart from her relationship ana shows very little interest in the outside world and never voices concerns about her future actress dakota johnson brings humor sensitivity and vulnerability to anastasia making her the clear breakout performance of fifty shades johnson holds onto anastasias bubbly energy and plays with the power dynamics of her characters troubled relationship her body language shifts from shy and insecure to ashamed of her dirty deeds to tapping into her inner goddess and confidently rocking her normallooking body johnson is not made up to look like a porn star we see hair on her legs untrimmed pubic hair and wearing very little makeup for most of the movie the audible gasps in my audience over her first nude scene were a sign of how little we see unplucked and unwaxed women engaging in and enjoying sex unfortunately mr greys jamie dornan does not equally rise to the occasion with a special clause to shade his privates from the camera dornan never seems to be at ease with the explicit nature of the movie he doesnt relish his characters highs and lows leaving the audience to beg for more acting chops dornan wears the suit well but sometimes disappears into its folds on the way to becoming americas next top sex symbol his distanced energy leaves the bulk of the chemistry to be sparked by johnsons ingénue its just a tad unsatisfying to watch as he cruelly manipulates her for little to no reward speaking of sex the troubling sexual politics of the source material was muted in order to score the coveted r rating each sex scene is differently shot to show the couple in various stages of the relationship anas deflowering is the darkest lit scene as she is slowly and seductively brought into the light a rougher afternoon tryst goes from warm sunny afternoon to an evening with an unpleasant ultimatum only one of the two sex room scenes unclimactically named the playroom plays it campy complete with the bassridden beyoncé theme song a third scene in the playroom is borderline abusive and brings to mind the question ana has been grappling with since the beginning should she stay or go fifty shades of grey is keen on details thanks to director sam taylorjohnson with only one previous feature under her belt 2009s young john lennon biopic nowhere boy taylorjohnson has now proven she can handle the sticky subjects an opinionated author and protect the story from becoming the butt end of a bad joke her visual style lends itself well to the big studio production and allows for great subtle side moments to occur outside the central relationship like ana and her roommate kates eloise mumford relationship and anas strained connection with her mom as of now taylorjohnson is attached to direct the next two sequels which could very well make her one of the highest grossing women directors in history so long as creators dont pull a twilight stunt and hire a male director instead
Mar 1 2015,negative,a monumentally boring motion picture
Feb 27 2015,negative,who would have thought a twilight ripoff actually being inferior to its already inferior inspiration
Feb 27 2015,positive, it is finally here the swooningly anticipated movie version of fifty shades of grey the book that millions read but far fewer were caught doing it and you know what director sam taylorjohnsons movie isnt nearly as terrible as el james novel would make you expect theres perverted like the sadomasochistic sex games played by tycoon christian grey and then theres perverse like the pleasure of watching trash so glossily compacted christian jamie dornan made his fortune doing something unexplained except he shouts on a cellphone about 24hour ultimatums its a lush lonely existence with a single sensual palette gray suits ties and luxury cars christian probably pays god to keep the seattle skies outside his penthouse the color of slate he is in the parlance of our time quite the catch but theres a catch christian is one chainsaw shy of american psycho with an sm playroom and a sexual history that might make sigmund freud weep not the most interesting man in the world but certainly among the kinkiest dornan also plays a serial killer on bbcs the fall and theres a dash of dexter in his deadpan perversion here he never takes himself too handsomely even when undressed despite christians dominance dornan is an anatomically correct sex doll with bling accessories for taylorjohnson to pose and sighing viewers to take home in their dreams dont take him seriously and nobody gets hurt into christians fabulously wealthy world tumbles anastasia dakota johnson a college senior helping her sick roomie with a campus newspaper project he immediately spots her as a potential submissive who will bend to his kinky desires something about the way she shyly pokes her lips with the pencil he loans her the one with his name embossed on it chicks dig that before long christian is impressing ana with expensive gifts and helicopter rides he proposes that she move in with him into a bedroom she cant leave without his permission waiting for his command to be sexually dominated to the point of needing a safe word theres some paperwork to fill out its complicated thats when fifty shades of grey finally gets around to the reason were here the naughty nekkid parts that james readers dogeared not all of them of course or else lars von trier could make two movies an r rating for the adaptation of a triplex book is a clue to the rough stuff skipped still taylorjohnson and her actors go further than usual for a major studio production in skin spanking and thrusts soft core porn filmed prettier than life christians infamous red room displays far more intimidating sadism tools than the script employs theres a gentle hand on the riding crop and all but six spanks ana counts them are just love taps johnson is the best thing about fifty shades of grey an average beauty with awkward allure the girl imprisoned next door the actor and screenwriter kelly marcel make ana less of a pushover than james wrote she holds her own with christian in the movies best nonerotic scenes a contract negotiation over what can be put where and when and a blackout cliffhanger that had viewers groaning from premature evacuation those moments put ana on equal footing with christian even when shes strapped down prone thats vital to any movie romance with or without the flogs fifty shades of grey isnt the howling pornucopia it could be but its sexy enough spank you very much the tampa bay times enewspaper is a digital replica of the printed paper seven days a week that is available to read on desktop mobile and our app for subscribers only to enjoy the enewspaper every day please subscribe
Feb 26 2015,negative,basically they made a lousy mid2000sera katherine heigl romance with a handful of explicit sex scenes spliced throughout the familiar clichés
Feb 24 2015,negative,a syrupy softcore melodrama with perhaps too much dialogue
Feb 23 2015,neutral,   fifty shades of grey is without doubt going to be one of the years most talked about releases  those who want to see it will be telling you how much they want to see it  those who dont want to see it will be telling you how much they dont want to see it  those in my twitter feed tonight seemed to fall into the latter category  for those living in the dark fifty shades of grey is the first in a trilogy of novels that was first published in 2011  writer erika mitchell going by the pen name of el james was as surprised as anyone when her books became so popular  within a matter of years shed gone from writing twilight fanfiction to an author who had sold more than 70 million copies around the world  this first instalment brought to the screen by director sam taylorjohnson nowhere boy and writer kelly marcel saving mr banks is ultimately two hours of seduction  anastasia steele is a shy bashful 21yearold college student studying literature  christian grey dornan is a strong influential 27yearold entrepreneur who has already has a net wealth exceeding one billion dollars  the two meet thanks to a curious twist of fate  what follows is a love story very different from what we usually see out of hollywood  christian clearly has feelings for ana but he also has a series of peculiar ground rules  he refuses to be romantic he wont go out for dinner and he even makes ana sign a nondisclosure agreement preventing her from discussing their relationship  you might think ana would be running for the hills but not so  thanks to his chiselled good looks and mysterious personality she decides to stick around and get to know him a little better  its around the 45 minute mark where we get treated to the big reveal  after dancing around the subject for days christian tells ana that hes into a bit of kink  his luxurious apartment features a playroom which a wide assortment whips paddles cuffs toys and pretty much anything else you can imagine  just as he operates in the business world christian likes being in control  he seeks a relationship with ana where he acts the dominant and she serves as the submissive  theres a humorous scene where the pair sit in a boardroom and flesh out terms for a contract  it will outline exactly what christian will have the power to do inside the playroom  the subject matter is intriguing  ill say that much  ive commented several times recently that sex seems to be a subject that is avoided in todays mainstream films  not only does fifty shades of grey feature several sex scenes it goes a step further and takes inside the world of sm  as to the nature of the scenes taylorjohnson seems to have found a middle ground  theres plenty of nudity but also a number of quickpaced edits to ensure the film snuck through with an ma rating as opposed to r  perhaps i should be blaming the novel but my biggest grip with the film was that i didnt find the two leading characters all that interesting  christian keeps pushing and saying she should give in to his desires  ana keeps flipflopping  one minute shes acting life a shocked naïve innocent school girl  the next shes refuting christians advances and wisely giving him a taste of his own medicine  the supporting cast which includes jennifer ehle and marcia gay harden dont get a chance to do much  marketed heavily towards female audiences and released just in time for valentines day id expect this film to be doing big business at the international boxoffice over the next few weeks  two sequels are planned and so this wont be the last well hear of christian and anastasia
Feb 22 2015,negative, in this movie the wealthy john gray mesmerizes a woman into doing his intimate bidding  ice cubes blindfold and all  and pushes her to limits she never imagined im talking of course about 9½ weeks from 1986 this was a movie starring mickey rourke as gray with kim basinger as his lover that stirred up a lot of controversy and arguments over its sexual content here we go again with fifty shades of grey which in 2015 has the benefit of social networks to create an incredible amount of publicity as well as arguments pro and con jamie dorman marie antoinette is christian grey a gazillionaire in his 20s who is ready to be interviewed by college student kate eloise mumford who becomes ill and dispatches her roommate anastasia dakota johnson need for speed to do the interview instead when ana and christian meet they are attracted to each other hes worldly handsome and powerful shes mousy flustered and enchanted by him christian tells her he wants to be intimate but not in love and he wants it on his terms so much that he asks her to sign a contract saying she will serve as the submissive to his dominant the script contains intentionally funny moments which are numerous and enjoyable at the beginning of the film johnson known mostly for being the daughter of don johnson and melanie griffith giggles her way through this coming across more like a schoolgirl than a college student dorman whose abs are the focus of many scenes undresses johnson a lot still theres very little chemistry between these two and i didnt care one whit about either vapid character this one is shallow and it conveys a strong message about good looks and money i kept wondering whether ana would have endured what christian dishes out if he had been an averagelooking guy with a minimumwage job and a brief anecdote from christians past is cringeworthy  ew it does have a splendid soundtrack with a danny elfman score and songs by the likes of beyonce and annie lennox if you just have to see this please note that its not an entire movie its based on the first book in a series so to see how the story ends youll also need to see the upcoming sequels
Feb 20 2015,neutral, i went to fifty shades of grey prepared to mock it mercilessly but over the course of last weekend something happened as i skimmed the 50000 cultural commentaries that dissected fifty shades as the definitive statement on female sexuality soccer moms sexuality the sexual revolution modern depravity mainstream cluelessness about alternative sexuality and on and on i found myself agreeing more and more with an erotica writer i interviewed last week not a fan of el james bestselling series she nonetheless wished everybody would shut up about it its a fantasy she said exasperated its pretend indeed and maybe we shouldnt judge people by the content of their fantasies whether those fantasies involve remorseless scotfree murder the focus of many an action flick or getting tied up by a dreamy billionaire because fantasy is such a private thing however the transition from page to screen always involves directorial interpretation and contact with cold realities idealized characters must be replaced with real actors vague settings with concrete ones movies also target a wider audience than books so its worth asking how it feels to view fifty shades when its fantasy is not your own in my experience the film is sometimes boring to a nonfan sometimes confusing as pretty as an upscale homefurnishings catalogue and not nearly as squirm inducing or giggleworthy as expected lets address boring first as everyone probably knows by now once upon a time there was a naïve college senior named anastasia steele dakota johnson who met a big bad ridiculously handsome billionaire with intimacy issues instantly smitten christian grey jamie dornan buys her luxury goods and offers her a coveted place as the submissive occupant of his private sex dungeon all officialized by a contract ana says yea to the sex but demurs on the paperwork this happens repeatedly until the movie ends  or really just stops when a film is essentially just about two characters negotiating an offbeat relationship they need to be likable and johnsons ana is gone is mousy book anas firstperson narration no longer must we witness her efforts to blame every bold sexual impulse on her inner goddess despite some lip biting and whining this ana owns her desires and in a few scenes even calls christian out on his creepy insistence on controlling every aspect of her life thats where the movie gets confusing because anas selfrespect comes and goes like the march wind a glance from those gray eyes or a hint of christians tortured childhood suffices to make her forget how often hes a bossy jerk dornan was memorably creepy in the british series the fall but there he played a character not a fantasy figure here he fails as most actors doubtless would to show us just what ana is so damn mesmerized by director sam taylorjohnson gives the seattleset film an elegant streamlined look and a silverygray sheen distancing it from the more florid aspects of its source material even the sex scenes tend to the pictorial following the grand tradition of arty softcore films all these choices work to make fifty shades a more tolerable experience for nonfans of the books than it might have been a more adventurous writer and director could have turned this twisted fairy tale into a fullfledged surreal fantasy think lynch or almodóvar using its inconsistencies as assets but james who wielded considerable control over this production surely wouldnt have given her ok to such escapades in any case the reality of fifty shades was long ago eclipsed by the frenzy of discussion around it perhaps its time for all of us to recognize that fantasies come in a great many more than 50 shades  and that theyre not real  from 20142020 seven days allowed readers to comment on all stories posted on our website while weve appreciated the suggestions and insights right now seven days is prioritizing our core mission  producing highquality responsible local journalism  over moderating online debates between readers to criticize correct or praise our reporting please send us a letter to the editor or send us a tip well check it out and report the results online comments may return when we have better tech tools for managing them thanks for reading 
Feb 19 2015,negative, reading the first reviews of fifty shades of grey i wondered whether female critics had been banned from attending the films lastminute press screenings the male critics had a good old laugh at the film as they vied to write the most disparaging and entertaining review it was a warning  to their readers to el james and to the films director  effectively saying your erotica may be popular but god forbid anyone would take this rubbish seriously and by the way we can write better than you can even if youve made a fortune then came the second wave of responses from women who wanted to like it or to be shocked but found the film anticlimactic wheres the sex wheres the feminist agenda this isnt bdsm this is domestic abuse in directing this film sam taylorjohnson held a poisoned chalice fifty shades of grey is not a boundarypushing female shame but nor is it the golden turkey that some would wish like the novel it is a singular phenomenon an international boxoffice smash hit by a female british director aimed squarely at a female audience like cinderella bluebeard pygmalion or twilight it is a romantic fantasy and a fairytale a story of sexual awakening in which the innocent heroines inherent strengths allow her to battle monsters in this case capitalism and a male sexuality twicewarped by childhood abuse and adolescent manipulation wicked witches are omnipresent in this story whether its christians birth mother the shadowy mrs robinson with whom he had a relationship when he was 16 or anas mother on to her fourth husband and having such a great time that she cant make it to her daughters graduation danny elfmans score weaves its dark twinkling magic around the story bringing out the archetypal fantasy towering glassandchrome corporate landscapes replace the dark forests of classic fairytales and much of the films mise en scène brings to mind the great expressive excesses of douglas sirks hollywood melodramas lavish womens pictures such as written on the wind 1956 with its chain of unrequited love its palette based around the four elements seamus mcgarveys cinematography captures the films reflective surfaces while introducing shadows and depth a shot of christian and ana making love pans upwards to reveal a dark mirror on the ceiling their image like an underwater chimera or shunga painting memo to taylorjohnson jellyfish in an aquarium would have been amazing storm clouds are always on the horizon and when it rains it pours ana goes up in the air in the helicopter and glider sequences much derided as examples of the films silly stereotypical displays of conspicuous wealth these scenes are breathtaking and joyous referencing the title of erica jongs milestone novel about female sexuality fear of flying the walls of christians office glow red and orange like the fires of hell as he and ana negotiate the contract by which she will become the submissive to his dominant and the red room of pain speaks for itself it is in one of the films earth scenes when ana and christian walk like babes in the wood that he tells her the story of his adolescent submission to his mothers friend mrs robinson the film borrows big from grimm and also from alice in wonderland the hangover painkillers by anas bedside are labelled eat me the juice drink me ana falls down an internet rabbit hole when she begins to research her subject online looking at dita von teese bondage pictures  a sly reference to the burlesque strippers reallife urging of women to read erotica by the likes of henry miller and anaïs nin rather than fifty shades the casting of the film was famously difficult as fifty shades fans bayed their disapproval in the background but dakota johnson daughter of melanie griffith and don johnson granddaughter of tippi hedren is terrific as ana a latterday tess of the durbervilles reluctant yet curious and questioning rapidly proving herself incompatible with the 50 shades of fucked up controlfreak christian johnson brings to mind charlotte gainsbourg in an impudent girl rather than the older nymphomaniac not least when christian plays chopins prelude op 28 no 4 in e minor on the piano a piece of music sampled by serge gainsbourg in his love song for jane b birkin in the absence of any really explicit sex the chemistry between the leads strains to be there jamie dornan the fall is not the plank that some male critics have described and puts in a decent performance but he isnt the sexy beast of the fifty shades readers imagination nor does he beat jamie bells recent turn as a melancholic whipcracking sadist in nymph0maniac one of the disorientating things about the film adaptation is the shift in point of view whereas the book begins with ana looking in the mirror and is told from her point of view the films opening scenes are mostly of christian setting up his world for ana to enter the upside is the loss of anas annoying inner voice holy crap she exclaims repeatedly in the book and her inner goddess an irritating tinkerbell that most readers long to squash underfoot but while jamess novel luxuriates in anas descriptions of christian and particularly his erection the film barely allows the viewers gaze to linger on the face let alone the body of dornans character this is a far cry from the directors video david commissioned by the national portrait gallery in 2004 a single long take of the footballer david beckham sleeping that allows the viewer to gaze voyeuristically at his beauty equally exposing of their subjects are taylorjohnsons earlier gallery film brontosaurus 1995 showing a naked man dancing in slowmotion and her short film death valley 2006 depicting a man masturbating in the desert there have been several films featuring bdsm imagery andor themes subliminally in the mainstream daniel craigs james bond tied naked to a chair and beaten in casino royale or explicitly in the art house the films of alain robbegrillet or catherine breillat maîtresse belle de jour the night porter mano destra secretary and most recently the duke of burgundy the closest predecessor of fifty shades is probably 9½ weeks 1986 another sexually driven us mainstream movie phenomenon based on a novel by a woman and taylorjohnson includes a nod to that films ice cubes and blindfolds but whereas 9½ weeks became famous for a number of set pieces  the food sequence the male drag scene the you can leave your hat on striptease  its difficult to identify a single watercooler moment or destinedtobeclassic scene in fifty shades despite the fact that more explicit material filthier language and dirtier jokes have already been unleashed by 18certificate studio pictures universal was obviously not out to challenge the parameters of mainstream taste or the boundaries of the bbfc and its worldwide equivalents in the uk at least the film was passed uncut leaving no hope of seeing a directors version one suspects that taylorjohnson was never free even to push at the edges of sexual representation and the films lack of explicit imagery and grit is one of its disappointments that this has been the predominant articulated response may be apt because the story is about wanting more hes gorgeous wealthy and makes her come but he doesnt do hearts and flowers and he wont let her sleep with or touch him
Feb 19 2015,positive,what emerges in fifty shades of grey is perhaps the best finished product that could rise from the depths of a compromised starting point
Feb 19 2015,positive, with a sidelong glance billionaire bachelor christian grey opens the door to his playroom  a windowless dungeon kitted out with whips catonine tails and riding crops the greatest triumph of this adaptation of el jamess novel  the fastestselling paperback in british history  is how it so effortlessly takes the seedy world of sm and gives it a respectable makeover not that my opinion is going to affect the movies box office one jot with tickets being prebooked at a rate of one every seven seconds this week fifty shades is completely bulletproof dakota johnson the 25yearold daughter of melanie griffith and don johnson plays naive undergraduate anastasia steele who meets christian jamie dornan while interviewing him for her college newspaper the pair couldnt be more different shes a naive klutz whos all fingers and thumbs hes a debonair control freak  but the mutual attraction is palpable with the looks of brad pitt the wealth of bill gates and the sexual appetite of a dozen rabbits on the first day of spring what woman could possibly resist early on christian warns the smitten ana i dont do romance my tastes are very singular you can say that again for the aloof lothario is actually a dominant hoping to turn the 21yearold virgin into a submissive many of the books weaker chapters and anas asinine inner monologue have been stripped out but this isnt a film that could be described as high art scenes of ana sucking her pencil make for moments of clunking symbolism the soundtrack including the rolling stones beast of burden is painfully obvious and christian despite his peccadillos is too perfect to ever seem real and the film more than delivers the first after 40 minutes of foreplay sees ana lose her cherry missionary style on silk sheets amid a haze of boobs and buttocks her naked body is whipped spanked and teased with christians riding crop  behaviour that would be likely to spark a complaint to the jockeys association in any other situation

Feb 19 2015,negative, lets cut to the chase on this one if you are going into fifty shades of grey expecting a smörgåsbord of steamy bdsm sex scenes that send you over the moon with images of orgasmic euphoria wrapped in the finest naturalfiber constraints you best be lowering your expectations while not entirely stripped of eroticism the couplings in the film are pretty tame youre likely to find much more kink in any given episode of scandal truth be told and the camera tends to pan away like a courteous voyeur before most of les petites morts are achieved so what are we left with just the usual wishfulfillment fairy tale of a naive girl and her prince charming thats been told a million times before based on an obscure novel by e l james fifty shades is the story of anastasia steele an entirely legitimate name an english lit major at washington state a clumsy plain jane and no big deal a virgin subbing for her sick roommate shes interviewing the millionaire christian grey dornan for her school newspaper a man whos made his money manufacturing things that arent important to the story and also feeding poor people the spark that alights from that interview carries over into a courtship that seems to be bound for romance that is until he drops an exhaustive contract into anastasias lap that details his predilection as a dominant and his desire to see her as his submissive and will she just sign please so the flogging may commence snark aside the first half of the film is pretty entertaining it has a campy nimble approach to the material that elevates it above its fanfic origins dakota johnson breathes life into an otherwise drippy clueless character she is absolutely the best thing about this movie dornan as grey on the other hand does not fare as well as written his character is icy and taciturn which means youre in for a lot of pursed lips eye twitches and severe looks and not much else except perhaps his abs that the couples chemistry is nonexistent also doesnt help sell the story but once christian introduces anastasia to his wealthy lifestyle the rest of the film plays out like some forgotten calvin klein perfume ad mixed with an sm legal drama about butt plugs anastasias never heard of them and other similarly complex legal ramifications of things maybe fists you stick into other things with excursions in helicopters lavish penthouse suites and of course red rooms of bondage the subversive undercurrent at work here  that anastasia holds the real power over christian because she actually loves him as a person and will eventually change him for the better  ends up not being that subversive after all its a bondage movie without much perversion a love story without much passion and ultimately a film burdened with expectations it could never fulfill it never quite hits as hard as you want it to a note to readers bold and uncensored the austin chronicle has been austins independent news source for over 40 years expressing the communitys political and environmental concerns and supporting its active cultural scene now more than ever we need your support to continue supplying austin with independent free press if real news is important to you please consider making a donation of 5 10 or whatever you can afford to help keep our journalism on stands
Feb 19 2015,negative,i can only say that boredom set in early
Feb 19 2015,negative,while theres some meat to dakota johnsons role of the ingenue jamie dornan is given absolutely nothing to work with for most of the film
Feb 19 2015,negative,in the end fifty shades of grey isnt so much terrible as it is timid and tame
Feb 19 2015,neutral,the muchhyped film adaptation in which james was closely involved sticks closely to the novel but is both strengthened and weakened by what director sam taylorjohnson and screenwriter kelly marcel decided to omit
Feb 19 2015,negative,what is this thing called love thats a question asked by cole porter in fifty shades of grey the initially virginal heroine has a very different if not entirely unrelated query what are butt plugs
Feb 19 2015,negative, ive seen them reading it at airports reading in their front yards while the kids are at play reading while driving their cars on the freeway reading at church with the book cleverly tucked in their hymnals reading while violently kickboxing and most notably reading in public lavatories while jovially humming very unsettling that jovial humming the fifty shades phenomenon has been impossible to avoid and that virus has now spread to movie screens while i managed to avoid the book as if it were an illtempered grizzly bear infected with ebola and brandishing a shotgun the cinema now beckons so off to the red room of pain i go subbing for her sick roommate mousy college student with a porn name anastasia steele dakota johnson who is so innocent she doesnt know what a butt plug is goes to seattle to interview billionaire business guy douchebag christian grey jamie dornan greys offices are immaculate and adorned with supermodels the place is also riddled with fancy pencils that have grey stenciled on them so that when anastasia erotically sticks one in her mouth its sort of like shes sucking on greys dick shortly after the interview grey starts stalking anastasia at the hardware store where she works but thats ok because he has billions of dollars and looks like the result of a night of passionate lovemaking between ryan phillippe and eric bana i mean lets face it if grey looked like zach galifianakis and only had a quarter in his pocket straight to jail he would go for such behavior his psychotic courtship eventually winds up with anastasia becoming his prospective bondage slave he offers her a formal contract that if she signs will allow him to be the dominant and her the submissive in a kinky sex relationship that will involve spanking humiliation nipple clips and eating toast in bed the sex scenes eventually happen and if anything they provide some good hearty laughs while the screenplay doesnt explain much greys sexual proclivities and needs to abuse his mate have something to do with his being a crack baby so i guess were supposed to feel sorry for him when hes torturing his girlfriend because his mom was a stupid crack whore fair enough when people arent having sex in this movie which is quite often as things turn out they talk in a somber slow irritatingly elongated manner everybody in this movie is a mopey sodden sop i love seattle but watching how residents behave and communicate in this movie makes me never want to visit the city again even if the mariners make the playoffs on the subject of greys dick again take note dornan signed a no dick whatsoever  sorry clause so he never whips it out on screen theres plenty of dornan ass and dornan chest and dornan chin scar but no dornan dick so any of you out there highly anticipating a chance to see some massive dornan dick will have to score a real life date with the guy because there is no dornan dick to be found in this flick the guy could be a eunuch for all we know the movie sort of just ends at the just over twohour mark yes those of you who get intensely emotionally involved in the plights of anastasia and christian will have to wait empire strikes back style for the suretohappen sequel frantic negotiations have no doubt commenced with dornan to get him to show the dick i saw fifty shades of grey on a valentines day latenight showing i suspect there mightve been some tug jobs and fingerbanging going on in the theater since it was the sweetheart holiday and well i heard grunting and snorting if there were various acts of covert sex commencing around me im pretty sure they were a thousand times more erotic and genuine than the hilarious supposed sexual antics occurring on screen
Feb 18 2015,neutral, id like to think fifty shades of grey knows exactly what it is  corny slash fic come to life  and if thats the case its almost admirable in its attempt at spectacle the two leads are also nice unfortunately sam taylorjohnsons movie adaptation gets so caught up in the intrigue and melodrama that it never really finds its groove even the films raw sex appeal is lacking which just leaves a poorly plotted story and laughable dialogue    poilib elementaccentdivider    max nicholson is a writer for ign and he desperately seeks your approval show him some love by following maxnicholson on twitter or maxnicholson on ign
Feb 18 2015,negative, few people took fifty shades of grey seriously even the masses who read it and neither does the inevitable movie adaptation written by kelly marcel and directed by sam taylorjohnson which is too bad really for the result is a lukewarm exercise in timidity that  if not exactly embarrassed by its subject matter  is extremely wary of diving too deeply into it i suppose that would be fine if the film at least generated some sort of sexual heat or was instead a blackly comic deconstruction of its source material along the lines of mary harrons american psycho but fifty shades of grey is neither the picture is disinterested in serious social commentary a disappointment given the prominent place of sexual ethics in the current cultural conversation and aside from one spicy dinnertable detente  lit as if it were taking place in its own red light district  the movie too often resembles someone furiously trying to rub two sticks together hoping in vain for a hint of smoke the main problem is one of the sticks as christian grey the steely young billionaire with a taste for bdsm jamie dornan has the same handsome vagueness of the last few actors whove been cast as superman and whose names ive already forgotten this is supposed to be a man of privacy and reserve yes but dornan plays those qualities to the point of becoming a mannequin taylorjohnsons camera lingers on his face for much of the movie waiting for a spark that never comes dornan also brings very little chemistry to his scenes with dakota johnson whose anastasia steele is the inexperienced english major who falls under christians preying gaze a virgin  literally and figuratively  anastasia is at first wooed by his money he tops foxcatchers john du pont by having a helicopter with a leather interior then his intensity when he reveals that hes not interested in romance but rather her concession to being his sexual submissive shes both unnerved and intrigued the movie wants this to be a struggle for anastasia but the struggle is communicated in the most rudimentary of ways johnsons scenes operate in one of two modes physical pleasure including softcore cinematography that does nothing to mitigate the objectification element and emotional pain she moans in one scene cries in another and then the movie repeats we barely see the meeting and mixing of those two experiences any sense of real struggle or conflict fifty shades of grey  and johnsons performance  is distinctly missing the sort of intricacy diane lane brought to the infidelity thriller unfaithful especially the remarkable scene in which euphoria guilt pride and embarrassment all race across her face during a train ride home from an illicit tryst in the end fifty shades of grey isnt worth getting too bothered about no matter how dubious its sexual politics might be it never really takes a position on questions of consent or gender equality just as it conveniently portrays christians sexual preferences both as something enticing and something of which he needs to be cured for a movie with whips and chords fifty shades plays things awfully safe
Feb 17 2015,positive,fifty shades of grey which gingerly crosses over into the questionable subject mark may not be the film some of the books readers were hoping to witness
Feb 17 2015,negative,there is a very good chance that i will see nothing worse all year im pretty sure i will see nothing more brainwitheringly stupid and boring  or less sexy
