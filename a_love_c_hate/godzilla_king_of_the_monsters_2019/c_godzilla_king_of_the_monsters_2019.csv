"Mar 28, 2024",positive,"Works on its own, and as a chapter in a larger movie universe that pays off quite well."
"Mar 28, 2024",positive," The MonsterVerse has turned into one of the more consistently enjoyable franchises in all of movies, as Godzilla, King Kong and all of the fellow monsters rampage against each other for global supremacy.  Well, y’know, there are also lots of human subplots, but we’re never really there for the people on the ground. No, we’re there to see a clash of the titans for the ages, and the four films we’ve gotten so far have all been decently fun at worst and stunning spectacles at best.  Ahead of this week’s latest installment Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire, let’s rank the movies in the MonsterVerse and see how these movies stack up against each other in the grand scheme of the kaiju universe.  A riff on 1970s Vietnam films, Kong: Skull Island gave the Monsterverse’s proper introduction to King Kong and sent its human subjects on a terror ride through the jungles of a mysterious island with lots of monsters to battle. The monster action was actually pretty thrilling, but the film doesn’t do some of its main characters a lot of favors with the script. However, John C. Reilly nearly steals the whole movie as a stranded World War II soldier who helps the main cast navigate the terrain.  Godzilla and Kong finally got a chance to battle each other in 2021’s Godzilla vs. Kong, a psychedelic brouhaha for the ages across cosmic landscapes and unsuspecting cities. Sure, the human elements can detract from the mayhem, but the kaiju battles are so inspired and genuinely eye-popping that it’s hard to complain. This one might be the most pure fun of all four.  While the film just could not live up to that absolutely sensational first trailer, it’s still a very compelling monster film with some of the better human characters in the series. Godzilla taking on so many notable villains from the Toho history of the character was so cool in a modern landscape, and finally getting Mothra in the series to help the big lizard out was an added treat. The scope and melodramatics of this one meshed really well with the unfiltered desire to let these beasts go at it.  Gareth Edwards is one of the best filmmakers of his generation to understand scale, and his Godzilla film is one of the better monster films of the last decade. It feels like something bigger than you, one that pits pitiful humans against dueling forces of nature beyond comprehension. Bryan Cranston delivers the best human performance in any of these films by a mile, and Edwards’ big battle scenes feel ripped out of an apocalyptic nightmare. It’s a stunner in every sense of the word. "
"Mar 23, 2024",neutral," It’s too bad that Godzilla: King of the Monsters features far sludgier CGI than the two previous MonsterVerse installments—2014’s Godzilla and Kong: Skull Island—because the muddy imagery fails to capture the grandeur of the movie’s ambitious lineup of classic creatures: Mothra, Rodan, and King Ghidorah. Bathed in murky blues and bleary rain, none of them register with the awesomeness they deserve, to say nothing of the title “hero,” this time defending his turf against the new titans. The human story—involving a tug of war between two divorced scientists (Vera Farmiga and Kyle Chandler) over their teen daughter (Millie Bobby Brown)—is uninvolving to say the least, though I did appreciate how the various expeditions they’re on treat Godzilla and company like specimens: analyzing acoustics, measuring vitals, tracking locations. There are moments when Godzilla: King of the Monsters resembles a fantasy version of a National Geographic documentary—except those tend to deliver far more stunning visuals without any special effects whatsoever."
"Jul 24, 2023",neutral," Synopsis: The new story follows the heroic efforts of the crypto-zoological agency Monarch as its members face off against a battery of god-sized monsters, including the mighty Godzilla, who collides with Mothra, Rodan, and his ultimate nemesis, the three-headed King Ghidorah. When these ancient super-species - thought to be mere myths - rise again, they all vie for supremacy, leaving humanity's very existence hanging in the balance. King of the Monsters is the sequel to 2014’s Godzilla, and the third movie in Legendary’s MonsterVerse, which also includes Kong: Skull Island. In 2021, Godzilla vs. Kong is scheduled to be released. As some of you might know, Godzilla: King of the Monsters is one of my Most Anticipated Movies of 2019. Not because I expected it to be a beautifully written, heartfelt story with fully-developed characters who I would immensely care about. I was incredibly excited because it’s freaking Godzilla and from the few images that I had seen, it looked absolutely stunning. I didn’t need an Oscar-worthy screenplay or amazing performances. I just wanted a decent and logical (this last word is important) narrative with reasonable characters, and tons of monsters fighting to the death against each other. So, my expectations were neither complex nor as high as some other people might have. Unfortunately, I left the theater extremely disappointed. I can’t deny the impeccable VFX and the infinite amount of wallpaper-worthy images spread across the entire film. Some scenes are filled with jaw-dropping cinematography, astonishingly gorgeous monsters, and the fights feel so real that the sound design alone takes you to the edge of your seat. However, when the two pillars of any movie (story and characters) are so far away from even remotely working, there are no technically perfect aspects that can save the film from a disaster. I wrote this exact last sentence a few weeks ago regarding Game Of Thrones, and I will stand by it. I’m always the first guy to praise exceptional filmmaking skills, but if I have to choose between a technically seamless movie, and a film with a fantastic story and fully-developed characters, I have no doubts that the latter is the indisputably right choice. Ultimately, that’s the huge problem here. The screenplay is loaded with some of the laziest exposition scenes I’ve seen in the last few years. Characters continuously have some sort of presentation to explain something in a completely unpredictable conversation randomly. Generally, a movie like this always has some kind of cliche secondary characters who are either a nerdy scientist, a comic-relief guy, a duo of bantering personalities, or a military general who always wants to attack something, even though everyone knows it’s not the most intelligent decision. King of the Monsters has all of these types and more! More?! Seriously, Michael Dougherty and Zach Shields overstuff the narrative with so many unnecessary, useless, stereotypical characters who stretch the overall runtime and extend the periods between the massive fights, turning them into minutes of complete boredom. I yawned during a Godzilla blockbuster. Yawned. How sad is that?! I really enjoyed Gareth Edwards 2014’s Godzilla. At the time, the most common complaint was that there wasn’t enough Godzilla in it. Most of the characters were well-written, despite that some could have been more fleshed out. King of the Monsters is (kind of) the other way around: there are dozens of monsters and bone-crushing, titanic fights, but they literally forgot to write a captivating story with compelling characters. In the first installment, even though I also wanted more Godzilla, when he actually shows up, I was so freaking excited! Since I had to wait for the third act to watch the Titans fight, the build-up that was generated and its payoff actually made the time spent with the human characters worthy. This sequel was doomed from the moment the characters were written. There are a lot of fight sequences, and I wrote above that unnecessary characters extend the periods between these scenes. The dilemma is that those periods need to exist, making the whole thing look like a double-edged sword that the director is trying to avoid. On one hand, you can’t have an action set piece after another action set piece consecutively, otherwise, these will lose impact over time and become monotonous, so you need to spend time with the horribly-written human characters. On the other hand, you can’t have dumb characters with unclear motivations on-screen for long periods, otherwise, the audience will fall asleep of tediousness or get annoyed, so you have to insert a massive fight sequence again, hence making the audience gradually lose interest in those scenes. King of the Monsters continuously repeats this cycle of going from one situation to the other. No one wants to have back-to-back fights because they’ll lose the impactful energy, but no one wants to waste their precious time listening to exposition-heavy PowerPoint presentations from characters no one is going to remember their name. I can’t even remember the main characters’ names, and I watched the movie yesterday! I can’t blame the cast, everyone gives good performances. Millie Bobby Brown (Madison Russell) continues her path to become one of Hollywood’s biggest stars (in less than 10 years, she’ll have an Oscar in her hands, I guarantee you that). Kyle Chandler (Mark Russell) does more than what was expected of him with such a lousy script, and Ken Watanabe (Dr. Ishiro Serizawa) is the only one who delivered a solid performance AND had a suitable character (fruit of the previous film). Vera Farmiga (Dr. Emma Russell) is connected to the worst character of the movie (atrociously irrational decisions made by Emma), and everyone else is pretty much one of the vast cliche secondary characters."
"Mar 8, 2023",neutral," Synopsis: The crypto-zoological agency Monarch faces off against a battery of god-sized monsters, including the mighty Godzilla, who collides with Mothra, Rodan, and his ultimate nemesis, the three-headed King Ghidorah. If you’re a fan of the Japanese Godzilla movies from 50s, 60s, 70s and beyond, then Godzilla: King of the Monsters is the film for you! If you want Oscar-worthy acting and a complex story, then you may want to skip this one. I love monster movies and have been obsessing over this trailer since the first teaser was released. While this film is far from perfect, it definitely delivered the titan-fighting action that was missing from the 2014 Godzilla movie. Godzilla: King of the Monsters has a plot (contrary to popular belief); it focuses on Russell family (Vera Farmiga, Kyle Chandler, Millie Bobby Brown) and the monster tracking secret organization Monarch. Giant monsters, dubbed titans, each with their own cool nickname pulled from legends or history, are waking up and wreaking havoc. Monarch scientist and Godzilla fanboy Dr. Serizawa (Ken Watanabe) is convinced Godzilla will come to the rescue and restore balance. If you have not seen Kong: Skull Island or the first Godzilla, I recommend seeing at least Kong for a better explanation of Monarch, their mission and history (but they are not necessary viewing to understand this film). There are a few returning characters from the first Godzilla movie and many things mentioned from both Godzilla and Kong: Skull Island. My favorite thing about this film was the plethora of titans they introduced and the way they set the stage for future “MonsterVerse” movies. There were also so many nods to the classic movies- it was obvious the people that made this movie were fans of the old ones. Other than the ridiculous amount of monster fighting action, there’s also a ton of cool planes and other gadgets thanks to the extended look at Monarch operations we get in this film. I loved the scale they set, how massive this operation has become, and how hugely impactful Godzilla and the other monsters are. Something cool I noticed in this film is that it’s filled with women in powerful places (military command, running senate hearings, pilots, scientists) and they don’t make a big deal about it or make it a gimmick. It was nice to see it as “just a normal thing” instead of a selling point of the movie. Ken Watanabe is fabulous, as always, and one of the better acted characters in the film. Millie Bobby Brown also does a decent job in her first big screen appearance. Another positive is the designs of the titans themselves. I loved that Ghidorah, Rodan, Mothra, and others were easily identifiable and basically just big budget versions of their former selves. Now on to my list of things I didn’t like… The acting was kind of cringe-worthy (except Millie Bobby Brown she’s perfect), but the thing that really bothered me about it was every line of dialogue sounded like a quip or cheesy one-liner. Especially Kyle Chandler (the dad) and Bradley Whitford (Monarch’s nerd character). Much of the CG was good, there were moments where it looked like they forgot to finish it, but I was too distracted by the big monsters fighting to care. The thing I didn’t like was Ghidorah and Rodan’s eyes, they were too human or something, and it was weird on close up shots. I also felt like this movie fell into the category of “Fantastic Trailer / Okay Movie”, which was disappointing. The trailer with Somewhere Over the Rainbow playing in the background is one of my favorite trailers of all time, so I had high expectations and unfortunately, they weren’t entirely met. The biggest issue I had with this film was the sound mixing and score. I don’t know if I’ve just been spoiled by epic action movies with equally epic scores lately, but Godzilla: King of the Monsters was severely lacking in that department. There were so many perfect moments that just screamed for a big musical moment, like Godzilla getting back up after getting beat up, and we got nothing. Even when the score was doing something interesting, we could barely hear it over the guns and monster noises. It was such a letdown. To wrap up, Godzilla: King of the Monsters delivered the epic monster action it promised in the trailers. It was a big budget homage to the classic Japanese films many of us grew up watching. I am really torn on how to rate this film; I feel like it needs two grades- one for “Monster Movie Quality” and another for “General Film Quality”. Though it has many flaws, I think Godzilla: King of the Monsters is a solid B+ / A monster movie. I highly recommend it to any Godzilla fan, and suggest seeing it on the biggest screen possible. As for my actual, general film grade, I’m going to have to deduct some points for the score, sound, and script issues. That being said, I can’t wait to see what’s next for the “MonsterVerse” and Godzilla vs. Kong (2020). if you do see this film the credits are filled with interesting tidbits and there is a post credits scene at the very end, so stick around for that."
"Aug 21, 2022",positive," In 2014 director Gareth Edwards brought Godzilla back to the big screen. His monster reboot was the 30th film in the near 70-year-old Godzilla franchise and the first film in Warner Brothers’ interconnected MonsterVerse. I loved the movie and its slow-burning, old-school, creature-feature vibe. Relatively new director Michael Dougherty (“Krampus”) takes the reins of the sequel “Godzilla: King of the Monsters” and delivers a movie quite different from its predecessor. The slow-burn is gone and the large-scaled Kaiju action is front and center. And where the Edwards’ film could also be sold as a stand-alone movie, this one feels very much a part of something bigger and broader. I wouldn’t call this a spoiler but the last film ended with Godzilla sinking back into the ocean after leveling San Francisco in a fight with an earth-threatening monster. Jump ahead five years. Paleobiologists Mark Russell (Kyle Chandler) and his wife Emma (Vera Farmiga) lost their young son during the destruction of San Francisco. They have since divorced under the stress of loss leaving their 12-year-old daughter Madison (Millie Bobby Brown) caught in the middle. While Mark has been off the radar Emma has been working with the super-secret shadow organization called Monarch. They’ve been monitoring not just the movements of Godzilla but the locations of numerous other monsters (called Titans) scattered across the globe in various forms of hibernation. Even more, Emma has constructed a device called ORCA that emits a sonar pulse which can either calm or rile the Titans. This catches the attention of a devious eco-terrorist group, Mark is drawn into the chaos, and a lot of big monsters rise up. The human dynamic is interesting in a variety of ways. The Russell family drama is easily the most intimate, but it’s the broader human story that’s most compelling. As Dougherty himself describes it to Entertainment Weekly, “The world is reacting to Godzilla in the same way we would react to any other terrifying incident, in that we are overreacting.” We see mankind responding to the monsters impulsively – out of fear and uncertainty. And the question becomes how far can humanity’s intelligence and ingenuity take them in the face of such mighty threats? All of this is explored through a fine ensemble – Ken Watanabe, Sally Hawkins, Charles Dance, Thomas Middleditch, Bradley Whitford, David Strathairn, Zhang Ziyi, among others. They all fall in nicely with a script that hearkens back (in a measured way) to the classic Toho Studio films. We get countless reaction shots, stunned utterances, and quick quips. Some may not like what they’re going for, but I got a kick out of it. And I appreciate how the film steers clear of drawn out exposition and loads of scientific mumbo-jumbo. A handful of characters do get pushed to the side but that’s okay because they do exactly what they need to do – service the story and keep it moving towards what we really are there to see – the monsters! And the Titans really are the showcases. In addition to Godzilla we get classic Toho creations Mothra, Rodan, and King Ghidorah. The creature designs are stunning and their epic-scaled clashes are breathtaking spectacles. The special effects, Lawrence Sher’s crafty cinematography, and top-notch sound design makes for some truly satisfying and immersive Kaiju mayhem. I can already hear the pushback from those wanting more human drama in a movie about massive earth-moving monsters. I actually like the way they unpack the human story amid a breathless array of action. And I appreciate how they add layers of intriguing mythology without drowning us in babble. And I can also hear those wanting more of Godzilla on the screen. There are indeed huge segments where we don’t see him. But I was fine with it because his presence never leaves our mind. While things were playing out in front of me, I kept thinking “but Godzilla”. So it makes sense to me that many have dismissed “Godzilla: King of the Monsters” the way they have. But at the same time it saddens me. Michael Dougherty has delivered a Godzilla movie that is unquestionably action-heavy, probably too much for those with no affection for the classic creature-features. But while the film is tipping its hat to its roots, it’s also subtly holding a mirror to modern society. I feel many have missed that element which is unfortunate. But when that human detail is combined with some of the best big monster action ever put on screen, all I can say is ‘Long Live the King’. It’s a ton of fun. Unfortunately it didn’t get the best reception (which I obviously disagree with), but hopefully it’ll do good enough to keep the series going.  Can’t wait to read your take on it. I’m with you, the mediocre reception has really surprised me. It was a great time at the theater and exactly what I like about big summer movies. I also love how it doesn’t shy away from its roots. I was really surprised that this movie was given such a rough ride really . For me it was amazing epic monster bash . The human element was there enough to connect all the dots and the fight scenes were off the wall good. The kid in me that relished seeing all theses iconic giants brought to life and although there was much going on, I never thought it lost its narrative nor the human element .  Plus I liked the fact that didn’t over use Godzilla  it made his appearance more epic .After re-watching the first one before seeing this one , I also have come to enjoy that one even more .I always liked it but have rethought a few of my concerns with it after recent viewings .  I was a a bit disappointed in hows this one has been received . Perhaps it was too long after last one but since they are knee deep in Godzilla vs Kong , we are assured of at least one more . Solid 9 out of 10 from me and one hearty roar for the king of monsters . YES! You absolutely nail it. I’m really wondering what people’s expectations were for this. I found there to be more story depth and satisfying mythology building than I ever expected. And then the monster action. The film packs some truly epic sequences that my son and I absolutely loved. I can’t wait to see it again. Hate to be a naysayer, but I could not stand this movie. For me, the problem was a huge technical one, I couldn’t see it. It was all too dark and creatures were far too obscured. I just couldn’t make heads or tails of what was on the screen. You say the creature designs are stunning, but I simply couldn’t tell. This made it way too frustrating for me to enjoy. My full review should be up tomorrow, but that’s the gist of it. Oh bummer. Hate to hear that. If that were the case for me I would certainly feel the same way. For me it was often breathtaking. Thankfully the screen I saw it on was great which definitely provided a better visual experience. I might check it out on TV though I missed the last film version though I really want to see the rest of the entire Japanese series. The first movie really got this particular version off on the right foot. It was too slow for some but I thought the slow-boil was just right for that film. This movie is probably too action-packed for some. Me, I loved the big action and it felt in line with the story this one was telling. Hope to see it again before it leaves theaters. Love your positive take on a movie that’s just gotten SLAMMED. Ugh. Mind you I still haven’t seen it but you’ve reconfirmed that this will be a great time for me. I am literally baffled by the bad press. I don’t know, maybe ‘dismissive’ is a better word. I found it to be an absolute blast, full of old-school (and nostalgic) monster action. I think it dodges so many of the potholes that can often make a movie like this a real drag. For me it almost felt yanked out of a time capsule but with a stunning new coat of visual effects paint. I was lukewarm on 2014’s Godzilla, but everyone I’ve talked to about King of the Monsters say this one straight up rocked! Admittedly, there are few movies I’m excited for post-Endgame (LOVED Endgame, but it’s a lot of movie and a lot of hype to come down from). This one, however, seems right up my alley. I really enjoyed Godzilla (2014) but King of the Monsters is a much different movie. The monster action is simply fantastic and I would definitely recommend seeing it on the big screen. It was even more fun watching it with my son. Hope you get a chance to check it out. Haha…I know same here. I saw it in theaters on its opening night with the D-Box seating (the seat moves and vibrates), which was awesome, especially with the movie’s action scenes. Yeah, pity.  I enjoyed the higher stakes, action & premise – and the discovery of Atlantis!  (Even if they had to destroy it to save the world.)"
"Mar 2, 2022",negative," Sometimes when watching an action-packed finale in a Hollywood spectacle, the oversaturation of CGI causes your eyes to glass over and your mind to numb into a sleepy state. Somehow, the filmmakers have spent hundreds of millions on special effects, animating impossible creatures, superhero battles, alien invasions, and untold destruction, but none of it has the necessary emotion and energy to counteract our visual exhaustion or keep our attention. Certain blockbusters have this quality, where the third act descends into digital white noise, and the viewer cannot help but lose interest entirely. Competent Hollywood filmmakers know how to use CGI to enhance the material and impress their audience, whereas others resolve to throw endless computerized stimuli at the screen in the final battle and hope for the best. For that reason, Godzilla: King of the Monsters is exceptional; it’s an entire movie that functions as a relentless CGI assault on the viewer’s eyeballs, sustaining a heightened level of fireworks that would usually be reserved for the denouement. It carries on like this for the more-than-two-hour duration, and although initially diverting, it gradually wears the viewer down into a trancelike state of disinterest. Call it digital blindness, in the same way that snow blindness results from severe overexposure.  Godzilla: King of the Monsters is director Michael Dougherty’s bigger, louder, and more tiresome sequel to the 2014 reboot Godzilla, a movie that served its purpose blandly enough to earn some admiration for its technical competence and impressive cast (even though Juliette Binoche and Bryan Cranston played characters who died too soon). However, after a recent rewatch, my already lukewarm feelings about Godzilla have cooled. Not that it matters; most of the characters from the first movie have not returned for the follow-up—save for Sally Hawkins, in a thankless and throwaway appearance, and Ken Watanabe, who is forced to deliver fortune cookie jokes. The sequel also boasts a roster of recognizable names and faces, not that any of them have anything interesting to do. Each actor has been typecast in a familiar way, making it easy on screenwriters Dougherty and Zach Shields, who concentrate less on the human fodder than the enormous zoological specimens on display.  The action starts when, in the destruction caused by Godzilla in 2014, parents Vera Farmiga and Kyle Chandler lose a child, leaving their marriage in shambles and their teenage daughter (Millie Bobby Brown) in the middle. Five years later, Farmiga’s character, Dr. Emma Russell, works with Monarch, the secret agency that monitors humongous animals like Godzilla, known as Titans. Secretly, Dr. Russell also works with an eco-terrorist, played by the ever-villainous Charles Dance, and they plan to awaken the hibernating Titans to wipe out most of humanity and bring about ecological balance. It’s a standard “the Earth is dying, and humanity is the disease” argument popular among Hollywood villains these days (see Kingsman: The Secret Service, Inferno, or Avengers: Infinity War). Meantime, Monarch and the U.S. military try to stop Russell’s plan: Hawkins, Watanabe, Zhang Ziyi, and Bradley Whitford are the scientists; David Strathairn and O’Shea Jackson Jr. represent the soldiers; Chandler is the concerned Titan-whisperer who just wants his daughter back; and Thomas Middleditch provides the comic relief.  Dougherty approaches digital blindness in the opener with Mothra (a ten-story moth that spits sticky webbing), and he continues punishing us with CGI for the duration. Every major sequence—from the first appearance of Godzilla to the Antarctic emergence of the movie’s main baddie, Ghidorah, a three-headed dragon from space—takes place in some manner of visually muddy, inclement weather conditions. Battles between the Titans, such as the first clash between Godzilla and Ghidorah amid an oppressive snowstorm, are a struggle to watch because they’re so murky and obscured. These colossal monsters tangle underwater, in a hurricane, in a burning city, in the rain, or atop an exploded volcano. Along with the shaky camerawork, it’s almost as though the filmmakers don’t want us to make out what’s happening. Moreover, in each location, the image looks as though it’s been run through color filters (mostly blue, gray, or orange), giving everything a digital flatness and hued sameness that is monotonous to behold for any length of time. And while the global plot leaps around several locations the world over, somehow, as the grand finale unfolds, it does so underwhelmingly on the ruins of Fenway Park. Godzilla: King of the Monsters also desperately wants to establish an expansive franchise, wherein 2014’s Godzilla takes place in the same cinematic universe as 2017’s Kong: Skull Island—all to create enthusiasm for the upcoming sequel Godzilla vs. Kong in 2020. Conspicuous references to “Kong” and “Skull Island” are meant to titillate fans and build anticipation for the inevitable meeting between the giant iguana-god and the gargantuan ape. But since Godzilla fights several Titans throughout this large-scale sequel, the notion of Godzilla coming to blows with just King Kong seems rather underwhelming. In any case, Godzilla: King of the Monsters has done an effective job of making larger-than-life creatures completely inert, and any popcorn-munching fun that might’ve come from such a show has been reduced to a dismissive shrug. The viewer watches in a perpetual state of numbness, consuming but not processing, oblivious to any attempt at story or theme because the movie’s primary concern is delivering a sensory explosion—but we experience only the drowsy effects of digital blindness."
"Sep 29, 2021",negative,"Strong action, weak dialogue unfortunately."
"Mar 6, 2021",negative," Directed by Michael Dougherty, Godzilla: King of the Monsters follows an assortment of one-dimensional characters, including Millie Bobby Brown’s Madison, Kyle Chandler’s Mark, and Vera Farmiga’s Emma, as they race to prevent a series of building-sized monsters from destroying the planet. Filmmaker Dougherty, working from a script written with Zach Shields, delivers a predominantly tedious disaster that strikes all the wrong notes right from the get-go, as the movie boasts (or suffers from) an exceedingly, distractingly slick sensibility that’s reflected in its myriad of less-than-substantive elements – with this especially true of the picture’s uniformly underwhelming and incoherent action sequences. (Such moments, rendered entirely with computers, are about as convincing and compelling as a third-rate video game cutscene.) And although the movie is fleetingly tolerable when focused on the exploits of its impressively eclectic human cast, which includes David Strathairn, Bradley Whitford, Sally Hawkins, and Charles Dance, Godzilla: King of the Monsters is increasingly dominated by dimly-lit set-pieces that, perhaps inevitably, pave the way for an interminable second half that’s capped off with an astonishingly tedious final battle – with the end result a very expensive-looking flop that seems unlikely to please even the most indiscriminate of viewers."
"Feb 18, 2021",negative,"  Godzilla is one of those movie creatures who will never truly die. First dreamed up in Japan in 1954 at the height of the Atomic Age, the nuclear-powered monster has unleashed destruction in more than 30 Japanese productions and three American productions, including the new Godzilla: King of the Monsters.  Taking place five years after the events in 2014’s Godzilla, the basic gist of the film is that a group named Monarch is tasked with studying and keeping at bay the group of 17 monsters that have been found around the globe. A rival group believes the monsters should be released, letting “nature” take its course however it may. I’ll give you one guess as to which group wins that battle.  As a result, monsters like the three-headed dragon King Ghidorah, giant moth Mothra, and pterodactyl-esque Rodan proceed to wreak havoc as only giant monsters can. It’s up to the movie’s plucky group of humans to bring an end to the havoc, and this time they’ll need the help of Godzilla in order to do so.  No one goes into a Godzilla movie expecting high art, but it’s still stunning how incoherent the movie truly is. The plot, such as it is, devolves into a rambling mess almost from minute one. That leaves the epic clashes between the monsters to carry the day, but even those are just a mish-mash of special effects where it’s next to impossible to tell what’s going on until the battle is over.  One of the only things keeping the film afloat is the general watchability of its laundry list of movie stars. The cast, which has five Oscar nominations among them, includes Kyle Chandler, Vera Farmiga, Millie Bobby Brown, Ken Watanabe, Ziyi Zhang, Bradley Whitford, Sally Hawkins, Charles Dance, Thomas Middleditch, Aisha Hinds, O’Shea Jackson, Jr., Anthony Ramos, and David Straithairn. All of them deserve better than the material they’re performing, but each of them also elevates it in one way or another.  Points do go to the filmmakers, led by writer/director Michael Dougherty and co-writer Zach Shields, for keeping the visible human death toll to a minimum. Action films too often wantonly destroy cities with seemingly no regard for the thousands of deaths that destruction would cause. In this film, two of the biggest scenes take place in Antarctica and in the middle of the ocean, taking humans mostly out of the equation.  Fun could also be had in watching the film by playing a “spot the reference” game. Only four monsters are truly showcased, but Godzilla superfans will no doubt relish either the appearances or allusions to other monsters from the franchise’s history. There are also a handful of references to Skull Island, which harkens back to 2017’s Kong: Skull Island and also hints at what’s to come in the already-forthcoming sequel, 2020’s Godzilla vs. Kong.  It’s difficult to know what could make Godzilla: King of the Monsters a truly enjoyable film, but a start would be to focus on what everyone wants to see — the monsters — and leave the tricky plot mechanics for pretty much any other movie. If you go by the movies, life in small towns can either be quaint and neighborly, or drudgery where even the smallest change to the daily routine can be cause for excitement. The latter is certainly the case in LaRoy, Texas, where a case of mistaken identity leads to the small Texas town having more crime than it’s seen in its entire existence. Ray (John Magaro) is a sad-sack character seen as a pushover by the most important people in his life: His former beauty queen wife, Stacy-Lynn (Megan Stevenson), and his brother Junior (Matthew Del Negro), who manages the hardware store where they both work. Early in the film, Ray is shown evidence that Stacy-Lynn might be cheating on him by wannabe private detective Skip (Steve Zahn), bringing even more misery into his life. While sitting in a parking lot, lamenting his horrible life, one night, Ray is approached by a man with an envelope full of money and a request to kill a man. Although initially taken aback, Ray decides to take the job if only to bring something different and exciting into his life. The real hitman (Dylan Baker) doesn’t take kindly to someone stealing work from him, and Ray soon finds himself in several situations that upend his world completely. Written and directed by Shane Atkinson, the film is a lightweight but still enjoyable take on a Fargo-esque story. The fact that Ray has three separate elements with which to deal – his cheating wife, the seemingly ever-present Skip, and his inadvertent entry into the world of crime – gives Atkinson different avenues into which to channel the story, which keeps the film from becoming repetitive. He also upends expectations at multiple points in the film, from the excellent opening scene to the climactic sequence. While some of the characters adhere to storytelling conventions, several take detours that keep the film from relying too much on Texas stereotypes. Ray especially keeps viewers on their toes, as just when it seems he’s becoming predictable, he makes an unanticipated choice. The film does get bogged down a bit in the middle section after an initial jolt of energy that comes with the set-up of the story. Stacy-Lynn and Junior are both mostly one-note characters whose importance to the plot doesn’t help them much. The real hitman, after making a great first impression, recedes into the background too often. The few times he does pop up make you wish his role called for him to be in more scenes. Magaro is good casting for this role, as – much like he did in Past Lives – he plays the well-meaning guy who is overshadowed by others in a way that makes you root for him and hate him at the same time. Zahn has the type of face that allows him to easily play the comic relief, but he’s also good in more earnest moments. Baker makes the most of his relatively limited screentime; if only had had more. LaRoy, Texas doesn’t do enough to be a completely absorbing crime thriller, but with a few good performances and a story that’s familiar but still surprising, it has more highs than lows. With a deadly crime spree the most interesting thing to happen in this small town, it might be worth visiting again. LaRoy, Texas is now playing at Galaxy Grandscape in The Colony; it is also available on demand at home. It will screen as part of the USA Film Festival on April 19."

	From the get go “Rocketman,” the new Elton John jukebox biopic starring Taron Egerton, is more revealing and blunter than last year’s wildly popular but hagiographic Queen movie “Bohemian Rhapsody.” 
	Using flashbacks John, in full stage regalia, tells the story during an AA meeting. The movie and his tale begin with a revelation. “My name is Elton Hercules John and I’m an alcoholic, and a cocaine addict, and a sex addict and a bulimic and a shopaholic who has a problem with weed and anger management.” 
	Jumbled up in the mix are his terrible parents (Bryce Dallas Howard and Steven Mackintosh) — when he tells mom he’s gay she replies, “We will never be loved properly.”— his songwriting partner and muse Bernie Taupin (Jamie Bell), plus mounds of cocaine and hit songs used to punctuate the autobiographical action. Unlike “Bohemian Rhapsody’s” prudish attitude regarding Freddie Mercury’s homosexuality, “Rocketman” is out and proud, detailing John’s intimate relationship with partner and manager John Reid (Richard Madden). 
	Part “Moulin Rouge” by way of Ken Russell‘s “Tommy,” “Rocketman’s” startling opening number, “The Bitch is Back,” establishes that this is no warmed over “Bohemian Rhapsody” clone. It is a musical, not simply a musical biopic. Characters burst into song and Elton John songs are woven into the score. 
	Of course, music is a large part of the story. In the tradition of musical theatre “Don’t Let the Sun Go Down on Me” isn’t simply performed as one of John’s biggest hits, it’s moves the story forward as a duet between John and his ex-wife-to-be Renate Blauel (Celinde Schoenmaker). 
	To illustrate the transcendent nature of John’s star-making U.S. debut at the Troubadour in Los Angeles director Dexter Fletcher gets metaphysical. As he plays “Crocodile Rock” both John and the audience levitate as if the music is taking them to a higher place. It’s trippy but wordlessly conveys the excitement of those early gigs. Add to that dancing Teddy Boys and flamboyant stage costumes and “Rocketman” feels Broadway bound. 
	The surreal storytelling effortlessly captures the heady, “Who wants to go to a party at Mama Cass‘s house?“ days of Elton John‘s early rise to stardom. Later, when John becomes a walking, singing rock n’ roll cliché director Dexter Fletcher amps up the style to portray the lifestyle the musician himself describes as “madness.” As such the biographical details are jumbled but “Rocketman” is more about capturing the moment not the exact details. 
	It is glittering eye candy but there is much humanity on display. In one remarkable scene Taron Egerton as John prepares for a live show with copious amounts of cocaine and wine. Staring into the mirror he tries to find his game face. From dead-eyed to sparkly in the flash we see the two sides of a man who once said, “I wish I was someone else.” 
	Egerton is a dead ringer for John, even if doesn’t sound like the voice from the classic recordings. In a performance that portrays the humanity and the outrageousness of someone who says, “I do not live my life in black-and-white,” Egerton grabs the singer’s essence. 
	Dick James, who advises John to “buy something flashy, put on a great show and don’t kill yourself with drugs,” add to the flavor of the piece but it is Egerton’s show. He can sing and dance but also mines the character to find an emotional resonance missing from many biopics. 
	“Rocketman” is sometimes a little too on the nose in its song selections. As Taupin, who will eventually call the singer his brother, and John bond the soundtrack plays “Border Song’s,” “He's my brother let us live in peace,” refrain. It’s a tad obvious for a movie that pushes buttons in terms of style, portrayal of sexuality and the flexibility of the biographical timelines. 
	By the film’s coda, however, it’s clear this is a tale of self-reckoning. There is much talk of reinvention, of “killing the person you were born to become the person you were born to be,” and as John becomes the person he is meant to be this very specific story’s “I’m Still Standing” message of resilience becomes universal. 
	If Blue Öyster Cult were to write the hit song “Godzilla” today they’d have to change the lyrics. In 1977 they sang, “Oh, no, there goes Tokyo.” Today the prehistoric sea monster has expanded his worldview beyond Asia and is now concerned with the entire planet. 
	The action in “Godzilla: King of the Monsters” begins when paleo-biologist Dr. Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga) and her daughter Madison (Millie Bobby Brown) are kidnapped by terrorists. What would these bad people want with this Emma and Madison? Turns out Emma belongs to the crypto-zoological agency Monarch, a scientific watchdog group who study the Titans, creatures long believed to be myths. 
	Along with her ex-husband Dr. Mark Russell (Kyle Chandler) Emma invented ""the Orca,” a device that allows communication with these mysterious beasts. More importantly, for the bad guys at least, it can also ""control them using their bioacoustics on a sonar level."" 
	As reluctant hero Mark teams with Dr. Serizawa (Ken Watanabe) and Dr. Graham (Sally Hawkins) to save Emma and Madison from the kidnappers the Titans, Mothra, Rodan, the three-headed King Ghidorah and others, rise, threatening to destroy the earth. It’s the ultimate clash of the Titans as Godzilla (who now appears to have a beer belly) stomps in to level the playing field. Cue the Blue Öyster Cult: “Go, go, Godzilla (yeah).” 
	“Godzilla: King of the Monsters” is a remarkable achievement. It’s one of the most incomprehensible movies in the “Godzilla” franchise and that is really saying something. This story of restoring harmony to the world by releasing these angry monsters is pure codswallop and remember, this is the series that once devoted an entire movie to the king of the monsters teaching his dim-witted son how to how to control his atomic breath. 
	I’ll start with the script, and I only call it that because it contains words and was presumably written by people and not some kind of Kaiju-Auto-Cliché generating device. Ripe with pop psychology (“Moments of crisis can become moments of faith.” #Deep), horrible dialogue (“We’ve opened Pandora’s Box and there is no closing it!” #howmanytimeshaveweheardthat?) and several big emotional moments you won’t care about because the characters are walking, talking b-movie stereotypes, the movie is as clumsy as the script is dumb. 
	But you don’t go to a Godzilla movie for the human content; you go to see Titans battling it out and on that score “Godzilla: King of the Monsters” delivers. Unlike the 2014 Gareth Edwards reboot the new film wastes no time in introducing the radioactive monsters. We then sit through a bunch of pseudo-scientific pontification until the main event, the cage match between G-zil and his three-headed foe. In those moments the film improves, mostly because these characters don’t spout endless exposition about saving the world. They simply fight. It’s WrestleMania with fire-breathers and when they’re wreaking havoc it’s a good, fist-pumping time. 
	“Godzilla: King of the Monsters” is in 3D—Death, Destruction and Decibels—and has a certain kind of cheesy appeal. Watching the cast of good international actors try and play it straight as they muddle through the nonsense leading up to the climax is fun for a short time but next time I hope we get more actual monsters and less monstrous scripting. 
	He was once the single most successful American fashion designer ever, a man who counted Andy Warhol and Liza Minelli among his best friends. Studio 54 was his playground and he made Pill Box hats a sensation after designing one for Jackie Kennedy. He was Halston, a pioneer, nearly forgotten today. 
	From his early days as head milliner at Bergdorf Goodman to his stunning late 1960s success to his domination of the 1970s, he defined what was fashionable for the in-crowd. 
	“He took away the cage,” says former “Halstonette” Pat Cleveland. “He made things as though you didn’t really need the structure as much as you needed the woman.” 
	He designed luxurious pieces from single pieces of material, usually silk or chiffon, doing away with the extras like bows and zippers, creating form fitting clothes that, as Minelli says, “danced with you.” His clothes were for a modern time when women’s lives had changed and they were very popular. “You were free inside your clothes,” says model Karen Bjornson. 
	In 1973 he created a sensation presenting a runway show at the Palace of Versailles, which made him one of the first American designers to rock the world of Parisian couture. Minelli says the staid audience were wowed by the show. “They went bananas. All that energy and that joy and that wonder and that curiosity. That is America.” Years later he made similar inroads in China, breaking through in a way none of his contemporaries were able to emulate. 
	The ambitious designer’s company was growing as quickly as his acclaim. Money came in the form of business deals with Norton Simon holding company that also owned cosmetics giant Max Factor and a disastrous deal the down market JCPenney. One reporter labels the deal, ""from class to mass,"" and it marks the decline of Halston’s empire. 
	French filmmaker Frederic Tcheng is a specialist in the genre of fashion docs. He previously directed “Diana Vreeland: The Eye Has to Travel” and co-produced and co-edited the feature “Valentino: The Last Emperor.” It’s a world he understands and the kind of story he is expert in telling. For the most part his instincts don’t let him down here. He doles out the details, carefully weaving together the personal and professional story of a man whose career was destroyed by excess—he spent $2000 to $3000 a week on cocaine — and compromise. 
	Tcheng ‘s choice to use a framing device, an unnamed narrator played by fashion blogger Tavi Gevinson, posing as an employee in the Halston archives feels like an unnecessary addition given the natural, dramatic rise and fall of the story. 
	“Halston” is part biography of a creative genius, part cautionary tale for artists who throw their hats in the ring with big corporations and lose everything, including the right to use their own name."
"Jan 29, 2021",negative," In 2014, “Godzilla” left us with a San Francisco in smoldering ruins and the very injured title character returning to his mysterious home in the depths of the ocean, having saved the world from near-guaranteed destruction by a pair of radiation-hungry MUTOs.  Five years later, Godzilla has his work cut out for him again, this time against a monster of mythical proportions King Ghidorah, a three-headed water dragon reminiscent of the Lernaean Hydra as well as the other flock of high-rise-size creatures that nightmares are certainly made of. Right away, you know ""Godzilla: King of the Monsters"" is a film that is not making a push for Oscar gold, but is focused purely on packing in the entertainment punches. Perhaps this is what boxing fans find so appealing about their sport. Or even those who follow the abhorrent game of tennis, for that matter. They come for the spectacle, for the head-to-head combat of two (or more) adversaries and to watch how the bodies hit the floor. Ken Watanabe and Sally Hawkins return as doctors at Monarch, the crypto-zoological agency – whatever that means – in charge of tracking Godzilla and keeping the other secret monsters of the world in hibernation. This time around, the Russell family is at the center of the film. Mark (Kyle Chandler) and Emma (Vera Farmiga) are the resident experts in the technology that can communicate with the beasts, and their daughter Madison (Millie Bobby Brown) astutely keeps tabs on what her parents are doing. When a rogue eco-warrior hijacks Emma’s technology and releases the monsters to set the world back to its natural order, the Monarch ninjas must race across the world and around the clock to tame the titans. But what they quickly learn is that their only hope rests on their fire breathing king, Godzilla. If the terminology and technicality sound vague, that’s because they are. The science, if real, is above the average viewer’s pay grade, but it also doesn’t always add up, even to us layman folk. However, we forgive the science of convenience to get  from A to B in the most thrilling way imaginable. The movie runs through action sequences like my fourteen-month-old plays with her toy figurines; our human protagonists are thrown onto submarines and military jets, traversing the world multiple times, which in the brief timeline of the film, doesn’t seem physically possible. In fact, you know it’s all a bit much when, mid-action sequence, you find yourself thinking about when they sleep or use the loo or do any of the logistical things people need to do in a day. And listen, it’s ridiculous. “Godzilla: King of Monsters” attempts to pack in so much bang, you forget why the fighting started in the first place. It’s an action film on steroids, and, like with most great terrible blockbusters, you may be guilty of laughing at a corny throwaway line or absurd scenario at least a few times before the credits roll. Despite this, or perhaps because of it, this “Godzilla” installation is fast, fun, and pretty much exactly what we want from a sequel five years in the making. The story veers in outlands so far removed from reality, they could only come to life in a high budget, sci-fi summer blockbuster that, at the very least, won’t be called boring."

"Dec 16, 2020",positive,The story is a little bit of hollow it's a little bit orced... but - big but!- Godzilla makes up for it. The return of Godzilla and all of these friends is pretty amazing and pretty epic.
"Dec 7, 2020",negative," Director: Michael Dougherty Actors: Kyle Chandler, Vera Farmiga, Millie Bobby Brown, Ken Watanabe, Bradley Whitford, Sally Hawkins, Charles Dance, Thomas Middleditch, Ziyi Zhang, Aisha Hinds, O’Shea Jackson Jr. ive years have passed since the devastation caused by Godzilla’s climactic battle in San Francisco. While many have attempted to move on, mourning mother Dr. Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga) has committed herself to her work on the Orca, a bio-acoustic sound wave system that may hold the key to controlling Godzilla and other “titans.” When the doctor is kidnapped by Jonah Alan (Charles Dance) and his band of eco-terrorists, Emma’s daughter Madison (Millie Bobby Brown) is dragged into the madman’s dangerous scheme to release more behemoths being held by secretive monster-hunting organization Monarch – led by Ishiro Serizawa (Ken Watanabe) and Vivienne Graham (Sally Hawkins). Despite his hatred for Godzilla, Madison’s father Mark (Kyle Chandler) agrees to assist Monarch in their quest to locate and aid the gargantuan reptile against their mutual enemies – including a newly freed three-headed abomination hell-bent on dominating the world. “We must keep our faith in Godzilla!” The world’s most famous lizard monster has been, conveniently, taking a five-year hiatus so that the events of this sequel can directly line up with the span of time between films. Humanity hasn’t learned much during the break, once again building containment fields that immediately fail to hold their prisoners, and devices of control that are unable to exhibit much command over their targets. It’s certainly not an original idea to have humans quarrel over meaningless authorities, yet that seems to be the major premise here; indeed, the first half-hour of “Godzilla: King of the Monsters” rehashes themes from every monster movie of the last 20 years. Further delaying the inevitable clash between Godzilla and longtime nemesis Ghidorah is a collection of hackneyed personas. Every generic character blueprint appears, sometimes in multiples: a nerdy scientist (Middleditch); a wise-cracking technician (Whitford); the precocious, headstrong child (Brown); the guilt-ridden father running away from his family (Chandler); the grief-stricken mother consumed by her work (Farmiga); the grimacing, stone-faced villain (Dance); and a wealth of military personnel (some barking serious orders, others providing cynical utterances), researchers, and politicians. And the dialogue is bland to match, from commonplace conversations to laboratory lingo to military mumbo-jumbo. Far too many supporting players populate the picture, with not a one feeling fresh or necessary. Fortunately, Monster Zero promises some excitement, though it’s the kind that probably won’t live up to expectations. Special effects have come a long way since the man-in-a-suit gimmicks of the originals or Harryhausen’s stop-motion derivations, so Ghidorah’s appearance is fairly amusing; the space creature’s movements are mesmerizing, particularly as its three heads writhe in a natural, oscillating cadence. But despite the sizable budget, there are still copious amounts of obfuscation pummeling the screen; rapid cuts and camera angles, storms and environmental debris, and flickering lights paired with nighttime shots all keep the kaiju combatants blurred and entangled. Specific choreography is impossible to sort out. “Godzilla: King of the Monsters” is an epitomic example of bombastic spectacle unable to overtake terrible storytelling. Accidental hilarity finds its way into the film through candid lines from an emotionless antagonist; ludicrous transportation conundrums as the main characters zip back and forth across the globe; and the nonsensically-ignored physics of nuclear explosions and blast radii, oversized stealth jets flying through violent tempests while miraculously pulling off complex rescues, and submarines diving and surfacing from extreme depths with the ease of a toy in a bathtub. But the visuals are the least of the problems; the narrative is more focused on motivational speeches, awestruck expressions and commentary, phonily emotional sacrifices, artificial predicaments designed to inspire last-minute heroism, and laughable stare-downs between man and titan. The filmmakers opted to follow the techniques of the Transformers series rather than “Pacific Rim,” resulting in massive amounts of destruction and collateral damage with very little substance. The monster battles are intermittently enjoyable, but the humans and their trivial woes continually interrupt them to ruin the momentum. For a film promoting the fine balance between mankind and nature, “Godzilla: King of the Monsters” can’t seem to balance the petty people, the colossal kaiju, or the reasons for all of them to exist in the same storyline.

"Nov 20, 2020",negative,A surprisingly dull affair as far too much time is spent on a truly ridiculous plot involving the freeing of Godzilla's rivals and far too little on epic monster throw downs.
"Nov 10, 2020",positive," Ever since the dawn of time, prosperous minds have dove headfirst into this indelible question, cutting through the dichotomy of our civilization and its past for the right answer. What happens when human beings try to reshape the world by using the dangerous creatures to clear the table? Who has the true power then? In Mike Dougherty's Godzilla: King of the Monsters, this theme is explored just enough to set up the wild and over-the-top action sequences featuring Godzilla, King Ghidorah, Mothra, Rodan, and other endangered, yet still highly dangerous, species. It's the crypto-zoological agency, Monarch, and various other black ops security mercenaries along with it, that have given these otherworldly monsters a rebirth on Earth that kicks off the deadliest of times. Picking up after the events of Gareth Edwards' 2014 film, Dr. Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga) is living in mourning peace with her daughter, Madison (Millie Bobby Brown from Stranger Things), estranged from her father, Mark (Kyle Chandler, so effective here). Emma is testing a new technology that can alert, harness, and tame creatures from different worlds, but what happens when such tech gets into the wrong hands, such as a mercenary like Jonah Alan (Charles Dance, aka Tywin Lannister on Game of Thrones)? Chaos can break out, alliances are tested, and families are destroyed. Enter Ken Watanabe's wise yet Dr. Serizawa and Sally Hawkins' Dr. Vivenne Graham, two holdovers from Edwards' film that carry over the story here. Along with computer wizards like Rick Stanton (a hilarious and much-needed Bradley Whitford) and Sam Doleman (Thomas Middleditch), Mark tries not only to reconnect with his family, yet save them at the same time. By the by, the monsters come and go, with the humans not sure who they can trust. So, you get the drill, right? Humans running scared, yet with purpose, while monsters, both good and bad, attack and roar. Dougherty's film scratches the surface of the methodology of these creatures while providing the audience with what they really came for: crazy action and monster fights. You didn't come to this movie for a geology session without coffee and donuts; you bought a ticket for Godzilla to take on the three-headed dragon thing over the city of Boston (Sorry, Fenway Park fans). It is the consistently rousing action that makes King of the Monsters a worthy spring escape. The 2014 film was bogged down by a terrible Aaron Johnson performance and way too much deliberations and talky nonsense. Every monster film needs a little substance, but don't forget to keep the pace and tension up. You don't need to be a Godzilla nerd to roll with the punches here, as Watanabe's doctor and Chandler's expert will keep you informed about what's going on, but your eyes will be served plenty of candy. Try and tell me there isn't a rush inside you when Godzilla and Ghidorah make a mad dash for each other, crashing through skyscrapers and streets for a battle. I judge an action thriller's quality based on how many times I lean up out of my seat to get tuned into the picture, and let's just say there were several occasions here. It's not heavy nor is it too light, but screenwriters Dougherty and Zach Shields layer the plot with enough thrills and scares to keep audiences busy and alert. You won't be bored, and quite frankly, you'll be tired in the end. The cast gives the film much-needed weight. When they were casting the film, the filmmakers knew quality was more important than quantity. Chandler gives Mark instant conviction. The man's been putting out solid work since he took over Coach Taylor's desk on Friday Night Lights. Farmiga gives Emma the soulful duality that's required. Hawkins and Dance are solid. Whitford is the highlight here, injecting humor into any scene he can, even if it's playfully saying, ""zilla,"" after someone says, ""God."" Brown doesn't get much to do here except look scared, concerned, and ready to run. The trailer really placed a focus on her character, so seeing her being given not much to do was somewhat disappointing. If you've watched the Netflix Original series, you'll know she can handle a lot. Watanabe doesn't work enough in America these days, but he's popped up in two films recently, this and Detective Pikachu, and given each of them some much-needed soul. He plays a doctor who is more connected to Godzilla's origin tale than he is civilization's future. It's as if the rent on his forgiveness for our world ran out and he wants to explore a lease on another planet. Serizawa has skin on each side of the game here, and a scene late in the film between his doctor and Zilla is one of the better ones I have seen all year. It's quiet, patient, and emotional, setting up the big finale. The action can get overbearing at times, especially with the title character making several appearances right at the exact moment that he is required. Most of the time, Godzilla looks like a drunk war soldier who showed up the VFW a few minutes late, barking and shouting about what's right. His battles with Ghidorah felt more like a 12 round boxing match, accelerating yet exhausting at the same time. Then again, I liked the Rocky-esque touch given to Godzilla's story here, showing us a creature who may not be as monstrous as the humans trying to dictate his pace. Like the understated brilliance of the King Kong stories, he's out of his own time and element, looking for safe passage yet running into harm's way at every turn. There's intrigue there that Dougherty doesn't miss. Godzilla: King of the Monsters is a fun spring kick to the senses, delivering on the action and boosting a cast that knows how to hit the proper dramatic notes, therefore giving the tale extra weight and space. I won't write this down on my year-end best of the year list, but I will advise you to see it. It fulfills the promise of the trailer and eradicates the dullness of the 2014 film. Who is the real monster: creatures or humans? That may never truly be answered, but this action-heavy film gives the theory some credence amidst the war."
"Sep 9, 2020",positive," Godzilla: King of the Monsters, if we're being honest, completely sucks but it sucks in that special kind of way that makes a guy feel kind of special. It's the kind of suck that you instantly forget about except for that weird tingling in your nether regions that serves as a reminder of the sucking.  There's no question that Godzilla: King of the Monsters should have been and could have been a much better film. There are moments when director Michael Dougherty, following up on Gareth Edwards' serious and silly 2014 film, taps into the soul of the Godzilla films and in these moments Godzilla: King of the Monsters flirts with being an upper tier Godzilla film. Unfortunately, these moments are often short-lived and surrounded by abysmal editing choices, excessive and unnecessary exposition, and wonkily awkward dialogue that serves little purpose other than constantly reminding us how completely unnecessary the humans are in this overly populated cast of one and two-note caricatures.  Godzilla: King of the Monsters isn't a necessary film. It's not even a good film, really. However, Toho devotees are likely to embrace it for the most part and those seeking escapist cinematic fare could definitely go more wrong than sticking with this nearly brainless, plodding, disorganized but still rather fun and cheekily endearing endeavor.  The Godzilla franchise is cinema's longest running and franchise, though certainly there are others that could claim to have a wider reach. The franchise has encompassed 30+ feature films, television, breakfast cereals, and a host of other pop culture outlets on its way to having attained its current iconic status globally. Most people have managed to see at least ""a"" Godzilla film, while others, including friend and film journalism peer Evan Dossey, have plopped themselves down in front of a big screen and watched, quite literally, every Godzilla film ever made.  In case you're wondering, Evan's a fan of this film. While recognizing its flaws, he embraces the culture of Godzilla and feels like Godzilla: King of the Monsters embraces that culture and brings it to life.  The third film in Legendary Pictures' MonsterVerse brand behind 2014's Godzilla and 2017's Kong: Skull Island, Godzilla: King of the Monsters is a difficult film to describe precisely because the film is less about narrative and far more about CGI Kaiju kick-ass sequences and goofily fun action sequences. Somewhat reflective of Toho's Heisei era flicks, think Godzilla vs. Destroyah, this is a film that defies its overly complicated plot with overly simplified action sequences.  The military also has their eyes on the tool, of course, and a certain refrence to 1954's Gojira should bring more than a few smiles to faces for true Godzilla devotees.  If you've managed to follow that last couple of paragraphs, then you're also an obvious devotee of my writing because I'm even sitting here reading it back to myself thinking ""That doesn't make sense."" Godzilla: King of the Monsters doesn't make a lick of sense, but it has a lot of fun along the way. Dougherty, who directed the films Krampus and Trick r' Treat, has crafted a visually appealing film with enough affection for its cinematic roots that it's hard not to imagine that folks are absolutely going to love it. While one could easily argue the visuals are often dark and muddy, there's a consistency within those visuals to the Toho films that is admirable and it's hard not to get a goofy ass grin on your face when such monsters as Mothra, King Ghidorah, Kumonga, and a few other surprises pop up along the way.  The humans? They're mostly irrelevant here with Millie Bobby Brown being one of the most appealing, while Sally Hawkins, now an Academy Award winner, being completely and utterly wasted.  Bear McCreary's original score is loud, booming and domineering, though at times McCreary serves up delightful hints of Akira Ifukube's Godzilla scores from the 1950's and 60's and suddenly all feels right within the Godzilla universe. One can't help but wish he'd stuck even consistently within that musical realm.  Godzilla: King of the Monsters isn't a good film. It simply isn't. However, it's also not the disaster many will proclaim it to be and it's fair to say that it earns its way within the Godzilla franchise. It's close enough in tone and aura to not be considered a guilty pleasure, because one need not feel one iota of guilt for enjoying a brainless exercise in monster mashing and kaiju bashing. "

"Jul 28, 2020",positive,"King of the Monsters is a solid, powerhouse kaiju story that even manages to find the time to make us like a couple of the human characters as well. That's a win in my monster book."
"Jul 27, 2020",positive," Five years after Godzilla becomes known to the world, an eco-dystopian plot is set into action that involves releasing more of these “titans” in order to reverse humanity’s mistakes. Shock almighty(!), it doesn’t work. Instead, titans wreck havoc, led by the three-headed monster Gidorah. Only one other titan can stand up to the apocalypse’s resident bully, and that’s Big G himself. Although Gidorah is not the only one he has to watch out for.  It speaks volumes that each of the four primary monsters are named in the end credits – played not by their motion capture artists, but by ‘themselves.’ Dougherty is letting his kaiju fanboy euphoria overtake him with Godzilla: King of the Monsters, and it works a treat. There are subtle nods and callbacks to the detailed history of the beasts, and a character arc that so deliberately mirrors the bleak finale of the 1954 original (the American re-release of which gives KOTM its name). Such care is taken for each major monster to have its own distinct personality, sounds and look. This is especially true with Gidorah; the fallen angel who is an easy villain to detest, the embodiment of an insidious, repulsive evil. All of these are evolutions of Toho Studios’ original creations, and a stunning demonstration of what modern motion capture can do. Taking in the magnificence, terror and spectacle of these monsters reminds you of why we have movies like this. Most importantly however, the battles are as vicious and intense as you like. Weirdly for a film with a 500-foot three-headed dragon, some of the final moments feel over the top. Mostly though, the kaijus are finally seen as the best version of themselves. The most heart-pounding set piece is a chase involving the giant pteranodon Rodan near the Mexican coast, but the ultimate showdown is between Godzilla and Gidorah. With these two mighty foes at the centre, KOTM has plenty of moments where it rivals Avengers: Endgame for biggest visual spectacle of the year. Dougherty holds nothing back, raining fire without mercy, and for this he deserves massive credit. Unfortunately, KOTM can’t really move the MonsterVerse forward like it wants to, since it falls into some all too common pitfalls. As with Godzilla (2014), the humans serve little purpose other than occupying screen time that should be taken up by the monsters. They at least seem less robotic than Aaron Taylor-Johnson’s moody military maverick, but the family dynamic of the Russells is uninspiring. Very much going through the motions as far as the troubled family thread goes, they still emerge as the highlight amongst a spirited cast with little to do. Sally Hawkins especially, after her incredible performance in The Shape of Water (2017), feels wasted here. The cast aren’t helped by an occasionally appalling script, which takes so long to kick into action. Besides a strange plot based around a device that can summon titans (left out of the trailers for a reason, you suppose) and some nonsensical motivations, the dialogue is shoddy. It does nothing beyond moving the plot along, and suffers from some horribly corny moments. One line in particular is criminally awful – you’ll know it when you hear it. Admittedly however, you don’t watch KOTM for engrossing character work. You watch it to see kaijus kick the shit out of each other, and at least it gets that right. Don’t let naysayers put you off – Godzilla: King of the Monsters is a lot of fun and a bombastic salute to the franchise’s history. Although, you might want to consider losing a brain cell or six if you want to come away heralding it as a masterpiece. Director Michael Dougherty turns Godzilla up to eleven, but ultimately this beast is all killer and no filler."
"Jul 8, 2020",negative," Godzilla: King of the Monsters (2019) is a spectacular mess. This is an ugly, tensionless blockbuster where characters do stupid things while staring at computer generated, skyscraper-sized monsters battling it out in mundane fashion. It’s a never-ending assault on our visual, auditory, and common senses. Now, what I just mentioned may be a selling point for some of you, and with that I say: more power to you. If you come out of this thoroughly entertained, that’s great. I wish I could’ve had that experience.  Director Michael Dougherty (who cowrote the screenplay with Zach Shields) molded this story – a continuation of Warner Brothers’ “MonsterVerse” that includes the previous Godzilla (2014) and Kong: Skull Island (2017) – with a flat, lifeless energy. Visually, the action is depicted as though it were photographed through mud, often taking place at night during a rain storm or blizzard, or in the middle of a dust cloud. An early set piece happens in Antarctica of all places, where a nighttime snow storm obscures our vision badly. It’s all chaos with no clarity. One of the major gripes some audience members had with Godzilla (2014) was the lack of action with the monsters (or “Titans” as they’re described). This time, the action is tripled, and yet we aren’t rewarded because the visuals are so damn murky. Is it too much to ask that an action scene take place in the middle of the day while it’s sunny outside? It’s unfortunate that a talented cast is wasted with such undercooked material. O’Shea Jackson Jr., David Strathairn, Ziyi Zhang, and Sally Hawkins are all exceptional actors, and yet are given nothing to do, are tossed to the side, or are simply forgotten about as the plot progresses. Poor Vera Farmiga, she is saddled with a character who defies all logic. Her Dr. Emma Russell has developed a machine that can communicate with the Titans through sound waves, and yet her motivation isn’t to control them so much as to let nature balance itself out? There’s a strange bit of dialogue in which she explains how civilization has destroyed Earth’s ecosystem, and the emergence of the Titans is nature’s way of correcting itself, regardless of the substantial loss of life that will come of it. Basically, she’s Thanos but with a PHD.  Safety is not treated with much urgency among these people. Emma, knowing full well how hazardous her work is, willfully brings along her daughter Madison (Millie Bobby Brown) to her secret laboratory to witness her experiments play out. It doesn’t help that the compound is then ambushed by eco-terrorists (lead by Charles Dance) in an attempt to steal Emma’s technology. This leads to Emma’s ex-husband Mark (Kyle Chandler) going on a personal quest to save Emma and Madison. Chandler is the only rational character we get. He clearly sees the danger of the Titans, and yet his warnings fall on deaf ears. Chandler exudes the same kind of dad/intellectual/everyman quality that Sam Neill brought in Jurassic Park (1993) but is let down by a far lesser narrative. The plot settles into repetitiveness as our characters travel across the world on a super jet, witness a Titan fight just to be caught up in the mayhem and having to escape before being crushed, and then traveling to a new destination to do it all over again. For a movie where the action is the selling point, there is a surprising lack of it amongst our human characters. When they are not running towards or away from danger, they simply stand around a command center looking at monitors or out of windows. The art direction has such little ingenuity that a scene taking place inside of a submarine looks like it could have happened on the super jet also, the set design does not distinguish the two locations well enough. The story is so underwhelming that a situation involving twins is brought up as though it were important but is then thrown away with no real relevance or impact. I’ve heard of actors making cameos in a movie, but it’s rare to see an actual plot point be treated like one. I found myself squirming in my seat during Godzilla: King of the Monsters as a means of keeping myself engaged. There’s very little here that I found fun, entertaining, or enjoyable at any level. It’s a drag of epic proportions. I’m jealous of those who will like this, I wish I could’ve seen the movie they saw."

"Jun 28, 2020",positive," The post-credits scene. It’s been around for a long time, much longer than the classic Ferris Bueller plea for the audience to finally leave (In fact, Animal did something similar at the end of The Muppet Movie seven years earlier). Mostly because of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, they’ve become even more popular, as of late. In my opinion, the number one, best of these is from a Marvel film: Spider-Man: Homecoming. Being that it was released worldwide on the same day, I consider it to be the greatest practical joke ever played upon movie theater audiences. The second best, to me, was at the end of Kong: Skull Island. Even though I knew the film was a litmus test to see if what had been started in Godzilla could continue as a franchise, it was still an amazing surprise to this longtime kaiju film fan. The promise set forth with that post-credits scene has now finally been realized with Godzilla: King of the Monsters. It's been five years since the battles between Godzilla and the MUTOs wreaked all kinds of destruction and showed the world that monsters exist. The organization Monarch has been locating and, subsequently, keeping an eye on these creatures, known collectively as Titans. One of their lead researchers is Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga), who has developed a machine, called the Orca, that mimics the frequencies Titans use to communicate. After the first successful test, she and her daughter, Madison (Millie Bobby Brown), are kidnapped by Alan Jonah (Charles Dance) and his team of ecoterrorists. Monarch recruits Emma's ex-husband, animal behaviorist Mark (Kyle Chandler), to help track down his family and the Orca. In the process, they discover that Godzilla has been straying from his usual migration patterns, heading directly into the path of Jonah and his plan to loose all of the known Titans upon the world. Godzilla: King of the Monsters (henceforth to be known as GKOTM) is a very worthy successor to the previous films, amping up the monster action and even giving us a framing plot that's just as good as Kong and better than the one in Godzilla. It's also the big budget version of these creatures we've been waiting for since the summer of 1998. The human element is well thought out, with characters whose fates you get genuinely concerned about, who cause you to inch toward the edge of your seat when they're in peril. These aren't cookie cutter, central casting characters, wandering around like supporting players in a slasher film, just waiting to get stomped or chomped. Instead, these roles were filled with actors of a quality caliber. Returning for a second round with the Big Guy are Sally Hawkins, Ken Watanabe and David Strathairn. Joining the fight with them are Bradley Whitford, Thomas Middleditch, Aisha Hinds, O'Shea Jackson Jr. and, in a somewhat familiar-feeling dual role, Zhang Ziyi. Also, keep an ear out for a cameo actor to be called a familiar name. Of course, what you truly want from any Godzilla film, old or new, is monsters. The character designs the GKOTM effects team came up with are amazing. They have taken the classic kaiju a lot of us have grown up loving and given them the upgrade that goes above and beyond a fan's wildest dreams. I genuinely think the creators of the original Japanese creature suits would, and should, be proud of the design work in this film. Not only does GKOTM give us great monsters, it expands the mythologies of these beasts. The focus is primarily on the big four from the Toho films: Godzilla, Mothra (my personal favorite), Rodan and King Ghidorah. Yet, we’re also given a glimpse into what totals, according to the film’s scientists, seventeen different species. Sure, this is a blatant set-up for future films, and it would ring more as such if this wasn’t already the third entry in the franchise, as well as a fourth having finished principal photography. With several winks to longtime fans, GKOTM delivers the kaiju mayhem and serious storytelling that should satisfy all audiences. And, yes, there’s another nice post-credits scene.

"Jan 17, 2020",negative," What if I were to say that a summer blockbuster was boring? Worse yet, what if I were to say that a summer blockbuster starring Vera Farmiga, Ken Watanabe, Sally Hawkins, O’Shea Jackson Jr., and more were boring? What if I were to say that said summer blockbuster wasted its cast, its simple premise, and its handful of provocative themes? And what if I were to tell you that a random PA accidentally spilled their bottle of Mountain Dew Voltage all over the camera, staining 75 percent of the film an opaque shade of blue? I can’t corroborate that last statement, but I can—as much as it pains me to do so—verify the rest. In what appears to be a response to Godzilla’s reception five years ago, Godzilla: King of the Monsters triples down what audiences were clamoring for. That’s more mayhem, more laser breath, and yes, more monsters. However, all of that comes with a caveat. More lens flares, more Michael Bay-hem, more awkward cuts, and less cohesion in both fight scenes and pacing make for a ride that goes on for way too long and still ends before it begins. Don’t peg me as some plot-driven square, though: the main issue with King of the Monsters isn’t necessarily its plot. It’s just how apparent it is; just how left of center it exists without enough care to either blossom or completely get out of the way. That plot concerns a so-called “cryptozoological agency”, Monarch, as they fight against a trio of god-sized monsters. That includes dragon-type destructor Rodan, Mothra the giant moth, and, for all the franchise fans out there, the three-headed King Ghidorah. Again, there aren’t many plot devices here. The entire plot is a device in and of itself, and while that would be fun in more secure hands, it instead seats the audience with a handful of dreadfully dull characters. The closest to a conduit exists in the form of Dr. Emma Russell (Farmiga) and her daughter, Madison (Millie Bobby Brown), both of whom have their own turbulent relationship with the family patriarch, Mark (Kyle Chandler). Alongside them are science experts Ishiro Serizawa (Watanabe) and Ilene Chen (Ziyi Zhang) who, in their infinite wisdom, let in the little fact that Ghidorah is Godzilla’s arch nemesis. They naturally decide to pit Godzilla against the new team of threats. Things get scaly. Things blow up. Things get really dark, really dusty, and then really bright again thanks to a cacophonous light show of visual effects. Rinse, repeat, the end. But despite this schematically sound setup, King of the Monsters tries its hand at a semblance of commentary. Director/co-writer Michael Dougherty and co-writer Zach Shields build the film around environmentalist ideologies that don’t go much of anywhere. Its idiosyncrasies point to more genre-bending potentials, but the film instead uses this base as filler. Add in the fact that the film exists to bathe in destruction, and it ends up at the south end of an already-extraneous moral compass. This isn’t to say that the entire film is preoccupied with some sort of message, however. That would only be the first 80 minutes or so, which come out to a very long first two-thirds. The arc is almost entirely dependent on tone as well, and while the film starts much more akin to Gareth Edwards’ Godzilla, it veers farther into cartoon territory without telegraphing its shifts or recontextualizing its earlier scenes. Its closest efforts in doing so are personified with Dr. Rick Stanton (Bradley Whitford), a joke dispenser who feels stuck in an entirely different film. Instead, the unifying motif is its platinum color palette courtesy of Lawrence Sher, the cinematographer behind movies such as War Dogs and the Hangover trilogy. It’s all blue all the time here save for the wide shots of the fiery abattoir that comes to be, and, if he and Dougherty are feeling generous, there might be some red in there as well. It’s economically shot but not fun to look at, often lacking a sense of scale or grandeur. Each monster, each crash, and each blow are so isolated that the film doesn’t feel light on its feet but void of weight instead. Cord-cutting once carried the promise of reducing live TV costs, but with most services nearing a $100 per month, that statement checks less every day. That said, there is a handful of cord-cutting services with reasonable monthly prices. Below we list them. Maybe you’ve just seen Oppenheimer and have the strongest urge to marathon—or more fun yet, rank!—all of Christopher Nolan’s films. Or maybe you’re one of the few who haven’t seen Interstellar yet. If you are, then you should change that immediately; the dystopian epic is one of Nolan’s best, and with that incredible twist in ...  Which Netflix Country has Interstellar? For whatever reason, The Hunger Games series isn’t available in the same countries around the world. You’ll find the first and second (aka the best) installments in Hong Kong, for instance, but not the third and fourth. It’s a frustrating dilemma, especially if you don’t even have a single entry in your region, which is ...  Which Netflix Country Has Each Movie of The Hunger Games?"

"Jan 10, 2020",positive," 
	The Gareth Edwards-directed 2014’s Godzilla  is by no means a bad film. That may not come as a ringing endorsement, but it makes sense given the impact that film had on the cinema goers of the world. While praised for its sombre tone and appreciation of scale, the film was nonetheless criticised for its reluctance to show its titular monster in all his kaiju glory. Legendary Pictures seems to have heard the outcry of audiences everywhere and have seen fit to produce Godzilla: King of the Monsters, a film that knows no sense of the word ‘restraint.’ 
	In this movie there are several different bouts between monsters the size of skyscrapers. After Godzilla emerged to defend the modern world from destructive titans five years ago, he’s taken a much-deserved sabbatical from being defender of the earth. That is, of course, until a grief-stricken mother takes it upon herself to unleash the worst titan of them all, King Ghidorah, in a misguided attempt to save the planet for future generations. 
	To go into the story further would be tantamount to actively repelling viewers from the cinema, as it all boils down to a series of plot contrivances put in action for the sole purpose of getting two monsters within fighting distance of each other. The dialogue is a mix of bad jokes and technical mumbo-jumbo (to describe it as jargon would be an insult to intelligence), and does just enough to get you to the next fight without being completely irritating. In Godzilla: King of the Monsters it’s all in service of action. So it’s a good thing said action is wildly entertaining. 
	Whether you’re a long-time fan of the pantheon that is Godzilla films, or a newcomer to the monster mash, it’s hard to imagine not being entertained by what’s on screen. What used to be people in rubber suits battling stop-motion puppets can now be appreciated with an attention to detail that often goes unnoticed in blockbusters. Still, as fun as it is to watch, the film feels, perhaps appropriately given Godzilla’s massive jaw, a little long in the tooth. If not for the massive scale of the action demanding to be seen on the big screen, I’d say this is a film best viewed in a format where you can skip ahead to the best parts."
"Jan 9, 2020",positive," BY DAN TABOR FILM CRITIC It’s been five years since Godzilla reboot decimated the multiplexes. That film was an artier take on the monster film, directed by Gareth Edwards (Monsters, Rogue One), that seemed to focus more on the human story than the giant lizard namesake that has spawned 30+ films. Since then there has been a refocus of the series, thanks of course to Marvel, to franchise up these monster films. This re-think was introduced in the follow up Kong: Skull Island, which setup not only one of cinema’s most beloved monsters, but also a mythology that hinted at Legendary, who produced these films, would be bringing Toho’s entire rogues gallery of monsters to this new cinematic universe. This was very exciting news to long-suffering Godzilla fans who have waited patiently to see these monsters unleashed onto a new generation. Cribbing a page or two from Avengers: Infinity War, Godzilla: KOTM takes place five years after the events of the first film. The once shadowy Monarch organization has come to prominence as humanity’s monster liaison with the revelation that 17 of these apex predators known as Titans are hibernating around the planet. Or they were, until they were awakened by a sonar device called “the Orca” wielded by a group of eco-terrorists lead by Colonel Alan Jonah (Charles Dance AKA Tywin Lannister from GOT) who want to rebalance the world by allowing the Titans to cleanse it. The film begins with Dr. Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga), the Monarch scientist who developed the Orca — which can control the Titans through bioacoustics — getting kidnapped along with her daughter Madison(Millie Bobby Brown). Its then up to her estranged husband and former Monarch scientist Dr. Mark Russell (Kyle Chandler) to navigate Kaiju battles around the world while bringing his fractured family back together. Blessedly, the first Titan the terrorists bring back is Godzilla’s infamous nemesis King Ghidorah, the three headed dragon also known as Monster Zero. Godzilla: KOTM wisely ditches the arthouse pretense of the first reboot and delivers a rock’em sock’em old school Kaiju beat’em up. Unlike his predecessor, director Michael Dougherty (Krampus, Trick ‘r Treat) isn’t stingy with the goods either. Just minutes into the film, Godzilla is on screen in all his glory doing just what he does best, laying waste to anything that gets in his way. We soon learn that mankind once worshipped the Titans as gods, and some are benevolent (Godzilla, Mothra) and some are in league with lucifer himself (King Ghidorah). The film culminates in the brutal and breathtaking spectacle of team Godzilla taking on team Ghidorah. Sure it’s campy and a bit goofy but it’s the right direction for these films and the right audience to target since Godzilla belongs to the monster kids, both young and old. There were moments watching Godzilla: KOTM when I was once again a bedazzled 10 year-old kid watching Godzilla fight King Ghidorah for the very first time, cheering on the good guys, hoping Godzilla triumphs again. It says a lot that a film can still inspire that kind of awestruck reaction from a 40 something film geek who sometimes thinks he has seen it all, but this movie managed to do just that, time after time. Loud, over the top and utterly unrelenting, Godzilla: King of the Monsters is the WrestleMania of kaiju films and makes no apologies for it."

"Dec 6, 2019",positive," I’m not a Godzilla person. Or at least I wasn’t until 2014, when I was a year into dating a certified Godzilla person and Gareth Edwards’ Godzilla was released, and I was shocked to discover that I was weirdly into giant monsters beating the shit out of each other. I even told my grandpa, who I thought was a Godzilla person, that this new one was pretty good. He looked at me sideways and said, quite calmly, “Aly, I think you’ve lost your mind.” Well, maybe I did, because I married that Godzilla person, watched from the sidelines as he dove in headfirst into 65 years of Godzilla movies and wrote an opus about them, had a baby with him, and watched Godzilla: King of the Monsters with said Godzilla person and Son of Godzilla person, not once, but twice — twice! — since receiving a review copy of the DVD/Blu-ray. (The baby tried to eat my face after the first viewing — parenting win!) This is all a long-winded way of saying I never would have predicted that I would be in the apparent minority of people who loved Godzilla: King of the Monsters. This was the blockbuster that critics chose to lambast upon its release in May. Because, like the 2014 film, the humans are one-dimensional? Because, unlike the 2014 film, there are too many monster fights? Those are criticisms I don’t agree with or understand because they’re exactly what make King of the Monsters a good Godzilla movie. Maybe even a great one. If unironically loving Alien: Covenant (and, to a lesser extent, Prometheus) has taught me anything, it’s that sometimes you have to let go of caring about the human characters and root for the monsters (and / or robots) instead. The central family of Vera Farmiga, Kyle Chandler and Millie Bobby Brown and their emotional journeys are fairly milquetoast. Their names are Emma, Mark, and Madison, for crying out loud, and the parents separated after their son Andrew was killed during the events of Godzilla … but who cares? While some of them play a more active role in the story, literally waking monsters, they’re really nothing but human witnesses of a world that must change in order to undo the damage humans have done to it. This story is too big for humans to be either the protagonists or antagonists. Some fall one way or another, of course, but it’s the monsters — the Titans — who are the real heroes and villains. Some, like Godzilla and Mothra, want to save the world; others, like Ghidorah and Rodan, want to destroy it. None of them really care about the tiny humans who either try to help in the tiniest of ways, fuck up in some majorly royal ones or wisely flee at the sight of real, tangible Gods.  You see that photo at the top? That’s it. That’s the movie. Godzilla has always worked best as an allegory for the consequences of human destruction, whether it’s nuclear testing or climate change. Do you think those consequences give a shit about whatever story we’ve been telling ourselves for generations to make ourselves feel better about how small we are?  The best example of this blending is the discussion of motion-capture performance. Both Godzilla and Ghidorah were performed by motion-capture artists (each one of Ghidorah’s heads was played by a different actor!), and Dougherty calls this the natural evolution from the man in the rubber suit in the original Toho films. He’s not wrong, and this is a pretty decent way to recontextualize a method of acting that has been underappreciated at least since the days of Gollum. Most tellingly, though, Dougherty smiles throughout every single one of his talking heads. Most directors undoubtedly love what they do, but it rarely shows in special features; even Taika Waititi sounds bored out of his mind during the Thor: Ragnarok commentary. So it’s pretty wonderful to see one who is so genuinely enthusiastic about his film and the franchise in which he’s playing. It’s worth watching all the special features for Dougherty’s contributions alone. Another aspect of King of the Monsters that I adore is its reverence and incorporation of world mythologies into Godzilla lore. I could probably go on about that forever, but the DVD has me covered: a dorky 15-minute featurette called “Monsters Are Real” interviews various professors and cryptozoologists about this very topic. It’s not necessarily the best special feature — I would say those would be the “Evolution of the Titans” and “Monarch in Action” collections — but it’s worth a view if only because it leans so hard into the campier aspects of Godzilla, for better or for worse. And that’s ultimately the deciding factor on whether or not King of the Monsters is for you. The “science” isn’t any stupider than what you’d find in Star Wars or the like. The humans are just humans. The monster fights are, and I don’t say this lightly, the fucking tits. This movie is beautiful on Blu-ray, and the special features are actually special. So overall I’d recommend adding this to your collection, should you find yourself a Godzilla person and not a total stick-in-the-mud."

"Nov 7, 2019",negative," With Trick ‘r’ Treat director Michael Doughtery taking over from Gareth Edwards, Godzilla: King of the Monsters follows the efforts of the crypto-zoological agency Monarch as its members face off against several god-sized monsters, including Godzilla, who collides with Mothra, Rodan, and his nemesis – the three-headed King Ghidorah. Although he has only directed three films, Edwards has established himself as a filmmaker that is confident with big-budget features. Following his departure from the production in 2016, it allows Doughtery to step in to make his first big-budget film. With so much pressure to deliver on the success on the 2014 film, the sequel needed to up the scale on Edwards’ mammoth feature. With that in mind, the sequel features more of Toho’s classic monsters such as Mothra, Rodan and the three-headed King Ghidorah. Setting the stage for the most epic battle in Legendary’s MonsterVerse, it promises high-paced action. However, it falls spectacularly short. Ranging from Kyle Chandler‘s embittered father and Bradley Whitmore’s unfunny crypto-monographer to Godzilla returnees Ken Watanabe and Sally Hawkins, the extensive list of characters don’t do much other than bicker about Monarch’s poorly maintained secrecy or argue about whether to help or kill the monsters. It is evident that each character has their own opinion about the Titans but the predictable narrative restricts them to being one-dimensional. When certain characters try and offer a serious spin on their motives (Vera Farmiga’s Emma Russell being a notable example), they just come across as laughable. In addition, the film isn’t helped by Doughtery and Shields’ poor script. Containing a mash-up of overdramatic lines and needlessly long (and ludicrous) explanations, the dialogue strays into cliché territory. Needless to say, the already limited character development is abandoned as soon as the Titans take to the sky.  Considering that they are the real stars of Godzilla: God of the Monsters, not even they can help enhance the quality of the film. Imposing on-screen and chaotically animated, audiences don’t have the time to revel in the majesty of the Titans amid the melee of sky battles going on.  Although Godzilla and Mothra do look quite astounding, the overall lacklustre quality down-scales the thrill factor of this supposedly high-paced action feature. Due to these poorly developed elements, Godzilla: God of the Monsters fails to deliver on the promise of an epic monster film. Long gone is the thrill of seeing two formidable opponents face-off on screen – thanks to the machinations of its human characters, it ends up being another boring blockbuster that is not as good as the original. "
"Oct 14, 2019",negative," It’s a royal rumble of titanic monsters, as the iconic Japanese sea creature Godzilla confronts a slew of giant prehistoric foes and some very confused humans. There’s a degree of spectacle but it’s a misshapen movie, writes critic Craig Mathieson. Several times in this monster mash-up, the film will cut to a medium close-up of Godzilla, fixing on the oversized sea creature as he takes a break from his latest rumble with another of mythic Titans that have returned to life to topple skyscrapers and crush civilisation. The digital creature has a steady, blank gaze – obviously he’s seen a few things – but there’s no real inner-life to him, outside the destruction he causes or sometimes counters. That’s a problem for Michael Dougherty’s scaly blockbuster, because it keeps trying to assign motivation, values, and even beliefs to the radiation-ripped beast. He’s a blank slate nothing permanent can be written on. With 2014’s Hollywood reboot Godzilla, Gareth Edwards skilfully exploited that unknowable distance. The scale was human – the characters ran and dodged in the debris and dusty surrounds of Godzilla and his eventual adversaries – and when the monsters were revealed, after an admirable period of menacing restraint, their otherworldly scale rendered humanity and its toys insignificant. The sequel has many more monsters, and many more battles. Like an old 16-bit fighting game, Dougherty shoots Godzilla and his latest opponent in city-wide profile; you half expect them touch claws before they come out punching. Having ‘saved’ – i.e. devastated – San Francisco from a pair of Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organisms five years prior, Godzilla is a source of hope and a transformative figure in the new films. As more Titans are revealed they’re set free by eco-terrorists led by a former British soldier, Alan Jonah (Charles Dance, himself a giant of scenery chewing), who believe that the Titans will save a dying planet by reducing the plague of humanity and sparking regrowth through their radiation-fuelled bodies. That is a step short of worshipping these monsters, whose selections such as King Ghidorah will delight long-time Godzilla fans, and there’s a wild mix of paganism and nihilistic abdication lurking here that the movie, not unsurprisingly, doesn’t want to get into. Instead the framework is a divided family, with Jonah kidnapping one scientist who’s been helping the international agency Monarch study the dormant Titans, Dr Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga), along with her teenage daughter Madison (Millie Bobby Brown). That necessitates Madison’s father, Emma’s ex-husband and former Monarch scientist Mark Russell (Kyle Chandler), returning to the fold, growing increasingly more angry (Chandler has such an expressive jaw) as the extent of the Titans becomes destructively clear. Everyone, including the characters played by Ken Watanabe and Sally Hawkins in the first film, race around the globe from one clash to the next, complete with a MacGuffin-like box that’s super crucial (and thus easily stolen by an angry teenager). Yet it’s all strangely ineffectual – there’s no physicality to the fighting and no wonder to the creatures’ rise. Dougherty signals as much by repeatedly cutting away to scrambling humans or deeply ineffectual jet fighters that are mere mosquitoes. The film even has two comic relief archetypes: Bradley Whitford as the freaked-out white scientist and O’Shea Jackson Jr as the phlegmatic black soldier. Both actors are better than those roles require, but then everyone – and everything – in this film is reduced to their basic tenets; that look of furious focus Millie Bobby Brown trademarked in Stranger Things is showcased here. “You need to see this,” one bit player after another urges the main characters, but the reveals in Godzilla II: King of the Monsters never really linger, let alone inspire. A blank slate is nothing until it’s filled in."

"Sep 27, 2019",positive," Godzilla may be king of the monsters but this sequel to the 2014 American reboot of the legendary Japanese franchise is king of the monster movies. That does not mean the best. When I say ‘king’ I mean more in the context of a king-sized meal or bed. Despite having the blandest lead characters in mainstream blockbuster history, the 2014 Godzilla delivered the goods of a kaiju movie – that is brutal giant monster and giant monster action. While the titular character was used sparingly, when he did appear there was a real sense of weight. The camera shot Godzilla from below. You felt the sublime awe of those cowering under him and could witness the buildings around him buckle. From director Michael Dougherty (who helmed underrated creature flick Krampus), Godzilla: King of the Monsters improves on some of the issues fans had with its predecessor. There’s a more gripping human story and more Godzilla (as well as Ghidorah, Mothra and Rodan) for your buck. Kyle Chandler and Vera Farmiga star as Dr Mark and Emma Russell. One of their two kids (the other being Stranger Things’ Millie Bobby Brown) died during the events of 2014’s Godzilla. The two are now split up. Mark has become an alcoholic. Meanwhile Emma works with Ken Watanabe and Sally Hawkins’ scientists from the last movie to try capture and study Godzilla and other giant creatures like him. This is to try find a way to discover how monsters and humans could exist symbiotically. When Emma and her daughter are kidnapped by a group of radical environmentalists (led by Charles Dance), Mark is brought out of exile to help find his ex-wife. Her captors are travelling around the world, freeing skyscraper sized monsters as they believe the destruction they wreak is the only thing to save Earth from being destroyed by human hand. The Dark Universe with movies like Dracula Untold and Tom Cruise’s (Show Me) The Mummy struggled to build a shared MCU like universe based around properties acclaimed for their villains. No one wants to watch a heroic sexy Prince of Darkness or Tom Cruise becoming a kind-hearted version of an Egyptian boogeyman. Legendary’s MonsterVerse of which this is the third entry (after Kong: Skull Island) has fared a lot better. This is by realising all that’s needed is a series of movies loosely connected by their central monsters doing what they are famous for, all while a set of different each time human characters deal with their own issues tied to the creatures. Emma and Mark’s story is not exactly deep. Plus, it falls to the wayside (along with any commentary on environmentalism) as soon as the monsters take over. However, it provides just enough of an emotional spine in between kaiju fights to keep audiences invested. Here you have two parents dealing with grief in radically different ways and the daughter caught between them. There’s a tragedy there that is hard not to sympathise with. All that said, the real reason to see Godzilla: King of the Monsters is its gargantuan monster brawls –  the biggest put on screen maybe ever. While the worry is during these sequences the movie will descend into CGI mush, here what they resemble is Rembrandt tableaus. Or at least those on steroids – depicting giant gods dueling for the fate of the world in the midst of bright heavenly lights. The latter the effect of either an oxygen bomb designed to kill the monsters, the lightning that gathers any time Ghidorah is present or the radiation used by Godzilla to get increasingly jacked. You watch these fights and forget you are seeing a movie. They transcend the medium, becoming almost abstract art. It’s because of them you ignore the many flaws of Godzilla: King of the Monsters.

Going into Godzilla: King of the Monsters, I expected off-the-charts monster clashes and not a lot else. Instead of posters littered with human characters, we’ve got a spotlight on the sort of cast audiences have longed for since 2014’s relatively Kaiju-less Godzilla. Godzilla, Mothra, Rodan, King Ghidorah – and really, what else do you need?
For less than half the movie’s run time, my wish was fulfilled, either by witnessing the slow reveal of each monster or watching them engage in full-on combat. For the other more-than-half-ish, though, I was engaged in an internal battle of my own: how much does the good outweigh the bad?
The joy you get out of Godzilla: King of the Monsters may depend largely on how much goodwill it earns from you with the kaiju clashes. What’s the exchange rate for boring human drama to nostalgic monster fights? Is every 1 minute of Mothra worth 5 minutes of Kyle Chandler frantically yelling about his daughter? How about 10? The value of that kind of currency will vary from one person to the next, but the answer to these kinds of questions is a basic litmus test for whether this film really works.
Godzilla: King of the Monsters employs a sort of nesting doll approach to conflict. The largest in scale and easily the most engaging is the battle of the Kaiju, pitting Mothra and Godzilla against Rodan and Ghidorah. Move down a layer and you’ll find the least interesting, most convoluted plot: that of various government entities, including Monarch, a special unit researching the Titans (e.g. monsters), and even environmental terrorist organizations. Each has a different opinion and approach in how to best handle the potential threat from the Titans. This piece of the story somehow, almost impossibly involves both the most exposition and the least amount of clarity. It’s a major but mostly needless obstacle to telling this story, filled with boring McGuffin chasing at best and complete nonsense at worst.
In the final layer, we have the the drama surrounding a family torn apart by tragedy and, well, Godzilla. This is the part of the movie that could have worked in different circumstances. Kyle Chandler, Vera Farmiga, and Millie Bobby Brown do their best to make us care about this family, but the effort falls flat as it gets trapped in the underpinnings of that second layer of plot previously mentioned.
But, like I said, it’s not all bad. Because then you have the kaiju. In 2014’s Godzilla, the lack of appearance from the titular character was the main complaint I heard from people who were unsatisfied with the film. This is, fortunately, not a problem here. Monarch spends most of the film’s running time tracking and chasing Godzilla, and this time we even see enough of him to see glimmers of personality. Mothra is also well-served by this movie, getting moments in battle that are pronounced enough to almost make her feel more human than the film’s leads. On the other side, Ghidorah and Rodan are mostly served up as pure monster menace, with an even elaborate bit of Ghidorah’s back-story woven into the central plot. It’s clear that director Mike Dougherty is a fan of these creatures, and he does them justice.
I also thought the visual effects looked good here, though I could understand complaints that they’re a little murky: the film uses lots of Earth tones for the Titans and the biggest fight scene is portrayed in the dark and in the rain (not unlike Pacific Rim). But I thought those choices helped the film light up more drastically when special powers or brighter colors were used, and everything was still crisp and clear. Small snapshots within the film were artful enough that you could see how gorgeous each moment would look as a still. The music only adds to the nostalgia factor, and fans of the older movies will recognize some of the themes of Bear McCreary‘s score. I would add that if you’re interested in seeing this, I expect the big-screen experience would be vastly more rewarding than waiting to catch it at home.
Godzilla: King of the Monsters poses several questions about humanity and the burden we put on the Earth and our environment. Do we deserve to reign over this Earth if we will destroy it in the process? I’m not sure it was the intent, but I walked away from the film with a clear feeling: we really don’t need the humans after all. Just bring on the kaiju. Shin Godzilla is amazing. I’m sad that we’ll never see a sequel to that, but then again it’s a miracle that first one exists at all. I’ll admit the 2014 Godzilla has its moments. It’s better than the ’98 misfire with Matthew Broderick. (Most things are.)
Still, any movie that makes Elizabeth Olsen uninteresting has some problems."

Join Cultured Vultures as we bring you some of the biggest news from the world of wrestling. Whether it’s WWE news or something from across the sea, let’s talk shop. Remember the trailer for the 2014 reboot? György Ligeti’s Requiem played over J. Robert Oppenheimer’s speech regarding his role in creating the atomic bomb. As he quoted the Bhagavad-Gita, it seemed as though it would be the darkest Godzilla movie since the original. Arguably, Michael Dougherty’s long-awaited follow-up is darker and far more intense than its predecessor, with the potential to eclipse its success at the box office.  The events of the MUTOs and Godzilla fight has deeply affected Mark and Emma Russell’s marriage. 5 years later, they’re apart and the only thing they have in common is their daughter, Madison. The human drama is neither complex nor uncharacteristic for these types of movies, but on the contrary, Vera Farmiga and Kyle Chandler deliver their lines and perform respectably enough to save the audience from a potential sense of ennui that would have undoubtedly sunk this sequel, had it not been for their casting.  Millie Bobby Brown plays Madison, Mark and Emma’s daughter, who struggles with her parents’ inability to see eye-to-eye. The Stranger Things actress gives a terrific performance as the heart of the human side of the story. Even the supporting cast perform adequately and convincingly enough to underpin a story rich in atmosphere and emotion. The government adamantly expresses its disdain for keeping the titans alive. The military seem to agree it should be under their control, but Monarch feels confident they can learn to coexist with the monsters. Whereas one group collectively look at the destruction as a new beginning, the rest are fearful of extinction of humankind.  If you’re concerned Godzilla: King of the Monsters cuts away from the thrilling monster action and focuses mostly on the human drama like its predecessor, you’ll be delighted to know this one’s loaded with intense, suspenseful action sequences and the CGI is brilliantly crafted. The kaiju are magnificent and are shown in beautiful, awe-inspiring ways. Director and co-writer Michael Dougherty milks the sequences, nurturing and establish a presence for each creature. The visuals are absolutely stunning and Bear McCreary’s impressive score awesomely compliments each and every scene, nuance and the ethereal subtext, all the while celebrating the franchise by incorporating some familiar score pieces.  Celebrating Godzilla seems key here, as the creative team were referencing the original in ways you might’ve not picked up on immediately unless you’re a diehard Godzilla fan. If there’s anything to feel uneasy about, it’s one specific scene between the family. Let’s get this out of the way: if you’re expecting total realism and logic, none of the Godzilla movies are for you and most certainly not this one. It does make an effort to logistically explain things, but the specific moment that had me raising a curious brow is utterly nonsensical in virtually every sense. Of course, Godzilla, Rodan, King Ghidorah and Mothra all make up for any questionable decisions our human characters make. Lawrence Sher’s cinematography, Tom Woodruff Jr.’s contribution to the visual effects and Michael Dougherty’s directing ability (and even his knowledge of horror) make this installment one of the more appealing in the franchise. There are moments in which you might laugh, jump in your seat with excitement, or feel momentarily startled. There’s a real effort put into this production and it’s certainly worth the trip to your local theater.  Godzilla: King of the Monsters is 2 hours and 12 minutes of well-paced movie magic with rich performances and an incredible score. The story may be simple, which, on the bright side, anyone can easily follow, but it’s not the worst I’ve seen — especially in this franchise. It’s not a boring entry as it delivers on the action and excitement, and the cast and crew seem to genuinely respect the Godzilla legacy.

"Aug 28, 2019",negative,"  Look, who are we fooling here? Does anyone go to a Godzilla movie for the plot? Or the human actors? For years I’ve been agitating for a disaster movie that is all disaster, or a giant-monster movie that is all giant-monster destruction, and to hell with the pallid subplots about parents trying to track down their kids in the midst of the maelstrom or whatever. Such a movie would be a pure-cinema mammoth with no dialogue and no stars except the disaster or the monsters. Name me one moviegoer who said “Let’s go see that new Kyle Chandler monster movie!” I’ll wait.  I should’ve known Godzilla: King of the Monsters, despite its promising title, would not be the answer to my demands, but really Godzilla’s amount of screen time has traditionally always been scant; in the original 1954 Gojira, the big guy only showed up for less than nine minutes (out of a 96-minute running time). But by now, the footage of humans staring at screens or discussing what to do about the kaiju or having moral debates while cities burn is so. fucking. dull. I appreciate that they’ve tried to get terrific actors like Chandler and Vera Farmiga (playing a divorced scientist couple) and Millie Bobby Brown (as their daughter), and there’s some comic relief from a sardonic Bradley Whitford. But there’s so much pressure on a big expensive thing like this — from Warner Bros., from Toho, from its own fan base — that it can’t truly be surprising or inventive.  The suspicion is that the old-school Godzilla movies play better in nostalgic memory than they do in actuality. And at least the old man-in-suit throwdowns between Godzilla and, say, Ghidorah — his big nemesis here — were fun, in a goofball way, and easier on the eyes and ears. In Godzilla: King of the Monsters, directed by Michael Dougherty (Trick ‘R Treat), the fight scenes between kaiju are always shot at night or during terrible rain or snow storms, the better to hide the CG seams, and the design of the creatures is “dark,” grim, gritty, ugly, lacking the charm of the old critters. And when they fight, they take down skyscrapers by the dozen, and even though the movie takes pains to establish mass evacuation, so what? These are not real buildings with real people inside. The assumption that we care about loss of human life in these movies is hypocrisy. Of course we don’t. The height of true sadness here comes when Godzilla appears to be dead.  The trailers for these things are always electrifying. When the trailer for this film landed and we first saw Godzilla and Ghidorah racing at each other in the middle of a city, we shuddered and laughed and swore to catch it on an IMAX screen — I did, anyway. I’m sort of glad I didn’t bother. There’s Godzilla and Ghidorah and Mothra and Rodan and a few other beasties named Scylla or Behemoth or Baphomet or Dennis, and there’s forever the problem of showing action between really tall creatures on a really wide screen — either you have to pull way back, or go so close in you might as well be watching leather suitcases bashing into each other. (The O.G. Gojira occupied the squarish 1.37:1 aspect ratio.) Godzilla started out in black-and-white movies and, for all intents and purposes, has circled back there. The look of this film is gray with the occasional blast of colorful radioactive breath; the sound is bass-heavy, headache-inducing. It’s not a good time or aesthetically pleasing or even very exciting. There are two or three fantastic apocalyptic images (see above), but that’s about it.  At this point, I prefer off-the-beaten-path big-monster stuff like Big Man Japan or The Host or even Colossal. They don’t have the big guy’s name recognition, or the giddy buzz (which soon dies when you see the actual thing) of going to a Godzilla flick. But they have more interesting things to say, and therefore better things occupying our brains between kaiju rampages. This movie tells us that the monsters are vital to the survival of the human race because they maintain “balance,” even though they tend to destroy cities (Boston gets turned into an ashtray here). Their destructiveness holds our destructiveness in check. This is a bitter pill to swallow when we’re watching the Amazon rain forest die in real time, and our children’s future with it. Save us, Godzilla! But he won’t. No one will. And movies like this add to the delusion that there’s hope to be found in the rubble."
"Aug 27, 2019",neutral," Godzilla: King of the Monsters is rated PG-13 for sequences of monster action violence and destruction, and for some language. The running time is 2 hours and 12 minutes."
"Aug 27, 2019",negative," Over the course of 65 years, the “Godzilla” franchise has certainly seen its ups and downs. The original 1954 film is a decent monster flick (“kaiju”) that, while somewhat cheesy in this day and age, still holds up as a classic, with the multitude of films that followed (i.e. “Godzilla vs…”) having a solid fanbase. However, in more recent years, the films have taken an obvious turn for the worse. The 1998 “Godzilla” is constantly criticized as being a big mistake, while the less said about the disastrous 2014 reboot, the better. With this in mind, you would think a sequel to the 2014 film would be another big mistake for the franchise, but because it made some money, you knew it was inevitable, so now we’re faced with “Godzilla: King of the Monsters,” a follow-up that attempts to up the kaiju action considerably. Would the sequel finally be the one to get the series back on course, or were audiences simply in for an even bigger disaster than before? Taking place five years after the previous film, we begin by following Dr. Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga), a member of Monarch, a group that seeks out and studies monsters akin to Godzilla. While she is researching a recently born creature known as Mothra, her group is attacked by eco-terrorists led by Alan Jonah (Charles Dance), who kidnaps both Emma and her daughter Madison (Millie Bobby Brown), in addition to stealing a piece of machinery known as the “Orca,” which can influence the behavior of the monsters (known as “Titans”). Monarch approaches Emma’s ex-husband, Mark Russell (Kyle Chandler), to help get them back, and while he eventually agrees, the situation only becomes more complicated when it is discovered that Emma is actually working with the terrorists to help free more Titans, believing that they are needed to help heal the Earth from damage caused by humans. With the terrorists waking more and more Titans around the world, Monarch must pin their hopes on Godzilla and his allies in hopes that they can bring the other monsters to heel. With a film like “Godzilla: King of the Monsters,” there’s really no beating around the bush. There are several things that can be said about it, but unfortunately none of them are good. The film is simply one of the biggest, noisiest messes you will see in this, or any other year. When the previous film was criticized for having a very noticeable lack of Godzilla until near its conclusion, apparently the folks behind the follow-up took that to mean that the next film should be as overloaded with monsters as possible, even to the detriment of the characters and plot. Granted, no one really goes to see a film like this expecting to see anything near a well-rounded human character, but for this sequel, it feels as though they put in even less effort than before. For those watching the film just hoping for a good bit of mindless kaiju action, there’s certainly plenty of that. Unfortunately the rest of the audience will be bored silly by the flat characters, nonsensical plotting, and the mind-numbing action. What’s even more frustrating though is that it wastes an incredibly talented cast in the process, including Sally Hawkins, Charles Dance, Bradley Whitford, Millie Bobby Brown, Vera Farmiga, Kyle Chandler, David Strathairn, Ken Watanabe, and Ziyi Zhang. Alas, even such a remarkable ensemble as this would never be able to breathe life into Michael Dougherty and Zach Shields’ insipid screenplay, which ultimately ends up being the glaring source of the film’s multiple problems. It’s really rare to find a film like this that has no redeeming qualities about it. The direction is sloppy, the action is dull, the characters are lifeless, and the plot never becomes compelling, or even slightly interesting. It’s a two-hour mishmash of monsters fighting and one-dimensional human characters running around trying to do something about it. When all is said and done, it’s rather easy to label it the worst film of the year, and it’s quite inconceivable that anything would be able to take the title away. In that sense, and in that sense alone, this “Godzilla” truly is king. “Godzilla: King of the Monsters” comes to Blu-ray in a 2.4:1, 1080p High Definition transfer of outstanding quality. This is a very dark and special effects-heavy film, but the picture remains perfectly sharp and clear throughout its 132-minute runtime. The Dolby Atmos-TrueHD audio is equally impressive, giving you all of the dialogue, score, and the extensive sound effects in excellent quality. Overall, the kaiju fans in the audience will no doubt be thrilled with the wonderful treatment that the film has received. With its mind-numbingly dull action, flat characters, and nonsensical plot, it’s rather difficult to find a single redeeming quality in the entirety of the two-hour tedious mess that is “Godzilla: King of the Monsters."" Also going so far as to waste a great cast consisting of multiple Oscar and Emmy nominees, it easily makes a case for being the worst film of 2019. Will anyone dare challenge the king for the title? It seems very much doubtful."
"Aug 12, 2019",positive," Arguably a great case of ‘be careful what you wish for,’ the new “Godzilla: King of the Monsters” represents a hard turn away from the more elegant less-is-more approach of 2014’s reboot, which left many hardcore fans unsatisfied by its lack of gratuitous giant monster mayhem-porn. ‘King of the Monsters’ makes up for that shortcoming and then some; on the downside it veers so far in the other direction that it overcompensates. That said, it’s probably the most kaiju-esque “Godzilla” movie since “Godzilla: Final Wars” sent the lovable lizard into hibernation in 2004. Sadly, its kitschy melodramatics and pulp sci-fi elements will likely be misread by casual viewers.  Co-written and directed by Michael Dougherty (“Krampus”), the movie picks up directly after “Godzilla” and expands on elements depicted in it and “Kong: Skull Island” by establishing Godzilla, Kong, and several newly discovered ‘Titans’ (Mothra, Rodan, and Ghidorah) as relic species of an ancient world that are rising again as a result of mankind’s dicking around with the environment. While the Monarch organization, led by Dr. Ishiro Serizawa (Ken Watanabe), works to study the creatures and seek a symbiotic relationship with them, extremist Colonel Alan Jonah (Charles Danse) wants to weaponize and release them in order to save the world by thinning out the human herd. Caught in the middle are scientist Dr. Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga), who has invented a rudimentary means of communication with the Titans; her ex-husband Dr. Mark Russell (Kyle Chandler), who’d rather see them all destroyed as payback for the death of his son; and their daughter, Madison (Millie Bobby Brown). It falls upon the more level-headed humans to assist Godzilla when his ancient rivalry with three-headed, lightning-breathing Ghidorah turns into a multi-monster brawl with the potential to level human civilization. Like many Godzilla flicks, this one has a degree of social commentary. Big G debuted as a metaphor for the dangers of nuclear power; here, he’s climate change on legs. Dougherty and co-writer Zach Shields aren’t subtle it, but they don’t get preachy either. They also aren’t subtle when it comes to the wholly predictable plot, specifically when it comes to the flesh-and-blood human characters. Their arcs become clear about 30-40 minutes in, including what should be a major twist. The actors give solid performances (including Oscar-nominee Sally Hawkins, Thomas Middleditch, Zhang Ziyi, and Bradley Whitford, but they are often hamstrung by clunky exposition and lame wisecracks. In all fairness, few come to a “Godzilla” movie looking for dramatic depth. It’s all about giant monsters slapping the bejeezus out of each other and the massive property damage that entails. In that regard, ‘King of the Monsters’ delivers in full. Whole cities are demolished over the course of its 130 minutes, with Boston getting the worst of it. (It’s safe to assume that Ghidorah is not a Red Sox fan.) The effects live up to expectations, and the designers have imbued each creature with distinct personalities that come through clearer than those of some of the human characters. For better or worse, ‘King of the Monsters’ does set-up some tantalizing details for future installments, some of which are callbacks to classic cheesy elements of the Toho films (pay close attention during the closing credits).  It doesn’t come as close to transcending the genre as the previous entry did, and it’s doubtful next year’s “Godzilla vs. Kong” crossover will either, but there’s enough here to keep kaiju fans hooked for at least one more outing."
"Aug 8, 2019",neutral,Nevertheless I mostly enjoyed myself though this installment definitely lacks for personality.
"Aug 5, 2019",positive," Previous director Gareth Edwards has been replaced by Michael Dougherty, best known for his horror efforts like the Halloween anthology film Trick ‘R Treat and the Christmas movie Krampus. With an all-star cast of acclaimed thespians, rising talents and franchise returnees and free reign to utilize other monsters in the franchise, will the film be as fun as the premise promises? There really feels no need for a synopsis with a film such like this, especially since the marketing materials make it clear we’re only here for the monsters. And those monsters certainly make their presence felt, and the film crew do their darnedest to make their action scenes as vast and impactful as possible, especially in terms of scale. That said, the simplistic story is a fitting continuation from the 2014 film, following on from the disastrous events in San Francisco. Although the film fulfills its promise to show monsters duking it out, the story is still quite effective, thanks to the inclusion of an interesting moral dilemma, that both pays tribute to the social commentary of the classic films, and offers food for thought. Without sharing any spoilers, Godzilla: King of the Monsters leaves humanity questioning whether the monsters are a positive or negative step in the natural order, and this compliments the characters quite well, making their questionable, though honourable, motivations convincing and even empathetic. Action scenes take place in varied settings ranging from Antarctica, to cities like Boston and islands like Mexico’s Isla de Mara, all captured vividly from both human and monster perspective by cinematographer Lawrence Sher. Editors Roger Barton, Richard Pearson and Bob Duscay manage to shift perspectives between action scenes briskly, and the grand musical score from Bear McCreary (whose prior work included cult monster dramedy Colossal), compliments the film beautifully, as McCreary adapts original composer Akira Ifukube‘s score and brings his own touch to proceedings, using both to great effect. The monsters are coded with a certain colour, hinting at their allegiances, and plenty of respect is paid to their original appearances. Their movements bring to mind actual animal behaviour, which lends them a stronger and more believable presence, such as how King Ghidorah attacks in a manner of a King Cobra. Godzilla: King of the Monsters is led by a top-notch cast, whom all bring credibility and approachable presences that makes it easy for us to sympathize with. Kyle Chandler brings his salt-of-the-earth average joe charisma to the character of Dr. Mark Russell, Vera Farmiga is convincingly conflicted and forceful as Dr. Emma Russell, and Millie Bobby Brown does well as the moral center, bringing tenacity, wonder and initiative to the character of Madison Russell. The supporting characters are all colourful and add to the fun. Bradley Whitford, Thomas Middleditch and O’Shea Jackson Jr. all amuse in their parts, while Charles Dance, Aisha Hinds and Zhang Ziyi lend authoritative presence to their roles. Franchise returnees including Sally Hawkins, David Strathairn and Ken Watanabe are given more to do (particularly Watanabe) and really make the most out of their parts. No one in the cast act like they are above the material and look like they are actually having fun, which makes a positively huge difference. Also adding to the fun experience are the numerous callbacks to the franchise. It is quite clear that director Dougherty and co-writers Max Borenstein and Zach Shields are big fans of Godzilla, peppering many witty references throughout the film, including a certain plot device from the 1954 original film, a callback to certain characters relating to the origin of Mothra, and a clever role reversal that calls to mind a major moment in the 1954 film. It is moments like these that franchise devotees will truly appreciate. Overall, Godzilla: King of the Monsters is an incredibly fun continuation of the franchise, and one that respects and honours its roots. Thanks to solid direction and a committed ensemble cast, the film provides the extravagant action that franchise devotees will salivate for, while providing a story that brings forth an interesting moral dilemma that calls to mind the environmental messages of prior installments."

GODZILLA films are rarely balanced affairs between their kaiju stars and human counterparts. The vast majority of Big G movies (excluding the original 1954 entry, 2016’s SHIN GODZILLA, and maybe a couple of others) have scant amounts of monster action in between long stretches of inane human drama populated by characters that no one really cares about. The human element is a necessary one for these giant monster stories for scale purposes—it lets audiences know how big and powerful the creatures are while also putting some semblance of emotional faces and weights to the destruction being caused. Throughout the GODZILLA films, there have been attempts to make the human components at least as close as interesting as the kaiju brawls. This leads to intrigue with spies and assassins, space aliens that look like PLANET OF THE APES castaways, terrible MATRIX rip-offs, and a bunch of labyrinthine plots that are so far removed from making sense that the light from making sense won’t hit them for another seven years. Or there are attempts to make the human element compelling through drama — GODZILLA VS BIOLLANTE‘s ghost daughter plot, for example, or all of that terrible schtick from 1998’s GODZILLA — but they rarely work. The human element in GODZILLA films remains a formula to which most filmmakers don’t have a solution. GODZILLA: KING OF MONSTERS doubles down on that by not only giving the people a lot more screen time but trying out melodrama and action as a means to make the film’s bloated run time interesting as well. It doesn’t work, and it’s only one problem with the film in a sea of many issues. Following 2014’s GODZILLA, the world is now fully aware of these “titans” that exist on this planet. Godzilla hasn’t been seen in five years while the government debates between ordering the military to wipe out all of the titans or continuing to let the Monarch organization (headed by Ken Watanabe, Sally Hawkins, and Thomas Middleditch) continue to monitor and study the colossal beasts. With this backdrop, Monarch scientist Dr. Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga) has just created a means of communicating with the titans by issuing specific noises that imitate predators, friends, etc. When she and her daughter Madison (Millie Bobby Brown) are abducted by ecoterrorist Jonah Allen (Charles Dance), estranged husband/father Mark Russell (Kyle Chandler) is brought in with Monarch to find her and not let the communication device be used to manipulate other titans across the globe. Calamity ensues. 2014’s GODZILLA is a flawed movie. Whether it’s the wasted use of Elizabeth Olsen in a meaningless storyline, or drab Aaron Taylor-Johnson appearing at every meaningful moment in the story like a kaiju version of BAND OF BROTHERS, or how long it takes to introduce Godzilla into a movie with his own name on it — issues abound with it. However, to its credit, there is very little unnecessary melodrama when the monsters aren’t around, and the action is usually caused by (or a symptom of) the carnage the giant creatures are causing. And when Godzilla does show up, it’s for a savage fight that feels choreographed but brutal, and all of it is beautifully captured on frame. GODZILLA: KING OF MONSTERS, as directed by Michael Dougherty (KRAMPUS, TRICK ‘R TREAT) from a script by Dougherty along with Zach Shields (KRAMPUS), doesn’t have those positives. Not only is the human story so invasive and poorly done, but it is also badly captured in an incredibly inept way. For the first five scenes that Mark is introduced, there are constant shots of pictures with him and his daughter (or it cuts to his face when his wife and daughter are mentioned) to underscore that this man is related to these people — a fact that has actually already been established previously in the movie (thanks to, yes, more photos). And then Mark shows up and becomes Captain Amazing for the rest of the movie — he knows strategy better than the military, can outflank an armed team of mercenaries better than soldiers, knows the science in all sorts of specialties better than everyone else in the room, and constantly has the “crazy idea” that just might work that every qualified leader is only too happy to listen to and obey. If internet fanboys were honest in looking for unearned abilities and sudden talents outshining the rest of the cast in their fictional characters, Mark Russell in GODZILLA: KING OF MONSTERS is an incredible example. The plot keeps trying to be action packed for the humans and also full of melodrama involving betrayals and the Russell family’s issues, and it just doesn’t work. If the filmmakers leaned into it more, elevated it to camp with all sorts of nonsense and mustache-twirling villainy — while cutting the screen time WAY down—then maybe this could have been something. So that just leaves the monsters — or, the reason people are coming to this movie (sorry, David Straitharn stans). They are… okay. Every Godzilla entrance is badass and fun and makes viewers feel excited about what’s about to happen. He’s shown off early in the film, and there are more scenes of him and the other kaiju than 2014’s movie (but there is just so much more time devoted to the awful human plot that it becomes a moving ratio). There are some great moments in the fighting and cool elements that deliver on promises of imagining what a Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah fight would look like in the 21st century. Unfortunately, there is also a lot of awkward shots and cutting away. It is the only time in any GODZILLA movie (except maybe 1998?) where I couldn’t figure out the geography of the action; buildings would suddenly pop up to be destroyed but then it would look like a leveled city again, and it was hard to figure out exactly where each creature was at points. GODZILLA: KING OF THE MONSTERS isn’t without its charms, of course. The titular monster, as I said, looks great and has real personality — it’s just a shame he’s not used as much as people would like. Charles Dance is very catty as the ecoterrorist unleashing apocalypse, which makes his scenes very fun. Middleditch, Watanabe, and Ziyi Zhang are good in their roles and effectively sell their thin characters. Bear McCreary’s score is a great adaptation and update of classic themes from past Toho films, but with newly added percussion and choruses that make it very engaging and pulse-pounding. The f/x are fairly well done when the poor editing and action cinematography isn’t getting in the way. It’s a hard problem to solve, the human/Godzilla balance. Maybe humans aren’t needed? Maybe we as a people have seen enough disasters (natural and man-made) in just the past two decades to get the suffering and grief and empathy we should be feeling. Or maybe filmmakers need to figure out what type of movie they are telling, with their giant lizard monster in a central location, and build the tone around that. Is it a sober warning about climate change or impending wars? Is it a popcorn bit of entertainment with brawling titans? GODZILLA: KING OF THE MONSTERS never knows and tries throwing all sorts of dead-end plot threads and ineffective emotional beats at the audience. Onto GODZILLA VS. KONG next, I guess.

"Jul 10, 2019",negative," You can tell a lot about a country by the way it writes about Godzilla. “Godzilla is the son of the atomic bomb,” explained the original film’s producer Tomoyuki Tanaka. “He is a nightmare created out of the darkness of the human soul.” Meanwhile Gareth Edwards’ lauded and commercially successful Godzilla in 2014 was critiqued for a lack of nuance when it came to the atomic age: “Rather than offering caution about nuclear energy,” summised Godzilla expert Ed Godziszewski, “the new film almost gives you the idea that nuclear weapons are actually the answer to everything.” If the West’s last Godzilla outing seemed to have an intriguing take on warheads, then King Of The Monsters feels like it almost lusts for nuclear conflict. It is astonishing to see a movie series that was once focused on assessing nuclear technology’s vices now suggesting that nuclear holocausts are necessary and beautiful and – more times than is safe to count – relying on atomic weapons to save the day. This might sound very confusing and you are correct to think that. The thing about King Of The Monsters is it makes absolutely no sense. Not in a fun, campy way either: I could chart every scene of the movie for you, but why any of them happen is absolutely beyond me. Crucial character work happens off stage all the time: Charles Dance (in a atrocity of a role) reveals, in passing, that he has been working with Vera Farmiga, who up until this point we thought was his hostage and this is not lingered on or explored. This is, I cannot stress enough, one of the most crucial pieces of information in the whole movie. Another character dies in such a turgid fight sequence that it took me 20 minutes to realise she wasn’t just off screen. Nobody even mourns her passing. This is because in King Of The Monsters – part of a series literally built on exploring the consequences of human power-lust through the heightened lens of science fiction – there are absolutely no consequences to anything. It pays lip service to the idea of consequence the way all epic cinema does in the post-Avengers age: it suggests all extras in its decimated townscapes are “evacuated” though never really lingers on how. But we are never left with any idea of the damage being done by the monsters that roam throughout this movie: we do not see if the few civilians given screen time are saved or killed, or what impact battles have on those who survive. Yet it’s a movie based on characters who made it through the conflict of the first film, but even their PTSD is unclear: do they love Godzilla? Fear him? Hate him? Everyone seems to just change their opinion on him depending on what the movie requires. There are moments when the film almost dares to pause and think. Not many mind – at one point Ken Watanabe says “There’s no time for debate,” which is actually the one time in the film I would have killed for one – but sometimes it manages to take a moment to provide us with a slow moment of terribly written dialogue. In one, Ziyi Zhang – in a welcome return to western blockbusters because she knows how to present the spectacular with poise – explains to Kyle Chandler’s Dr Mark Russell that slaying dragons is a western concept, while in the east they are seen as messianic. This concept is not... really expanded on much. Or it is, I suppose, but not by her character and not in any sort of order. Other characters praise Godzilla and the monsters as ways of saving humanity, but who says it, again, just depends on who is needed to say it rather than who has any reason to think it. Every character has something akin to motives and every character does things. These two factors, however, rarely come together to affect each other. On the note of Ziyi Zhang: at one point in the movie she appears in a completely different location, intrigued by Mothra, and then in the next scene she is back with the main cast. It turns out, according to Wikipedia, that this is because she is playing twins. This twin literally only appears in this one, tiny vignette, doesn't say any lines and could honestly be the same character. When did it fall back to IMDB to explain plot points to me? It’s also a movie that falls back on so many lazy, lazy tropes it staggers me. This is Godzilla – the ultimate trope – it’s allowed to fall back on the archetype it comes from. But wider cinematic clichés, for example “this character died off screen so are they really dead?” or “this character says ‘I'm coming!’ which everyone believes but actually they're sacrificing themselves” are so bored, so overused, that they don’t feel like homage but fromage. All of this adds to a movie that seems to like Godzilla and the other monsters simply because they’re just cool to look at. This is fair, the CGI is great (most of the time: Ghidorah is tough to watch in a post-Drogon world), but it defeats the point of a movie about nuclear weapons. A film in which the drive is to see all these allegories for thermonuclear devices is aesthetically staggering, but it doesn’t entirely match up to the truth and the power of the Cold War as a storytelling device, which is: nobody actually wants to see them. The greatest threat is just knowing they’re latent. Gareth Edwards got that. This film absolutely doesn’t. Godzilla (2014) was a huge turning point for the franchise. Japan even went back to it, leaving behind the kaiju traditions of men dressed in lizard suits to bring in some CGI. They got the exceptional Hideki Anno – a man whose opus Neon Genesis Evangelion practically gets off on the true depths of human trauma – to direct and write. It’s a movie that overwhelms, that is filled with banality, that presents Godzilla as a diplomatic and bureaucratic nightmare as much as a deity. It is also fascinated to go into the wider implications of every part of its mythos, down to exactly how dangerous the half life of his atomic breath might be. It’s not a perfect film but it got a lot of love for the right reasons: it told a compact story well. Godzilla: King Of The Monsters tells a big story very, very poorly. By the third act, I did not care who lived or died in part because I no longer really knew who lived or died. It has a diverse and wide-ranging cast, but it is not charming or particularly representative: there’s a short haired woman of colour who... I think she’s a pilot? She’s trotted out the same way my overwhelmingly white secondary school kept putting my one black friend on every prospectus cover: to suggest that her being there is as relevant as giving her something to do. This kind of surface level inclusion means the film is more interested in ticking boxes than in giving life to the ensemble it gathers together, meaning I just don’t care about their personal stakes. Then again, neither does the script. In the third act, the cast of burgeoning famous actors are all sent on separate missions, which have no real reasoning behind them and which just happen on rails as if to give everyone a little bit of screen time. There’s one moment where a mission in a submarine aims to shoot nuclear missiles at Godzilla underwater (I just... I can't) and then this is scuppered by a vaguely familiar background actor saying, “Sorry, but the missile launching facilities were destroyed in the crash.” Or something similar. What is “the crash”? I couldn't tell you, because this is a movie of collision after collision. The characters decisions from that point on, then, are not the product of a logical sequence of decisions that impact on each other, but caused by completely inexplicable external parties forcing characters this way or that. This is the film’s constant way of suggesting characters act the way they do. “They have no choice!” people tell us. No, Medea had no choice. Hedda Gabler had no choice. These people never present or explore the many avenues they can no longer go down to get to “no choice”. It is almost impossible to pick apart all the reasons I found to loathe Godzilla: King Of The Monsters without sitting you down to watch it and pausing every five minutes to decode, but that would involve us buying tickets for a movie that should be killed off faster than most nuclear programs. And this is part of a cinematic universe! A universe! One that they will not stop reminding you of all film: so many references to King Kong, just so they can weave these two beasts together for another dreary cash cow in 2020. The constant reminders that this isn't the end made me wish I was about to be wiped out like something out of the BBC's Threads. We have seen grandeur enough times on the big screen now to know it can be clear, intelligent and as driven by characters as it is by plot. Everything from The Incredibles to Captain America: Civil War to Game Of Thrones proves in its own way these can be done. Godzilla: King Of The Monsters wants to cash in on these successes but puts in none of the work. Avoid it like a nuclear bomb site: this is the sort of film that'll make you think cinema is dead."

"Jul 3, 2019",negative," For a film series that has long since outstayed its welcome, the latest in the very first superhero saga – X-Men: Dark Phoenix (dir. Simon Kinberg, rated M) – seems to be in an awful hurry to wrap things up. The culmination (and likely finale) of the film series that began long ago with X-Men in 2000, and has seen actors and storylines come and go (with the occasional time-travel retcon here and there) is a zippy little thing that nevertheless seems bursting at the seams and sagging with the weight of a series that just can't seem to end, already. Returning to ground covered in the much-maligned X-Men: The Last Stand, this film follows the X-Men as they face one of their own, Jean Grey (Sophie Turner, who does well to hold the whole thing together in a cast of sleepwalkers) when exposure to cosmic rays gives her immense, uncontrollable powers. One gets the impression from Dark Phoenix that the film-makers are trying to make up for the ""sins"" of that previous film, but this one commits too many of its own in trying to play it safe to fare any better. Packed with actors who seem desperate to simply run out their contracts (particularly Jennifer Lawrence as Mystique and Evan Peters as Quicksilver, whose brief appearances here may as well have featured them picking up their paychecks), the action itself is at least solidly entertaining and occasionally even thrilling. Indeed, there are moments of inspired genre film-making that occasionally elevate the whole operation, boosted by a reliably bombastic Hans Zimmer score. The inclusion of a nonsensical and unnecessary alien subplot slows things down enormously, and there is little in the way of catharsis or a sense of an ending here – if it is to be the end of this iteration of Professor X, Magneto, Cyclops and the like, they've gone out less with a bang than a whimper. Rating: Two-and-a-half stars. The problem with the fledgling mega-monsters series that began with 2014's Godzilla, followed by Kong: Skull Island and now the woebegone Godzilla II: King of the Monsters (dir. Michael Dougherty, rated M) has never been the monsters themselves. The series has always had the ability to deliver agreeably epic visuals of titanic monsters ripping into each other in giant tableaus like something out of a Bosch painting. No, the problem with this series has always been the characters running around the monsters – the human element that somehow takes up so much of the filmmakers' concern and yet remains so very boring. Godzilla II picks up sometime after the first appearance of everyone's favourite rotund super-lizard, and largely follows an estranged family (Kyle Chandler, Vera Farmiga and Millie Bobby Brown) as the actions of an eco-terrorist cell revive a coterie of long-dormant giant monsters hiding beneath the earth. Globe-trotting without feeling like it gets anywhere, packed with quips without being funny, and featuring muddy, messy action devoid of excitement, Godzilla II is a mostly pointless in-between instalment before the inevitable King Kong/Godzilla showdown to come. Rating: Two stars."
"Jul 3, 2019",positive,Maybe it's time to include Godzilla in the discussion of our richest cinematic franchises.
"Jun 27, 2019",negative," It's really hard to tell what kind of movie Godzilla: King of the Monsters wants to be. The predecessor to this garish, nonsensical monster mash, 2014's Godzilla, was a moody take on the famous kaiju, sparing in its depiction of scaly flesh. While some -- including yours truly -- found it dull, it also amassed a vocal critical fanbase. The follow-up seems to nod half-heartedly to artistry, but it's more interested in the brainless crash-bang of a bunch of CGI creatures duking it out. The cast is stacked with otherwise brilliant actors stuck in a borderline incomprehensible plot and forced to play second fiddle to monsters whose powers of wonder wear off fast. This is franchise filmmaking at its most unnecessary, a last gasp to salvage a series that seems to have little chance at survival. Because, yes, this is supposed to be part of a bigger MonsterVerse, all leading up to a showdown between Godzilla and King Kong, the latter of whom was featured in 2017's Kong: Skull Island. Those two don't go at it in King of the Monsters, directed by Michael Dougherty, though there are some offhand mentions of the large ape. Instead, this installment features some more wheel-spinning and tedious exposition involving Monarch, the monster research organization that's this franchise's version of Marvel's S.H.I.E.L.D. King of Monsters focuses primarily on the Russells, a family that was caught in the rampage that made up the finale of Gareth Edwards' earlier movie, in which Godzilla battled some Mutos and saved San Francisco, but created a big mess in the process. The stomping beasts killed Mark and Emma Russell's son, and in their grief the couple split. She (Vera Farmiga) went to live on a Monarch research base with their daughter Madison (Stranger Things' Millie Bobby Brown). Emma has been building a sonic device that can control and subdue the monsters, called Titans. Meanwhile Mark (Kyle Chandler) has dedicated his life to photographing wolves. He's eventually brought back into the fold when Emma and Madison are kidnapped by eco-terrorists led by a scowling leader named Jonah Alan (played by Tywin Lannister, a.k.a. Charles Dance). Except -- in a headache-inducing twist -- that was part of Emma's plan. She's teaming with Jonah against Monarch because she misguidedly thinks she can save the planet by letting the Titans roam free, thinning humanity and its pollution. Like Thanos before her, Emma's ostensibly noble intentions cause a litany of issues issues when it turns out that one of the ancient giants that Monarch has been monitoring, the three-headed King Ghidorah, is especially cruel and powerful, and not willing to submit to Godzilla's more benevolent impulses. If this sounds needlessly confusing, well, it gets worse when you factor in that the script seems cobbled together from various unfinished drafts. It casually drops references to characters and scenarios in a way that assumes the audience has a bigger investment in the narrative the film ever earns. Perhaps the most baffling moment is when it's revealed, with little to no explanation, that Ziyi Zhang plays identical scientists on different sides of the world who may or may not be twins. Speaking of the cast: It's filled to the brim with otherwise excellent performers, most of them either slogging their way through perfunctory technical dialogue or taking the whole mishegoss way too seriously. The only one who seems to know what movie he's in Bradley Whitford, who at least thinks all the nonsense is funny. At times, Dougherty manages to create some arresting images of wings emerging from clouds. There's a big brawl that ends in Boston, of all places -- a Dunkin' sign tragically falls in the fight. Godzilla remains king, Mothra's the queen, and there are a few human casualties. It's not a conclusion that elicits many further questions, but that doesn't mean the studio has skimped on the frustratingly obligatory post-credits scene. In the tag, Dance's Jonah sets out to purchase one of the Ghidorah's heads, implying that it may return for the next round, when presumably Kong will get involved. Like it or not, there will be another film in the Godzilla universe. But at that point -- if you've even made it through the credits -- you'll probably have the same reaction I did: Who cares? King of the Monsters does nothing to prove that the MonsterVerse should continue. When you can't get a crowd excited for kaiju fighting one another, what's the point?

Entre todos intentan resistir a las embestidas de Mothra, Rodan o del último némesis de la humanidad: King Ghidorah. Estas ancianas criaturas harán todo lo posible por sobrevivir, poniendo en riesgo la existencia del ser humano en el planeta. En un único instante de su farragoso ir y venir tratando de convertir el kaiju eiga nipón en un blockbuster de seria severidad de autor, el Godzilla (2014) de Gareth Edwards comprendía de verdad a sus criaturas mitológicas. Era una escena brillante, en la cual el saurio mítico y ese enemigo mutante ciclópeo que el pánico nuclear había sacado de su letargo se retaban en un plano general visto a ras de suelo, desde el punto de vista de los personajes humanos. En ese glorioso (lamentablemente un oasis entre el resto del pesado metraje) instante, rematado con unos portones inmensos (los de la isla de King Kong, claro), ambos titanes parecían señores disfrazados a punto de arrasar la maqueta de San Francisco. Mike Dougherty, el director de Godzilla: rey de los monstruos sí que entiende este universo, y toda su película es una sucesión de (espectaculares) decorados que parecen la más cara y naíf maqueta jamás soñada; de dioramas ante los que su terceto de dioses terrenales (Godzilla, Rodan y Mothra) y ese otro de origen alienígena (Ghidorah) posan como los luchadores de sumo antes de librarse a peleas de candorosa fisicidad humanoide. Y sus monstruos utilizan toda la última tecnología digital para imitar la textura de especialistas embutidos en disfraces de caucho. Incluso cuando caen en la lid, sus posturas son las que los fans del opus producido por la Toho (también la Daiei, pero esa es otras historia) recuerdan jalear en los cines de barrio disfrutando con esos tipos en traje de fantasía. Gastar más de 240 millones de dólares en replicar esa artificialidad, esa no realidad de infantil inocencia, enfurecerá a muchos espectadores, algunos de ellos enarbolando un purismo sobre el legado del kaiju eiga que demuestra su profunda ignorancia respecto a este. Cualquiera que haya perdido sus dientes de leche y cambiado la voz a base de maratones de esta clase de películas (sobre todo de Los hijos del volcán, a la que Godzilla: rey de los monstruos cita con la generación de gemelas y la conexión telepática) sabe que ese cine no era riguroso, que era infantiloide, poético también, pero que funcionaba sin apenas guión, a trompicones, saltando de escena a escena sin ningún tipo de homogeneidad dramática, tan solo por el amor a la aventura y a dar al público lo que querían.  Mike Dougherty y sus guionistas han hecho un film así: deslavazado, sin conexión entre sus escenas tal como reclamaría la heterodoxia, pero bella y estimulantemente coherente con el alma del kaiju eiga, del opus de su profeta, Ishirô Honda. La acción pasa de un retablo a otro, de una localización a otra, atenta a dibujar ese cuadro inolvidable (las apariciones de Mothra, de Rodan, la resurrección de Godzilla, las luchas cuerpo a cuerpo…) que apela a lo legendario tal y como aquel cine lo imaginaba. Nada importan (como no importaban en los títulos japoneses de los años 60 y 70) las personas, sus dramas y traumas de folletín, en Godzilla: rey de los monstruos. Los seres humanos están siempre a los pies de los titanes, casi como si sus escenas se rodaran ante una colosal pantalla donde, vía retroproyección, tuviera lugar otra película, otra cosa, otro mundo. Es ese mundo, ese universo, el que engrandece el trabajo de Dougherty. Un lugar donde un submarino (por supuesto que el de Latitud cero (Donde el mundo acaba), de Ishirô Honda, 1969) puede llegar a una Atlántida pulp que pocos sabrán apreciar, acaso los mismos entusiastas de Honda, Jun Fukuda, el británico Kevin Connor o nuestro Juan Piquer Simón. Da igual que sean, que seamos, pocos quienes apreciemos todo ese cariño y conocimiento de causa hacia sus seres fantásticos XXXL que derrocha Godzilla: rey de los monstruos.

"Jun 22, 2019",negative," Al cine dionisiaco, el que apela a las más bajas pasiones, a la desmesura, a la intrascendencia, a la efervescencia y a la extravagancia, sin mayores ambiciones que las de provocar en la platea un par de horas de exaltación más o menos colectiva, solo hay que pedirle una cosa: que esté bien contado, que esté bien narrado desde el más elemental sentido de la palabra, el que alude a unos personajes, unas situaciones, un tiempo y un lugar, y que todo ello se comprenda. Pero ni eso es capaz de cumplir el espantoso armatoste Godzilla: rey de los monstruos, secuela de aquella Godzilla del año 2014, dirigida por Gareth Edwards, que al menos tenía un puñado de imágenes símbolo de estimable belleza formal. Este kaiju-eiga (ya saben, películas de monstruos nacidas en la cultura japonesa), dirigido y coescrito por Michael Dougherty, confía simplemente en la acumulación, y para mejorar a una criatura tan emblemática como Godzilla cree que solo hace falta sumarle otras: tres monstruos mejor que uno. Sin embargo, Dougherty es incapaz de componer imágenes brillantes, el efecto político del original japonés (Hiroshima y Nagasaki, en el recuerdo) y de alguno de sus renacimientos es aquí ininteligible y, lo peor, nunca acaban de percibirse con nitidez cuáles son los objetivos de los personajes dentro de un panorama en el que el cliché familiar (la hecatombe mundial, la catástrofe de un matrimonio y su hija) supone un elemento más para el sonrojo. Es una lástima que Legendary Pictures y Warner Bros., productores del evento, hayan desterrado del todo el estruendoso sentido del humor y el espíritu de sano gamberrismo de Kong: la isla calavera, segunda entrega de lo que se ha dado en llamar franquicia monsterverso, para apostar por la grandilocuencia, la mirada penetrante y el arqueo de ceja vacuo y pedestre. Si Ray Harryhausen y el Gordon Douglas de La humanidad en peligro (1954) levantaran la cabeza y vieran este trasto de impostada seriedad, no darían crédito."
"Jun 21, 2019",positive,"Sometimes you have to be honest about the movie you really are - smashy smash. If you can reconcile that, then it's not so awful."
"Jun 18, 2019",positive," Let’s get this out of the way first: In a movie that includes a tri-headed dragon and a Nakatomi plaza-sized spider, Mark (Kyle Chandler) is easily the most grotesque monstrosity. This dude is introduced to us while he’s shooting B-roll wolf footage for a knockoff Planet Earth. Yet somehow, within minutes, he’s bossing around the entire global military on Armageddon eve. Mothra vomits sticky webs, but Mark’s mansplaining is the vilest thing to come out of any mouth in the entirety of Godzilla: King of the Monsters, which is otherwise a damn good monster-stravaganza. Ever see what you’re convinced is a terrifying murderer in your home, only to realize that it’s nothing more than an article of recklessly discarded clothing disguised by poor lighting? That’s what screenwriter Zach Shields and writer/director Michael Dougherty have done with the plot here. Wisely, there isn’t one. Oh sure, it looks like there’s a plot. There just isn’t. Bad eco-terrorists reawaken long-dormant monsters hiding around the world to restore “balance to the planet.” Godzilla fights those monsters while being alternatingly helped and hindered by humans and Mothra. (colorreflections.com)  That’s not a plot. That’s nothing more than set-up for long-overdue, glorious Kaiju fetishization. Hooray! When it comes to intricately detailed toys, imagination should ideally spark just as vibrantly when posing them as when smashing them into one another. Dougherty and company get that. They spend significant time having Rodan, King Ghidorah, Mothra and the titular G-man preen and flex in atmospheric lighting. It is somehow both beautiful and blissfully cheesy. The creature design for Ghidorah resembles early Harryhausen stop-motion designs. Mothra is somehow equally endearing and terrifying. Rodan murders planes like he’s being controlled by a malevolent, giant, invisible toddler. Godzilla has an atomic seizure. Admittedly, they only fight each other a few times, but the film never strays its gaze too far from them. Remember: You can only blow your action figures up with firecrackers once. A legion of typically insightful detractors have somehow surprisingly blasted Godzilla: King of the Monsters for leaning too hard into the humans and away from the creatures. Maybe it felt that way to some, but it’s literally just untrue. The film doesn’t go 10 consecutive minutes—most often less than 5—without a monster on screen. From the opening sequence to the final frames, it is chock-a-block with Kaiju juju. The job of the humans is to give the camera a ride to the next monster sequence. In its understandable obsession to prioritize the monster squad, Godzilla: King of the Monsters admittedly fails to synthesize a thesis worthy of the franchise. It’s entirely possible that the American psyche simply does not easily permit the kind of condemnations of hubris and militarization that are trademarks of the best works in the series. Likewise, making villains out of those who legitimately fear for the planet’s extinction may be a misguided narrative tactic at a moment when the United States is ghosting the global movement against the climate crisis. However, what Dougherty and company have done here is fairly stunning. Not since the original Jurassic Park have massive CGI creatures felt this majestic and menacing. Long after memories of Mark’s whining and interrupting have faded, the sound of Godzilla firing up his electrical barf will remain. Please note: If one annoying character is able to ruin everything for you, you’re going to have a very exhausting road to November 2020."
"Jun 18, 2019",negative," ¿Puede ser sutil un monstruo gigante? Hace cinco años, Gareth Edwards se empeñó en probar que sí. Y, aunque la jugada distó de salirle perfecta, su Godzilla logró al menos que el viejo reptil recuperara, a base de drama y conspiranoia, parte de la dignidad que Roland Emmerich le había arrebatado en 1998. Qué noble esfuerzo. Y qué lástima que Godzilla: Rey de los monstruos llegue ahora para mandar sus logros al traste. La película de Michael Dougherty (coguionista junto a Zach Shields) aspira a recrear los fiestones kaiju de cintas como Los monstruos invaden la Tierra. Y, empeñado en llenar la pantalla de criaturas demoledoras, olvida que estas no bastan para sostener un filme. No es ya que su libreto, estructurado según las arcanas leyes del desbarajuste, sea incapaz de transmitirnos las motivaciones de sus personajes humanos: es que tampoco sabe hacernos ver las de esos monstruos que se enfrentan en escenas repletas de un caos que no es ni estimulante ni abrumador, sino solo confuso. Por otra parte, mientras el tratamiento dispensado al personaje de Vera Farmiga hace preguntarse si Un Tío Blanco Hetero ha trabajado aquí como asesor,  la cinta se permite relegar a toda una señora Mothra, pese a su importancia en la mitología godzilliana. Así pues, uno abandona la sala deseando revisar Shin Godzilla (Hideaki Anno, 2016): tal vez ese filme, última excursión del bicho en su país natal, sea cruel e irritante, pero al menos es fiel a sí mismo y a su criatura. La agencia criptozoológica MONARCA se enfrenta al mayor desafío de la historia: una invasión de monstruos gigantes en la que Godzilla se enfrenta a una variedad de criaturas como Rodan, Mothra o su némesis, King Gidorah.

"Jun 18, 2019",positive," ‘Godzilla: Rey de los monstruos’ llega este viernes a los cines españoles con tres semanas de retraso respecto a su estreno en Estados Unidos. Allí no ha funcionado tan bien en taquilla como se esperaba de ella, dejando en duda la continuidad del Monsterverse con el que Warner pretendía emular una vez más a Marvel. La película parece una respuesta directa a aquellos que se quejaron de que el monstruo no aparecía lo suficiente en ‘Godzilla’, una notable superproducción que se centraba más en ver los efectos que provocaba el resurgir de la bestia en la población que en su lado más devastador. Aquí eso cambia y se apuesta por una sobredosis de destrucción que arrasa con todo a su paso. El resultado es inferior a su predecesora -y también a ‘Kong: La isla calavera’- pero como pasatiempo también tiene su lado positivo. Michael Dougherty da el salto a la primera línea de Hollywood con ‘Godzilla: Rey de los monstruos’ tras las muy estimables comedias de terror ‘Truco o trato’ y ‘Krampus: Maldita navidad’, por lo que uno podría esperar de su elección que el humor tuviera una presencia importante en el relato. Podéis ir olvidándoos de eso más allá de alguna puya aislada entre personajes secundarios. Aquí prima un tono dramático, marcado desde el inicio por el potente prólogo que marca las motivaciones de la familia protagonista. A partir de ahí la película da un pequeño paso atrás en términos de intensidad para luego ir creciendo sin control hasta que todo se convierte en casi un videojuego con criaturas gigantes dándose de leches y destrozando todo a su paso. Esa faceta destructiva es lo más estimulante de la película, ya que es cierto que se tiende a una ambientación visual más oscura, probablemente para no tener que realizar una inversión aún más gigantesca en efectos visuales -se estima que ha costado la friolera de 170 millones de dólares- sin que eso suponga renunciar a la avalancha de monstruos sembrando el caos. Aquí pesa más la cantidad que los esfuerzos porque cada una de esas escenas luzcan de la forma más vigorosa posible -se echa en falta la exquisita planificación visual de Gareth Edwards para algunas escenas de 'Godzilla'-. Luego a la hora de la verdad son muy pocas las que tienen una relevancia real en el devenir de los acontecimientos, pero aporta cierta variedad para que uno no se canse de ver a los mismos monstruos enfrentándose una y otra vez hasta que todo se zanja de forma definitiva. Además, todas son impresionantes visualmente y abordando la película desde una perspectiva más sencilla es fácil dejarse llevar por el derroche de efectos visuales. El problema lo encontramos con los personajes humanos, pues es cierto que ‘Godzilla’ adolecía de unos protagonistas sin la entidad suficiente para liderar el relato a partir de la desaparición de cierto personaje, pero a cambio ofrecía una visión global más estimulante del drama humano. Aquí la humanidad en sí misma es algo inconcreto que en la que solamente se hace hincapié para ver cómo se intenta rescatar a un grupo de anónimos o para incidir en el drama de algunos de los personajes principales. Una decisión que en sí misma no es negativa, pero que ayuda a dejar más al descubierto las limitaciones del guion firmado por Dougherty y Zach Shields. Algo me dice que no gozaron de la libertad adecuada para explorar la historia, ya que cuesta asumir que de su mente salgan diálogos tan planos, como si fueran fruto de la plantilla resultante del acuerdo de un comité. Eso daña la película, pero no de forma irreparable. Lo que sí provoca de forma innegable es una inestabilidad dramática, bajando el interés cuando la historia tiene que centrarse de forma inevitable en ellos y además restando empaque a las grandes catarsis emocionales de la película. Momentos con una fuerza innegable que no consiguen el impacto deseado por todo el lastre que la película había ido acumulando con anterioridad. En definitiva, ‘Godzilla: Rey de los monstruos’ funciona como entretenimiento al que no pedirle más que ver a monstruos arrasando con todo. El resto no pasa de prescindible en el mejor de los casos, pero hay tantísimo momento de combate entre criaturas o sembrando el caos que personalmente sí me ha merecido la pena.

"Jun 17, 2019",neutral," Since franchises and “universes” are the rage in Hollywood, this is Legendary Entertainment’s attempt to get in on the action.  Godzilla II: King of the Monsters marks the third film in the series following on from two reboots, Godzilla (2014) and Kong: Skull Island (2017).  If you’re wondering where it goes next, prepare yourself for Godzilla vs. Kong which is slated for release in March 2020. As for this film… it picks things up about 5 years after the original.  The world now knows that monsters are real and the political fall-out has been huge.  That’s particularly evident within a government-run organisation known as Monarch.  It was originally established to locate and destroy monsters to ensure mankind remains the dominant species.  There’s now a differing view held by some within Monarch that the monsters (or most of them) are friendly and to kill them would disrupt the world’s natural order. It turns out there are roughly 17 monsters on the planet, including Godzilla, and a team of scientists have been studying their genetic composition.  It may sound ridiculously dangerous but the monsters are in a hibernating state.  A catalyst is required to create drama and it comes in the form of an eco-terrorist (Dance) with confusing motives.  On one hand, he wants to make money by trading monster DNA but that seems counterproductive considering he wants to kill most living things on the planet. In the same vein as the 2014 film, I’d argue that the human characters in this movie have the charisma of a wet sponge.  They’re a dull, boring group of people who between them, magically have the answer for every problem.  It’s part of the reason why there’s so little tension in the movie.  These characters should have died countless times but help and/or good fortune always arrives at the last possible moment.  The only actor worthy of a mention is Bradley Whitford (The West Wing) who adds a splash of comedy to break up the tedium. It’s the monsters who should have provided all the excitement but writer-director Michael Dougherty struggles to creating something meaningful amongst the chaos.  We can see a myriad of monsters duking it out (the three-headed dragon looked cool) but it’s largely the same stuff from scene-to-scene.  I wish I’d kept count of how many buildings were destroyed.  I’m sure there were humans in them but it’s best not to think about that."
"Jun 15, 2019",negative," Of the nine films currently showing in local cinemas, six of them are either giant studio-remakes or sequels. It’s typical of the last few months, where trips to the cinemas may have triggered feelings of déjà vu, with some equation of superhero-sequel or Disney sequel/remake or monster remake commanding the majority of screens. This week, two continuing releases continue to thrive at the local box-office. “Dark Phoenix,” the seventh film in Fox’s main X-Men series is in its second week of release against “Godzilla: King of the Monsters,” a quasi-sequel to the 2014 “Godzilla” which is part of another newly extended universe that will see Godzilla battling with King Kong in the near future. In 2014, director Gareth Edwards’ sombre “Godzilla” was antithetical to the immediate spectacle of the franchise as it opted instead for a muted aesthetic. It worked to good effect for me, despite the criticisms of too little time with the titular monster. Michael Dougherty’s direction in “King of the Monsters” seems intent on course-correcting this sombre predecessor. And not for the better. This new film picks up five years after the first, in a world where Godzilla and titans like him are known and studied. The (mostly) new cast of characters are dealing with the fallout and ramifications of living alongside these ancient monsters, whose powers have been reignited and exacerbated by human interference. It’s a thoughtful, if familiar, science-fiction plot-point – human folly precipitating apocalypse. And, in its way, it’s a hook that announces “King of the Monsters” as vaguely conscious of the role of humanity in a world of fantasy: humanity as both destroyers and saviours of the world. Except, despite this marginally thoughtful hook, plot and ideas are negligible in “King of the Monsters.” The film ostensibly surrounds paleobioligist Emma Russell, whose research and skill has been able to lead to the construction of a device that communicates with the titans. Although the film nods to a plot in Dr Russell having lost a child in the battle that ended the 2014 film, “King of the Monsters” is all about the monsters. We meet our first titan ten minutes into the film and it keeps launching news ones at us until the final battle sequence that sees Godzilla in a gargantuan face off with Ghidorah, an alien monster.  That final battle is a brawl that gives you all the high-energy thrills you could want from such a thing. It offers exactly the promised CGI-centred spectacle one expects from the franchise. But, the deployment of the battle also feels perfunctory and oddly dull in ways that represent “King of the Monsters” strange inability to sustain tension over the course of its run-time.  This issue is exacerbated when the human story takes over, with the majority of characters teetering between rote existences and preening tedium. Their incapacity to ground the (large amounts of the) film when they are the focus kills the momentum. But it is also doesn’t help that the consistent focus on the monsters makes the final battle lose some of the thrill of discovery since we’ve already seen them do so much. By the time we reach the would-be climactic end, we feel exhausted and just want it to be over. Within the film’s unsatisfying trajectory, the real titan is Vera Farmiga, who harnesses her acting prowess to superheroic heights in the role of Dr Russell to force some sort of emotional resonance and sense into this thing. Her final lines in the film make a valiant attempt to make this all worth it. She does not succeed. But her attempts are valiant and compelling enough to make the film around her more credible. Luckily, “Dark Phoenix” fares better, even if critical response has been unkind. In this final film of the X-Men series, Jean Grey earns her own film as she must deal with her growing powers after a space mission goes awry. At first, “Dark Phoenix” seems like it may be biting off more than it can chew. The film’s opening, which (perhaps inadvertently) mimics the opening of the enjoyable “Shazam” from earlier this year, gave me pause. It has to work as a story of Jean Grey while functioning as an X-Men film, and that seems like a whole lot for a film like this to cover. And the opening scenes struggle a bit at building the world – Jean Grey’s ambivalence, the team’s ennui, and Professor Xavier’s pride at making mutants accepted tipping over into carelessness. But, by the time the film creates its first crisis – a solar flare envelopes Grey, making her inexplicably stronger – things get better. “Dark Phoenix” is able to satisfy both sides of desire; it is compelling as an examination of that familiar superheroic ambivalence we’ve seen a lot of lately but also thoughtful in its examination of the isolation of being a hero, and the value of found families and (yes) the value of love. Certainly, the central thesis here is overly familiar. We know this story. And in this way, “Dark Phoenix” is not doing something particularly new for superhero stories, or stories of families. The expectation for the series to end on something explicitly unique may make what it is doing seem banal. What it is doing is crafting a narrative that depends, emphatically, on emotion and sensitivity that’s buoyed by spectacles that complement its story. The film is aided by a stunning sound design that cultivates the sounds of fury and rage with stunning effect. Sophie Turner (of “Game of Thrones” fame) is, in some ways, riffing on her familiar performance as Sansa Stark. There is much of Sansa Stark in Grey’s own emotional journey, and even as the protagonist Jean is not the most dynamic player in her story. But it’s that earnest sincerity that “Dark Phoenix” has going for it. The film may seem to tremble at the umpteenth scene of Xavier extolling the all-conquering power of love to his team, and even though he and director Simon Kinberg seem to believe that, the “Dark Phoenix” is nuanced enough to recognise that love is always complicated and sometimes unsatisfying. In this way, this sort of humble focus may seem muted for the end of a franchise, especially in the wake of the way the recent “Endgame” ended, with pomp and ceremony. Jean Grey is not necessarily a character one would extract as central to the series, and “Dark Phoenix” exacerbates that potential issue by pairing her with a villain who is more schematic and illusory than one would hope. But, it’s all towards an end-result that privileges the small-scale, ragtag camaraderie of the series and these group of characters. “Dark Phoenix” feels thoughtful and meditative in a way that surprised and left me surprisingly moved when the credits rolled."
"Jun 15, 2019",negative," Somehow, Legendary Pictures found a way to totally muck up the greatest Godzilla premise ever with Godzilla: King of the Monsters, a movie that is all things great and terrible at the same time. This movie has some terrific monster battles in it, and the special effects are mind-bogglingly good. Godzilla squares off against such legendary foes as multiheaded Monster Zero and Rodan, while getting some much needed assistance from the great Mothra. All of these monsters, including the title character, are wonders to behold when on screen. As for the internet bitching about the movie’s appearance being dark and murky, I think the darkness was fitting, made things scarier, and didn’t diminish the effects. But, and this is a big but, I cannot endorse this movie overall. The human stuff in between and during the fighting is dreadful. Homo sapiens get too much screen time. The writing and staging for that screen time is so bad that the film derails every time it goes to military types in a war room. The plot has the world in a state of disarray after the 2014 attacks on San Francisco and Las Vegas depicted in the last Godzilla movie. OK, that’s kind of cool. How do we dust ourselves off and find a way to coexist with the likes of Godzilla and big monster moth things after the decimation of the Bay Area? Apparently, according to writer-director Michael Dougherty (Krampus), we deliver inane dialogue real slow-like, and inexplicably play with a sonar gadget that supposedly calls out to the monsters in a manner that either chills them out or fires them up. That gadget is created by Dr. Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga), who lost a child in the San Francisco attack and is attempting to talk to the monsters with her daughter (Millie Bobby Brown), while Dr. Russell’s husband, Mark (Kyle Chandler), is off taking pictures on safari. Once the gadget thing sends out a call that basically kicks off the monster apocalypse, the action goes from nicely staged monster battles featuring beautiful close ups and battered landscapes, to a bunch of lost actors sitting around in a situation room observing and commenting. Bradley Whitford basically gets the Jake Johnson-in-Jurassic World role. That is, he’s the nerdy guy cracking wise from afar while monsters eat people and military folks scratch their heads. While Johnson had crack line delivery and some honestly funny moments, Whitford looks like the victim of a director who said, “Hey, Bradley, say some funny shit about monsters!” and Whitford had nothing. Brown is OK here, but there’s not much one can do with material so bad. She has the movie’s dopiest moment. When fleeing Monster Zero as it’s destroying Fenway Park, Godzilla comes up behind her, and she turns and posts a calm, satisfied smile. No paralyzing fear, no screaming in terror at being in between two massive charging monsters. Just one, calm, movie star smile, because Godzilla might be her friend or some shit like that. Give me a break. Brown has already completed her shots for Godzilla vs. Kong, due out next year, so she’s not escaping this franchise. Dougherty, who messed this movie up, had low grade, OK horror films (Krampus, Trick ’r Treat) on his resume. The next film’s director, Adam Wingard, is also a director of horror films (You’re Next and the awful Blair Witch reboot). Also, Dougherty, who co-wrote this messy movie, contributes on the next film as well. Not good signs. Perhaps Legendary should stop putting large blockbusters such as this into the hands of relatively new and mediocre horror film directors. They got it right with Gareth Edwards on Godzilla (2014). They blew it with Dougherty, and I fear for the future. If you are uninitiated, as I was, this movie will come off as a useless blur. If you love you some Pokémon, perhaps you won’t hate it."
"Jun 15, 2019",neutral,"It is all one monster mash with humans running around hysterically while spouting lines in no discernible plot. How in the world did Kyle Chandler, V]era Farmiga and Millie Bobby Brown end up in this mess!"

"Jun 10, 2019",positive," While not as thematically rich as its predecessor, Godzilla: King of the Monsters dials up the Kaiju action as it delivers stunning visual action sequences and awe inspiring Godzilla moments that will please most fans.  Godzilla: King of the Monsters stars Kyle Chandler as Mark Russell,  Vera Farmiga as Dr. Emma Russell, Millie Bobby Brown as Madison Russell and Ken Watanabe as Dr. Ishiro Serizawa. Directed by Michael Dougherty and distributed by Warner Bros, Godzilla: King of the Monsters is the direct sequel to 2014’s Godzilla and the followup to 2017’s Kong: Skull Island. Part of the wider MonsterVerse, Godzilla: King of the Monsters tells the story of the fallout of 2014’s Godzilla and how characters have changed due to the climactic event, how the world reacts to Titans and the wider implications of Godzilla’s place on the Earth.  One of the reasons why 2014’s Godzilla was praised was Gareth Edwards’ commitment to showing Godzilla from a human perspective. Making his presence feel larger than life and only using him a limited amount was effective but left more to be desired from longtime Kaiju fans. Godzilla: King of the Monsters takes the opposite approach to this. Instead of focusing on the human element and the interaction between man and Godzilla, this time the Titans have motivations of their own as they battle for control of the Earth to either protect it, or destroy it. While the human characters end up suffering because of this, fans of Godzilla won’t care much as the titans are firmly put in the forefront to the story and the action superseded the plot.  The true ‘king’ of Godzilla: King of the Monsters are the Titans themselves. Godzilla, Mothra, Ghidorah and Rodan all shine and have stunning moments accompanied with a strong score and almost impeccable VFX work. From the icy terrain of the arctic rain soaked battles in Boston, Godzilla: King of the Monsters lets the Titans roam free and in turn provide a stunning backdrop for the Titians to do what they do best, destruct. The chief battle of the film is between the Apex predators of Godzilla and King Ghidorah. Ghidorah, who can command the other Titans of Earth to destroy while Godzilla commands them to save the Earth causes a strong sense of tension and drama between these mythic beasts. Pleasant surprises of the film included Mothra, whose Wonder Woman like entrances and moments highlight some of the best moments of the film. Godzilla: King of the Monsters is firmly rooted in a larger cinematic world involving these Titans. The third film in what looks to be a 4 film story, Godzilla: King of the Monsters sets up a lot of seeds for the franchise’s future, namely for 2020’s Godzilla vs. Kong. While it does succeed in planting the threads to which the future films will spin off of, one can hope that the future films will keep the human plot threads to an even greater minimum and just let Kong and Godzilla run the show in the IMAX spectacle it is meant to be.  Overall, Godzilla: King of the Monsters is a solid summer blockbuster experience. In a world where superhero franchises are king and other blockbusters have trouble finding their footing, Godzilla: King of the Monsters has the potential to possibly add another player to the battle for King of the Blockbusters."
"Jun 10, 2019",positive," Godzilla: King of the Monsters will satisfy those  looking for a giant-sized monster bash, yet it’s the human element that weighs  down this colossal titan from becoming king of the monster movie. The relationship between man and beast has always been  vital in the giant monster movie genre. One cannot think of King Kong without Fay Wray coming to mind as well. The reason is obvious: these colossal  creatures – although intimidating and awe-inspiring – do not drive a story or give  it any depth. They are the superstar player on the champion winning team. Yet  that team goes nowhere without those role players putting in the grunt work. There  is no terror if the stakes – primal, emotional, human – are not in play. For Godzilla:  King of the Monsters, those stakes are minimal at best.  That is not to say that a good show cannot be presented.  Directed by Michael Dougherty (Krampus) this second instalment in  Legendary Films Godzilla reboot franchise is as spectacularly big and loud  as they come, a blockbuster in name and size that features our favourite  rampaging titans throwing down with wild abandon, setting up a shared universe  with a promise of Godzilla v King Kong down the road. But then the humans start talking. Yes, there is nothing like  the domestic first world problems of an incredibly dysfunctional family to put  a damper on the glory of watching a nuclear fuelled lizard monster take on a  three headed dragon alien giant. This “human” element is like a pesky infection  attacking its host. The personification of this is found in the Russell family,  consisting of shouty angry scientist dad Mark (Kyle Chandler), quiet yet  manipulative scientist mum Emma (Vera Farmiga), and emotionally confused  teenage wannabe scientist Madison (Milly Bobby Brown). Their squabble is over  an invention that can control the mind and mood of these colossal creatures  battling for dominion of the Earth, which is in the hands of eco-terrorist  Jonah Alan (Charles Dance in automatic villain mode). Rounding out the human  cast is Ken Wattanabe as kaigu expert/groupie Ishiro; David Strathairn and his cement  faced scowl; and a blink and you will miss her Sally Hawkins.  The human drama sub-plot is not only forgettable, but annoying  in its distraction from the real show on offer: super-duper giant monsters laying  waste to one another and the world. It is here that Godzilla: King of the  Monsters is a success. Doughtery, along with the VFX wizards from the Moving  Picture Company (among others), and an excellent sound team deliver giant-sized  action set pieces that will rattle-bones and make mouths a-gap. Godzilla has never  looked as ferocious, and a plethora of iconic monster characters (including Mothra  and King Ghidorah) all make an impact both frightful and stunning. A shared universe is in place here, and there is much potential  for it to be good. All is needed is for those pesky humans to sit a few rounds  out, and let these titans do what they do. "
"Jun 9, 2019",negative," Clarification: this Godzilla bears little resemblance to the iconic sci-fi creature called “Gojira” that Ishiro Honda and his Japanese collaborators created in 1954 as a warning against nuclear proliferation after the horrific W.W.II bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Now a CGI Godzilla and a number of other Titans emerge from the briny deep as a result of climate change. While we’re causing our own ecological extinction, these prehistoric creatures, hiding in remote spots around the world, might just the Earth’s only hope for restoring balance – whatever that means. These sites are guarded by Monarch, a well-funded scientific organization. Testifying before a Congressional committee, crypto-zoologist Ishiro Serizawa (Ken Watanabe) insists that these creatures have existed on Earth longer than humans and they are, perhaps, the rightful rulers of the planet. His view is supported by scientist Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga), whose husband Mark (Kyle Chandler) became an alcoholic after their son was killed during Godzilla’s San Francisco rampage. Retaining custody of their daughter Madison (Millie Bobby Brown), Emma has built the Orca, a sonic device that can lure Titans by imitating their audible calls. As soon as it effectively awakens larval Queen Mothra from her cocoon, the machine is stolen by sneering eco-terrorists led by Jonah Alan (Charles Dance), who kidnaps Emma and Maddy. Coming to his senses, leaving a Colorado wolf preserve, Mark is now even more determined to kill Godzilla, et al. Relentless chaos reigns as Godzilla proves he’s a friend to mankind, ultimately battling King Ghidora, a ferocious three-headed dragon, part of an invasive species from beyond our galaxy. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, “Godzilla: King of the Monsters” stomps in with a fiery, fearsome 4 – MonsterVerse franchise fodder, heading toward Godzilla’s confrontation with Skull Island’s giant gorilla King Kong."

FILM REVIEW – GODZILLA: KING OF THE MONSTERS. With Kyle Chandler, Vera Farmiga, Millie Bobby Brown, Bradley Whitford, Charles Dance. Written by Michael Dougherty & Zach Shields. Directed by Michael Dougherty. Rated PG-13 for sequences of monster action violence and destruction, and for some language. 131 minutes.  There are some interesting ideas and strong actors playing around in GODZILLA: KING OF THE MONSTERS, but they’re doomed trying to compete against Godzilla, just like the kaiju alumni he battles. (Kaiju is the name for the Japanese genre of giant monster movies.) The result is a movie that probably could have been much shorter, since we’re really only there for the special effects. Dr. Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga) is a scientist working on a project dealing with the giant monsters, whom she believes are an important part of Earth’s ecosystem. At the start of the film, she and her daughter Madison (Millie Bobby Brown of “Stranger Things”) are kidnapped by a mysterious terrorist group led by Jonah Allen (Charles Dance). The government turns to her ex-husband Mark (Kyle Chandler), who had abandoned the project she’s continued, to help find her. He’s more concerned with rescuing his daughter. It turns out the terrorists are looking to unleash Mothra, Rodan, and the three-headed King Ghidora to lay waste to civilization. Who can battle such creatures? Why it’s Godzilla, who has appeared in various forms in Japanese cinema – many of which have made it to the U.S., although the original “Gojira” (1954) was re-edited with added scenes featuring American actors. The film plays with environmental issues and family psychodrama, and even has some well-known characters actors in small roles like Bradley Whitford, Joe Morton, CCH Pounder, Sally Hawkins, and David Strathairn. None of it really matters. The thin script ties up most of the loose ends, while leaving a few threads for a sequel, including the promised showdown with King Kong, which is teased here as it was at the end of “Kong: Skull Island” (2017). The problem is that the appearance of four giant monsters leaves less time for plot and character development, which gave “Skull” its flavor. Here you just want to sit back and enjoy the monsters. There are nods to the earlier films – such as the twins associated with Mothra – but it’s all just marking time until the main event, which is Godzilla battling King Ghidorah at Fenway Park. Yes, that’s right. Dr. Russell’s home base is Boston and the device used to lure the monsters is broadcast over the public address system at the stadium, using the open-air park as a giant transmitting dish. Some effort went into making Fenway look like the real thing, but once the monsters start trashing Boston it looks more like a generic city than any specific location. Daniel M.

"Jun 8, 2019",negative," Gareth Edward’s 2014 Godzilla was pretty good. It wasn’t bad. Not excellent but better than Matthew Broderick in the rain. It caught some flak for holding back on the titular beast and instead opting for a human story – and killing Bryan Cranston off pretty quickly too. Now, Trick ‘r Treat director Michael Dougherty takes the chair for this follow up in the Monsterverse that boasted a stunning marketing campaign and the promise of more monsters! The trailers depicted this visually outstanding epic – honestly, some of the trailer shots looked like pure paintings – and Godzilla: King of the Monsters rocketed up people’s hype lists (also piggybacking off of the success of peer Kong: Skull Island). Unfortunately for ‘Zilla fans and for Michael Dougherty – Godzilla: KOTM is awful. It’s really not good which is a massive shame as I was one of those who was amped for this. A lack of Godzilla itself is a claim that cannot be levelled at this movie - he’s everywhere - shooting that blue flame stuff at anything that gets in his way – and his massive monster friends and foes are along for the ride – King Ghidorah (a three-headed dragon beast), Rodan (a flying beast) and Mothra (a giant…moth). The beasties themselves look great and, unsurprisingly, deliver the highlights of the movie with their titanic battles – Ghidorah especially was ace – the problem is this time the humans are side-lined completely and become simple plot devices. Everyone is underdeveloped or stereotyped and, to be honest, I wasn’t bothered if they got chomped or not. Kyle Chandler is the limpest hero committed to screen in a long time, Vera Farmiga had dollar signs in her eyes and Millie Bobby Brown became more annoying as the movie rolled on (that facial overacting was something else). The company behind it all, Monarch (they track own all the titans and have done since 2014’s Godzilla), now just seem like a collection of Austin Powers baddies in their lair and are on Jurassic World-levels of uninteresting villains and corporations. With all of that, I doubt it’ll come as a surprise to know that the writing throughout is atrocious – to the point where the characters literally spell out what is happening. It’s mind-numbing even for a movie like this. One of the soldiers delivered the line “What the f*** is that?!” upon Ghidorah’s intro and it was probably the best acting/delivery in the movie. When the subpar dialogue is mixed with overly-long CGI fights, things get very tedious very quickly. The majority of the action is just fine, but by the end, it stretched out for too long and became almost boring. Whilst the score was good, Godzilla: KOTM is a prominent case of style over substance. Things look great but there’s nothing to cling to behind the visuals. Three movies into this Monsterverse and we’re at an impasse. Godzilla was decent, Kong: Skull Island, too, was decent and this was awful. So, next up? Godzilla vs. Kong in 2020. Despite Godzilla: KOTM being a toilet blocker, it’s hard not to get just a wee bit excited at that title, however, can they balance the human drama with the all-out action? We’ll see and Adam Wingard is tasked with the job (eek…). Surely it can’t be any worse than this massive let down. Bigger isn’t always better and that’s absolutely the case with this monstrous disappointment."
"Jun 8, 2019",negative," When it comes to the cinema of the 2010s, the 2014 Godzilla is The Manchurian Candidate of my moviegoing experience. I know I saw it — I have the review right here in front of me — but damn if I can recall any of the particulars. In the immortal words of that esteemed 20th century philosopher Curly Howard, “I’m trying to think but nothing happens!” Yet if I scrunch my brain really hard, I vaguely recall Aaron Taylor-Johnson as a particularly boring hero, Bryan Cranston as his grumpy dad, and a Godzilla whose pot belly suggested he had spent the past few years guzzling Kirin Ichiban or Sapporo Draft while lounging on the ocean floor. Nothing else surfaces beyond that, although I do remember it being superior to 1998’s terrible Godzilla vs. Ferris Bueller, in which the oversized lizard was no match for Matthew Broderick’s incessant schtick. Indeed, glancing over my review of the ’14 model, it appears I mildly enjoyed it but found no compelling reason to see it again. I expect to hold a similar reaction to Godzilla: King of the Monsters, the latest in the MonsterVerse (Christ, what a daft name) franchise that began with the 2014 Godzilla and continued with 2017’s Kong: Skull Island. It’s fairly engaging in the moment, but there’s absolutely no reason to ever want to revisit it. Like all films of this nature, the real battle isn’t between the monsters duking it out with each other but between the excitement of the creature-feature scenes and the banality of the copious sequences focusing on the human protagonists. It isn’t always a losing battle: In the 1954 classic Gojira (the original Japanese version, not the depoliticized 1956 American edit released as Godzilla, King of the Monsters!), the segments centering on the humans were charged with the picture’s overriding theme of nuclear devastation, lending urgency to the plight of a people coping with the aftermath of Hiroshima and Nagasaki less than 10 years removed from the bombing. Godzilla would morph from villain to hero in later series installments — heck, he would even sire a baby boy named Minilla (not to be confused with the equally nauseating Milli Vanilli) — but here in Gojira, the title behemoth is collectively Fat Man and Little Boy, and his towering presence over Tokyo triggers a queasy flashback for the city’s citizens. With the 2014 Godzilla and now Godzilla: King of the Monsters, there’s an effort to add import to the human sequences by invoking global warming, overpopulation and other manmade disasters at every turn. But it never sticks the landing as effectively as the nuclear angle in the original, largely because the filmmakers spend too much time on personal relationships that aren’t very compelling. In 2014, it was Taylor-Johnson’s soldier and Cranston’s activist; now, it’s Kyle Chandler’s Mark Russell and Vera Farmiga’s Emma Russell, a divorced couple whose marriage was destroyed following the death of their young son during the monsters’ rampage five years ago. Mark has gone off grid while Emma looks after their daughter Madison (Millie Bobby Brown) even as she works on a device that she hopes will allow humans to control the Titans (i.e. Godzilla and the planet’s other ancient gods). Employed by the monster-watch outfit Monarch, Emma is kidnapped by eco-terrorist Alan Jonah (Charles Dance), which leads Monarch scientists Ishiro Serizawa and Vivienne Grahame (returning actors Ken Watanabe and Sally Hawkins) to contact Mark in order to fashion a rescue attempt. What happens next is a betrayal so ludicrous that, when one character yells at the turncoat, “You’re out of your mind!” they should instead be yelling, “You’re an absolute imbecile!” since the plan that’s put into motion (and the reasons behind it) is beyond moronic. Nevertheless, this plot pirouette largely triggers the critter skirmishes that involve Godzilla and other kaiju such as Mothra, Rodan, and the all-powerful King Ghidorah. Ever since my youth, when I first caught him in the 1968 all-star creature romp Destroy All Monsters, the three-headed Ghidorah always struck me as the most dynamic of all Toho grotesqueries. His appearance in Godzilla: King of the Monsters does not disappoint, and he remains a terrifying entity. The CGI work on display in this picture is particularly robust, with all of the marquee monsters rendered in stunning fashion. And when they get ready to rumble, there’s enough body-slamming, head-biting, and limb-twisting to satisfy all kaiju groupies (and, presumably, wrestling devotees as well). Indeed, fans of Godzilla: King of the Monsters will praise the picture for its monster-on-monster action, and they’ll be correct. But detractors will condemn it for its human interludes, and they’ll be equally right. A bingo card of clichés would quickly be filled with such soggy lines as “We opened Pandora’s box, and there’s no way to shut it” and “It sounds like you admire these monsters,” and drab characters like a stammering scientist (Thomas Middleditch) and a wisecracking scientist (Bradley Whitford) add nothing to the proceedings. When it focuses on the marquee attractions, Godzilla: King of the Monsters roars to life. At all other times, it’s merely Godzilla with a zzzz."

"Jun 7, 2019",negative," There's no rushing a Joanna Hogg movie—the making or the watching. After a six-year hiatus, the English auteur hits a career peak with The Souvenir, an oblique study in heartbreak she says has gestated for 30 years. In 1980 Sunderland, England, film student Julie (Honor Swinton Byrne) meets Foreign Office suit Anthony (Tom Burke). He's somewhere between a mysterious stranger and a haughty bore, but evolves their relationship from tea conversants to roommates to lovers all the same. Swinton Byrne (daughter of the great Tilda, who plays Julie's mother in the film) gives an admirably earnest performance, but Burke is upsettingly good, turning on the charm after long spells of avoiding eye contact and spouting empty rationalizations for why he needs to move in or borrow 10 quid. It's a toxic relationship, yet The Souvenir probably wouldn't abide that more political diagnosis. It's told from so close up that dramatic irony around Anthony lying and Julie enabling hovers only on the edge of consciousness. Alluded to in some weaker art school scenes, The Souvenir is intended as a patchwork of memory, not a document. This side-door approach is as elusive and dissatisfying as revealing and true. Experiences are not life lessons until they're over. R. CHANCE SOLEM-PFEIFER. Clackamas, Fox Tower. Coming so closely on the endlessly bedazzled platform heels of Bohemian Rhapsody by the same director (Dexter Fletcher), Rocketman follows a familiar '70s-steeped music industry biopic blueprint: monster of pop rock towers over the monoculture despite a semi-closeted homosexuality that seems in retrospect glaringly obvious. If the film's biggest laugh comes from Elton (Taron Egerton) swaggering down a shadowy corridor in full Fire Island demon regalia ready to rock…a Narcotics Anonymous meeting, its best joke might just be the heart-shaped, rose-colored frames he wears throughout a subsequent vividly authorized 120-minute confessional in which all public embarrassments and career misfires are blamed on the eventual disappearance of Mom, Dad, manager/boyfriend and hairline. Elton's only successful relationship, we're reminded again and again, has been with long-suffering, lyricist-for-life Bernie Taupin (Jamie Bell), which also neatly explains away the film's greatest failings—don't expect anything more than a jukebox musical outlining the piano player's true-ish story. To its credit, Rocketman seems to understand the gossamer-thin origins were always of far less importance than the tunes collected along the way. Scenes of middling interest repeatedly give way to all-singing, all-dancing dramatizations of that platinum songbook, but expertly unlocking the MGM-styled schmaltz within the heart of its subject does not justify the existence of such a laborious vanity project.

Trudging along in the milewide reboot steps of 2014's dully reverent Godzilla and 2017 shoot-'em-up Kong: Skull Island, this third installment of Legendary's ever-more-creaky MonsterVerse franchise introduces an undercard of supporting kaiju for the once and future lizard king to trounce en route to next spring's throne match against the great ape. Alas, even as an empty spectacle intended solely to focus attention on the coming main event—Godzilla: Don King of the Monsters?—the results never satisfy. There's a nervous energy bristling throughout that seems wholly separate from the, y'know, ongoing planetary destruction continually dismissed as either logistical puzzle, ecological mission bleed, or too-apropos metaphor for the familial hurdles bedeviling estranged parents/bio-audio techs Kyle Chandler and Vera Farmiga along with their precocious daughter Millie Bobby Brown—i.e., Coach Taylor, Norma Bates and Stranger Things' Eleven. While disaster flicks of every stripe have long cast small-screen staples in recognizable parts to paper over plot holes, so many familiar faces are asked to flesh out such negligible characters that the first act plays like a fever dream of recap sequences sewn together from unconnected shows. Had cult horror-steeped director Michael Dougherty been just a shade less invested in arguing the teleological value of our New Testament Godzilla, a daft popcorn epic could've been forged from the sheer cavalcade of stream-worthy icons (Charles Dance, Thomas Middleditch, Bradley Whitford) encountering second-tier big bads (Rodan, Ghidorah, Mothra) amid forbidding environs from Atlantis to Antarctica to the Red Sox's storied ballpark. When Fenway hosts the climactic battle of a Godzilla without anyone mentioning the Green Monster, hasn't mankind already lost? PG-13. JAY HORTON.

"Jun 7, 2019",neutral,Godzilla itself looked incredible...but too much humans...
"Jun 7, 2019",negative," Making a serious Godzilla film must be a difficult task. The lumbering nuclear-powered monster works better as an icon and - ironically - in small bites. It does not help that while you get a lot more monster action than before, the key lesson from five years ago has yet to sink in: We do not care about the human drama. We want Godzilla versus Ghidorah, not Godzilla versus Kramer versus Kramer. Aside from poor scripting, it also doesn't help that there are too many human characters. Then there are many dangling plot threads such as Zhang Ziyi suddenly having a twin only for it to never be mentioned again. It is a simple premise where lifelong friends fall out after their first time, only to reunite years later when their lives are going in different directions. And yet, this feels like a fresh take on the genre. While the finale is a tad too cheese-tinged, overall this is warm, funny and hits the note every Netflix film should strive for: Why didn't this get a theatrical release?"
"Jun 7, 2019",negative," For more than six decades, almost every Godzilla film has ended pretty much the same way. But at least the original Japanese efforts conveyed a campy rudimentary charm that made them distinct. The latest incarnation of the franchise, which began five years ago and continues with GODZILLA: KING OF THE MONSTERS, is merely a derivative example of spectacle trumping substance, filling the screen with incoherent mayhem while taking itself way too seriously. In the story, people take a backseat to the massive monsters, headed by Godzilla, who emerged as an ally for humanity in the prior film. He fills the same role here, thanks to the hubris of a collection of scientists known as Monarch, an organization tasked with keeping Earth safe from Titans. Among them are a paleobiologist (Vera Farmiga) and her preteen daughter (Millie Bobby Brown), whose efforts to spawn a new Titan larva named Mothra are interrupted by an eco-terrorist (Charles Dance) with sinister plans. Soon afterward, ancient predatory beasts are awakened from the ocean floor, including the three-headed fire-breathing adversary Ghidorah, leading to failed military efforts to contain them. As the hapless humans flail away by land, sea, and air with weaponry large and small, Godzilla emerges as the only hope for restoring peace. As you’d expect, KING OF THE MONSTERS contains some impressive action set pieces and some imaginative creature renderings. However, like its predecessor, this Godzilla movie needs a rooting interest, either in the resilient humans or in the beasts trying to wreak havoc. Instead, the screenplay by Zach Shields and director Michael Dougherty (Krampus) offers little incentive for emotional engagement, opting instead to repeatedly flaunt its technical prowess and big-budget effects — masking its lack of narrative integrity and scientific logic with constant chaos. Only a few of the actors from the first film’s multicultural ensemble are back on the payroll here, with the understanding that humankind’s collective brains and brawn is feeble as the oversized reptiles unleash their obligatory pattern of destruction with the future of the planet in the balance. Of course, there’s little creative justification for this follow-up, which hardly advances the Godzilla mythology in any meaningful way. Aside from box-office aspirations, the intent is to set the stage for the next pre-planned franchise tentpole in two years, during which our amphibious hero will again prove indestructible."
"Jun 7, 2019",negative,"Jarringly choppy, under-developed and relentlessly cliched, the material underserves its fine cast of actors and never creates anything terribly meaningful from its titanic line-up of creatures."
"Jun 7, 2019",positive,Godzilla remains a political monster.
"Jun 7, 2019",neutral," Five years after Godzilla levelled half of San Francisco, an outpost for the global monster-monitoring outfit Monarch is attacked: scientist Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga) and her daughter Madison (Millie Bobby Brown) are kidnapped along with Russell’s experimental device ORCA, which can communicate and even influence giant monsters. Once this technology is used to awaken the three-headed dragon Ghidorah, it sparks off a rise of multiple ‘titans’ including the volcanic bird Rodan, the giant insect Mothra, and the return of Godzilla himself. 2014’s giant monster remake Godzilla finally gets a sequel in writer/director Michael Dougherty’s explosive, messy, and effects-driven effort Godzilla: King of the Monsters. Proving that sometimes more actually is more, this faulty and uneven effort does benefit from the increase in named ‘kaiju’ in terms of upping the action and improving the all-round quality of the film. It still does not manage to successfully develop a must-see Summer blockbuster, but it does at least pick up the pace compared to Gareth Edward’s pedestrian effort. The same overall problems do remain, however, just in a less egregious fashion. Writing remains the Achilles’ heel, with a relatively silly narrative and risible dialogue interspersed between the expected scenes of giant monster mayhem. Doherty and Zach Shields’ script shifts the human focus from a separated family to… well, okay, to another separated family, but this time they do come better framed within an ensemble of Monarch employees racing to contain a worldwide crisis. Plotwise the film takes itself much less seriously than its predecessor, which is a positive sign, but what replaces that dour take is still badly under-motivated and poorly expressed. Charles Dance plays a radical eco-terrorist: we know this because other characters say he is, and he is given no real opportunity to demonstrate this or suitably reveal his motives. Other characters are saddled with the most stereotypical of motivations. A surprise development at the end of the first act sees one trusted character be revealed as a villain. This is a bold move, but said character spends the first 30 minutes as an audience viewpoint and as a result the twist jars badly. Other characters undertake numerous actions to push the plot forward, but there is no internal motivation that quite makes sense. The result is a terribly messy story that collapses under scrutiny. There should be a question asked every time a scene of the human characters is written: is this scene more interesting than Godzilla punching a giant monster in the face? If the answer is no, then the scene really should be replaced with a better one – or it needs to step out of the way and let the monster fight take control. There are essentially three key scenes of monsters fighting here, which feels like more than in the 2014 Godzilla – indeed more than several other Godzilla films – yet the paucity of strong human scenes still make it feel like are being under-served. Fans of giant monster movies will not have come to the film for a human story, of course. Dougherty frames his four monster protagonists brilliantly. Tom Woodruff’s revised designs for each are exceptionally good, and they are captured in atmospheric and dynamic ways from scene to scene. The sound design is particularly brilliant, returning Godzilla’s own roars to the 1954 Japanese original and finding freshened takes on Rodan, Ghidorah, and Mothra at the same time. The film’s main draws – devastating battles between the titans – are distinctive and inventive. Dougherty has been given an almost unfair task in taking the deliberately fantastical and ridiculous set of monster characters, and giving them a sense of realism and weight. I am a particularly keen fan of Mothra, and had doubted any director’s ability to faithfully reconcile the more serious tone of American cinema with a rainbow-coloured giant moth, but Dougherty marvellously succeeds. The same goes with Ghidorah: a three-headed gold alien dragon that has never seemed so terrifying. They are shot from dynamic, powerful angles, and they have a palpable weight and power to them. Here is the ultimate problem though, and it addresses not only the bad screenplay but also the film’s commercially disappointing performance in cinemas: all three American attempts to develop a Godzilla feature (1998, 2014, and 2019) have suffered from being mainstream ‘tentpole’ releases. Godzilla is iconic, but the character’s actual films are comparatively niche. They do boast a healthy, dedicated audience of fans in Japan, but they have never been what Hollywood professionals describe as ‘four-quadrant’ hits – films appealing to men and women both young and old. Godzilla: Final Wars (2004) was only the 44th highest grossing film of its year in Japan. Shin Godzilla (2016) fared much better, only topped by the anime Your Name and grossing US$75 million in Japanese cinemas, but it was also the first home-grown Godzilla picture in 12 years and brought a resonant element of social satire with it. Conversely, the American Godzilla films are bankrolled to the equivalent of Star Wars and The Avengers. They are structured and financed as four-quadrant blockbusters, yet broadly retain the same style and narrative conventions of their Japanese cousins. They are being advertised as big screen epics without epic storylines. Put simply: Warner Bros is spending too much money. Budgeted at $60 million, and the story quirks and weak characters would not stand out so visibly. Budgeted at three times that, and the studio is simply setting itself up for failure. Godzilla: King of the Monsters is definitely a disappointing film, but it is not about what was delivered, which is simply a particularly pretty replica of a Japanese equivalent, but what the studio continues to promise. What is needed here is not reproduction, but rather reinvention: an American-targeted Godzilla film rebuilt from the ground up. We tried that already. It did not go well. In fact, it went so poorly, Toho bought the rights to it just so they could have Godzilla absolutely trash it in Final Wars."
"Jun 6, 2019",positive,"The actual battles are highly satisfactory, even if no one gets to shout, ""Destroy all monsters!"""
"Jun 6, 2019",positive," 2014’s Godzilla was a bit of a mess. It was often grainy and unintelligible to watch, and with the exception of a couple of notable supporting actors (Ken Watanabe, Sally Hawkins, and Juliette Binoche), it had a largely unexciting cast that never really captured audiences. It also, somewhat shockingly, had surprisingly little actual Godzilla in it — by most estimates, there were no more than nine minutes of the monster shown in the entire 123-minute runtime. It’s a film I enjoyed watching because it’s a Godzilla movie, though not necessarily because it’s a good movie. Since then, we’ve had a rousing, exciting King Kong movie in Kong: Skull Island that seemed to promise a broader, more monster-heavy future for the franchise, now in the hands of Legendary Pictures and titled the “Monsterverse.” It took a little bit, but now they’re back with Godzilla: King of the Monsters, and they’ve clearly taken some of those criticisms to heart. The new film, despite being a good deal more apocalyptic than its predecessor, is also a good bit more fun. This is no surprise considering that director and co-writer Michael Dougherty cut his teeth with the sublime Trick ‘R Treat, and it made the film significantly more enjoyable. But there’s also a feeling of desperation to the production, as if they wanted to overload on everything to try to compensate for the weaknesses of its predecessors. Unlikable leads? We’ve got that covered! We brought in everyone — Kyle Chandler, Vera Farmiga, Bradley Whitford, Millie Bobby Brown, Tywin Lannister, Thomas Middleditch, O’Shea Jackson Jr., Zhang Ziyi, Aisha Hinds, in addition to the returning Watanabe, Hawkins, and David Strathairn. The film is packed with characters, and given its nonstop action, this has the unfortunate side effect of the audience never really getting to know any of them. Yes, you learn about the family dynamic between divorced scientists Mark and Emma Russell (Chandler and Farmiga) and their daughter Maddie (Brown, who is terrific here). But everyone else is essentially defined by a few lines of clever dialogue, which is a shame when you have that strong a set of actors to play with. That’s not to knock the action, which is constant and almost exhausting. But it does almost feel like overcorrection. There was a certain degree of nuance to the first film, a more contemplative style that was well-used by its director (Gareth Edwards, Monsters, Rogue One). This one? Hell no. It’s a cacophonous horse race from the get-go, and at 132 minutes, that sometimes feels like a long-ass race. The plot is a wild one, featuring the reappearance of the shadowy monster-seeking organization Monarch, government interference, murderous eco-terrorists, weird technology that relies on bio-accoustics, and everything else in-between. The long and short of it is that the various “titans” of the world have been long dormant, but are either waking up, or being woken up. These monsters respond to an “alpha”, and the problem that humanity faces is which alpha will they follow — the benevolent-if-terrifying Godzilla? Or the malevolent, more terrifying Ghidorah, a three-headed, two-tailed behemoth that seems determined to reduce the world to ashes. What follows is a series of harrowing scenes of devastation, as the monsters rampage across the world and trash everything in their path. Entire cities are laid to waste, while the agents of Monarch try desperately to figure out how to stop them, leading them to inevitably try to team up with Godzilla. There’s a lot happening, story-wise, and unfortunately, a good bit of it is either superfluous or needlessly complex. There’s a Maguffin of a suitcase that holds the key to everything, and it’s chased around the globe alongside the monsters themselves. But despite all this chaos and mayhem, King of the Monsters manages to be surprisingly fun. Kudos to Whitford, Middleditch and Jackson for keeping things occasionally light, a nice compliment to the relentless and often overwrought seriousness that Chandler brings to the table — they make things fun even if you never really get to know them. But more importantly, the film feels like more of a loving throwback to the Toho classics than the first film, as if a bit more of that spirit was present. If it sounds contradictory — this juxtaposition of global apocalypse with enjoyable romp — it is. And it is at times difficult to reconcile. The fact is that over the course of the film, literal millions probably die, and it’s hard to think of that as “fun”. But at the same time, it’s also … giant monsters. Like, GIANT monsters. And they’re beautifully rendered and animated, with stunning sounds and fluid movements, engaged in well-choreographed battles that feel real. The film is absolutely gorgeous, using far more color this time around, and not filmed exclusively on rainy nights and all of this keeps it engaging and at times, even enthralling. Yet at the end, I feel I must repeat — sort of — what I said earlier about the first film. I think there’s joy to be found in Godzilla: King of the Monsters because it’s a very good Godzilla film (and definitely superior to the 2014 film). Yet I’m not certain how much love it will garner for those who aren’t fans of the big greenie. It’s exciting and there’s a strange loveliness to be found amidst all the bedlam that these monsters wreak. But it also feels quite bleak at times, and it’ll be up to the individual viewer to reconcile those things. Those of you who grew up with Creature Double Features, who yearn to see these new incarnations of Godzilla, Mothra, Ghidora and their ilk back on the screen? I think you’ll be pleasantly surprised.

"Jun 6, 2019",positive," Five years after Godzilla defeated the MUTOs in San Francisco and reduced a sizable portion of the city to rubble, crypto-zoological agency Monarch is on the verge of being put under United States military control. But before that can happen, scientist Dr. Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga) and her teenage daughter Madison (Millie Bobby Brown) have been kidnapped by the unscrupulous Jonah Alan (Charles Dance) and his band of mercenaries. Their goal is to awaken the god-like monsters, dubbed Titans, Monarch has been studying around the globe from their slumber, believing that the destruction and carnage these creatures leave in their wake will help the Earth heal from centuries of misuse on the part of the human race. But their list includes the mysterious Monster Zero, also known as Ghidorah, a three-headed behemoth who may not be of this world, and instead of restoring the natural balance this vicious beast’s goal might just be the complete eradication of all of humanity. Monarch scientist Dr. Ishiro Serizawa (Ken Watanabe) enlists Dr. Russell’s estranged ex-husband Mark (Kyle Chandler) to assist him in the search for the kidnapped mother and daughter. He understands her work better than anyone, so the feeling of Dr. Serizawa and his trusted fellow scientist Dr. Vivienne Graham (Sally Hawkins) is that he is their best option to stop to Alan from awakening these Titans. But his resolute hatred of Godzilla, potentially the only creature capable of destroying Ghidorah, could prove to be a catastrophic roadblock for the Monarch team, Mark blaming the kingly creature for the death of his son in San Francisco five years prior. I thoroughly enjoyed director Michael Dougherty’s Godzilla: King of the Monsters. It made me smile. That does not mean I think it is as memorably great as Gareth Edwards’ 2014 hit Godzilla which birthed this so-called “Monsterverse” for Warner Bros, or that it is as giddily enjoyable as Jordan Vogt-Roberts’ 2017 adventure Kong: Skull Island proved to be. It also cannot hold a candle to Ishirô Honda’s 1954 Japanese classic that started this giant monster craze 65 years ago, that magnificent motion picture standing the test of time something fierce. But Dougherty, the mind behind inventive low budget horror gems Krampus and Trick ‘r Treat, has an obvious affinity for the Toho Studios creatures, and not just the titular star. Along with Ghidorah both the usually benevolent Mothra and the fiery Rodan are also utilized here, the director showcasing all four in action with consummate skill. Rodan’s entrance is particularly fantastic, the pterodactyl-like monster birthed from inside a Mexican volcano and subsequently proceeds to lay waste to an entire village with blistering fury before finding itself in conflict with both Godzilla and Ghidorah out in the middle of the ocean. It’s a stunning sequence, one that is delivered in true late 1980s, early 1990s Toho Godzilla sequel splendor, the unabashed silliness of their clash juxtaposed with devastating respect for the might and muscle of the creatures that’s suitably incredible. At the same time, also much like many of those Japanese epics from the tail end of the 20th century, the human component of this story grows increasingly asinine as events progress. Co-writing the script with Krampus collaborator Zach Shields and working from a story the pair dreamt up with Godzilla and Kong: Skull Island scribe Max Borenstein, Dougherty’s screenplay is unquestionably stupid. Alan’s plan never makes much sense, and his indifference when he realizes that Ghidorah isn’t part of the natural order but instead an alien invader intent on domination is demonstrably absurd. As for Dr. Emma Russell, her motivational flip-flops are impossible to keep track of let alone understand, making it difficult to care whether or not she is going to be reconciled with Mark let alone invest emotionally when she’s inevitably forced into a fight for her own survival. It’s also a tad
strange just how quickly Monarch has developed as a scientific defense force in
the span of five years. The organization has essentially become the
Monsterverse’s version of Marvel’s S.H.I.E.L.D., complete with secret
underwater headquarters where they’re able to monitor Godzilla’s movements and
a huge flying fortress that allows them to zip around the planet in no time flat.
Granted, there’s a similar agency in the latter Toho Godzilla films, so the fact Monarch morphs into the Earth Defense
Force (given that name in Godzilla: Final
Wars) or the Global Defense Force (as called in Godzilla: Unleashed) isn’t a big surprise. It’s just the speed in
which they suddenly have all of this technology and equipment available to them
that’s hard to buy, especially considering there’s a major plot point regarding
the U.S. government wanting to put them under the control of the Pentagon meaning
they’re not a military organization. Still, there are sequences
of such staggering beauty, not the least of which is a journey to Godzilla’s
underwater layer where Dr. Serizawa gets a heartfelt close encounter or the
birth of Mothra from her cocoon beneath a Central American waterfall, and I really
loved how much Dougherty appreciated the size and scale of the various monsters.
I found the climactic showdown in Boston to be well worth the wait, and while I’d
rather we stop staging these clashes shrouded in darkness and sheathed in rain,
that doesn’t mean I could take my eyes off the screen for a single second of
the Ghidorah-Godzilla smackdown. It’s likely I was as close to being in-the-bag for this sequel as anything I’ll see and review this summer and I feel I need to admit that. I adore Dougherty’s previous films. As already stated, I love the most recent Godzilla and had a heck of a good time watching Kong: Skull Island. Most importantly, I’m as devoted to the Japanese Godzilla pictures as anyone, and while I’d never say I’ve liked all of them, even the ones I don’t particularly care for I’d watch again at the drop of the hat if the opportunity to do so were to arise. Heck, composer Bear McCreary (Backcountry) even manages to work in Yûji Koseki’s “Mothra’s Song” and Akira Ifukube’s iconic original Godzilla theme into his magnificent score, and it’s quite possible I might have shed a silent tear the first time the latter’s thunderous refrains splashed upon the soundtrack. None of which means that I think Godzilla: King of the Monsters is perfect or that everyone will enjoy it near as much as I did. It does have flaws, and its missteps are egregiously obvious. But I was able to look past most of those as I let the joy of seeing Mothra and Rodan soar through the sky in mortal combat and the euphoria of Ghidorah and Godzilla locked in a lethal embrace sweep over me in continuous waves. I had a blast watching Dougherty’s take on these legendary creatures, and it goes without saying I’ll be heading to the theatre again to see this sequel for a second time relatively soon.

"Jun 6, 2019",positive," “Then war broke out in heaven. Godzilla and his angel, Mothra, fought against the dragon, and the dragon and his angels, called Rodan and others, fought back. But he was not strong enough, and they lost their place in heaven. The great dragon was hurled down—that ancient serpent called the devil, or King Ghidorah, who leads the whole world astray. He was hurled to the earth, and his angels with him.” Just look at that cross. “Subtle” is not how one would describe Godzilla: King of the Monsters. Instead, it’s awesome, in every sense of the word: inspiring a sense of genuine awe, as well as being, y’know, pretty cool. It’s also quite stupid. The overall plot and the humans who inhabit it are either overstuffed or under-baked. Some characters are given far too much attention and narrative importance, while others are vacuous avatars for various monster movie tropes: No-Nonsense Military Leader (Aisha Hinds), Snarky Soldier (O’Shea Jackson Jr.), Non-American Eco-Terrorist (Charles Dance), Goofball-but-Brilliant Tech Guy (Bradley Whitford). I don’t recall any of these characters’ names, and I don’t have to. The actors all seem like they’re having a good time embodying these stereotypes (especially Whitford, who is totally hamming it up). The basic plot centers around a family of scientists, Mark and Emma Russell (Kyle Chandler and Vera Farmiga), and their daughter Maddie (Millie Bobby Brown). There was a fourth Russell, a son and brother who died during the battles in San Francisco from the 2014 Godzilla film, a plot detail intended to ground the characters’ decisions as motivated by grief, but often feels like attempting to add pathos to a film that doesn’t ask for it. Since that tragedy–and somehow in connection with Kong: Skull Island (a film I haven’t seen)–the Russells have been part of Monarch, a covert research group with a mission of studying the not-so-dormant Titans (that’s what they call the big beasties). They have developed an audio device MacGuffin, the Orca, which is used to somehow control or speak to the Titans. When Emma, Maddie, and the Orca end up in the hands of eco-terrorists trying to set the Titans free, it prompts Mark to rejoin Monarch, which is being led by Godzilla‘s Ishiro Serizawa (Ken “Let Them Fight” Watanabe) and Vivienne Graham (Sally Hawkins). Much like director Gareth Edwards’ approach with the 2014 film, Godzilla: King of the Monsters is at its best when the Titans are shown to full scale in all their glory, with the puny humans staring up at them in fearful wonder. There are some marvelous images generated here–I would dare to call some of Mothra’s moments beautiful. It’s what makes the original trailer so frisson-inducing and transcendent. When the characters spout off silly lines or unfunny jokes, it distracts from the film’s purpose, very much akin to a priest or minister attempting humor in a sermon while preaching in a vast and lofty cathedral. We’re not here for your jokes, Pastor; just let us gaze at the light shining through the stained glass, feel the weight of the hymns and organ, joyfully partake in the eucharist, to find the glory (thank you Malick). As Godzilla is portrayed as the rightful and good king over the Titans–indeed, he is the King of Kings and Lord of Lords–the connections here between Godzilla and his divine namesake shouldn’t be dismissed as superfluous, even within a silly summer blockbuster of giant CGI monsters duking it out in various global locations. Such an awe-inspiring religious spectacle which is also about humility–about when not to attack but to simply be–is unique and praiseworthy in our cultural ethos. When the prophet Isaiah saw the glory of God in Isaiah chapter 6, his response is to cry out, “Woe is me! for I am undone…for mine eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts.” It’s an appropriate response to coming face-to-face with a god. Or a Godzilla."
"Jun 6, 2019",positive," Hay dos formas de hacer una película de
Godzilla. La primera es usar el monstruo japonés como una metáfora del
comportamiento destructivo humano. La otra es decir “¡que se fastidie!, vamos a poner a pelear bestias como niño borracho chocando
sus juguetes”. Aunque me gustan las que siguen el primer estilo,
me complace decirles que Godzilla: King of the Monsters es de las segundas; fantástica
acción kaiju que complació mi deseo infantil: ver estas magnificas criaturas con
presupuesto de Hollywood en la pantalla más grande posible. Hay historia envolviendo drama humano pero,
¡vamos!, ir a ver Godzilla por sus humanos
es como ir a un negocio de comidas rápidas para que te hagan los impuestos: lo
pueden hacer pero probablemente tendrás que cambiarle el techo a tu casa. Cinco años después del surgimiento de los “MUTOS” y la revelación de Gojira como una especie de guardián del balance en la tierra, el mundo continúa monitoreando la presencia de estas y otras antiguas bestias. Los esposos Emma (Vera Farmiga) y Mark Russell (Kyle Chandler) trabajaron juntos para desarrollar el “ORCA”, un equipo capaz de reproducir las ondas de sonido de los monstruos con la potencial habilidad de calmarlos o hasta controlarlos. Su matrimonio, sin embargo, ha quedado disuelto luego de la muerte de su hijo menor durante el primer ataque en el filme anterior. Mark quiere eliminar todos los kaijus mientras Emma los considera una fuerza necesaria de la naturaleza. El conflicto se traslada a Madison (Millie Bobby Brown), su hija mayor, a quien usan como pelota de ping pong entre sus distintas perspectivas. Cuando el terrorista Alan Jonah (Charles
Dance) roba el orca y secuestra a Emma y Madison, Mark necesita la ayuda de
ambas organizaciones, ya que Jonah planea despertar el “Monstruo Zero”, una
inmensa bestia, mezcla de dragón e hidra que los fans reconocemos como Rey
Ghidorah, uno de los enemigos clásicos de Godzilla.

Con su versión del 2014, Gareth Edwards lanzó una referencia al cambio climático, y la reciente Shin Gojira fue una crítica a la mediocre respuesta del gobierno japonés a la crisis de la planta nuclear en Fukushima. King of the Monsters intenta igualar la vibra, al hacer comentarios obvios sobre la influencia del humano en su entorno, la incapacidad de gobiernos contra los retos climáticos y otras cosas más que el guion de Michael Dougherty no fue suficientemente inteligente para manejar. Uno de esos libretos que confunden “complicado” con “profundo”. También director, Dougherty al menos
reconoce la oportunidad que tiene de lanzarnos a un mundo de bestias
combatiendo entre sí destruyendo todo a su paso, y la aprovecha todo lo que
puede. Ese presupuesto de efectos especiales se usó hasta el último centavo, el
último día no les debió quedar ni para un café de Game of Thrones. Lo único más grande que los Kaiju es la fantástica
banda sonora de Bear McCreary, manteniendo la emoción de los zarpazos y rayos atómicos,
definitivamente para escucharla con las mejores bocinas disponibles. Godzilla: King of the Monsters es hecha
especialmente para todos los fans del “Monsterverse”, y aunque comete el viejo
error sobre exponiendo trama para anticipar futuras entradas a la franquicia
(como Godzilla vs Kong el próximo año), tiene la ventaja de tener seguidores (como
yo) que no les molestará ver demasiados monstruos. Si ver a Mothra contra Rodan,
y a Gojira contra King Ghidorah combatiendo en pantalla grande no es suficiente
aliciente, siempre hay algún drama en fine arts que puedes buscar. Podcastero, comediante, crítico de cine y TV miembro de la Critics Choice Association, crítico certificado en Rotten Tomatoes, y padre de gatos. Una vez cuando niño entré a un cine, y en cierta forma nunca salí."

"Jun 5, 2019",negative," The new story follows the heroic efforts of the crypto-zoological agency Monarch as its members face off against a battery of god-sized monsters, including the mighty Godzilla, who collides with Mothra, Rodan, and his ultimate nemesis, the three-headed King Ghidorah. When these ancient super-species—thought to be mere myths—rise again, they all vie for supremacy, leaving humanity’s very existence hanging in the balance. First and foremost, this film did not waste any time when it came to showcasing Godzilla or the other monsters. That in itself is a huge major win for this film seeing as though the previous Godzilla (2014) took practically an entire hour before they showed the creature at all. Moreover, this sequel starts off with the aftermath of the previous film to help continue the story. In terms of the narrative, it was nice to see the stories connect and address the gravity of the situation when giant monsters have destroyed an entire city. In addition to this, the level of destruction in this film was really on par with what we could expect from giant monsters fighting. Speaking of monsters, we get a whole lot more in “King of the Monsters”. It would appear that any criticism the previous Godzilla movie received for having a lack of monsters had been heard loud and clear by the movie studios. The inclusion of multiple monsters was probably this movie’s strongest asset. There was a nice variety of monsters that casual Godzilla fans may not be acquainted with. However, the initial draw will come from the more classic monsters that have been advertised like Mothra, Ghidorah, and more. When it came to the more well-known monsters, they thankfully didn’t remain one-dimensional during the movie.  Many of them were given a combination of various attack moves or power-ups to help make their battles more interesting. While I’m on the subject, the monster battles are exactly what people expect, and “King of the Monsters” does mostly deliver in that regard. Many of the fights were constructed in a manner that almost felt like a professional wrestling match. There were many moments in the film where the drama and suspense would build up and you’d find yourself practically cheering for this or that monster at any given time. Besides the monsters, most of the actors handled their roles just fine.  I just want to highlight the one actor that felt the most compelling and that was Ken Watanabe. He had a certain presence in the movie that just made you want to pay attention and listen to him as the voice of reason. It was refreshing to see his role expanded much more this time around. One element that was also essential and nicely done in this film was the inclusion and growth of the Monarch company. The benefit of this organization is that it becomes a practical medium for the audience to obtain information in a reasonable way. The positive with Monarch’s role is that the film is able to provide a lot of additional mythological lore about the monsters which just so happen to also be homage to the much older Japanese Godzilla films. Starting with the minor issues first, I think that the random bits of humor in the movie were hit or miss. In a vacuum, the jokes or humorous moments were chuckle-worthy at best, but when you think about the movie as a whole, the humor really didn’t serve any beneficial function. It unnecessarily broke the tension, or the sense of urgency that the monsters posed. Between this sequel and Godzilla (2014) film, the tonal shift became much lighter, and I don’t think that was a good direction to take. Again, it’s minor issue, but in hindsight, it became rather noticeable how unnecessary it was for the film. Another minor issue in the film was some of the cinematography that was utilized during the monster battles. The reason why this was a minor issue is because it wasn’t a frequent occurrence, but it was unfortunate that it would happen during some of the monster battles. Basically what would happen is the camera shots would be too tightly zoomed in during the fights, and this would happen while the scenery was poorly lit. It made some of the actions scenes hard to make out. As for the last minor issue with this film, you’ll be able to tell pretty early on that this movie is rather predictable. Unfortunately this film doesn’t take very many risks with its characters or monsters so that basically leaves you to easily guess the outcome of most situations. You might start to notice that the film will telegraph situations during a really intense moment and after the fourth time or so the build up of anticipation starts to wear thin. With those minor issues out of the way, now we can talk about one of the major issues. Unfortunately, while it was a commendable effort to include more monsters in the movie, many of them were just wasted. While the initial setup and promise of the film feels like there will be a major free-for-all, we just have a bunch of monsters become background noise. To top that all off, even one of the primary monsters in the film was a complete and utter letdown. This particular monster gets hyped up so much, and even has some pretty interesting moments in the film. However, when it’s all said and done their entire existence was for nothing. As for the biggest problem in “King of the Monsters”, that prize goes to the all of the humans in the movie (except for Ken Watanabe’s character) and their personal drama. While the movie studio clearly heard the criticism of not having enough monsters, they apparently missed the memo that the human drama is not needed at all. The motivations for some of the main characters are pretty dumb and almost straight from a comic book villain’s story. For a monster movie, taking time away to focus on the human characters’ personal drama was a huge distraction.  As a matter of fact, “King of the Monsters” is 2hrs and 11 mins long and it most definitely would’ve been better served to remove the family drama elements to save a solid 20 mins of time. To make matters worse, many of these irrelevant issues would come up right in the middle of the climatic monster fights. All of that rising action and tension gets broken every time we take time away from the monster fights to focus on a character’s personal issue. I don’t know how anyone would’ve thought that would be a good idea at all, but one of the best monster fights in the movie has to take a break just to show us an update on how some family is doing in the midst of the fight. Godzilla: King of the Monsters is a monster movie that feels like a restaurant that just can’t get your order right. It’s like when you ordering a hamburger with extra ketchup and no pickles. When you finally get your burger, they give you the ketchup packets on the side (which is fine) but you still find two strangely pickles hiding under the bun. So let me address this human problem with a bit more clarity because I don’t want there to be any confusion with my criticism. Right now, Godzilla: “King of the Monsters” is falling into a similar trap that the Michael Bay movies would succumb to. It’ll give you a lot of the good stuff you wanted (The Transformers), but it won’t take the time to filter out the unnecessary things either (human drama). There simply needs to be a better balance when it comes to the monsters and the human drama in these films. I say that because I believe there is a built up expectation for audiences to come and see monsters fight. The monsters should be the lead characters in the film and receive the most screen time. Besides that, the humans should be complimentary or secondary characters rather than trying to fight for the audiences’ attention. In other words, the only human drama that is necessary in these films should be any drama that is directly related to the monsters themselves. The moments in the movie that show the humans trying to deal with the monster problem are great. The moments when they’re trying to deal with their family, marriage, or whatever else is not so great. I’m sorry (no, I’m not) but I don’t care about a family’s personal issues while a group of large monsters are destroying the world right outside. The humans in these movies can serve the purpose of  informing us about the monsters, be affected by the aftermath of the monsters, and even have some relationships with the monsters. (Since many of the humans in this movie have a weird inclination to want to touch the monsters’ faces.) Regardless, the moment the focus goes away from the monsters and onto the humans and their personal issues, the film has betrayed its primary purpose, which is to be a movie about monsters.  With all that being said, yes, this movie did some great things with the monsters. Yes, it does have some great action, and I’d say it had some entertaining moments. It’s ultimately an ideal popcorn flick that is worth seeing in theaters IF you you’re willing to ignore the parts of the movie that have nothing to do with the monsters. The story is nonsensical, but they give you so many monsters to distract you, you’ll probably be more forgiving about it. As a fan of monster movies myself, and despite the many issues I had with this movie, I’d recommend to check this out. Be sure to stay until the end of the credits for a bonus post credit scene too.

"Jun 5, 2019",negative," The third film in Legendary Pictures’ Monarch Cinematic Universe (after Gareth Edward’s 2014 Godzilla and Jordan Vogt-Roberts’ Kong: Skull Island), Godzilla: King of the Monsters course-corrects the lack of the titular beast in the first movie but also expands on the elements that weren’t so popular. There’s a glut of unnecessary, dull, dumb, human characters and while the monster fights are frequent, they often look murky and lack visual dynamism. Unfortunately, this movie misses the gorgeous cinematography of Guillermo Navarro, who conjured the awesome aesthetic of Pacific Rim or Larry Fong’s striking visual palette in Kong: Skull Island. Watching both Godzilla’s I’m left wondering if we’ll ever see the king titan clash under clear skies. The excitement of seeing this beastly royalty on screen is dampened by the restrictive storm of dusty, smoky, greys and browns. It’s a visual dirge that made me ache for the breath-taking HALO jump from the 2014 movie or practically any monster shot from Skull Island (honestly… check my earlier review. I took a lot of flak for unashamedly loving that movie). Seeing the sheer number of iconic beasts and the loving fan-service, liberally slathered on screen should have been a joyous thing but sadly, they’re competing for screen-time with a phalanx of hollow, grating human characters. It’s bad enough director Michael Dougherty squanders the scenery-chewing Charles Dance, we also have to endure the human slice of dry white, crustless bread that is Kyle Chandler.  Vera Farmiga’s character motivations are astoundingly stupid and cliched, Bradley Whitford delivers naff quips, Zhang Ziyi espouses vaguely Asian mysticism and Ken Watanabe returns to intone super-seriously. Millie Bobby Brown gets a little more to do than most but the family dynamic between her character, Chandler and Farmiga’s is ill-defined and has no satisfactory resolution. Oh… and there’s an utterly wasted Sally Hawkins, Thomas Middleditch, Aisha Hinds, avid Stathairn, Joe Morton, Anthony Ramos and O’Shea Jackson Jr. to name a few. There’s simply too many human characters that whenever we lose sight of the titans the movie becomes a trudge. In that regard, Godzilla: King of the Monsters suffers from the same issue the Transformers movies had, where the spend way too much time with an inordinate number of unlikeable characters, delivering terrible dialogue and doing idiotic things. What could have been a lean, mean clash of creatures ends up a monotonous meander between muddy-looking, incomprehensible battles. That aside, the Bear McCreary score is aces and there’s a couple of unintentionally hilarious moments that helped me through this overstuffed, undercooked pretender to the crown. If you’re a fan of the 2014 movie you may enjoy King of the Monsters at face-value. There are plenty of call-backs to the rich history of Godzilla and the promise of more gargantuan tussles in future but as a casual fan I was bored.

"Jun 5, 2019",positive," Most disaster-style movies follow a basic structure. They open with a tease. Then they let you meet the characters. Then they lay out the stakes. Then they kill off a character. Then they let the remaining characters mobilize and formulate a plan. Then they unleash hell for a chaotic climax in the third act. Godzilla: King Of The Monsters hits many of those same beats, but the unleashing hell parts happens almost constantly throughout the whole movie. In fact, the pacing is so strange that after about the twenty minute-mark, I had no concept whatsoever of how far into the film’s runtime we were. I’m usually pretty good at timing out a movie in my head and estimating what percentage we’ve completed. Not here. Not even close. There’s no slow burn or escalating momentum. The whole movie is in the deep end. Godzilla: King Of The Monsters is just a relentless haze of destruction throughout, a creative decision that obviously brings with it an enormous amount of pros and cons. The pros are, of course, we get to see a ton of amazing visuals. The special effects work is consistently wonderful throughout, and some of the set locations in major cities are a sight to behold. Whether you’re emotionally invested or not, it’s riveting to watch major landmarks get wrecked by gigantic prehistoric leviathans. The cons are there is so much destruction it’s hard to focus on anything else and be particularly moved by any single moment. We’re given human characters. There are a few attempts to make us feel something for them, but because Godzilla: King Of The Monsters clearly cares about the fight scenes more than anything else, that emotional connection is never established. There’s just not enough time and not enough moments without frenetic urgency. They say you learn a lot about people during a crisis, but that only works if you know their personalities and can guess at how they would seemingly react. Those human characters have names and some of them have minor backstories, but I’m not sure any of that really matters. For the sake of being thorough: there’s a woman (Vera Farmiga), her ex-husband (Kyle Chandler), their kid (Millie Bobby Brown), some scientists and a lot of monsters. There’s also a villain played by Charles Dance, who is always a delight. Some of the characters want to use a sound frequency machine to control the monsters, or titans as they’re called here. Others just want them to go away. The beasts are eventually set free and go on a rampage that makes the carnage in Man Of Steel look like a slap fight between two little kids. It’s all a lot in the best and worst ways. Despite existing in the same universe as Kong: Skull Island, Godzilla: King Of The Monsters shares almost nothing in common with that movie, at least when it comes to tone. There are some light jokes from Bradley Whitford and Thomas Middleditch that are worth a smile here or there, but basically, it’s all monster fights all the time with intense, brooding and emotional undercurrents bubbling beneath the surface. If you’re the type of person that gets excited about the idea of numerous prehistoric beasts invading major cities and leaving them in utter ruin, this is a great movie for you. You’re going to absolutely love it. If you’re the type of person who cares about the story first and the visuals second, this probably won’t be one you feel the need to see a second time. Still, it’s hard not to at least mildly enjoy Godzilla: King Of The Monsters. With some of the best visual effects you’ll see this year, solid enough acting performances and big scary unnatural animals wandering about and breaking everything near them, the end product does enough to justify its two hour plus runtime and perhaps justify the cost of a ticket.

"Jun 5, 2019",negative,"       They made the first one in 2014, and you asked why, and then they went ahead and made another one, and it'll make you scream, Why!  Godzilla: King of the Monsters comes with the unoriginal tag line ""one king to rule them all"", a lazy and force-fitted hat-tip to Lord of the Rings.    Michael Dougherty’s sci-fi action adventure is a breathless series of action pieces and elaborate special effects building up to a possible apocalypse. The story opens a few years after the earlier film. Emma (Vera Farmiga) and Mark (Kyle Chandler) are estranged, dealing with the loss of their son Andrew in the last movie. Caught somewhere between their angst is their daughter, Madison (Millie Bobby Brown). Emma works for Monarch, a corporation that monitors and protects Godzilla and the other Titans. To this end, Emma has developed a machine that is able to control their behaviour through bioacoustics.    But eco-warrior Jonah Alan (Charles Dance) has his own greater plan and that’s when things begin to go terribly bad. Emma and Madison are captured and Mark is enlisted to help track them down.    Eventually a whole lot of monsters are stomping around Earth, reducing it to rubble. A three-headed creature is commandeering the dormant Titans (monsters) but can he outwit Godzilla, aka Gojira? Or will Godzilla show that co-existence is possible and save the planet from annihilation? The WWE of monsters is almost fun, but then the humans, with their trite lines, spoil the (limited) drama.    Ken Watanabe, Sally Hawkins and Zhang Ziyi also appear. A third part is inevitable, as Godzilla goes head-to-head with King Kong in ""Godzilla vs. Kong"". Godzilla 2 might have worked as a B-grade creature feature or a contemporary comic homage to such films, but it is neither. It's just a big-budget waste of resources that weakly attempts some eco-warrior gibberish and leans heavily on disaster movie clichés. Unlock a world of Benefits!

"Jun 5, 2019",neutral," I am not here to disparage your work. On the contrary. I have a huge amount of respect for visual artists who work in CG, and you deliver stunning images that are truly the definition of movie magic. This is especially impressive to someone like me, who has a technical aptitude of approximately zero. I am in awe of your craft. Unfortunately, I’m significantly less in awe of Godzilla: King of Monsters. Godzilla has been around since the 1950s. Which means he’s pushing seventy and probably starting to lose his eyesight. I am a little more than half his age, and about twenty minutes into Godzilla: King of Monsters, I worried that I might need to see my optometrist; this film is so murky I began to wonder if my corneas were malfunctioning. But I soon realized it wasn’t me. It was you.  To be fair, I’ll assume this murkiness was a conscious decision made by director Michael Dougherty, who decided to shroud this narrative in logical darkness, too. This second installment in the Godzilla portion of the Legendary/WB “Monsterverse” franchise falls into the trap that many middle-chapter films do: it’s a placeholder, a forgettable episode in a who-knows-how-long saga. The Godzilla mythology is vast, and Godzilla: King of Monsters introduces other monsters (aka. Titans) for the titular mutant to reign over – Mothra, Rodan, and King Ghidora – setting fans up for an epic kaiju showdown. This set-up pays off, but only barely, and only after slogging through too many scenes of a put-upon cast sputtering rote exposition. Stuffed between the monster fights is a finger-wagging ecological conundrum, a globe-spanning chase, and a kitchen sink family drama, all of which are as tedious as they sound. If spectacularly rendered monsters are what audiences are after, then they’ll have to work for them here. Despite a few notable exceptions, their screen time is mostly frustrating. Rodan’s appearance atop a volcano, Mothra’s technicolour splendor, and the final battle between the three-headed Ghidora and Godzilla in Boston’s Fenway Park are scenes that stun and delight the way a film of this scope demands. When your work is discernible, Marcello, it complements the grandeur of these beasts, highlighting rough dermis and glinting eyeballs, and showing just how enormous and formidable they are by scaling them against the crumbled cityscapes. But the rest of their antics are bathed in a smoky patina, their majestic details obscured by rain and cloud.  Perhaps the worst part is that the film was too dark for me to check my watch, which I attempted to do many, many times. Not simply because I wanted to know how much longer this film would hold me hostage, but because looking away from the screen was a respite, however brief, from the convoluted, interminable human narrative. This all takes place five years after San Francisco was levelled in the first Godzilla movie. We meet an estranged couple, both scientists, who lost a child in the disaster. They are swept up, along with their teen daughter. in separate plans to either help or hinder the apocalypse, among them Project Monarch’s attempts to track the Titans and eco-terrorists hell-bent on destroying them. Vera Farmiga, Kyle Chandler, and Millie Bobby Brown (in her feature debut), are joined by Sally Hawkins, Ken Watanabe, Charles Dance, Zhang Ziyi, O’Shea Jackson and others in their quest to make a silk purse out of this sow’s ear of a script. The comic relief, such as it is, is played out between Bradley Whitford and Thomas Middleditch as a game of “Duelling Sarcastic Guys”, who, along with the rest of the cast, seem determined to spout their dialogue as quickly as possible so they can put this whole monster mess behind them. That they conduct their business in barely-lit control rooms and underground bunkers should be no surprise, as Godzilla: King of Monsters seems to have mistaken darkness for depth. It takes itself so seriously that it would be almost laughable if it weren’t all so exhausting. All of this, of course, is just a bloated premise for the main event, which will see Godzilla take on King Kong in 2020’s Godzilla vs. Kong. I was firmly Team Kong, if for no other reason than 2017’s Kong: Skull Island has everything a neo-classic monster movie should have: a compelling but easy to follow plot, a steady and consistent upping of the stakes, clever world-building, and, most importantly, an engaging cast who knew exactly what kind of ridiculous film they were making. Kong: Skull Island proved that you can have CGI creatures stalk and terrorize in the daylight without sacrificing tension or awe. But with that film’s director, Jordan Vogt-Roberts, prepping a new film for Sony after almost being killed by Vietnamese gangsters (yup, that happened), and none of Kong: Skull Island’s writers returning for Godzilla vs. Kong, and Michael Dougherty and co. returning instead—well, let’s just say my anticipation has dimmed considerably."
"Jun 5, 2019",negative," The sequel to Gareth Edward’s 2014 reboot of the ubiquitous Godzilla franchise could well be the first truly abysmal big budget production of the summer. Directed and co-written by Michael Dougherty (Krampus), Godzilla: King Of The Monsters presents such a preposterous and idiotic plot, that even those with expert knowledge of the franchise might find it impossible to follow. Set five years after the end of the first instalment and starring Vera Farmiga (The Departed, Up In The Air) and Kyle Chandler (Friday Night Lights, Manchester By The Sea), the story follows the crypto-zoological agency Monarch as its scientists face off against more giant monsters. As well as reacquainting audiences with the mighty lizard king Godzilla, this new chapter introduces some new adversaries, including the powerful three-headed behemoth Ghidorah. After suffering a great loss five years earlier in the first attacks, Dr Emma Russell (Farmiga) has dedicated her life to attempting to understand the nature of the monster who killed her son. On the other side of the world, her husband Mark (Chandler) is finding it equally impossible to come to terms with the events which went on to destroy his marriage and kept him away from the couple’s teenage daughter Madison (played beautifully by Stranger Things teen star Millie Bobby Brown). When both Emma and Madison are taken hostage by a group of eco-terrorists headed by Jonah Alan (a suitably sinister Charles Dance), Mark must locate his family and retrieve the Orca, a scientific gadget created by Emma and which could help stop Armageddon. Even if one is willing to forgive its ludicrously complicated and drawn-out plot, there’s no ignoring the fact that Godzilla: King of The Monsters is simply not a very good movie. Michael Dougherty presents a poorly written screenplay and a story so devoid of any coherence that it seems unable to decide what to do with its protagonists. Squandering the bulk of an undoubtedly huge budget on some dimly lit and poorly thought-out action set pieces, the film fails to bring anything new to a franchise which, impressively, is on its 35th instalment. Elsewhere, the usually excellent and hugely funny O'Shea Jackson Jr (Straight Outta Compton, Ingrid Goes West) is wasted in a role which barely sees him uttering more than a couple of sentences throughout. The immeasurable talent of Sally Hawkins is squandered on a “blink and you’ll miss it” appearance."
"Jun 5, 2019",negative," There is such a clear disdain for the human element in Godzilla: King of the Monsters, one wonders if there wasn’t a way to make this sequel with monsters alone. Co-written (with Zach Shields) and directed by Michael Dougherty, this film picks up five years after the wreckage of the first. The loss of life was devastating for many, the Russell family included. After the death of their son, Mark (Kyle Chandler) fell into a bottle and ran away while Emma (Vera Farmiga) fell into her work for Monarch, the agency devoted to discovering and protecting/destroying these mammoth creatures, which they call titans. While Mark and Emma’s daughter (Millie Bobbie Brown) tries to keep the relative peace between her parents, Emma perfects a device that allows humans to communicate and pseudo-control these beasts. Since Mark was one of the initial creators of this device, he’s forced back into the fold. Unfortunately, nefarious motivations prevent things from going smoothly. A straightforward villain played by Charles Dance is just the tip of iceberg in a script that lives for its twists, logic be damned! Credit where it’s due, Dougherty does (sometimes) deliver on the promise of his film’s subtitle: there are plenty of monsters, and Godzilla does appear to be the king. When they fight, there are glimmers of the B-movie banger that was promised. There are also, however, cutaways to a slew of supporting characters quipping incessantly at the action, Bradley Whitford and Thomas Middleditch chief among them. Gareth Edwards’ outing got a lot of credit for holding its proverbial cards back and ramping up tension throughout, filling out the world in which Godzilla was emerging. And while this writer was not as enamored with that strategy (and execution) as others, King of the Monsters serves as a reminder at the difficulty in making one of these movies. There is not a single human character in this picture worth investing in. Furthermore, much of the narrative is formed from rationalizations that feel devoid of real thought or consideration. Most of these people are scientists and military higher-ups, making the lack of intelligence hard to swallow. Ken Watanabe, David Strathairn, and Sally Hawkins all return and are given markedly less to do. And though Aisha Hinds and O’Shea Jackson Jr. are welcome additions, they are left with scraps in a screenplay painstakingly devoted to introducing monsters and reacting to their glory. There has always been a lack of logic to these movies, but all pretense slips away here. Within minutes, Mark offers the most logical answer to the problem of “we found huge creatures underground whose existence will surely kill us.” He’s quickly ignored. Meanwhile, other, far more problematic, stop-gaps are put into motion throughout that result quite literally in the destruction of the planet. Who knows how many actual human beings are left at the end of Godzilla: King of the Monsters, but after the lizard’s forthcoming bout with King Kong, let’s hope they’re not forced to endure much more.

"Jun 5, 2019",positive," For the sake of simplicity, I’m going to say there are two kinds of Godzilla fans. The first kind of fan adores the thematic ideas behind Godzilla. Films like Ishirō Honda’s original classic, Gareth Edwards’ Godzilla, and Hideaki Anno’s Shin Godzilla explore the fallout of humanity toying with nuclear power and nature. They are not really monster movies so much as allegories of mankind’s nature for self-annihilation. The second kind of Godzilla fan enjoys watching Godzilla beating the everlasting crap out of other monsters. The circumstances of how Godzilla faces King Ghidorah are not important. The important part is the fight itself.I strive to be both kinds of fans. I believe Honda, Edwards, and Anno made the three best Godzilla films in the franchise’s 65-year long history. But I’m also a big fan of epic cheese like Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah (1991), Mothra vs. Godzilla (1964), and Invasion of Astro-Monster (1965). These are movies with time travel, aliens, and victory dances as plot points. Part of what makes Godzilla such a fascinating franchise is it consists of a wide variety of genres, tropes, and styles.Director Michael Dougherty aims to make Godzilla: King of the Monsters a gigantic callback to epic cheese, specifically to the Heisei and Millennium era of Godzilla movies. What I got was something admirable, beautiful, bombastic, but in the way of itself too many times.A Properly Nonsensical PlotLike a proper Godzilla action movie, the plot of King of the Monsters is so nonsensical and complicated that it’s not worth writing out completely. Essentially, what we have is Monarch scientist Dr. Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga) and her daughter Madison (Millie Bobby Brown) are kidnapped by a group of eco-terrorists  interested in using a sonar device she invented to awaken all the monsters aka Titans across the globe. Among the Titans are Mothra, Rodan, King Ghidorah, and of course, Godzilla himself.source: Warner Bros. PicturesWith Titans bringing utter destruction upon the earth, it’s up to Madison’s estranged father Dr. Mark Russell (Kyle Chandler) to work with a group of Monarch scientists to retrieve the device… and potentially help Godzilla defeat the other Titans.Fans of the Heisei and Millennium era will find it easy to forgive the plot and characterization in this movie. Really, the plot is an elaborate connect-the-dots game, where it finds the perfect excuse to awaken each monster. I couldn’t care less how King Ghidorah gets awakened. I just want to see him awaken and roar in his full glory on the big screen. In that sense, the plot manages to string everything together without ever falling apart.Sure, none of it makes any logical or practical sense, and the movie never gives the audience a chance to reflect how stupid the eco-terrorists’ motivations are.

However, the Godzilla completionists are not going to care, and I don’t blame them.Exquisite Monster, Sound, and Music DesignIf there’s one reason to see Godzilla: King of the Monsters, it’s to see how Dougherty honors the original source material through the monster, sound, and music design. This is the first time Mothra, Rodan, and King Ghidorah have been on the big screen since 2004, and man, all three of them look amazing. Not only does the film stay in line with the personalities of all three monsters, it does not hesitate in giving King Ghidorah more screen time than Godzilla himself. Certainly, the film gives Ghidorah a chance to earn that “bad guy” title.source: Warner Bros. PicturesFrom the middle head being the alpha to the roar clearly resembling how he sounded during the Shōwa era, King Ghidorah is fully realized in Dougherty’s vision and easily worth the wait. The same can be said for Mothra, who literally looks like her 1962 incarnation writ large on a $200 million budget. The monsters all look and sound amazing.And if that’s not enough, music composer Bear McCreary bombards us with a loud operatic score. From the original Mothra’s Song by Yuji Koseki to the classic 1954 Godzilla theme by Akira Ifukube, McCreary brings all the classic tunes back to life in full force. Most of all, Dougherty knows the perfect time to queue those melodies in the film. If you’re familiar with these tunes like I am, you might find yourself grinning through a lot of the third act.Overexposure, Iffy Camerawork, and Very Busy DirectingThe most heartbreaking thing about King of the Monsters is how the monster action gets staged. As much as I can tell Dougherty loves Godzilla, he directs the action like a cross between the 1998 Roland Emmerich Godzilla, where it’s raining all the goddamn time, and Zack Snyder’s Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice, where the exposure, contrast, and saturation is so high that it makes your eyes sore.source: Warner Bros. PicturesSeeing Godzilla grab one of Ghidorah’s heads may be satisfying, but when the shot is obstructed by rubble, rain, smoke, and regular darkness, it’s hard to make out all the images. It’s even worse when the shot is framed as a close-up or a medium shot. Often times, a wide establishing shot is still the best choice.Past filmmakers like Anno, Edwards, and even Guillermo del Toro for his Pacific Rim master the way we gaze at monsters. Almost all the shots in their films are done from a human perspective, where a tangible object is in the same frame as the monsters to help get a sense of how enormous they are. Anno would have the camera look up and let buildings, streets, and telephone lines obstruct part of Godzilla’s body. Edwards would sneak in birds flying around Godzilla or even look at a monster through a bus, office window, or from a building’s roof. Del Toro would use cargo ships and freight transports as obstacles or weapons during a fight.These subtle artistic sensibilities are sorely lacking in King of the Monsters. Occasionally, Godzilla rams King Ghidorah through a building in a glorious wide shot or Rodan and Ghidorah tackle each other in the sky like something out of a gorgeous painting. When once the overabundance of close-ups come in, the lack of tangible objects and clever framing strips the monsters of their scale and majesty. It’s still awesome to watch, but there’s definitely something missing this time.source: Warner Bros.

I strive to be both kinds of fans. I believe Honda, Edwards, and Anno made the three best Godzilla films in the franchise’s 65-year long history. But I’m also a big fan of epic cheese like Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah (1991), Mothra vs. Godzilla (1964), and Invasion of Astro-Monster (1965). These are movies with time travel, aliens, and victory dances as plot points. Part of what makes Godzilla such a fascinating franchise is it consists of a wide variety of genres, tropes, and styles. Director Michael Dougherty aims to make Godzilla: King of the Monsters a gigantic callback to epic cheese, specifically to the Heisei and Millennium era of Godzilla movies. What I got was something admirable, beautiful, bombastic, but in the way of itself too many times.A Properly Nonsensical PlotLike a proper Godzilla action movie, the plot of King of the Monsters is so nonsensical and complicated that it’s not worth writing out completely. Essentially, what we have is Monarch scientist Dr. Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga) and her daughter Madison (Millie Bobby Brown) are kidnapped by a group of eco-terrorists  interested in using a sonar device she invented to awaken all the monsters aka Titans across the globe. Among the Titans are Mothra, Rodan, King Ghidorah, and of course, Godzilla himself.source: Warner Bros. PicturesWith Titans bringing utter destruction upon the earth, it’s up to Madison’s estranged father Dr. Mark Russell (Kyle Chandler) to work with a group of Monarch scientists to retrieve the device… and potentially help Godzilla defeat the other Titans.Fans of the Heisei and Millennium era will find it easy to forgive the plot and characterization in this movie. Really, the plot is an elaborate connect-the-dots game, where it finds the perfect excuse to awaken each monster. I couldn’t care less how King Ghidorah gets awakened. I just want to see him awaken and roar in his full glory on the big screen. In that sense, the plot manages to string everything together without ever falling apart.Sure, none of it makes any logical or practical sense, and the movie never gives the audience a chance to reflect how stupid the eco-terrorists’ motivations are. But this is a franchise where we’ve had man-made black hole generators as part of the plot (I’m not kidding. It’s from Godzilla vs. Megaguirus). When graded on a curve, King of the Monsters is pretty standard.Human Characters? Rightfully Heisei/MillenniumIf you’re one to forgive the plot, you’d likely forgive the human characters too. Chandler and Brown show their full commitment throughout the film, giving natural performances to elevate their one-dimensional personalities.

But this is a franchise where we’ve had man-made black hole generators as part of the plot (I’m not kidding. It’s from Godzilla vs. Megaguirus). When graded on a curve, King of the Monsters is pretty standard.Human Characters? Rightfully Heisei/MillenniumIf you’re one to forgive the plot, you’d likely forgive the human characters too. Chandler and Brown show their full commitment throughout the film, giving natural performances to elevate their one-dimensional personalities. The triangular relationship among the father, mother, and daughter is one of the better explorations of character in the Godzilla franchise. The typical Godzilla movie makes little to no effort to help you care about the human characters. Here, at least we have solid performances to give them some sort of emotional weight.source: Warner Bros. PicturesThe side characters, on the other hand, are reduced to your typical one-liners and expositional dialogue. Almost every scene with the humans is someone using pictures, maps, and diagrams to explain the plot to the audience. Hilariously, most of the explanations come from Chandler’s character, who essentially knows the answer to everything the humans need to know at the moment. Either that or he figures it out in seconds. Not only does the script explain the current situation, but it also feels obligated to explain all the mythology to the audience as well, as if Dougherty is trying to convert new fans to join the club. Anyone unfamiliar with the mythology would find the storyline to be a clunky hodgepodge of biology and fantasy lingo.Ken Watanabe and Sally Hawkins return as their respective characters from the 2014 film. The former, to my surprise, is given a beautiful reverse-role callback that honors the 1954 classic, while the latter is frustratingly wasted in the blink of an eye. Then you have Charles Dance using his British voice to intimidate people, Bradley Whitford dropping hilariously bad one-liners (The “Oh my Godzilla” line is in the final cut), Thomas Middleditch being the unfunny comic relief, and Zhang Ziyi providing one of the best reveals in the film.For an average Hollywood blockbuster, there are obviously too many human characters and almost none of them serve any purpose in the grand scheme of things. However, the Godzilla completionists are not going to care, and I don’t blame them.Exquisite Monster, Sound, and Music DesignIf there’s one reason to see Godzilla: King of the Monsters, it’s to see how Dougherty honors the original source material through the monster, sound, and music design. This is the first time Mothra, Rodan, and King Ghidorah have been on the big screen since 2004, and man, all three of them look amazing. Not only does the film stay in line with the personalities of all three monsters, it does not hesitate in giving King Ghidorah more screen time than Godzilla himself. Certainly, the film gives Ghidorah a chance to earn that “bad guy” title.source: Warner Bros. PicturesFrom the middle head being the alpha to the roar clearly resembling how he sounded during the Shōwa era, King Ghidorah is fully realized in Dougherty’s vision and easily worth the wait. The same can be said for Mothra, who literally looks like her 1962 incarnation writ large on a $200 million budget. The monsters all look and sound amazing.And if that’s not enough, music composer Bear McCreary bombards us with a loud operatic score. From the original Mothra’s Song by Yuji Koseki to the classic 1954 Godzilla theme by Akira Ifukube, McCreary brings all the classic tunes back to life in full force. Most of all, Dougherty knows the perfect time to queue those melodies in the film. If you’re familiar with these tunes like I am, you might find yourself grinning through a lot of the third act.Overexposure, Iffy Camerawork, and Very Busy DirectingThe most heartbreaking thing about King of the Monsters is how the monster action gets staged. As much as I can tell Dougherty loves Godzilla, he directs the action like a cross between the 1998 Roland Emmerich Godzilla, where it’s raining all the goddamn time, and Zack Snyder’s Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice, where the exposure, contrast, and saturation is so high that it makes your eyes sore.source: Warner Bros. PicturesSeeing Godzilla grab one of Ghidorah’s heads may be satisfying, but when the shot is obstructed by rubble, rain, smoke, and regular darkness, it’s hard to make out all the images. It’s even worse when the shot is framed as a close-up or a medium shot. Often times, a wide establishing shot is still the best choice.Past filmmakers like Anno, Edwards, and even Guillermo del Toro for his Pacific Rim master the way we gaze at monsters. Almost all the shots in their films are done from a human perspective, where a tangible object is in the same frame as the monsters to help get a sense of how enormous they are. Anno would have the camera look up and let buildings, streets, and telephone lines obstruct part of Godzilla’s body. Edwards would sneak in birds flying around Godzilla or even look at a monster through a bus, office window, or from a building’s roof. Del Toro would use cargo ships and freight transports as obstacles or weapons during a fight.These subtle artistic sensibilities are sorely lacking in King of the Monsters. Occasionally, Godzilla rams King Ghidorah through a building in a glorious wide shot or Rodan and Ghidorah tackle each other in the sky like something out of a gorgeous painting. When once the overabundance of close-ups come in, the lack of tangible objects and clever framing strips the monsters of their scale and majesty. It’s still awesome to watch, but there’s definitely something missing this time.source: Warner Bros. PicturesIn terms of how the action is filmed on a technical level, I’m still a bigger fan of Edwards’ Godzilla and Jordan Vogt-Roberts’ Kong: Skull Island. The fact that I still enjoyed King of the Monsters says a lot about my love and Dougherty’s love for Mothra, Rodan, and King Ghidorah.King of the Monsters: A Mess Made with LoveGodzilla: King of the Monsters, from start to finish, is evidence that Dougherty loves Godzilla –a dedicated fan who has supported every stupid idea in every era of the franchise. The callbacks in this film can only be done by someone who knows what he’s doing. Unfortunately, I wish he had a better artistic sensibility in how he stages the action. The context of what’s going on is jaw-dropping and entertaining, but what’s literally shown on screen on a technical level is short of perfection.That being said, as a dedicated fan myself, I still support the film and Legendary Pictures’ efforts in building the MonsterVerse. Next year, we are getting Godzilla vs. Kong. For the average moviegoer, it may sound like yet another crossover, where studios are following what Marvel Studios have been excelling at for over a decade. For Godzilla completionists, however, we’re getting a remake for a 58-year old movie. This is a dream come true for some viewers out there, including myself. The only way you can hype this announcement even more is if you bring back Gamera.My only request is for director Adam Wingard to stage the titular fight during the day.Did you see Godzilla: King of the Monsters?

My only request is for director Adam Wingard to stage the titular fight during the day.Did you see Godzilla: King of the Monsters? What did you think of the film?

"Jun 5, 2019",positive," It’s yet another kaiju movie. Kaiju, in Japanese, means “strange creature,” but in English is has come to have a meaning more like “monster.” Generally, kaiju movies involve military action, fight scenes and social commentary – and this features all of the above. This takes place after the 2014 ""Godzilla"" reboot, continuing the idea that monster such as Godzilla and Mothra, which are called the Titans, are ancient creatures that once ruled the world. In the 2014 film, and the 1954 original, too, Godzilla awakens because humans misuse technology. In this one, Dr. Mark Russell (Kyle Chandler, “Manchester by the Sea”) and his ex-wife Dr. Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga, “The Conjuring”) along with their daughter Madison (Millie Bobby Brown, television’s “Stranger Things”) take center stage. It doesn’t really matter how it happens. Suffice it to say that several monsters begin to threaten each other and humankind. There is talk about how people are destroying the planet, and how the Titans have returned to take over. The monsters, or at least some of them, may want to maintain the balance that humans are ruined. Russell has created a sonic device called the Orca, which she uses to great effect when a giant larva hatches. The Orca manages to calm what comes out of the egg – at least temporarily. Someone else wants the gizmo, and soon Emma and Madison are kidnapped. Ghidorah, a three-headed monster, arrives along with Rodan and Mothra. Are they forming an alliance? Is there hope for the human race? I grew up watching these monsters, and I think a lot of other people – viewers of all ages – did too. I loved the references to the early films, and I wanted to see the battles and up-close action with the critters. I wasn’t disappointed. I love the way Rodan rises out of an active volcano, for example, and how Godzilla at times gets close enough to really look at a single human. Bear McCreary’s score is incredible – it’s as big and impressive as the monsters, with a symphony, Japanese Buddhist monks’ chants, throbbing percussion and a gorgeous chorus. The credits are pretty cool, too. Not only do they claim each monster is played by itself – this cracked me up - but there’s a touching dedication to ""Godzilla"" veterans: Producer Yoshimitsu Banno and the late actor Haruo Nakajima, who so often wore the Godzilla suit in the early movies."
"Jun 4, 2019",neutral,"Godzilla: King of the Monsters ultimately collapses under its own weight, the result of trying to do too much all at once. It'll scratch your giant-monster-fighting itch, but don't expect much else."
"Jun 4, 2019",negative," The new American film Godzilla: King of the Monsters honors a tradition that has won millions of fans over sixty years. The Japanese “kaiju,” or giant monster movie, struck it big in America back in 1956, with the American release Godzilla, King of the Monsters! That alternate version of the 1954 Japanese picture Gojira (a.k.a. Godzilla) tacked on scenes with American star Raymond Burr, but these days, Godzilla movies are made in America to begin with: what a world. Godzilla enthusiasts came out to support the big guy’s return in 2014’s Godzilla, but while Gareth Edwards’ reboot was well-received, fans have impatiently awaited a movie like its sequel, Godzilla: King of the Monsters. That’s because the sequel, directed and co-written by Michael Dougherty, dusts off other iconic creatures from the Godzilla “family”: giant-moth-thing Mothra, pteranodon-esque Rodan, and three-headed monster King Ghidorah. The promise of monster-on-monster action—in various combinations—is all the true believers need to get their butts in seats. But for everyone else, Godzilla: King of the Monsters has a higher bar to pass. Aside from Godzilla and fellow MonsterVerse entry Kong: Skull Island, the CGI blockbuster era has spat out the Cloverfield movies, the Pacific Rim movies, Rampage, and more (including earlier stabs at both Godzilla and Kong). Dougherty’s take, then, emphasizes its plethora of monsters, but it also gathers a cast of character actors in an attempt to create a human-interest story on which to hang the action. The biggest human star here, oddly enough, is teenager Millie Bobby Brown, making her big-screen debut on the strength of her Netflix sensation Stranger Things (another sci-fi monster tale). Brown plays Madison Russell, whose estranged parents are kaiju experts. Paleobiologist Dr. Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga) and anthrozoologist Dr. Mark Russell (Kyle Chandler) couldn’t keep their marriage together after the loss of their son in a monster attack. When kaiju start making havoc again, and Emma and Madison get lost in the shuffle, monster-managing organization Monarch brings a reluctant Mark back into the fold. From there, it’s a lot of character actors gathered around consoles in dark laboratories, under big radar maps that track the monsters’ movements. Ken Watanabe and Sally Hawkins reprise their roles from the 2014 film, and we’re introduced to new scientists played by Bradley Whitford, Thomas Middleditch, and Zhang Ziyi. Dougherty makes every night dark and stormy and every interior shadowy, making for a night at the movies that sometimes feels more like a patience-testing blackout at home (3D only enhances that impression). We spend too little quality time with Godzilla for him to register as a character (it’s a tough trick to give a creature personality, but hardly impossible), and the human characters prove one-note, mostly because there’s no time to discuss anything but monsters (the screenplay mostly consists of debates over monster policy). While every plot twist is explained, that doesn’t mean every plot twist is believable, and the Russells are so grumpy and/or kooky that there’s no rooting interest in bringing them back together. The CGI creatures impress—a star is reborn in Mothra—and their battles, though dark and often too tightly framed, basically deliver the fire-breathing goods. It’s just unfortunate that in the process of giving fans more of what they want, the filmmakers squander the tastefulness of Edwards' franchise launcher and significantly dumb down the proceedings. As a result, the picture as a whole lumbers a lot like its forty-story star."
"Jun 4, 2019",positive," Godzilla returns to the big screen after a 5-year hiatus, this time he’s prepping to take on King Kong by fighting a 3-headed dragon and a giant moth? Batman Shane pinch-hits for Richard as we try to make sense of ‘Godzilla: King of the Monsters’ and discuss some news coming out of Netflix."
