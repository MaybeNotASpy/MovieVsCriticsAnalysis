Feb 29 2024,neutral,in the end rebel moon part one  a child of fire is ridiculous unoriginal and stereotypical but also there is a lot of fun to be had especially if someone can jedi mindtrick you into forgetting you knew anything about star wars
Feb 2 2024,negative, happy february were technically still in winter in minnesota but you wouldnt know it looking at the weather forecast weve had a mild december and just a few frigid days in january but it ended with a recordbreaking temp per mpr yesterday was the warmest jan 31 in 150 years in the twin cities as temp topped out at 55 degrees on wednesday afternoon it broke the previous record of 46 degrees by 9 degrees whoa my hubby and i went out for a walk around a nearby lake in a light jacket and the weird thing was i still saw a few people icefishing in the middle of the frozen lake thats minnesotans for ya i first heard of this film when news came out that peter sarsgaard won best actor at the venice film festival last year somehow his name dropped off the radar come award season which is a shame as his performance was terrific here its a wellacted twohander starring sarsgaard and the alwayswatchable jessica chastain memory is a deeply layered and moving drama about past trauma and finding connection when you least expect it it can be slow and tough to watch at times but well worth your time just for the lead performances alone this was a really cute animated movie with adam sandler bill burr cecily strong whos so funny on snl i miss her the idea of a 74yearold lizard named leo and his turtle friend escaping their florida school terrarium is quite a hoot i was expecting a silly fishoutofwater well a lizardoutofitsterrarium in this case comedy but leo turns out to be quite a gem of a movie about unlikely friendships loyalty and aging gracefully plus there are some life lessons delivered in a fun but endearing way oh just so you know this is an animated musical but the songs are catchy and entertaining i grew up loving cars thanks to my twin brothers and my late brother used to play the gran turismo video game what i didnt realize was that this movie is based on a true story where gamers get to compete in real racing cars thanks to crazy but ingenious ideas by a nissan marketing exec orlando bloom i had just seen archie madekwe in saltburn but he gets to flex his acting chops in a leading role here the movie centers on two underdogs jann the gamer madekwe and a failed former race driver jack david harbour working together to achieve the impossible overall i find it more enjoyable than ferrari and the racing scenes including the crashes are wellstaged it uses cgi in an effective way to showcase the video game elements that enhance its storytelling i was surprised that neill blomkamp directed this i havent liked anything hes done since district 9 in 2009 mélanie laurent directs and stars in this french action comedy the tone is a bit off but manages to still be quite entertaining thanks to exhilarating highoctane action and the fun chemistry of the female cast notably adèle exarchopoulos an incredible true story of australian teenager jessica watson the youngest person ever to sail solo nonstop around the world the subject matter is so fascinating that it deserves a much more compelling movie wish they gave the talented cliff curtis something worthy to do here my goodness where do i start i was curious to see if this is as bad as the critics say well as it turns out theyre spot on this is the most inept boring pointless movie not sure why people even compliment the visuals as its visually garish  ugly apparently the project started out as zack snyders space opera concept pitch to lucasfilm that got rejected well star wars isnt the only thing snyder mined for inspiration the 135minute overlong slog is a chaotic compilation of so many better scifi fantasy franchises lord of the rings avatar magnificent seven kurosawa samurai epics and so on its such a waste of the talented cast with charlie hunnam being the only bright spot the one star is mostly for him but wish he picked a better movie this is by far the worst movie i saw of the entire month probably of the year too i managed to finish two miniseries this month love both of them ive written a review of bodies and will write about lessons in chemistry later this month i highly recommend both of them its time absolutely wellspent per women in film wif organization the basic rules of 52 films by women are simple watch 52 films directed by women within one year and share what you watched on social media using the hashtag 52filmsbywomen to spread the word and get more people talking about the women filmmakers that dont always get attention im starting the year strong with no less than seven movies directedbywomen  woot during the second week of january i watched four femaledirected movies back to back anatomy of a fall origin wingwomen and true spirit then added the other 3 nyad priscilla and silent night in the last week of the month i saw poor things much later than i would have liked but it was well worth the long wait it ends up making up my top 3 of the year beating out oppenheimer its currently my favorite of yorgos lanthimos work though i have yet to see killing of a sacred deer bravo to emma stone for her spectacular performance and for getting her first oscar nom as a producer for me the film of the month is babylon  my only interest in rebel moon is to see jena malone as a spider as that is fuckedup combination of seeing the actress that i love being the thing i fear the most i saw her name in the cast in imdb so i kept looking for her i didnt realize it was her as the big spider man shes too good to be used in that way but that movie wasted the talented cast i do know what you mean though its gotta be weird to see your fave actress playing the thing you fear most im scared of spiders too i still cant believe how warm its been this winter here but i think well get dump with a big snow storm and cold temps soon i hope im wrong but this is mn lol i got about halfway through wingwomen then i turned it off it started out well but the story didnt go anywhere and i lost interest rebel moon was one of the ugliest piece of crap movies ive ever seen i dont know how snyder is still being employed by netflix his other movie army of the dead also looked like shit the only new movie i saw last month was cloud atlas a film that came out over a decade ago i totally missed it when it first came out and realized that i have it on bluray and decided to finally watch it i thought its great but i do remember how divisive it was back in 2012 i watched mostly tv series finished the second season of reacher and the latest season of fargo yeah wingwomen is odd but i kept on watching because i like the french actresses its still waaaay better than rebel moon though that is just the dumbest and ugliest thing ive seen in a long while it ought to win all the razzies ive been watching a lot of french action films on netflix and looked forward to watching wingwomen since the trailer looked it was going to be a fun action thriller but once they arrived in that small town the story just didnt go anywhere and i got bored and turned it off i think the razzies might be even too good for rebel moon i still cant believe snyder got millions of dollars from netflix to make not just one but two rebel moon movies i thought cloud atmas was the best film of the wachowskis since the matrix they havent anything good since then and yes i remember reading your review of it over a decade ago lol yeah melanie laurent is so multitalented its kinda a weird movie but still worth a watch for the cast ohhh yes do see poor things its worth seeing on the big screen film is in my blood love movies of all genres from jane austen to james bond official blogger for the twin cities film fest tcff ive written and produced my first short film  hearts want in 2017 and currently working on developing the full story as a feature film
Feb 1 2024,negative, while rebel moon part one a child of fire  hitting netflix this week after a limited theatrical run and to be followed in april on the streaming service by rebel moon part two the scargiver  also was influenced by the lord of the rings the dirty dozen and more it shares much with the 1977 film now titled star wars episode iv  a new hope theres a malevolent galactic empire lightsaberlike swords a scoundrel pilot a polite robot a bar scuffle and most importantly a messiah figure pulled from an existence as a farmer but while watching this first rebel moon you cant help but wonder if snyders specific idea was to do star wars but without any of the fun snyder  whose credits include 2006s 300 several dc extended universe movies including the muchdiscussed zack snyders justice league in 2021 and army of the dead for netflix later that year  has crafted a grandios but soulless tale that begins with some promise but wears you out over twoplus hours with the violent slowmotion action sequences for which the director is so well known in lieu of an opening crawl snyder gives us narration from the great anthony hopkins who  in a movie boasting character names such as titus nemesis and devra bloodaxe  goes by  jimmy we learn about a king a princess and the motherworld which is using its military the imperium to try to squash a growing resistance a sort of rebel alliance if you will we then meet the good people of a village on the moon veldt who can produce a small surplus of food after harvesting grain for themselves and where a mysterious stranger named kora sofia boutella has been taken in and helps farm the land an imperium warship arrives above the planet and the villagers are visited by a force led by atticus noble ed skrein an officer giving off serious nazi vibes and demanding they produce so much food for the military that they will not have enough left to feed themselves although she initially plans to flee veldt kora quickly runs afoul of military men about to have their way with sam charlotte maggi a sweet young woman soon she and gunnar michiel huisman the flight attendant who oversees the harvest leave to recruit others willing to help them fight the imperium the first recruit is kai charlie hunnam a pilot and selfproclaimed opportunist who takes them to other parts of the galaxy where they pick up swordswoman nemesis doona bae jupiter ascending revolutionary karian bloodaxe justice league alum ray fisher brother of devra cleopatra coleman dopesick bloodaxe footsoldeer milius e duffy the onceregal tarak staz nair supergirl and former military commander titus djimon hounsou a quiet place part ii the building of this fellowship is the meat of this first rebel moon and it is almost wholly uninteresting it is joyless  an adventure that never feels remotely adventurous despite little action pieces such as nemesis fight with harmada jena malone a halfwoman halfspider who has kidnapped a human girl reportedly next year also will see an rrated and extended cut of this film said to be about an hour longer its amazing that a movie that drags as much as child of fire can also feel rushed at least in terms of its storytelling as presently constructed the movies narrative elements feel as though theyre being held together by fraying threads heres hoping that added time will allow for at least some character development as there is very little to be found in this version theres probably no saving the movie but given the screen presence of hunnam triple frontier the gentlemen kai being fleshed out to the point of serving as even a poor mans version of han solo would be something do we even dare to dream snyder could stitch together a bit of a love triangle for kora kai and gunnar probably best we dont boutella 2107s the mummy and atomic blonde is pretty stiff in the lead role but its also surely tough for any actor to shine in a snyder movie where all that stylized action  presented as slowly as possible  is the top priority the best work is turned in by skrein midway even if atticus isnt likely to prove to be a memorable villain he is sufficiently hateable all the same especially in his tensionfilled introduction he works under the littleseen regent belisarius fra fee hawkeye who has a connection to kora and who seems poised for a more significant part in scargiver that also would seem to be the case with jimmy jimmy whos mostly forgotten about after koras altercation on veldt if nothing else zack snyder please give us more anthony hopkins if theres one area where snyder succeeds with rebel moon is worldbuilding sure this universe has some things in common with a galaxy far far away but there are some inventive elements such as one character you meet in the aforementioned cantina
Jan 31 2024,negative, what its about stop us if youve heard this before in a galaxy far away from our own a band of rebels gathers to fight back against militaristic oppressors an empire bent on intergalactic conquest and subjugation these rebels include a farmer a smuggler trying to go straight a former general and various warriors theyre led by a hero with deep ties to the evil regime oh and theres a talking robot if the world of zack snyders rebel moon sounds an awful lot like a star wars castoff thats not only because the justice league filmmaker once pitched it to lucasfilm the finished product set to be unveiled in two parts the first of which subtitled part one  a child of fire is now on netflix as well as a directors cut plays like the bizarro world version of a star wars movie the hero in question named kora sofia boutella has abandoned her life as a highly trained soldier and the adopted daughter of the evil senator balisarius fra fee who now lords over the movies version of the empire called the motherworld kora has traded it all for life in a simple farming community but her idyll gets shattered when balisarius righthand man the sadistic atticus noble ed skrein lands there kills the communitys leader corey stoll and threatens the rest with a violent return unless they compensate him with most of their grain so an interplanetary recruitment trip must begin with kora joined by the farmer gunnar michael huisman on a search for the right collection of resistance fighters cast members also include djimon hounsou charlie hunnam and anthony hopkins who gives voice to the aforementioned robot my say theres nothing fundamentally wrong with pursuing a star warsadjacent project so much of modern scifi today still remains shaped and inspired by that universe but even as snyder attempts to construct a world of his own in rebel moon its so similar that it becomes hard to take seriously on its own terms throw in some of the classic western genre tropes that also inspired george lucas and are about as old as the movies themselves and youre left longing for any number of dozens upon dozens of better options were one able to get past all that theres still the endless exposition to contend with and dialogue that consists in large part of endless droning monologues that have a knack for sapping out any semblance of suspense or tension throw in a good measure of slowmotion action the same stuff snyder has been known for since he directed 300 which came out in 2007 add to it a general aura in which everything feels impossibly overdone with some of the creatures of this universe crossing the line from creative and cool to downright unsettling and you wind up with a picture that feels more like a bad episode of cosplaying than a compelling new vision
Jan 26 2024,negative,in the running for the worst movie of 2023
Jan 17 2024,positive, individuals can make a difference against an oppressive or authoritarian system or colonizer you cant negotiate with bad actors not everyone can be trusted dont judge a book by its cover a village of farmers works collectively for the common good some characters put themselves in harms way for the benefit of others even to the point of sacrificing their own lives theres much discussion of honor and what it means to act honorably characters have suffered the trauma of extreme violence and loss which they either run from or try to face and overcome others seem to want to redeem themselves from their actions in the past the film is set on a string of planets with a diversity of human and humanlike species as well as a variety of creatures and robots the lead cast is also diverse with actors hailing from algeria holland scotland england ireland benin korea australia iceland and more english is the main language spoken in a variety of accents graphic fight scenes involve onscreen deaths including by sword knife falls guns explosions broken bones and more people are killed in front of those who love them men threaten sexual violence toward a young woman creepy

suggestion of crushes and settling down characters drink ale and other concoctions at celebrations and a bar a man connects his body to an infusionlooking machine that appears to give him a druglike pleasure parents need to know that rebel moon part one  a child of fire is a scifi fantasy epic from director zack snyder featuring an international cast and graphic violence there is also some swearing including st hell ahole bitch and more fight scenes involve onscreen deaths sometimes of beloved characters in front of their loved ones including by sword knife falls guns explosions broken bones and more men threaten sexual violence toward a young woman creepy creatures appear to suck life out of or give life to humans and kids are put in peril through kidnappings invasions and battles

individuals can make a difference against an oppressive or authoritarian system or colonizer to stay in the loop on more movies like this you can sign up for weekly family movie night emails after an insurrection leaves the benevolent royal family of the motherworld dead no corner of the universe is safe in rebel moon part one  a child of fire that includes the residents of the peaceful farming village of veldt where kora sofia boutella hides her warrior past when the cruel commander noble ed skrein and a fleet of soldiers land in veldt and make impossible demands kora opts to run  again  rather than stay and fight a single incident forces her to change her mind so she and fellow villager gunnar michiel huisman set off across planets to round up a band of rebels to try to save veldt they include gunforhire kai charlie hunnam general titus djimon hounsou swordswoman nemesis doona bae prince tarak staz nair and resistance fighters darrius bloodaxe ray fisher and milius e duffy the first of two planned entries in a new franchise for netflix makes for an accomplished visual spectacle but the characters and scenarios are more predictable than likely intended much about rebel moon part one  a child of fire feels pulled directly out of the star wars universe technical innovations have improved the way new worlds can be brought to life in scifi and fantasy forays and rebel moon packs some impressive sequences costuming effects and general visual experiences the problem comes more from the feeling that for all its technical prowess the story lacks soul youve seen it all before of course the reality of franchisedriven hollywood is that many audiences desire familiarity and predictability rather than the more mythical journeys of its obvious inspirations like the skywalkers or kurosawas seven samurai rebel moon pulls its otherworldly characters down to our level and motivates them by basic human interests like childhood traumas absentee families and sexual desire this certainly makes them easy to understand but it also feels a little humdrum and less epic than the invented worlds and megaproduction suggest theres something very outdated as well in video gameinspired fight scenes and especially the macho posturing of soldiers including attempted sexual aggressions families can talk about how rebel moon part one  a child of fire sets up a cast of characters and a story that can be carried on into future films what do you expect to happen next in this story what aspects of veldt and other locations felt like earth and which didnt what technical handiwork goes into creating new worlds and planets like in rebel moon how would you describe main character koras motivations what about the other warriors she picks up along the way why do they all

Jan 16 2024,negative,despite the expected dazzling sequences from a visualist like snyder the subpar story and pace end up taking us to the dark side of boredom hopefully the extended version and its sequel will eclipse these shortcomings full review in spanish
Jan 12 2024,neutral,part one fails to captivate the through its admittedly impressive visuals as the story feels like recycled ideas that never quite come together there is plenty of potential here but it cant overcome a lackluster script
Jan 11 2024,negative, theres no joy to be found in hating a directors entire body of work on a long enough timeline and with strong enough scripts any director can find their niche and produce a good film or two this hope prevails in the hearts of optimists who having seen glimmers of gold within the shitmine that is zack snyders oeuvre find themselves hoping that one day hell make something truly excellent even if its terribly dumb and full of gratuitous slowmotion largely shackled by comic book adaptations and franchises for the better part of the last 20 years besides 2011s sucker punch and 2021s army of the dead and army of thieves of course the idea of snyder doing his version of star wars felt promising perhaps with just a little bit of grace the muchmaligned filmmaker could at last take all his stylistic quirks and urges and create a universe befitting the fawning adoration granted to him by internet movie bros its cynical to say that its the hope that kills you but in the case of rebel moon part one  a child of fire its just too fitting all films reveal something about their maker and in the case of rebel moon it reveals that the issue was never that snyder was being held back by having to adapt the work of others the reality is that the best parts of 300 watchmen and dawn of the dead only exist because snyder was being kept on a leash his disciples will argue that the comparative qualities of each socalled snyder cut of any of his films show a history of executive meddling ruining his vision but really his directors cuts only serve to make lackluster films more snyderflavored without making them good  if youve seen star wars seven samurai and a bugs life you dont need to watch rebel moon snyder has been upfront about these inspirations in interviews but despite the overwhelming obviousness of their influence its hard to say whether snyder or his cowriters kurt johnstad and shay hatten whom he worked with on 300 and army of the dead and their sequels respectively understood what made those films work we watch soldiers of an authoritarian empire land on the backwater moon of veldt and do some textbookevil stuff beat an old man to death try to rape a young woman abuse their own robot helper demand the farmers of veldt give up all their crops but their actions are too onthenose to be menacing we watch our heroes kora sofia boutella of the mummy 2017 fame and gunnar michiel huisman better known as daario naharis on game of thrones slowly collect other rebels but none of them are compelling enough for us to even remember their names or anything about them once the film changes focus to another planet and another rebel this is the epitome of tell dont show scifi where every character speaks in chunks of wooden exposition every person and place thoroughly explained at other people even if those people would already know everything being said in one particularly egregious latefilm scene the villain of the film and likely the series rattles off facts about kora to her face this kind of thing happens repeatedly throughout the movie making almost every interaction feel like a tedious slog this is one of the easiest pitfalls of the space epic you end up needing characters to deliver a lot of dialogue meant for the audience not for the people in the film  essentially nothing about rebel moon works  even when the film stumbles onto something bordering on interesting character or environmental design its undercut by just looking lifeless and sterile even in natural settings the one thing that snyder should be able to do in his sleep  give us coollooking fight sequences  instead feels like a joke played on the audience a murky barrage of slowmo and bland toothless violence watching some comically evil space nazis get their brains blown out by a robot voiced by anthony hopkins wont change the fact that the snyder we find on rebel moon couldnt frame a shot to save his life which is a death sentence for action scenes and spells doom for smaller moments that happen outside our view for seemingly no reason as the first installment of an at least twopart story rebel moon feels like it devoted all its energy in setting up part two the scargiver due out in april but totally forgot that typically movies only get a sequel when enough people like the first film snyders clout and name recognition is enough that part two was essentially a foregone conclusion and its clear that snyder and his cowriters thought to themselves its fine part two will be where all the really good stuff happens once we know who everyone is the end result is a halfassed halfbaked halffinished schlockfest that leaves you struggling to imagine anybody  even the most diehard snyder apologists  finding enough value in it to want to give away another twoplus hours of their precious lives to its sequel  early water doesnt have much of an arc  after all its a rehearsal tape but it does have a surprisingly plentiful array of textures and transitions within its somewhat narrow parameters 
Jan 10 2024,negative,rebel moon has potential but borrows too many elements from the films its inspired by zack snyder fans must once again wait for a future cut to fulfill the directors true vision
Jan 9 2024,negative, while zach snyders army of the dead watchmen dawn of the dead relationship with warner bros officially ended with the release of zack snyders justice league ie the 2021 snyder cut a certain subset of extremely online diehard fans have refused to let sleeping andor comatose superheroes lie with dimming fervour the same fans have unrealistically pushed for snyders return to a corporatebranded superhero franchise refusing to take reality for an answer not coincidentally snyders incredibly ambitious franchise starterwannabe rebel moon  part one a child of fire will be released on streaming giant netflix the same weekend as the final entry in the dceu dc extended universe aquaman and the lost kingdom arrives in movie theatres ambition is the key word here as snyder one of the premier visual stylists of the twentyfirst century but also one of the least subtle envisioned not just a world but a standalone universe of its own one that would generate all manner of related properties from spinoffs to direct sequels a prequel here or there and possibly even a series set somewhere within the boundaries of snyders futureset space opera netflix seems to think so too since theyve invested untold sums to allow snyder to fulfill his vision though its certainly questionable whether they should have orat a minimumdemanded more rigorous attention to screenplay quality andor a more streamlined editing process aimed at coherent compelling storytelling rather than what we ended up with here ie the exact opposite much of that may be a direct result of snyder and netflixs decision to release rebel moon as a twopart film part two the scargiver is due next spring but also as separate snyder cuts for both halves each one longer than the original by at least an hour that length is presumably there to deepen character development add missing exposition and include snyders favourite stylistic flavours eg slow motionspeed ramping etc and thematic preoccupations like the conflict between libertarianleaning personal morality and authoritarian political structures the responsibilities and duties of superheroic and ordinarily heroic characters thereof that fight or flight response fuels rebel moon part one  the child of fire and its central character kora sofia boutella an eximperium officer turned dirt farmer on the rebel moon of the title veidt saved from a mysterious crash two years earlier koras life took a turn for the better when she was welcomed by a romanticized idealized preindustrial agrarian community she has everything she could need from a physically demanding if otherwise fulfilling life she even has an occasional bedmate to satisfy her other physical needs for kora its the first real home shes had the first home outside of the brutal worldconquering military machine led by her surrogate father regent balisarius fra fee a likely usurper to the centuriesold monarchy abruptly ended by an unseen assassin as dictatorial however as balisarius might be hes only slightly worse than the romaninspired monarchs he replaced each ruled through the force of arms and the threat of violence using both to win and lose worlds across the galaxy koras brief peace doesnt last long when a fascist in a black tie black suit and a severe haircut appears one afternoon newly disembarked from the imperium dreadnought circling overhead like a shark that hasnt fed in weeks its easy to surmise what hr reps the world over like to call next steps the imperium wants the grain from the next harvest in the 910 weeks to murder a highranking member for the community in cold blood publicly and leave a small contingent of illmannered unprofessional soldiers to monitor the communitys progress over the next three months the imperiums plans dont remain in place for long leaving kora as the de facto leader and resistance organizer in rapid linear succession kora and her secondincommand gunnar michiel huisman acquire the help or the promise of help from kai charlie hunnam a black market smuggler tarak staz nair an exnobleman turned blacksmiths assistance nemesis bae doona a doublesword carrying mercenary titus djimon hounsou a disgraced general turned gladiator darrian bloodaxe ray fisher the coleader with his sister devra bloodaxe cleopatra coleman of a resistance group large enough to get the imperiums attention at various times characters spontaneously bring up the words rebellion revolution and insurgency as if theyre interchangeable terms theyre not far from it but the mixeduse suggests more than muddled dialogue it suggests muddled unfocused storytelling by either a confused bored or even indifferent screenwriter or screenwriting team either that or somewhere in the cut soontobe restored footage for the directors cut several characters sit down for a political discussion and iron out what they mean when they use those words in any relevant or possible context not surprisingly for an unoriginal derivative work like rebel moon  part one a child of fire that takes inspiration or  less charitably  borrows freely without attribution from highly popular wellknown 20thcentury works of commercial art like flash gordon the foundation trilogy dune and star wars itself a product of many influences before borrowing the premise wholesale from akira kurosawas seven samurai roger corman got here decades ago releasing battle beyond the stars four years after star wars broke boxoffice records around the world in moderation influences callbacksshoutouts and fan service are fine maybe even more than fine but when those influences are always surfacedeep and constantly call attention to themselves via narrative echoes its a surefire way to ensure your audience is more engaged in spotting references and patting themselves on the back than caring about the sketchily developed characters onscreen or their individual and collective fates and at least in this truncated iteration of snyders latest franchise wannabestarter we dont all you need is death is the latest in the celtic folk horror genre that will appeal to fans of you are not my mother a hole in the ground and men in this unboxing video jason gorber checks out the joni mitchell archives volume 3 on vinyl and covers just what you get with this latest release
Jan 7 2024,negative, one of the best things i can say about director zack snyders scifi space epic rebel moon part one  a child of fire is that at least its not totally unwatchable it certainly is a total mess of a movie which was supposedly inspired by star wars akira kurosawa and heavy metal magazine thats unfocused and lacking in all areas from lame cgi effects and onedimensional characters to mediocre performances and unsatisfying plot despite all of these serious flaws i couldnt stop watching its not that im a total glutton for punishment but that i inexplicably found myself invested in the lead characters story arc set on the quiet edges of the galaxy the hardworking inhabitants a peaceful farming colony are threatened by the tyrannical ruling force kora sofia boutella is a tough mysterious stranger who lives among the villagers desperate for help kora is tasked with assembling a team of trained fighters and brave warriors to help make a stand against the mother world she searches for the best people she can find which includes an unlikely group of outsiders that share a passion for revenge the story takes a long time to get going and once it does its a letdown theres a lot of traveling around the galaxy and meeting new characters that simply arent all that interesting the only one with whom i developed any sort of emotional connection is kora with the others fading into the background at least snyder nails the villain department as atticus noble ed skrein embodies pure evil which makes him a great bad guy the film doesnt look great either with horribly mediocre cgi effects and bloodless censored pg13 action snyder pushes the boundaries of the rating with violence but theres no grisly aftermath its not that the movie needs it to be enjoyable but it does make it feel too sanitized dragging this story out into two parts is excessive but hopefully the second installment will fare better rebel moon part one  a child of fire is a drab unexciting movie thats only slightly better in quality than a star wars mockbuster
Jan 7 2024,neutral, for almost two decades the director has stood at the fore of hollywood barricades enduring the slings and arrows of critics toxic fans journalists personal tragedies corporate suits and more through it all the man had continued to make movies his way without the pandering increasingly common to directors of cinematic blockbusters in other words he is who he is says what he wants to say and doesnt care what anybody thinks his latest endeavor rebel moon a child of fire part one finds snyder relishing his love of science fiction and anime as an original story the pressures and expectations of executives and fans that so plagued his superhero outings do not encumber the arrival of the movie on the other hand some of snyder displays some of his bad habits here and the resulting film never quite makes the jump to lightspeed in a distant galaxy the imperium a militaristic dictatorship rules over countless worlds with brutality and oppression on the tiny farming moon of veidt korra sofia boutella a former imperium soldier now lives a quiet life planting fields with her fellow villagers when imperium forces led by the nefarious atticus noble ed skrein try to take control of veidt korra and her friend gunnar michiel huisman set out on a planethopping mission to recruit mercenaries and antiimperium rebels in hopes of building a force to resist fascist aggression reading that summary anyone with even a passing knowledge of american movies probably has a looming thought on their mind rebel moon sounds a lot like star wars indeed though snyder has worked on the rebel moon story on and off for almost 40 years he did pitch the concept to lucasfilm as a possible star wars spinoff movie the project has obvious parallels to the galaxy long ago and far far away and much as george lucas did in 1977 snyder and his cowriters kurt johnstad and shay hatten construct rebel moon as a pastiche of beloved genre fare the seven samurai the wizard of oz space battleship yamato lord of the rings alien blade runner the works of edgar rice burroughs and attack on titan all get references here yet if snyder wants rebel moon to have the same newyetfamiliar glow as star wars he forgot to add the one key ingredient beloved characters though boutella has the right amount of grit mystique and cunning to make a great protagonist and though the camera loves her angular face korra lacks the irrepressible personality that allows her to transcend her archetypal origins korras empathy and mysterious past will keep viewers rooting for her but wont make an audience care about her other characters including the enslaved prince tarak staz nair the pilot kai charlie hunnam the warriors darrian and devra ray fisher and cleopatra coleman and the evil noble get even less depth they never feel like real characters so much as placeholders in a story outline child of fire lacks the kind of goofy humor or character banter that makes the characters in star wars or star trek so beloved the biggest laugh here comes in the opening shot as a phallic spaceship traverses a giant pink opening in spacetime freud would have howled in the cinema two performers defy their restrictions doona bae as the swordmaster nemesis and djimon hounsou as titus an alcoholic general bae and hounsou have the kind of magnetic charisma and personalities that make their characters vivid even though both have little screen time or dialogue indeed one of child of fires best sequences introduces nemesis as she fights a childeating spider woman jenna malone in their brief moments together child of fire sparks with the kind of character drama that the rest of the movie lacks and hints at what might be the movies biggest problem snyder and netflix have already announced that an rrated much longer version of child of fire will debut early in 2024 on the streaming service snyder of course loves releasing extended cuts of his films as he did with watchmen sucker punch and most notoriously justice league and batman v superman dawn of justice critics maligned the latter when it arrived in theatres in one of the worst critical drubbings in recent memory yet when snyder released his ultimate cut which reinserted 30 minutes of deleted scenes a totally different much more intriguing movie emerged the longer version of batman v superman has undergone something of a reevaluation since debuting its longer cut earning accolades as a secret success a child of fire seems to have the same problem the second half of the movie jumps from one action sequence to another in rapid succession adding characters along the way as it does we suspect that the longer cut of the movie will reinsert considerable character drama and exploration which can only help the story the director should remember that no amount of slick visuals and action will engage an audience beyond the superficial if viewers dont care about the characters and a child of fire has plenty of visual flare the aesthetic of the movie looks like an anime come to life and several action sequencesincluding one of a space ship crashing into a stationhave the edgeofyourseat kind of suspense that makes an audience hold its collective breath or they would if viewers cared more about the drama snyder has also developed a rich backstory to his universe and scenes of aliens suckling at human hosts androgynous soldiers marching to battle and space griffins soaring over extraterrestrial worlds have enough imagination to enthrall an audience a child of fire is in short not as irredeemable as some of our fellow critics have insisted snyder again reminds viewers of his immense talent even if the movie feels incomplete given that sequels a tv series and a continuation titled the scaregiver debuting in april all follow the longer cut of a child of fire down the pipeline it seems snyder intends to flesh out his universe and has much more to say about the world he has engineered heres hoping next time he can use a complete sentence until then audiences wanting a space opera with more than just visual splendor will need to wait for the extended edition david reddish is the awardwinning writer behind the novels the passion of sergius  bacchus and the sex drugs  superheroes series hes also a noted entertainment journalist having written for such publications as wealth of

Jan 5 2024,negative, for those who are sad about the sun setting on the dc era of the snyderverse please do not fret for those miss slowmotion battle scenes unnecessary lens flares and dark gritty unsympathetic characters who seem pissed off about saving mankind zach snyder has brought forth his vision of the future with the science fiction saga rebel moon  part one a child of fire for all to enjoy depending on your definition of enjoy at least that was the intention but it is doubtful that many will enjoy this wannabe star wars for much of anything other than onestar zingers on letterboxd  conceived by snyder decade ago the original space saga is the story of kora sofia boutella a former soldierturnedmember of a peaceful farming community on the planet veldt whose livelihood is threatened by the tyrannical imperium led by atticus noble ed skrein who rule the motherworld to protect her people she goes on a quest to gather warriors from different corners of the galaxy with hopes of overthrowing the repressive regime  this is an oversimplification of a perplexing problematic story so jampacked with mythos exposition and flashbacks that the central figures are given practically no time to develop into meaningful characters  rebel moon is an aggressively mediocre space opera that is less of a coherent plot and more of an amalgamation of vignettes in which a grumpy galactic gunslinger gathers space hobos for her battle against celestial nazis with plot points seemingly cobbled together from seven samurai the dirty dozen dune and the unforgiven as well as a dozen or so other pop culture properties to come out in the last 50 years rebel moon has little to offer in terms of originality according to interviews snyder once had hopes for rebel moon to have a place in the star wars universe at one point a character makes use of nondisney branded lightsabers but it omits the tenacity and thrills that the original trilogy is known and adored for  synders space opus not only lacks heart and humor but it falls short on the fundamentals necessary for moviegoers to want to join a heros journey in star wars viewers watch luke evolve from lonely farm boy into a protagonist during that journey they can see themselves in luke as he transitions from chump to champ in rebel moon none of that growth exists on screen the audience doesnt experience the odyssey they are just told about it in derivative flashbacks using halfbaked characters who are just mildly amusing at best  rebel moon overusing the trope to the point of parodying himself  rebel moon combines complicated world building with shoddy characters and substandard storytelling to create a lackluster narrative the shortage of humor heart and humanity lessens the basic necessities required to create a compelling narrative resulting in an uninspired scifi tale somewhere in there might have been a riveting epic for the ages but that story is buried deep in intergalactic nonsense where aspects of fun and joy are far far away
Jan 4 2024,negative, subtlety nuance and detail are absent from rebel moon  part one a child of fire which is a shame given that the films striking trailer gave us new hope for a science fiction franchise that could rival its obvious biggest influence star wars the first chapter of the twopart film now available on netflix is entertaining enough given the nonsensical plot chaotic pacing flat characters and cliched dialogue the story begins in a small farming village on an independent moon called veldt this is of course set in a distant galaxy ruled by a militaristic empire named motherworld whose royal family was recently assassinated in an attempted coup the now reigning forces continue to rule the universe through violent conquests and war kora sofia boutella is one of the farmers on veldt with a mysterious past who has found a sense of purpose while living and working off the land im a child of war to truly love and be loved  i dont know if im capable of either kora says in one of the first scenes of the film in this early sequence the audience is presented with the main emotional thread of the story the real struggle kora has to face is herself when life in the village takes a dramatic turn koras existential journey begins this could have been presented in a more compelling way than through expositional dialogue which is present in almost every scene of the film exhaustively explaining everything thats happening to the audience instead of leaving room for them to derive meaning through the story itself alas admiral atticus noble ed skrein a brutal military leader from motherworld arrives to veldt with his loyal troops in tow noble demands and threatens the village to sell him their grain even if it means not having enough to feed themselves in retaliation kora sets off through the galaxy with a farmer named gunnar michiel huisman to gather a band of soldiers who will fight to bring down noble and his army meanwhile noble and his military legion are aboard a colossal space vessel named the kings gaze a frightening force that has wiped out whole planets and races one must ask why would their leaders focus be on grain from a small random village this should come as no surprise given snyders body of work which includes 300 watchmen and batman v superman dawn of justice he is a director who prioritises contrasting colour and dramatic lighting to create mood while producing grand theatrical compositions reminiscent of comics and graphic novels to captivate his audience while sometimes a little too stylised the cinematography special effects and choreographed fight scenes are visually engaging and do a lot of the world building on their own particularly giving hints of the galaxys history and mythology this is exactly what we want to see in a space opera  epic scenes in outer space where advanced technology warfare and interstellar battles are melodramatic and allconsuming these elements are well executed but they need to make sense action needs to be anchored otherwise its just movement there are many points at which it seems snyder has attempted to do so but he fails at every turn in one sequence kora and gunnar travel from one planet to the next to collect their band of outsiders and she narrates her own history with the motherworld and her connection to its current leader balisarius these flashbacks while visually appealing are woven into the story in a manner that feels a little blunt and amateur information is added but nothing is gained a mistake synder and his cowriters shay hatten john wick chapter 3 and 4 kurt johnstad atomic blond and 300 keep repeating throughout the film together this creative team has crafted a set of characters who are interesting only on the surface the details of how they look act and dress is part of a larger world that does make one curious to learn more but as soon as these characters open their mouths there is nothing there but jargon and hackneyed oneliners things do thankfully pick up towards the end which bodes well for the sequel heading to the platform in spring theres a powerful plot twist towards the end which ups the stakes of what the characters are fighting for this was done frustratingly enough without telling us much about the characters themselves making it hard to grab hold of its natural to be inspired by other films or literature the problem is how you use them in this case synder never manages to take the elements that he admired from other films and mould them to fit his own aesthetic and by extension create a solid and distinct world instead the stories and images that shaped him only serve to make his own world look undeveloped in comparison over and over again the film presents many missed opportunities for audiences to engage on an emotional level with the characters respective journeys delivering instead all the basic assumptions of an epic space opera perhaps its a formula that works for many since the film currently sits at number one on netflixs top 10 movie list in the uae but it takes more than beautiful images and expert fight choreography for a film to collate a massive fandom and become a longlasting cultural staple which this film is clearly intended for and this is the films ultimate issue in its desperation for epic moments rebel moon forgets about the intimate ones instead delivering microwave popcorn entertainment without much to feel connect with or remember
Jan 4 2024,positive,  the trailers for american fiction have been selling the feature as bamboozled in the publishing industry and while thats certainly the crux of the story it doesnt get to the root of what makes the film compelling based on the novel erasure by percival everett the movie follows thelonious monk ellison jeffrey wright a novelist pigeonholed into the african american studies genre

Jan 2 2024,negative, ive long been of the opinion that zack snyder does his best work when hes adapting someone elses writing films like 300 or dawn of the dead work well because they suit his admittedly remarkable visual creativity but are not bogged down by his sometimesshoddy storytelling snyder often has grand vision while also lacking the storytelling acumen to follow through on it which is how we get messy projects like batman v superman and army of the dead these issues are thrust to the forefront of his newest epic idea the space opera rebel moon recently released via netflix rebel moon purports to be a farflung wild odyssey of a band of diverse heroes in a fictional universe fighting against the tyranny of the motherworld the story centers on kora capably portrayed by sofia boutella a former soldier of the motherworld who fled its grasp to try to find peace on the quiet planet of veldt of course the forces of the motherworld  led by the sneering vicious yet oddly charming at times admiral atticus noble ed skrein come to this quiet little farming planet seeking conquest and subjugation in response kora begins a quest to find a collection of warriors to bring back to veldt to help them defend themselves against noble and his forces what follows is a curious collection of recruitment missions with kora traipsing about the galaxy with a fellow farmer michael huisman and a recruited renegade pilot named kai charlie hunnam over time they are joined by a lethal cyborg assassin doona bae a retired general and gladiator named titus djimon hounsou a rebel leader named  hilariously  darrian bloodaxe ray fisher and a mysterious animal whispererblacksmith staz nair this collective eventually faces off against the motherworlds forces setting the stage for the second film to be released in april 2024 rebel moon is a fascinating discussion point it is despite its proponents claims hardly an original story true there are few original stories in science fiction anymore and often stories will borrow from other sagas its hardly an unusual practice however rarely does one borrow so heavily and so hamfistedly as snyder does here rebel moon blurs that line between homage and copycatting clumsily and it makes for distracting storytelling this peculiar mashup of the magnificent seven or seven samurai if youre a purist star wars mass effect and a halfdozen other stories is so obvious as to make it distracting the film barely conceals its inspirationssource material and it suffers for it  its not helped by the fact that the film despite its 134minute runtime still manages to feel rushed theres little time to understand the motivations of its characters let alone get to know them since each recruitment is a tenminute vignette that feels jammed in there just to get the story rolling its awkward and jarring and throws the pacing of the film off completely of course this will theoretically be resolved with the inevitable and publicized release of a directors cut but theres no guarantee that expanding upon these issues will actually improve them thats not even covering the fact that deliberately cutting a movie down with the intent of rereleasing its full version later is such a commercially crass plan in the first place and a clearcut case of netflix trying to capitalize on the success of snyders justice league snydercut shenanigans where the film often does succeed is in its visual flair and snyders gift for action choreography while he still overrelies on slowmotion he continues to impress with how he assembles an action scene with flawless lighting and solid effects work combined with topnotch direction and for what its worth the actors mostly do well with what little theyre often given boutella whose dancer background gives her a natural physicality holds her own here as a star in a film filled with other more wellknown names and her costars both perform well while also giving her breathing room its a nicely rounded cast even if theyre stuck with some often derivative and stilted dialogue its with all this said that it becomes hard to say whether rebel moon is a good or bad film on the one hand how do you judge a film that does some things well but thats literally being released incomplete on the other hand theres no denying its failures in writing and originality and those are things that cannot be remedied in its future cut even more puzzling is why netflix chose to do things this way theyve obviously invested serious money in the project  why not simply turn it into an episodic project and give the story room to grow more organically instead of this weirdly bumpy film that feels as hastily assembled as its team of heroes its puzzling at the end of the day rebel moon technically its rebel moon  part one a child of fire but who has time to keep typing that out isnt a terrible film  certainly not worth the drubbing its been receiving but there are so many parts of it that struggle to work cohesively so many square pegs hammered into round holes that it becomes difficult to call it good either perhaps a directors cut will serve it well even if that very concept is infuriating in this context perhaps it will expand upon its flaws and expose them further what is clear is that regardless rebel moon is a visually arresting occasionally exciting film that borrows far too heavily from its predecessors to truly be called an original snyder project and suffers far too much from some strange combination of ego and greed to even be viewed on its own merits maybe you should just wait for the directors cut  but then again maybe that wont help at all only time will tell
Jan 1 2024,negative, andrew haigh the director of weekend and 45 years has made an emotionally powerful film that represents a contemporary queer take on field of dreams after all it isnt only heterosexual boomer farmers from iowa who would love the chance to interact and settle all their issues with their longdead parents  based on a japanese novel called strangers the film stars andrew scott from fleabag as a lonely writer named adam who lives in a gleaming but mysteriously empty apartment complex in london one day he meets a neighbor named harry paul mescal and they fall into a passionate affair at the same time adam suddenly gains the ability to visit his childhood home and interact with the ghosts of his parents jamie bell and claire foy who were killed in a crash when he was 12 years old  he essentially speedruns the experience of connecting with them and coming out to them  while explaining that life for gay people has changed a lot since they died in the late 1980s he eventually comes to terms with their deaths only doing so as an adult rather than as a child its all very affecting and beautifully rendered and i gather haigh shot the scenes in his own childhood home  its yet another searchlight pictures movie that feels like an a24 movie and fans of last years aftersun will be gladdened to know that paul mescal dancing in a club is once again an important part of the film  there are going to be many many arguments about the ending both what it means and whether or not it ruins the movie i think it works but the arguments its going to start are half the fun  michael mann has returned with his first film since blackhat eight years ago its a tightly focused biopic of italian car impresario enzo ferrari played this time by adam driver  its a compelling movie certainly manns best since miami vice back in 2006 although pardon the pun it never finds that extra gear ford v ferrari from back in 2019 but set a decade after this films events  but also featuring a big race at the end  was a better version of a similar idea  the film is set in 1957 and focuses on a specific moment still grieving his recently deceased son enzo ferrari is presiding over the mille miglia race while also considering selling a stake in his company hes also juggling his wife laura penelope cruz and a mistress lina shailene woodley laura at least nominally is all right with the mistresses both less all right with her husband having a secret son  yes this is the second movie in the past three years in which adam driver plays the head of a famous italian corporation and has sex with a woman on a table it recalls drivers 2019 parlay of marriage story and the report both of which featured scenes in which a lawyer tells drivers character he has to pay a retainer that hell never be able to afford  i had no trouble buying driver as an italian but had a bit more trouble buying the 40yearold actor as a man who was about 20 years older than that at the time and while cruz can do anything i had much more trouble buying woodley as an italian  george clooney as a director made an aboveaverage movie right out of the gate with confessions of a dangerous mind and followed it up with a nearmasterpiece in good night and good luck since then its been nothing but duds its almost impressive honestly  no its not as bad as suburbicon or leatherheads but clooneys latest film the boys in the boat is a completely perfunctory underdog sports movie that embraces every single cliche of the genre  based on a popular book of the same name the boys in the boat is about a rowing team from the university of washington in the 1930s who got to compete at the olympics in 1936 you know the ones in berlin that were presided over by hitler  the story is just told in the most uninteresting way possible with the rowers all played by generic handsome actors when the characters meet jesse owens it made me wish i was watching a movie about him instead  i can think of three different movies off the top of my head that were set at the 1936 olympics and were better than this one  even the one directed by leni riefenstahl that was pure nazi propaganda  im kind of getting sick of itll all make sense once you see the forthcoming directors cut thats an hour longer being used as a defense of movies that i didnt like i didnt buy that when it was about napoleon either  thats the case here with zack snyders latest spectacle now on netflix which lifts all sorts of aspects of star wars from its stated kurosawa influence to actual red light sabers its so star warsinspired that it even officially began life as a star wars movie that snyder wanted to make at one point  i made my peace with the snyder cut and even kind of liked it though im not about to justify that fanboy toxicity that went on for several years snyder has clear passion and talent but this one is a dud way too plagued by mumbo jumbo part ii is coming in april but i dont expect to remember much about part i a week from now much less in four months

Dec 30 2023,negative, less homage to star wars than it is a pastiche of that cultural juggernaut a strong sense of déjà vu hangs over zack snyders rebel moon unfortunately in plainly appealing to the memory of its vastly superior inspiration so many times it inadvertently reminds viewers of how much better its muse is there are far too many direct copycat scenes here for rebel moon to craft anything like an identity of its own but its derivativeness might be forgivable were it not so selfconsciously humorlessly straining for epicness rebel moon rises with narration from anthony hopkins and an operatic score  a promise of grandness it never lives up to at twohoursplus this dreadnought announces its lofty ambitions for future franchise status at every turn but never once earns it the dialogue is creakingly expository and the acting is spotty ultimately making it feel like the film has lazily assumed its already secured all the interest it needs to justify a potential two further sequels and a galaxy of tiein media though there are bright spots that suggest an actual movie lurks somewhere deep within its 134 minutes rebel moon instead feels like a laborious couple of hours of scenesetting that arrogantly banks on you returning for more despite doing little to deserve any more of your time there are moments when rebel moon nearly earns its selfseriousness like the gripping introduction of bae doonas lightsaberwielding nemesis or the moment boutellas kora rouses djimon hounsous disgraced depressed military general with an appeal not to his honor but to his desire for revenge unfortunately these glints of the film redeeming itself are almost entirely diluted in the general narrative sludge that surrounds them and thus cant do much to entice you back for the directors cut that netflix has cynically already teased despite having the power to have simply released that instead coproduced by pedro almodóvar this tumultuous argentine anthology film tests the limits of human sanity when pushed to the extremes  and will also test yours
Dec 29 2023,neutral, bereft of new ideas beholden to silly slomo shenanigans let it be known that writerdirector zack snyders rebel moon is only truly harmful to those of us who care about proper punctuation netflix appears to have it as rebel moon  part one a child of fire rotten tomatoes and imdb have it as rebel moon part one  a child of fire what in the em dash is going on here where does the colon belong thats a weird question to be asking given that a subset of snyders fandom is so toxic they almost certainly have their heads in the orifice necessary to locate that organ punctuation contemplation is more thought than anyone else has invested in anything involving rebel moon part one a child of fire that joke was lowhanging fruit but this is pretty much lowhanging fruit  the movie and thats okay sometimes hodgepodging together various elements of the timeless epic monomyth and throwing in some mildly original element like say a wizard wand can be pretty profitable jk but not really the problem is that snyder didnt throw in anything even mildly original he literally pitched star wars executives on a redundant seven samurai in space idea that was remade as recently as season one of the mandalorian when they passed netflix gave him eleventy billion dollars to do it anyway without using lucasfilm intellectual property there are still glowing space swords intergalactic governmental oppressors who shop at nazi gap and even problematic parentage everyone must applaud the restraint snyder showed in not introducing a tinybutpowerful character who speaks backwards named adoy if you find yourself saying adoy frequently you wont be alone the entirety of rebel moons first installment would be a minuteslong montage in most movies atticus noble ed skrein a galactic goebbels shows up to a small farming planet and says feed our army or well kill you all this doesnt sit well with kora sofia boutella who has a complicated past she doesnt like talking about do you think maybe shes good at killing stuff kora and gunnar michiel huisman skip around the universe picking up antiheroes to assist the farmers in fighting the fascists thats right the whole stinkin thing is the i know just the person we need if only theyll agree to help scene from a billion other better films snyder notoriously addicted to slowed motion has reached his zenith by making an entire movie out of a montage its not a movie actually legally sure technically yes but realistically no this is the introduction to characters like nemesis bae doona bloodaxe ray fisher and titus djimon hounsou which are names given to characters by actual grownups theres also a robot voiced by anthony hopkins named jimmy he wears a set of antlers at one point nothing really happens other than the group is assembled the fight at the end is so wholly inconsequential that it really only serves to finally reveal who are main character actually is it feels like a prequel to a movie series that doesnt exist snyders unique visual flair is quasiirresistible the recycled parts from better stories gin up just enough interest the unoriginality doesnt hit as offensive just lazy and although everything feels like a video game cut scene that introduces playable charactersthey would probably be fun to play with again to be clear this is not a movie it isnt even really the first part of a movie it is a liveaction adaptation of the cast of characters the biggest fear here is that streaming services without concerns about theatrical experiences who are content to blur the line between tv series and movies are producing mushy messes that dont work as either content form if this is the next step in the degradation of cinema wow is it hilarious that the horseman of the apocalypseis zack snyder gissane sophia at marvelous geeks media says its hard to decipher who were meant to trust and what relationship were meant to invest in here in no way shape or form does rebel moon part one feel like it knows what it wants to be siddhant adlakha at joy sauce says while it avoids hollywoods penchant for orientalism and instead uses its designs to create an explicit antiimperial and anticolonial text it fails to live up to both its eastern and western influences and exists only as a malformed piece of marketing for something better dr medlen at the mary sue says rebel moon puts the snyder spin on a space epic and delivers a wild ride from start to finish its not shakespeare but it sure is fun
Dec 29 2023,negative, permit me to take a short stroll down memory lane its 1977 and i have convinced my parents to take me to the movie theater at the tyrone gardens in st petersburg to see star wars  not star wars episode iv  a new hope because no one knew that this was the first film in what would become a multibilliondollar franchise when i viewed the film for the first time it was still just star wars an epic space opera boasting a narrative built upon a mythic structure model with traditional archetypes it was still just gratifying scifi fantasy with space battles and laser swords soon the film would become embedded in popular culture with creator and director george lucas reaping the benefits of a merchandising juggernaut the success of the first star wars film enabled lucas to make more films  both sequels and prequels  and to expand his fictional universe as he explored the skywalker saga but before star wars became a pop culture phenomenon lucas had no guarantee there would be a continuation of the series the original star wars works as a standalone story conveyed in an easytofollow threeact structure that clearly identifies the struggle between good and evil and provides the audience with a satisfying resolution to the conflicts it requires no followup but it depicts such wonderfully rendered compelling characters in vivid settings that the audience wants to see more more adventures more alien worlds and well more merchandise the first problem with rebel moon  part one a child of fire is that it lacks a satisfying resolution to the conflicts it introduces directed by zack snyder the first installment of the epic space opera was released in select theaters on dec 15 before making its streaming debut on netflix on dec 21 synder also intends to drop an extended cut in early 2024 before releasing rebel moon  part two the scargiver on april 19 the film revolves around kora sofia boutella a woman with a mysterious past who has been embraced by a peaceful settlement of farmers on the moon veldt when admiral atticus noble ed skrein arrives demanding tribute in the form of food to fill the bellies of his troops kora warns the community that this emissary of the tyrannical regent balisarius fra fee will take everything from them unless they fight because the farmers arent equipped to defend themselves the burden of finding fighters willing to risk their lives falls upon kora she and gunnar michiel huisman a nonviolent but pragmatic farmer travel to a cantina in mos eisley  sorry scratch that i mean they visit a seedy bar full of aliens in the port town of providence where they meet kai charlie hunnam a smuggler who can provide transportation on his stealthy spaceship  along the way kora and gunnar recruit general titus djimon hounsou a legendary but disgraced commander living on a world assembled from ridley scotts gladiator props and set dressings nemesis doona bae a master swordswoman who battles the love child of shelob and the borg queen before joining the campaign and tarak staz nair a noble prince possessing tarzans rapport with animals who for some incomprehensible reason must ride a creature that looks like buckbeaks second cousin to gain his freedom snyder is cherry picking tropes and cinematic elements to fill in gaps in the narrative rebel moon  part one a child of fire evokes pays homage to and draws inspiration from the work of edgar rice burroughs tolkien pierre christin robert a heinlein and poul anderson and from films such as julie taymors titus john sturges the magnificent seven and the original star wars trilogy  snyders primary influence must have been akira kurosawas seven samurai which also shaped the magnificent seven with sturges altering the storys setting to the old west snyder adapts it to fit the space opera mold  but hes not the first to make that leap in 1980 roger corman  in a blatant attempt to capitalize on the popularity of star wars  produced battle beyond the stars a film promoted as magnificent seven in outer space directed by jimmy t murakami this lowbudget endeavor starred richard thomas as shad a young akira farmer who enlists various mercenaries to save his people from sador john saxon leader of the very naughty malmori raiders  snyders take is undeniably a superior film in terms of scope and production with the directors signature style making it visually appealing but rebel moon  part one a child of fire suffers from a scarcity of characterization emotion and narrative subtleties the script lacks nuance genuine tension warmth and humor snyders characters are tiresomely serious to the point of being tedious it shouldnt be this difficult to root for the reluctant hero kora it shouldnt be this taxing riding along as she goes planethopping to round up her allies  i should be able to take skrein seriously as the fascist villain but every time atticus noble is on screen i keep seeing rik mayalls character rick from the young ones the two most promising characters in the film  jc1435 a sentient battle robot voiced by anthony hopkins and sam charlotte maggi a young woman from the farming settlement on veldt  have limited screen time in the first installment of the saga maybe there will be more story better pacing and expanded depth to the characters in snyders extended cut maybe rebel moon  part two the scargiver will somehow improve the first installment i hope that is the case because snyder is capable of making films that are both dazzling and entertaining i honestly want to like this product the characters have the potential to be interesting their cause is one that should resonate with the viewer their universe is filled with gorgeous alien planets and races that could be a prolific source of future storytelling but snyder needs to give the viewer some reason to empathize with the heroes to cheer them on to victory and to yearn to explore the uncharted worlds beyond the pages of the script  lee

Dec 29 2023,negative, a tedious slog through an avalanche of genre clichés made worse by an air of pretentiousness and ponderous selfimportance zack snyders latest piece of netflix bombast rebel moon part one  a child of fire spends over two hours of worldbuilding to create a place no sane viewer would ever want to visit once let alone the multiple times its subtitle suggests were meant to go back to it  its an excruciating bore the plot is supposedly an original creation of snyder and cowriters kurt johnstad and shay hatten but actually a derivative hodgepodge of bits and pieces of other better movies with classics by kurosawa and lucas the main models  it involves a growing rebellion against an evil empire by some of its oppressed people and the recruitment of members to join its ranks  and after overloading us with laborious exposition elephantine backstory and a repetitious sequence of episodes that are onehalf ponderous talk and the other chaotic fights that often slip into slowmotion for presumed effect and always conclude with a shot of the planethopping recruitment ship flying off for its next destination it has the temerity to close with the observation that weve just witnessed the beginning of something  one could only wish that it were the beginning of something else some of the narration is delivered in the instantly recognizable tones of anthony hopkins who provides the voice of a robot named jimmy once a warrior but now ensconced on a moon called veldt where a bedraggled community of farmers led by sindri corey stoll wearing a most unbecoming beard ekes out a handtomouth existence  hopkins fortunately for him doesnt actually have to appear in the movie  jimmy is played by dustin ceithamer so hopkins is basically doing a james earl jones thing veldt is part of the empire or imperium controlled by the motherworld which was once a monarchy whose king carey elwes and queen rhian rees hoped that their angelic daughter princess issa stella grace fitzgerald would usher in a new era of peace and harmony  but as we learn through narration and gauzy flashbacks the royal family was assassinated and power was seized by belisarius fra fee a militaristic tyrant whose chief henchman atticus noble ed skrein dressed in quasinazi garb cruises about the galaxy in a huge dreadnought tasked with snuffing out any remnants of resistance to the new order  one of his stops is veldt where he demands that the community provide grain for his crew  when some protest that compliance would mean their own starvation noble responds with murder and a simple takeover of the place before departing naturally his action causes distress and kora sofia boutella an outsider who was taken in by the farmers when she crash landed on veldt becomes an instigator of resistanceit will later be revealed that she was an imperial warrior who turned against the regime and thus a wanted fugitive  shes joined by handsome farmer gunnar michiel huisman whos besotted with her and together they persuade kai charlie hunnam a rogue pilot who for some reason speaks with an irish brogue to ferry them to other planets to seek out warriors to join in the protection of their moon at this point the movie turns into a repetitive formula in which the three travel to some locale where they can approach a noteworthy prospect to join them in each case snyder structures the episode to begin with visuals attesting to the otherworldly character of the place the production designers were stephen swain and stefan dechant the costumer stephanie porter and lots of surpassingly banal conversation before securing a yes which is followed by a gigantic fight he tries to jazz up with bursts of superspeeded up action and slowmotion for effect  by the time all the stopovers are complete the intrepid trio have found a group of supposedly charismatic companions titus djimon hounsou a former imperial general now a drunken layabout nemesis doona bae a swordswoman whose weapons shoot out beams of light energy tarak staz nair an enslaved smithy whos also an exceptional animalwhisperer and darrian bloodaxe ray fisher whose moniker is descriptive of his talents  by the close theyre all headed back for veldt and presumably a confrontation with noble whos shown receiving a set of stern marching orders from his sneering master belisarius snyder adds a plethora of genre piffle to amplify the plot at one point for example tarak takes flight aboard a weird winged creature that proves the writerdirector knows his harryhausen as well as kurosawa and lucas and at another jenna malone camps it up as a ravenous alien spiderwoman who does battle with nemesis  such stuff only increases the nonsensicality of it all the picture increasingly feels like a grabbag of cheesy tropes for the most part realized in mediocre cgi the effects supervisors were marcus taormina and john dj desjadin and shot in the same dark murky style that snyder brought to the series of dcu movies he oversaw and which acting as his own cinematographer he repeats here  editor dody dorn can do little to mitigate the monotony of the story and the visuals and while tom holkenborgs score ladles out music intended to inspire awe its to no avail nor can the cast bring much zest to the sodden material though theyre induced to pour a lot of energy into the attempt  boutella makes an athletic if inexpressive heroine and skreins sleazy villainy carries a certain campy charm but the rest cant invest their cardboard characters with any sort of inner life 
Dec 28 2023,neutral, zack snyders rebel moon part one  a child of fire is a cumbersome disjointed space version of a bugs life thats solely saved and made viewable because of its outstanding cast while visually stunning and somewhat engaging enough to keep a viewers attention the writing is all over the place making it constantly questionable why were supposed to care the dialogue is so clunky at times that even the deliveries coming from great actors feel forced in every way rebel moon wants to be an epic with such intensity that it loses itself in an attempt to tell a compelling story the cgi is acceptable some of the creatures are genuinely riveting as are the characters but the pacing fumbles in its endeavor to take us through various sectors of different times and places its obvious the film is meant to encompass one part of a story but the arc doesnt feel contained enough to leave a mark theres much to be desired sure but its hard to predict whether the second half will even manage to save it theres also something to be said about how the film couldve fleshed out relationships more to make it additionally appealing in the grand scheme of storytelling part of the reason why star wars a new hope works so well despite the slow steadiness of its narrative approach is because the character dynamics its setting up are thoroughly engrossing from beginning to end its hard to decipher who were meant to trust and what relationship were meant to invest in here in no way shape or form does rebel moon part one feel like it knows what it wants to be however its imperative to note that sofia boutella is an undeniable star kora is the most magnetic character in the story and diving further into her past could have made the story even more inviting whatever we follow her through feels earned and thoughtfully crafted which is also entirely due to boutellas performances its clear as day that the actress is aware of her characters heart and motives in a way that helps to bring the best to the surface michiel huisman djimon hounsou charlie hunnam and stuart martin also do an incredible job with the material theyre given quiet moments in the film result in some of the most vulnerable displays of humanity but theyre so scarce that its not enough to save the narrative from falling apart whether the rrated directors cut makes a difference is hard to tell but when a film is released with this many questions left in the air you have to ask yourself what the purpose of it is anyway whos running the show leaving one version clunky while another could potentially shine and who has the time and patience to commit to both for a visually stunning film of this caliber its unfortunate that the plot and characterizations dont match the beauty the third act is especially gorgeous and the final few scenes leave off with the kind of space explosions that are always enjoyable to see for those of us who love the genre still its not enough to make rebel moon part one a child of fire a film worth watching more than once or one thatll be well remembered either
Dec 28 2023,negative, is there anything left to write about zack snyder he is a polarising figure in film communities although i am unsure if polarising is the right word polarising tends to refer to filmmakers who present challenging loveitorhateit content or who address controversial topics in snyders case the vigorous and oftentimes angry debate is over whether or not his films are actually any good or if he himself has a reasonable amount of talent it is a debate that has raged throughout his directorial career personally i tend to sit on the fence i liked his 2004 remake of dawn of the dead as i did his underrated man of steel trilogy of films 201321 on the other hand his 300 2007 and watchmen 2009 adaptations left me cold and i actively loathed his 2011 original sucker punch my personal bottom line is that snyder has a strong visual aesthetic that tends to overuse cgi and slow motion that he is a deft hand at replicating other peoples imagery but that he has no story sense whatsoever this is a shame because i get the very strong impression that snyder would not agree rebel moon is snyders latest work a muchhyped science fiction epic broken into two parts the second comes next april it sees an interplanetary military force arrive at a remote agrarian community and violently demand they hand over all of their harvest with no way for the community to defend itself a solo representative travels to the neighbouring planets in the search of soldiers and mercenaries who will come to their aid if the premise sounds familiar it is because it is akira kurosawa filmed it in 1954 as seven samurai or perhaps you recognise it from john sturges 1960 remake the magnificent seven or from john lasseter and andrew stantons a bugs life 1998 which liberally lifts from the original story as well as does dean parisots galaxy quest 1999 tsui harks seven swords 2005 and  most pertinently  jimmy t murakamis scifi potboiler battle beyond the stars 1980 even gareth edwards 2016 star wars feature rogue one cribs liberally from kurosawas original playbook the point is that for all of netflixs hyping of rebel moon as an exciting new space opera it is actually based on pretty wellfurrowed ground this is not necessarily a bad thing as all of the previous films mentioned have demonstrated the execution of an old story is as much a key to success as the story itself with enormous scope to remix and innovate snyder has instead gathered together a painfully obvious collection of i hesitate to write influences as that seems to give snyder too much credit things to photocopy and then mash together feels rather more appropriate star wars is a very dominant influence but it is also easy to see imagery cribbed from a wide range of anime productions korean cinema and the popular wargame warhammer 40000 in most cases this assembled pastiche inspires a bored overfamiliarity rather than any sense of remix or play the film is generic pulp which will likely find an undemanding audience but reeks of missed opportunities it is also particularly unsubtle its villain played by ed skrein does not simply resemble a nazi like star wars galactic empire he is literally dressed as one there is an oddly talented cast here including sofia boutella charlie hunnam djimon hounsou and anthony hopkins but they are left hanging by a screenplay that does not provide them with any material to build upon my advice watch battle beyond the stars at the time of writing it is streaming on amazon prime it offers the same basic story has its own talented cast including john saxon george peppard and robert vaughn and never tries to pretend it is anything more than shameless pulp entertainment it also provides a complete story with beginning middle and end  rebel moon demands you come back in four months for that i imagine more than a few viewers will not bother
Dec 27 2023,positive, two months after the may 1980 release of the empire strikes back in us cinemas came a seven samuraimagnificent seven in space knockoff that was out to capitalise on empires pull and which is most notable for the upandcoming talents offcamera it had a script by future oscar nominee john sayles a score by titanic oscar winner james horner and special effects by a certain james cameron from little cosmic acorns grow battle beyond the stars doesnt loom large in anorak lore but it does come to mind watching netflixs rebel moon  part one a child of fire as 300 and justice league director zack snyder repackages the seven samuraimagnificent seven narrative for a twopart space opera the second instalment the scargiver is due next april this scenesetter sees a farming community on the planet veldt terrorised by the army of the mother world who need the crops to feed the troops figuring its better to die on your feet than live on your knees mysterious villager kora sofia boutella packs her bags and heads off to put together a bunch of hired gunsswords that can lead the farmers in fighting back theres loads of melodrama here and rebel moon takes itself very seriously but it will be no hardship for anyone with a thing for scifi action boutella is good in the set pieces theres a decent supporting cast anthony hopkins voices a robot charlie hunnams smuggler has wait for it a belfast accent and the nostalgia synapses will be firing goodo keep the movie reference bingo card handy with a cliffhanger ending snyder has nicely set up part two describing it as a war movie chances are youll be pitching up on veldt again next april  rté 2024 rtéie is the website of raidió teilifís éireann irelands national public service media rté is not responsible for the content of external internet sites  images courtesy of getty images 
Dec 27 2023,negative,snyder has created possibly the worst movie of his career which is edited to pieces filled with bland characters horrendous visuals and an ohsofamiliar story that leaves little interest in the upcoming future installment and inevitable extended cut
Dec 26 2023,negative, no matter how much snow or how many elves you have to offer what most people really want from a film at christmas is blockbuster action we know this from box office and streamer stats and its backed up by basic psychology the year is coming to a close weve worked hard and experienced a fair bit of stress its cold daylight is at a premium and many of us are keeping company with family member who for all that we might love them definitely get on our nerves of course we want to see something explode zack snyder understands that in this part one of a hopedfor new saga with filming on part two already underway he takes all the classic elements of the science fiction or fantasy action spectacular and condenses them for our viewing pleasure the result is a ridiculous mess but it may nonetheless be just what you need it reminded this reviewer more than anything of 1980 schlock classic battle beyond the stars itself a scifi takes on the magnificent seven which was of course based on akira kurosawas magnificent seven samurai snyder knows how to deliver space opera by numbers and twee as it is the amount of clichés that he manages to pack into a single film is impressive its a film which deserves to be watched in a group and enthusiastically heckled with a bit of popcornthrowing to add to the fun the dialogue is or course uniformly terrible the very idea of love and family was beaten out of me says heroine kora sofia boutella at the start letting us know what were in for shes a former outlaw and it turns out a lot of other things hiding out in a galactic backwater with a group of subsistencefarming vikings dont ask she wants to stop running find a peaceful home and all the rest of it but those hopes are thwarted when a large spaceship known as a dreadnaught suddenly lands there are a troupe of space nazis strolls out of it the uniforms have been adapted a bit the hats less so they want pretty much all the grain the place can produce which would leave the locals to starve kora insists its not her problem but changes her mind when a local girl is with extreme gratuitousness but hey snyder managed a whole 28 minutes before going there this time threatened with rape a spectacularly silly fight sequence follows and after that kora basically has no choice but to set out to lead a rebellion against the allpowerful bad guys before they find and kill her and everyone shes ever known accompanying her is ordinary farm boy gunnar in the absence of any available chris hes played by michiel huisman who does his best impression of a chris most of the rest of the film concerns their efforts to build an army this starts with kai charlie hunnam a scruffy looking pilot who describes himself as a bit of an opportunist they go on to acquire tarak staz nair a longhaired muscular slave guy with a secret past who intuitively understands animals beastmasterstyle and who never deigns to put on any more clothes no matter where they go next up is nemesis bae doona who in the absence of lines does her best to make her presence felt by glowering shes a swordwielding warrior with a strict honour code and a thirst for revenge who sometimes uses thinly disguised lightsabers instead just in case you thought that was enough of a stereotype we also get bloodaxe ray fisher a black revolutionary with dreadlocks and heavy forehead makeup perhaps inspired by furiosa who fights with a spear finally theres titus djimon hounsou a disgraced former general whose feelings of guilt about the deaths of his men have driven him to alcoholism oh and theres some lassie with woad on her face apropos of nothing although youd think these characters didnt need much building snyder spends a fair bit of time on it and thats not such a bad thing because it means that we get to see nemesis fight a giant spider monster which is really bad at fighting back like many a snyder bad guy but its still fun tarak bonds with an utterly adorable giant ravengriffin thingy which despite the cgi has something of the charm of an old stopmotion harryhausen creation theres a lot of great creature design especially in the background where one imagines that the effects team were more at liberty to play ed skreins lead bad guy spends his private time getting intimate with a tentacle monster and the abundance of such details helps to give the various worlds a livedin feel despite the shallowness of the actual plot parts of it are in poor taste that initial attempted rape is not the only incidence of sexual violence and for all that snyder thinks hes being clever by turning things round with his heroine coming to the rescue theres a nastiness about it which sits awkwardly in what is otherwise quite an amiable little adventure movie likewise the little lectures about the need for everybody to be more cynical and preemptively violent are as out of place as they are philosophically vapid the film is at its best when not pretending to be clever theres a lot of fighting involving numerous ridiculous stunts and though its not particularly well shot it keeps things pacey there are glamorous costumes and shiny weapons there are explosions which are both orange and teal at the same time a large budget was no doubt splurged on this but in essence its a great little bmovie and if you go into it expecting that you wont be too disappointed
Dec 26 2023,positive,getting right down to it it is entertaining an entertaining mess with a bevy of problems in the character department but still somewhat fun 
Dec 26 2023,neutral,as a fan of zack snyder star wars and space fantasy i wanted to love this film  but its simply not good enough in its current form theres some inspired moments but the story and script are devoid of any creativity
Dec 26 2023,neutral, so we are back time to catch up on some more recent movie reviews i forgot to share my best of the year video in my last post but dont miss it i honestly put off seeing this movie because it seemed very pretentious but when i actually went to see it it was actually quite accessible and engrossing in fact it almost made my best of the year video but was a strong honorable mention basically anatomy of a fall is a compelling crime courtroom drama where we are asked to question if a woman killed her husband or is it the accident she claims the movie keeps you guessing to the end as it layers clues through court testimony and flashbacks its the kind of movie multiple people could watch and have different opinions about sandra hüller is excellent and very good in zone of interest that i reviewed in the last post as the main protagonist as is milo machado graner as her son daniel its the kind of movie hollywood would ruin with poorly staged melodrama instead of trusting the audience with ambiguities and flawed characters it is an r rating but i think a lot of people would be entertained by this film its not the arthouse niche film i thought it was at first as a lover of anime i am always looking for ways to introduce friends to the artform in accessible and engrossing ways the first slam dunk is such a film and one of my favorite films of 2023 its a simple movie that tells us the story of a high school basketball team thats trying to compete and manage the stresses of their personal lives as we get to know the players on and off the court director takehiko inoue does a great job of building the importance of the big game and even the big shot so we are waiting with baited breath to see what will happen the game scenes are so well done my only regret is having to watch it at home and not on the big screen it was only at my theater for one weekend and i missed it which i bitterly regret even so what a compelling film that almost anyone will enjoy my only flaw with it is i think the character designs look like professional athletes rather than high school students i guess thats the way the manga is but it did take me out of the story a couple of times still i highly recommend the first slam dunk i am not a wrestling fan but my friend ryan cam is and he had prepared me for this upcoming film the iron claw and the intense tale it is telling i know people hate spoilers but this is a film where i do think knowing what you are getting into is a good idea particularly with how triggering it could be for some individuals 2 characters commit suicide the crazy thing is in real life there was another brother in the von erich family that committed suicide that they left out i have rarely been more angry at a character than i was at the father played by holt mccallany in this film you think about all the people who would do anything for a child and then to see the way this man manipulates and abuses his children its infuriating the only thing he cared about was wrestling not the humans he was entrusted with zac efron is excellent as one of the brothers kevin as is jeremy allen white as kerry its a tough sit but extremely moving and i do recommend it if only for the incredible performances i really disliked the first trailer for migration because it felt like another middling entry from illumination after being disappointed by their the super mario bros movie earlier this year my hopes werent high for this bird movie but then the trailers started to get better and with director benjamin renner at the helm i had more confidence and that optimism was not in vain this is probably my favorite film from illumination and ended up being a very enjoyable family film the story is pretty basic with the road trip and the neurotic parent scared to leave the nest but the script by mike white is funny and the voice acting is all well done the only thing i would change is we didnt really need the overthetop chef villain hes fine for the restaurant scene but didnt need to stay throughout the film theres enough drama going on with the journey we didnt need a supervillain complicating things but this is an entertaining funny wellwritten adventure the whole family will love i actually hadnt watched robot dreams when my colleagues at ufca nominated it for best animated film im the animation girl so i was a little embarrassed they selected something i hadnt seen so i immediately watched my screener dvd for it and am so glad they selected it what a delightful animated film it instantly went up my list of the best movies of 2023 im so sad that not many have seen this film because it is so charming its a simple story of a dog that makes a robot to be his best friend and the amazing summer they have together i love the hand drawn animation by pablo berger and the way the movie uses music is so endearing it might be my favorite use of september by earth wind  fire ever in a movie this movie is joy in movie form and i adored it keep an eye out for it if you can see it in a theater or on streaming i actually wasnt a big fan of 2017s loving vincent while the visual style of using van goghs paintings to make an animated film was impressive the story was not captivating for a feature film if you loved that film i am not sure what you will think of the teams followup the peasants but it also wasnt for me while the visual style is unique it feels slicker and less arresting than loving vincent and the story here is so relentlessly bleak it was hard to watch this is an animated film for adults where a young teen begins an affair with a married man and ends up marrying his father and things get expectedly messy with rape and assault involved throughout the picture its very depressing without the moving moments of something depressing like the iron claw i just really didnt enjoy it despite the impressive visual achievement its no secret to anyone who follows movies that director zack snyder can be very divisive in his films he has a huge hive that devotedly follows everything he does and then a large group that cant stand most of his work hes normally not my favorite but i do like some films like his most recent zack snyders justice league now he is releasing a new scifi epic that was evidently originally pitched to lucasfilm as a star wars film but was not accepted and sent over to netlflix i was able to see it on the big screen and left confused by what snyder had put together for an epic scifi film it was surprisingly small in feel for most of the movie a lot of the first half is spent on a farming planet and people confronted with a nazi type character played by ed skrein and what they are going to do about it then sofia boutellas kora goes out into space to try and find warriors ala the magnificent seven and seven samurai but in space the second half does get more epic in feel but its still arrive at a planet talk to people and maybe have a little bit of action small when i expected big i guess snyder has an entirely different cut of the movie which is very annoying especially when a film has a limited theatrical so it doesnt need to be pg13 it feels like a phony attempt to create a snyder cut movement where none needed to occur still the movie is fine if you like scifi but nothing special its not offensively bad just forgettable id rather just watch star wars even though that franchise has been pretty bad lately at least it has occasional characters and places i care about this is bland and left me pretty meh for part 2 which i think says a lot i would like to put in a longer review of the boy and the heron particularly when i get the chance to see it again when i am more rested i actually saw it opening night at a midnight screening so i was pretty tired and did struggle to stay awake throughout the entire movie still its definitely an impressive visual achievement full of imagination and creativity the type of film only miyazaki could come up with i also loved the music by joe hisaishi and i hope the academy will finally recognize his genius with a nomination the story was a lot and kind of all over the place but it left me intrigued to see it again and study its themes it also has a lot of weird birds which arent exactly my favorite still i have a feeling its a movie that will grow on me the more i see it and its always a treat to see a miyazaki film in the theaters more please obviously im a big fan of romcoms and for the most part this year has been a really good year for the genre both on the big and small screen so i was excited for anyone but you an r rated modern take on much ado about nothing seemed like just my thing but i came away thinking it was just ok  the parts where it leans into the shakespeare play work the best and glen powell is so good as your romantic lead unfortunately sydney sweeney felt very wooden and that impacted the chemistry between the two the physical comedy didnt really work and the supporting cast is mostly wasted fans of the genre will enjoy it but it just could have been so much better lately i have been enjoying indian action cinema a lot more than what hollywood is providing they have a spectacle and excitement you dont get in many american films these days this is why i jumped at the chance to see the new film from prashanth neel starring prabhas called salaar part 1 ceasefire its a mouthful of a title and a whole lot of movie to match but it mostly was a big bombastic fun time at the cinema prabhas is such a titan in these roles and the action is visceral and extremely bloody if you are squeamish about blood dont see this one it does get confusing and the subtitles felt very fast but overall i enjoyed the experience of this crazy wild film i do wish it had dance and music like other indian cinema ive seen like rrr and the  baahubali films but this is enjoyable as well so there you have it i did it thats all the movies ive seen in the last few weeks merry christmas to you and thank you for supporting my career and everything i do 
Dec 25 2023,neutral,with a decent villain portrayed by ed skrein fascinating visuals by snyder and the promise of an impressive saga rebel moon is a safe start to a potential new space opera
Dec 25 2023,positive, first things first i did not hate rebel moon part 1 a child of fire i didnt love it i didnt hate it i came away from the movie with mixed feelings then again i have mixed feelings about the first star wars which i do love but which is undeniably a rough draft of what george lucas and his collaborators eventually came up with across the original trilogy rebel moon is not a trilogy and thats my first complaint i am not a fan of these twopart movies a movie should be one film or three films two is an awkward number especially for what is obviously intended to be a major space opera epic too much and too little were attempted and achieved in part 1 the pacing is a mess it moves too slowly much of the time yet the storythe important pieces like character developmentare rushed through and glossed over my second complaint is that so much of the movie makes so little sense yes i can understand how a giant space empire needs food to feed its soldiers no i cant see how a group of five or six warriors even supplemented with three or four squads of rebel fighters will be able to fight off a massive dreadnought ship and its battalions of wellarmed troops i liked the twist and the betrayal toward the end of the movie but i thought the means by which our heroes escape quite preposterous who designed those scorpion chair robots theyre very cool butwhy would you make the paralyzing device the same as the key and how would the farmer gunnar know that it would have made more sense for kai to be playing a deeper twistier game here rebel moon part 1 functions like the beginning of seven samurai or the magnificent seven or well the three amigos a village comes under threat by a powerful enemy and a group of rougharoundtheedges heroes are gathered to help the villagers fight back the problem here is scale if snyder had made the enemy a group of space pirates or some kind of evil space biker gang or something fine even just a local officer manning this planet who cracks down to forcefully but were talking about a massive multistarsystem force thats conquered known space and is willing to throw all its might at these villagers i dont buy it the actual gathering of the heroes is also poorly paced we get a massively extended scene of tarak breaking and then riding a space griffon with lots of snyder slomo to slow things down further torn straight out of the harry potter hippogriff scenes but then when they find general titus a slovenly drunk now but still ripped its one motivational speech and off we go rebel moon is basically pg13 star wars in a lot of waysyou wont hear that kind of language in a galaxy far far away or have scenes with attempted sexual assaultbut its never as charming or funny the characters arent terrible but the most likeable among them ends up being a bad guy theres not nearly enough comic relief which directors like snyder seem to never realize helps us care and bond with characters so that we care more when bad things happen to them comic relief helps create tension i could go on and on about all the little things that didnt make sense in this movie but the long and short of it is simple with a little more time and a stronger script this could have been a tremendous space opera instead it was merely enjoyable i didnt find it half so terrible as the reviews made it sound all the worst movies ever talk seems rather overthetop and breathless to me in fact id say i like this more than any of snyders films since the old days of 300 watchmen and the dawn of the dead sure its derivative so is star wars im fine with derivative works especially in the swordandplanet genre john carter was around long before dune i dont begrudge frank herbert for riffing off of edgar rice burroughs or george lucas riffing off of herbert and akira kurosawa or zack snyder riffing off all of the above ive had my own ideas for swordandplanetandsamurai stories were all influenced by a million things the problem with rebel moon is that it doesnt do enough to establish itself as something unique and coherent maybe that will change when we have part 2 but i wish snyder had come up with some better hooks some more obvious ways to make this universe special and distinct rather than just a hodgepodge of other peoples ideas and yet at the same time it felt mostly very capable as a somewhat darker edgier star wars wooden characters and flimsy plot aside i enjoyed the action and was mostly entertained throughout if anything it suffered from many of the same problems the sequel trilogy suffered from which were often pacing issues recall the original star wars trilogy did such a great job at two things first it gave us great characters we cared about second it spent meaningful time establishing a sense of place in each of its films we got to know planets like tatooine dagobah hoth the moon of endor the death star cloud city and so forth in the sequel trilogy and in rebel moon the places we go are barely established at all and utterly forgettable the characters have potential but we hardly scratch the surface still i like them for the most part i like sofia boutellas kora i almost titled this review the legend of kora though i wish snyder had picked better ways to reveal her past to us than long expositionladen flashbacks charlie hunnams kai was a lot of fun though helike all the othersgets a little lost in the mix of introducing so many characters in so short a span the robot jimmy is an instant favorite thanks to the wonderful voice work from anthony hopkins more jimmy please djimon hounsous general titus didnt get enough screentime at all perhaps half of these characters should have been introduced in the second movie in the fictional trilogy i wish this was and michiel huismans gunnar and bae doonas swordwielding nemesis not to mention the surprisingly sympathetic spidermonsterlady she fights meanwhile the special effects sound design costumes and cinematography were all topnotch i really liked this films take on laser blasters which pop holes right through people nemesiss swords arent quite lightsabers though they looked like that in the trailer rather theyre normal swords that heat up into glowing fireblades i just wish that all this attention to detail had been given a little more room to breathewhich is a sentiment i hold toward the characters and the dialogue as well i suppose much of my enjoyment here is probably due to the exceptionally low expectations i came into the movie with i was fully expecting it to be dreadful at every turn but it was more like a fast food cheeseburger not bad really just nothing particularly unique and not the type of burger youd get on a date i enjoy a fast food burger from time to time though it can really hit the spot rebel moon scratched that space opera itch i always have in the same way john carter did when that movie came out and bombed with critics and audiences and it did it without the force its no andor by any means but its really no worse than the star wars sequel trilogy and i enjoyed it more than the prequels at least theres no jar jar binks im definitely going to watch part 2 and im genuinely curious to see what happens ill probably even watch the directors cut when that comes out though it should have just been that version from the start for goodness sakes which is something i didnt have the stomach for with the justice league  score 35  rebel moon is an entertaining but flawed space opera with some great action and cinematography that would have been better as the first part of an rrated trilogy hopefully part 2 builds on the opening films strengths i would not complain if this became a larger franchise with more room to grow the universe and shape into something more unique
Dec 24 2023,negative,there isnt enough slowmotion in the world to make up for the copypaste narrative lame characters awful pacing and miserable final act what a waste of time
Dec 24 2023,negative,snyder die hards might end up loving it but rebel moon is boiler plate scifi slop that just doesnt make an impression at all
Dec 24 2023,negative, the first part of zack snyders ambitious longcherished space opera rebel moon  part one a child of fire looks suitably impressive the story unfolds against vividly realised worlds starting in an idealistic agrarian commune on an outoftheway moon and travelling through cobalt mining planets gritty desert outposts and lunar dive bars the fight sequences are decent if a little overreliant on selfimportant slowmotion shots of people clobbering one another with space axes but the story is a derivative mess that feels as though it was assembled from bits of plot picked off the carcasses of other better films and glued together with brainnumbing pacekilling chunks of exposition sofia boutella shows actionstar potential as kora a mysterious outsider who has found peace living with the farming commune but she deserves a better vehicle than this chopshopped jalopy
Dec 24 2023,positive,rebel moon part one  a child of fire isnt terrible but it is derivative of so many other scifi and fantasy films 
Dec 24 2023,negative, the zach snyder mythos grows larger every day the director became a polarizing figure in his dc films era but his ability to create indelible images never wavered since his 2004 the dawn of the dead snyder could elevate his projects with vivid imagery yet some of his stories have fallen short of his potential sadly rebel moon  part one continues that trend despite some genuinely jawdropping moments thin characters and overused tropes sink what might have been snyders triumph as a filmmaker  snyders latest follows kora sofia boutella  a woman hiding from the galaxy in a small farming village however her past resurfaces when an imperialistic force  known as the motherworld  arrives with the help of local gunnar michael huisman kora begins to collect a group of warriors to fight the motherworld soon titus djimon hounsou kai charlie hunnam tarak staz nair nemesis doona bae and darrian bloodaxe ray fisher make up her elite team however regent balisarius fra free and atticus noble ed skrein hunt the crew to stop their growing cause  on its face rebel moon joins a long tradition of films nodding to past cinematic achievements star wars once drew from flash gordon the knives out series pulls from agatha christie stories even indiana jones pulls from old serial films however each of these stories found unique twists and turns based on the tropes these genres created like playing an arrangement of a musical piece the flourishes of the individual musician help sell the unique experience sadly snyder plays into these tropes rather than finding his own tune  the character shells quickly make rebel moon overly predictable snyder plays into these moments as shorthand yet overloads the film with exposition strangely rebel moon suffers from having too many tropes while simultaneously crafting lore that many will find challenging to follow while this could mean the feature has impressive worldbuilding the lack of ambition in the storytelling undercuts the franchises potential future not a single thing a character does in this film will surprise you either  synder certainly provides plenty of hero moments to each character but he also zaps any tension from these moments again the overly predictable nature of each character removes all dramatic tension from any moments that could make for interesting battles this combined with costuming that tells us exactly which type of character were interacting with leaves little for the audience to discover without personal moments where we fear for our heroes we simply lose interest even when one character acts selflessly the sequence borders on comedy its as if zach snyder is allergic to sentimentality despite telling an underdog story this may ultimately doom his franchise  watching rebel moon was less of a chore than one might expect yet at the same time that does make it a good movie much of the humor comes unintentionally a particularly yonic and phallic opening to the movieinspired laughter from this critic and throughout the theater the cg creates some spectacular moments but the lack of emotion within the story turns rebel moon part one into a checklist of a movie as we assemble the crew in order the rhythm and purpose of snyders latest dwindles with a second part coming in early 2024 and a directors cut already promised perhaps snyder can salvage his original franchise 
Dec 24 2023,negative, if there were fyc screeners for the razzie awards im quite confident id have received one for zack snyders rebel moon part one  a child of fire along with the usual hardbound picture book a tshirt that doesnt fit a moonshaped stress ball and a coupon for 10 off admission to rebel moon part two  the scargiver  alas snyders only hope for not taking home a multitude of razzies this year lies in this films late release and the distinct possibility that those always unpredictable razzie voters have already made up their minds  so lets just state the obvious upfront rebel moon is not a good film rebel moon is a bad film that makes other bad films look better it made me briefly contemplate the idea that m nights the last airbender wasnt really all that bad fortunately i changed my mind rebel moon made me briefly think that tom cruises the mummy wasnt actually godawful again i changed my mind  in rebel moon a peaceful colony on the edge of a galaxy finds itself threatened by a tyrannical ruling force kora sofia boutella is a mysterious stranger who lives among them and becomes their best hope for survival assembling a small band of warriors  outsiders insurgents and orphans of war  she leads battle over the fate of a galaxy a new army of heroes is formed  its important to note that rebel moon part one is in fact the first of a twoparter and one can only hope that were in for a heck of a lot more story with the second goround i doubt it but one can hope  when the bad guys arrive they subsequently demanded the villages entire harvest they immediately eliminate the villages leader an act returned by our dear kora who takes out some soldiers she is joined by gunnar michiel huisman and essentially the film takes off to recruit the warriors who will defend the villagers these recruits will include   charlie hunnams kai whose performance here is the films highlight as he at least infuses the proceedings with genuine energy and heart    djimon hounsous titus a rebel general whos skills are undeniable yet who is also seen as a disgraced man part one doesnt take us deeply into this journey or this conflict instead its like a 2 hour recruitment video with journeys to different planets the obligatory battles and weakly assembled origin stories for each character the script copenned by snyder with kurt johnstad and shay hatten never quite lives into its even basic description and exists with limp dialogue almost zero meaningful character development and a narrative that is about as murky as the worlds being created here  this is not to mean however that part one never works there are moments that hint at snyders intentions here and moments when the films visual palette clears and becomes rather impressive there are moments that make you think now were going to get going unfortunately rebel moon never gets going  there will of course be those who appreciate rebel moon for what it is and thats fine theyre wrong rebel moon part one  a child of fire is in fact simply a cinematic misfire of epic proportions 
Dec 23 2023,negative, you could read zack snyders latest transgalactic travesty as in part an apology for sucker punch his notoriously chauvinistic 2011 romp sofia boutella is not prancing around in exotic lingerie or cooing like an eroticised adolescent she speaks in arid quips she wears a properly concealing cape she punches giant lizards in the face kora the protagonist is in short regulation girlboss 349 a role model for the chatgpt generation if you want to avoid cliche and overworked influence you have come to the wrong place the word on rebel moon part one  no space armada can halt an incoming second spurt  is that netflix has allowed snyder director of 300 and lots of dc rubbish to develop his own take on star wars thats not an insane precis the film follows a plucky band of insurgents as they take on an apparently indestructible fascist regime kora is luke skywalker someone else is han solo there is a cute robot but the familiarities go back further  deep into the inspirations for the first part of george lucass space opera if star wars didnt exist critics would be focusing here on the shameless references to akira kurosawas seven samurai its not just that the characters gather together a band of around about that number to protect a literal and figurative village from marauders rebel moon is also much at home to pseudojapanese set and costume design the awful thing also plays like yet another gift for the johnny onebooks who still jaw about joseph campbells the hero with a thousand faces campbell and kurosawa were of course the godfathers of star wars anyway never mind all that the undemanding punter is allowed a slab of mindless space mayhem to while away the yawning afternoons during the christmas break right as so often with snyder one wishes the project were as much fun as it seems on paper to be fair to the guy he did discover a sense of humour for the recent tolerable army of thieves but though there are attempts at levity here we are for the most part stuck with his dreary stygian selfimportance you will get some sense of the subtlety at work from a summary of the opening section a happy farming village is disturbed when a space vessel disgorges a legion of smartly uniformed straightbacks  garbed as youd expect in a fascistthemed production of julius caesar  led by the reliably snakeeyed ed skrein he smiles and opens negotiations to appropriate grain for his troops at least one local reacts like the character in mad max 2 who confronted with the mountainous villain declared this humungous  is a reasonable man well no after more preamble than is strictly necessary lord skrein or whatever he is called takes to battering the citizens to death and stripping the land its simple i want everything he says you amaze me man in jackboots and shiny peaked cap kora  as so often in campbellian tales an adoptee to the village  finds herself tasked with assembling a gang to fight back against the oppressors what we end up with is a colossal colossally boring preamble to a lessmeandering second part that will im guessing appeal largely to viewers with screwdrivers lodged in their frontal lobes there are endless hunks of spoken exposition there is a lot of space travel a great many uninteresting people are introduced by the first hour all narrative drive has slackened into a limp connecting thread one thing does interest though if youll excuse the spoiler a surprising number of the worst villains turn out to be northern irish or white south africans how amusing it would be if the dup were to call for a boycott
Dec 23 2023,neutral,rebel moons failure to meet its potential is a shame as it appeared that zack copied the answers from the george lucas test the lack of originality of the story and characters was shocking to me considering its from a creative mind like zack 
Dec 23 2023,negative,its not a complete disaster and im a little curious how part 2 finishes the story that basically comes to a definitive conclusion no cliffhangers here but a child of fire is largely a whiff
Dec 23 2023,negative, from his critically maligned but fanfavorite sucker punch to his infamous internet darling snyder cut of 2017s justice league zack snyder is no stranger to drumming up discourse whenever one of his films nears release his latest effort for netflix rebel moon  part one a child of fire has already sparked discussions of an rrated threehour directors cut to give his fans an alternate taste before rebel moon  part two hits the streaming platform early next year but while snyder may do his best to invent a dark gripping universe to engross viewers rebel moon is a limp soulless regurgitation of tropes stolen from much more formidable films written directed produced and shot by snyder rebel moon follows kora sofia boutella a battlehardened soldier with a tragic past though shes attempting to live a lowprofile life on a peaceful farming colony kora is forced to once again take up the mantle of warrior when the motherworld sends a military contingent led by the brutal admiral noble ed skrein to occupy her new home with the help of a humble farmer michiel huisman kora sets off on a galaxyspanning adventure to recruit a ragtag group of fighters to defend her homeland attempting to establish an original engrossing sciencefiction world is no small task even for the most adept of writers and its painfully clear that snyder took heavy aesthetic and stylistic notes from genre classics like star wars and dune without understanding the story and emotional beats that made those aforementioned franchises so beloved certainly theres all manner of sciencefiction spectacle in rebel moon to gawk at the characters are all dressed in tattered greyscale robes wielding retrofuturist weapons and talking about the motherworld and the imperium but while every element of production design costuming and worldbuilding is certainly specific none of them are inspired or purposeful instead rebel moons stylistic sensibilities feel like snyder simply tossed all the scifi greats into a blender and called it a day extensive attention is paid to plotting out  lore and history but snyder forgets to flesh out the characters that populate his meticulously detailed universe aside from kora whose tragic backstory and brutal upbringing are delivered entirely through clunky monologues of exposition that bleed into extensive flashback sequences the rest of rebel moons sizable ensemble cast are eacg allotted five minutes of dialogue if that kora and her crew flit to a new planet are treated to a dazzling display of their new allys combat prowess given the cliffsnotes version of their tragic backstory is there any other kind and then that character simply falls in among the ranks never to be examined or explored with any real intentionality again as for kora herself boutella brings the customary strength and stoicism expected of a ya dystopian protagonist with none of the heart or passion constantly glowering out from underneath her dark crop of hair kora is a painfully uninteresting hero whose stoicism is certainly understandable given her history but whose personality could not make for a more tepid protagonist though shes plenty ferocious in combat kora is detached and distant when not embroiled in a fight giving the entire film a remote inaccessible emotional core at two hours and 15 minutes rebel moon is a laborious moviegoing experiencewhy should the audience care about the films events when the protagonist herself barely seems to  rebel moons lack of interest in exploring its own characters is made all the more frustrating by the cruel visceral nature of its villainswhile we dont get much personality from kora gunnar and the other wannabe heroes we are treated to several extended sequences that revel in the cruelty and violence of the imperium the vaguely fascist ruling faction is clearly an underbaked standin for star wars empire but snyder mistakes onscreen brutality for effective writing the films first act subjects viewers to an extended sequence of imperium soldiers attempting to rape a villager a scene that serves no other purpose than making explicitly clear to the audience that the authoritarian military occupiers are in fact bad guys the world snyder has created is a cold brutal one utterly lacking in any kind of charm whimsy or excitement the closest rebel moon ever comes to eliciting any kind of emotional response is during the actionpacked slomo heavy combat sequences stories like star wars and dune soar by using farfetched worlds and fantastical settings to interrogate relatable deeply human ideas rebel moon on the other hand trades in the aesthetic trappings of those classics without making the effort to engage on any emotional or philosophical level though rebel moon ends on a relative cliffhanger with the promise of a sequel on the horizon its difficult to imagine why one would want to subject themselves to  another two hours in this soulless slog of a universe certainly snyder is a master of his particular brand of highly stylized action sequences but the sheer lack of emotional stakes and memorable characters renders rebel moon toothless
Dec 23 2023,positive, now on netflix things are getting mighty funky behind the sky in the first installment of director zack snyders galactic epic rebel moon part one  a child of fire a dynasty of a thousand kings has ruled a slab of space but that is all over as the last of the bloodline was assassinated down on the farm on some backwater planet kora sofia boutella is hard at work behind a plow her coworker gunnar michiel huisman oversees the grain harvested and seems to have a sweet on her  however their planet is invaded by nazilike space tyrants who are taking over civilizations or wiping them out in the memory of the slain king at first the villagers believe they could cooperate with atticus noble ed skrein the leader of the death squad that has landed kora warns them that the tyrants will take and take until nothing is left but the villagers find out the hard way kora goes to flee the village but is waylaid when the invaders try to trap her and another village girl in a gang rape soon kora has to travel to the worst spots of her planet and beyond to recruit a band of outcasts and outlaws that can defend her village against the deadly dreadnaught if you think you have heard this story before think again first off know going in that i am not a snyder absolutist i am underwhelmed by half of his work though i am quite overwhelmed with the other half watchmen never got as interesting as its opening credits and army of the dead was a dud however justice league justice is gray is possibly the most beautiful black and white movie i have ever seen and i appreciate his dark slant on the superfriends so while i was curious about rebel moon i also wasnt going to forgive any missteps  so i spent the first 40 minutes picking the st out of it everything seemed subdued and pedestrian with the only grandeur supplied by the soaring soundtrack then snyder does what lucas did with the cantina and whips out the monsters suddenly we start to get an inkling about how far out we are going to be taken then snyder widens the scope of the visuals with each major movement so instead of a sprint from start to finish the script by snyder with kurt johnstad and shay hatten climbs a set of stairs instead getting higher and higher into its concept it is the perfect example of what the great critic quentin crisp called the crucial variety of tone i appreciate the thoughfulness of your analysis myself im a simple person and i thought it was a big bucket of dumb i thought there was excessive grain obsession a galactic empire  capable of wormhole one supposes travel  has a tough time with agriculture but whatever one mans grain is another mans macguffin i turned off my brain at about the 25 minute mark and just watched the gunfights  on the plus side many of the visuals were top notch some of the action sequences were well done and despite it all i will watch the next one  once because who dont like explosions on february 45 2006 horror returns to texas thanks to loyd cryer the lifelong horror fan decided to take the plunge and put on his own horror we can never see past a choice we dont understand  and morpheus old buddy theres no way we can see past a plot point we dont understand the sooner all of you realize that its no longer a worthwhile exercise to continue railing against the preponderance of remakes coming out of hollywood film threat cares about your privacy and the security of your information visit our full length privacy policy to get informed on our policies regarding the collection use and disclosure of information we receive from users
Dec 23 2023,positive, theres usually some kind of disturbance in the force happening when theres a 50 per cent difference between critical and public review ratings of a film on rotten tomatoes and zack snyders initial cut of his 166 million space opera for the netflix streamer is very the much the kind of project which revolts the snooty glitterati but delights the casual viewer with part two in the can as we say in the biz and scheduled for april next year snyder is hoping to launch the scargiver as the first of a trilogy of sequels to this opener and while this critic admittedly came to scoff at snyders efforts a child of fire is a betterthandecent slice of crowdpleasing scifi with a young game cast slick visuals and some wild ideas with this years barbie included its fashionable to bash snyder and i certainly saw a chance for snark when i read the following on the films wiki page on june 8 2022 it was announced that anthony hopkins had joined the cast as the voice of jimmy an impossibly sentient jc1435 mechanized battle robot and onetime defender of the slain king hopkins even narrates the opening sequence and his robot knight has a quasimessianic yet pagan look garlanded with flowers and antlers which fits right in with the semireligious feel of the rebel moon universe if star wars adopted the key elements of kurosawas hidden fortress then snyder has the right to do something similar with seven samurai itself the basis for john sturges the magnificent seven and roger cormans battle beyond the stars 1980 so the monarchyloving militaristic empire of the motherland have sent the horrid atticus noble ed skrein and his doomy dreadnaught spaceship the kings gaze to oppress the sexy funky planet of gardeners that is veldt where their work ethic sounds like a kool and the gang song make love tonight yes on lyrical verdant veldt theyve made a connection between hearty sex and a healthy lifestyle and are preparing for the rumpypumpy which will infuse their crops the sound of our pleasure will summon the seedlings this fertile ritual sounds like it might be fun to watch but before they can get down on it nobles men put a damper on their pastoral ardour by demanding a biblical tithe ten weeks to generate a tribute of many thousand bushels that gives rebel kora sofia boutella and her farmer pal gunnar michiel huisman less than three months to find some more tough guys and gals to stand up to noble and take down his battlecruiser to start a rebellion against authoritarian might were from a small village looking to hire some fighters is the allyouneedtoknow takeaway about koras ageold mission so sure weve been here before but not with snyder who injects some surprising elements into a classic space opera story of feuding hawkshaws and bloodaxes and not just his peckinpahinzerogravity action style shown off to good advantage here snyder also skips making this spaceadventure primarily for kiddies and as the opening text warns theres a strong elements of sexual threat from the mines of daggus to the brothelcantina that kora unwisely seeks help in rebel moon rises to a jodorovsky look at times notably nobles henchwomen are straight out of the holy mountain and the baddies really are bad if zack snyder think that its a bad thing to relish the ecstasy of combat like the motherland does youre pretty far gone and its probably for the best that we dont get to see noble get his desired wish to split that sapling when confronted by kora is kai the mercenary pilot hired by kora and played by charlie hunnam a reliable soul or not can fabiostyle prince tarak staz nair tame his giant crow and find true happiness why does ed skrein cuddle up with a sexy snake that seems to poke through various orifices in his torso theres literally tonnes of dunelite worldbuilding going on here and rebel moon generally looks good with snyder clearly invested in his universe of mechanical bounty hunters teethrattling conflicts and astral energy with a notably strong sounddesign and score to keep things interesting of all the festive blockbusters for 2023 this is probably the were getting closest to an avatarstyle epic and those who seek a blast of outerspace action should get their interstellar kicks on snyders rebel moon pretty impressed given all the critical fuss i expected to stop watching pretty quick instead i found it very enjoyable and aimed at an adult audience  which oppenheimer and barbie have proved beyond doubt exists  fairly zimmed along and the climax took me by surprise i was expecting something more dour and leaden though i did think it was richard attenboroughs plummy voice doing the opening narration i knew it was hopkins probably for the price of a picasso he reads that text with such feeling and so ripely i was totally ready for a hate watch but had to restart after twenty minutes when i realised it was good better than guardians or the flash or antman or the vast majority of whats out there and like you i thought the climax was sharp and came up suddenly no messing around barely one in five critics thought this was passable but im happy to be in a minority join the rebellion im pushing against a tide here but i liked this a lot more than i expected feel free to post a link with your alternative view i have read that there is an extended cut that is what snyder really wanted to do and the same with part 2 and they will be released once the short versions have been put out so sometime next year netflix wanted the pg13 version first so kiddies can watch it and snyder wanted an r rating so they let him do both i might hang on for those even in this family friendly pg13 version theres a few scenes where were clearly looking at horrible offscreen scenes which are about the be put back in for the snydercut but this is way more adult than aquaman 2 and is worth your time dont listen to snobby critics come on bunty this is big scifi action fantasy fun dont deny yourself you can watch it on your new nokia flipfone live the dream hopkins gives it his all he puts such feeling into his opening narration even if neither he nor i could understand it he certainly keeps busy and while his work on shadowlands and the remains of the day is widely admired to me hell always be jimmy the sentient droid sure its space nazis again when is it not but intergalactic pagan sex harvests is new dont pretend youre not intrigued actual sciif ideas bolted into a western plot as per this demo site is only for demonstration purposes all images are copyrighted to their respective owners all

Dec 23 2023,positive,rebel moon doesnt change the game in terms of scifi action epics it features a strong mix of characters some memorable action sequences and a sequel already filmed with an april 2024 release date and sometimes thats all thats needed
Dec 23 2023,negative, you may be tempted to further curse the existence of the star wars prequels for seemingly informing the upsettingly turgid scifi epic rebel moon part one  a child of fire now on netflix the first volley in a planned megafranchise from lovehimhatehim filmmaker zack snyder let it be known that im no kneejerk snyder hater  ill still defend watchmen and some aspects of 300 and for my nickel 2021s amusing army of the dead kinda redeemed him after making a few pretty terrible superman movies but rebel moon finds him leaning on his worst snyderesque tendencies not the least of which is releasing this the first of a twoparter which reportedly will be followed by an extended rrated cut and then part two  the scargiver confirmed for april 2024 release and then an extended rrated cut of that one and then probably a gigantic 193hour megacut of both films thats sure to feature more stultifying exposition and overstylized violence than anyone of sound mind would ever want as it is the 133 minutes of a child of fire already feels like way more than enough  the gist we open with  wait is that anthony hopkins narrating yes it is a bonafide knighted englishman with oscars on his shelf has now been in both a michael bay transformers movie and a zack snyder movie the latter of which features him giving voice to a blatant c3po ripoff while we scratch our heads and groan and we havent even gotten to the what of hopkins narration which immediately buries us in backstory and is not at all a particularly good way of opening a movie lets just say the galaxy is ruled by an evil empire of space nazis  they even have the hats and epaulets and shitty haircuts and everything  cruising around in warships that look like flying uboats conquering the living saliva out of the worlds they come across and as these things go a revolution brews and stews on some secret planet somewhere needless to say if youre a space nazi that revolution must be squashed like a squash youd stomp with your jackboot meanwhile on a small nothing of a moon some humble farmers farm the soil and say things like were just humble farmers we have no interest in your politics you know cornball shit like that one of those farmers is kora sofia boutella who of course isnt just a farmer you also getting some major more than what she seems vibes from this lady and her silently brooding brow of course you are kora exists among peasants bronzed by the sun and rendered lean by hard work and clad like 18thcentury quakers they are truly a chamber pot society who couldnt stand up against fascist cretins with spaceships and laser guns which is exactly what happens when evil fartknocker atticus noble ed skrein and his rapey proud boy soldiers show up to sexually assault the women and take the harvest atticus leaves some of his cruel turdburglars in charge and thats when kora goes wonder woman on them but only if wonder woman didnt mind killin some folks turns out that kora used to belong to the space nazis and thats how come shes such a skilled whupper of asses and now its on her to make sure all the humble farmers dont get slaughtered so she and generic guy gunnar michiel huisman set off to assemble a crew what kind of crew you may ask is it ragtag an assemblage of diverse types from various worlds maybe a guy who resembles a native american warrior staz nair a samuraitype woman doona bae with laser machetes because lightsabers have been very much done before a smirking smuggler charlie hunnam with a jalopy airship a could of heavily facepainted leaders of the standing rebellion ray fisher and cleopatra coleman djimon hounsou in another utterly thankless supporting role sure why not cram a walking carpet in there while youre at it throw them in a trash compactor maybe before they face off against the galactic totalitarians now if only this movie played out with the thrills and suspense of other movies that are just like this one what movies will it remind you of it rhymes with flar nores also some serious misguided ambition here a la jupiter ascending and the heytheyonlyreleasedhalfascifiepic frustrations of denis villeneuves dune memorable dialogue a prime example of the dialogue which is mostly meaningless mouthfuls of words via kora it seemed a myth or metaphor created in response to the generations of war and conquest she says speaking like any normal person would our take oh hi  you caught me looking up synonyms for turgid rebel moon colon part one dash a child of fire finds snyder killing us slowly with relentlessly awful exposition a marked lack of originality boilerplate scifi characters plot twists and betrayals with little dramatic impact and greenscreens greenscreens greenscreens oh also snyders trademark slomo all the better for him to stage his heroes in iconic poses and either drive us nuts or force his fans to convince themselves that that shit is super cool bro and not at all cheesier than a wisconsin truckstop  writing alongside kurt johnstad and shay hatten snyder spends an inordinate amount of time schlepping his protagonists across the galaxy kora gathering up pals to help her out the various locations identified by stultifying subtitles along the lines of gladiator arena of castor  moon of pollux needless to say by the time they get to unregistered trade depot  gondival youll be checked right the eff out the movie has a few notable moments where it threatens to get interesting a cantina scene boasting a basketballsized tabletop tickcreature that controls folks by sinking its slinky tentacles into their brains or an encounter with a hissing arachnoidwoman who descends from the rafters with impressively evil ceremoniousness too bad that stuff amounts to nothing in the long run tangents off the wornout path from tranquil opening to noisy finale of course theres a thirdact battle because without one movies like this just dont get funded but if we actually possess the fortitude required to get to that point in the story our emotional and intellectual investment in what happens will be a millionzillion halfpennies shy of giving a single good god damn about any of it it doesnt help that the story is about essentially nothing the text here is so dense it shoves the subtext straight into the fiery lava of the earths core theoretically in a world dominated by established ip we should be enthused by the idea of original scifi but junk like this transcends theory into dispiriting reality dont forget all this is to be continued just like dune but way shittier and very much unlike dune the thought of sitting through another one of these is a depressing prospect 
Dec 23 2023,neutral, sofia boutella plays kora a farmer with a secret past as a soldier in director zack snyders rebel moon  part one a child of fire photo courtesy of netflix with the ungainly title rebel moon  part one a child of fire director zack snyders new monstersized sciencefiction franchise for netflix launches with a lot of bombast and big action  but for several reasons not just the ones hinted at by the title it feels like an unfinished work the movie starts on a bucolic planet veldt and a young woman kora sofia boutella pushing a plow behind a horselike creature shes a resident of a peaceful village  peaceful until a ship from the ruling motherworld descends led by the movies main villain admiral atticus noble ed skrein atticus demands the village sell most of its grain harvest to his army and even kills the villages leader an unbilled corey stoll to put fear in the other villagers kora is not afraid and we learn of her backstory that shes not from this village  but a warhardened former officer in the motherworlds army the opening narration by anthony hopkins voicing an enigmatic android explains that the king of the motherworld was assassinated and the power struggle that followed left the nasty regent balisarius fra fee in charge prompting a rebellion in the outer fringes of the empire gee plucky rebels going up against a powerful evil empire fighting wars among the stars  where do snyder and his cowriters shay hatten who worked on snyders army of the dead and kurt johnstad who worked on snyders 300 get their ideas yes the legend is that snyder pitched himself to direct a star wars movie and when lucasfilm turned him down he recycled his ideas into this kora  who takes down the occupation force atticus left in the village in one of snyders familiar slowmotion action sequences  teams with gunnar michiel huisman a villager who has sold surplus grain to the rebel side to start assembling rebel fighters to fight against atticus main forces when they return thus snyder engages in some universebuilding as we hop from one thoroughly productiondesigned planet after another  among those kora and gunnar pick up are a homeless former general djimon hounsou a vengeful assassin doona bae a hunky prince staz nair a rebel leader ray fisher aka cyborg from snyders justice league and a roguish thief and space pilot kai charlie hunnam  some of the action sequences snyder devises are propulsive  my favorite is when bae goes up against a spiderlike creature with a head and thorax played by jena malone that resembles the borg queen from the star trek franchise but too often snyder falls into his regular habits creating empty spectacle thats quite violent though bloodless enough to get its pg13 rating  the worldbuilding is all in the visuals with no attempt to guide viewers from planet to planet  and the character development is much the same with only boutellas kora provided much depth or explanation of who she is and how she got here the audience is forced to fill in the gaps using the clues of other movies snyder references and perhaps the greatest crime of all for an action franchise theres absolutely no humor to lighten the heavy material as the title tells us this is the first installment of what has been announced as a twopart epic  the second part with the subtitle the scargiver is scheduled for an april release on netflix and snyder has recently said in interviews that this movie which is two hours and 13 minutes long and carries a pg13 rating will have a threehour rrated directors cut released sometime next year yes snyder himself has succumbed to the allure of the snyder cut that his legion of fans demanded after justice league the problem with announcing a directors cut for rebel moon  part one a child of fire is that it tells us snyder was so disenchanted with his movie that he started editing a different version as a distraction if the director cant be bothered to pay attention why should the rest of us starts streaming friday december 22 on netflix rated pg13 for sequences of strong violence sexual assault bloody images language sexual material and partial nudity running time 133 minutes
Dec 22 2023,positive, since this film was announced it seems there have been two camps snyders diehard fans the same ones who successfully waged a multiyear campaign of pressure to push warner bros to release his cut of justice league heralded this movie as the coming of a darker grittier star wars though to clarify this movie has nothing to do with star wars thats just the default when talking about scifi set in space and the other camp were those who believe snyder to be nothing more than a slowmotion enthusiast incapable of making a complete story without releasing 27 cuts of his movies despite an abysmal rotten tomatoes score and early crucifixion from other critics rebel moon is a visuallystunning film that has a fun though thin narrative and interesting characters who all deserve more backstory any fan of seven samurai or the magnificent seven is already familiar with this story a farm village on the independent world of veldt is visited by a brutal space empire called the motherworld they demand grain from the village and vow to return and collect it and a woman from the village named kora sofia boutella has to assemble a ragtag team of warriors to defend the town the story of rebel moon doesnt think far outside the box and thats fine because obviously this is a setup that has worked in movies and television for decades if it aint broke right kora travels to nearby planets to assemble her team and recruits a former motherworld general named titus djimon hounsou a cyborg swordswoman named nemesis bae doona a rebellion leader named bloodaxe ray fisher and an exprince who became a blacksmith named tarak staz nair together theyll have to defend veldt against a brutal military machine led by the tyrant balisarius fra fee he dispatches an admiral named atticus noble ed skrein to hunt for rebels and hell be the one who leads the crushing attack against koras home if koras team cant stop him noble will plunder the villages grain and leave so little behind that the people will starve rebel moon is without question a film that puts style ahead of substance and thats an automatic sin in the eyes of some critics but the movie makes up for its thin story and underdeveloped characters by having tons of visual aesthetic its hard to understate how gorgeous this film is snyder offers up so many cinematic shots in between his trademarked slowmotion fight sequences the aliens that inhabit this galaxy are all vibrant and distinct and each recruit kora comes in contact with just oozes cool with costume designs that wow and leave viewers wanting to see more through all of rebel moon the only visual disappointment were the starships their designs are rather bland and the cgi leaves them looking more like objects from an xbox game rather than a scifi blockbuster but everything else stellar snyders characters all offer hints of deeper story to come in the sequel and with how much fun this initial outing was rebel moon makes for an acceptable iou with a promise for more grand adventure to come in part two the films biggest issue comes down to relying on the tired trope of sexual assault to quickly establish who the movies villains are rebel moon has two scenes of sexual assault and the fact that both a man and a girl are the victims doesnt exactly balance out its an overused and harmful gimmick that needs to be retired there are plenty of other ways to show just how evil a films antagonists can be that dont rely on violently pulling assault victims out of the story for entire minutes at a time rebel moon didnt deserve to be shot down so viciously and quickly just because of the man behind the camera its a fastpaced space epic that has a lot to offer the film isnt without flaws but its nowhere near as bad as some would have audiences believe its a world full of characters that all deserve much more in the future and heres hoping the sequel will deliver on their promises given in part one
Dec 22 2023,neutral, zack snyder is a filmmaker who has always put effort into making big bold and splashy imagery whether its superheroes spartans zombies or an army of owls snyder has routinely leaned toward dark and dramatic visual compositions that would explain why he so often chooses to shoot his action in slow motion because he wants the images to make an impression this approach has become such an identifying signature that other areas tend to take a hit especially when it comes to writing his latest endeavor rebel moon part one  a child of fire 2023 continues this trend despite a wide scope and plenty of spectacle the weaknesses in story and character make the narrative feel thin snyder who also cowrites with kurt johnstad and shay hatten does not hide his cinematic influences in fact he places them so much in the forefront that it plays like a badge of honor not only does he heavily borrow from star wars 1977 but he also lifts from seven samurai 1954 which as it turns out was a big influence on george lucas when he made star wars what goes around comes around artists paying homage to the past is an old tradition and is not inherently bad in theory the issue with rebel moon is that it does not do enough to set itself apart because it follows the same blueprint with little variation it doesnt get an opportunity to establish an identity of its own how can this stand by itself if it keeps reminding us of other films as the title would suggest this is the first part of a supposed twopart series while that knowledge indicates that there is more to this then what is presented it does leave the initial entry with a lot of loose ends it would be easy to simply say wait for the next installment to see if everything wraps up in a satisfying way but we can only review what is given to us as a standalone film this takes on an episodic structure with kora and gunnar taking the near two and a halfhour runtime to pick up or pay off volunteers amongst them are kai charlie hunnam tarak staz nair nemesis bae donna bloodaxe ray fisher and titus djimon hounsou none of them are painted with much dimension outside of kora who gets plenty of flashback scenes explaining her background everyone else are made of surfacelevel traits and motivations but youre not here for a deep character study or to examine the philosophical complexities of life under a fascist regime are you you want to know if this is fun and if the action is well done right in that regard its a tossup snyder and the rest of the production stuff the frame with epic sequences and largescale set pieces however because snyder is so obsessed with slow motion it tampers down the excitement whenever the visuals pause in the middle of a fight or shoot out it drains the momentum the cinematography also by snyder is in love with stopping on a closeup of sofia boutellas face right when she aims her gun to fire a laser beam the approach creates a stopstart effect  we want the action to pick up but cant get there because the slow motion takes us out of it during another sequence tarak risks his life to tame a giant birdlike creature in the key moment tarak jumps off a cliff to land on the animals back the camera screeches to a halt just as tarak is in the air with the sun placed perfectly behind him and the bird plastered right below are we meant to be witnessing an action scene or a picture from a postcard when snyder lets the action play out it can be entertaining one of the highlights is a fight scene between nemesis and a half humanoidhalf spider enemy wielding dual lightsabers  i mean laser swords  nemesis twists and turns to avoid getting punctured by one of the arachnids legs because the production lays off the slow motion in relative terms anyway the sequence has verve and style and dynamism the film could have used a lot more of this instead it basks in scenes where everything nearly stops in time as if its telling the audience hey look at this cool shot isnt it awesome the textures are caked with dark reds oranges and browns creating a muddy and unappealing palette  as though all the environments are covered in heavy smog rebel moon  part one a child of fire does have its qualities ed skrein plays an imposing and dastardly villain anthony hopkins provides his voice talents to jimmy a robot not too dissimilar from one goldplated character from a galaxy far far away its telling how jimmy despite barely having any screentime has more emotional resonance than many of the human characters and thats the film in a nutshell  a collection of interesting pieces that make a disappointing whole perhaps when part 2 comes out next year well have a better understanding of the entire story and hopefully a greater appreciation for what snyder and co are trying to do as it stands though this is a scifi adventure that never really shifts out of first gear
Dec 22 2023,positive, rebel moon part one  a child of fire with sofia boutella djimon hounsou ed skrein michiel huisman charlie hunnam written by zack snyder  kurt johnstad  shay hatten directed by zack snyder rated pg13 for sequences of strong violence sexual assault bloody images language sexual material and partial nudity 133 minutes on netflix zack snyder has made some dark films filled with action and visually compelling images his latest is so epic it has been split in two although the films were shot backtoback rebel moon part one  a child of fire is now available on netflix its sequel  rebel moon part two  the scargiver will drop next april while the first half takes off after a slow start it is not a film that will be accused of originality after a talky prologue where we gather that as in star wars the empire  called the motherworld  is evil the scene shifts to the bucolic planet of veldt where the simple farming community there could have been lifted from any number of westerns the arrival of a ship helmed by admiral atticus noble ed skrein is bad news they want the crops to feed their troops leaving behind a brutish force to ensure compliance gunnar michiel huisman tries to comply but after kora sofia boutella intervenes to prevent the rape of a young woman she and gunnar take off to seek warriors who can help defend their community if this sounds familiar it should as it is the same premise as akira kurosawas classic the seven samurai 1954 the rest of part one consists of their band growing including a thief charlie hunnam a defeated general djimon hounsou an expert swordswoman doona bae a former noble with a special ability with wild creatures staz nair and one of the rebel leaders ray fisher theres even a sympathetic robot who will undoubtedly play a bigger role in the second film voiced by none other than anthony hopkins of course each of the characters must get their own introductory vignette and by the time they get back to veldt the movies over and its time for next years followup the problem here isnt that its dull but that you can practically see the serial numbers on what snyder and his two cowriters lifted from other movies hunnams character enters in a scene reminiscent of the cantina in star wars complete with a variety of alien characters nemesis the swordswoman has not one but two swords that strongly resemble light sabers she battles a grotesque creature thats half womanhalf spider and very similar to the borg queen in the star trek universe one of their number turns out to be a traitor paging lando calrissian from the empire strikes back while admiral noble seems to be modeled after the nazi villain of numerous world war ii dramas the cast does their best not to make their characters twodimensional with some even achieving all three dimensions particularly boutella since her kora is given the most complete backstory including flashbacks the fight scenes and special effects are effective although much more violent than in the star wars movies that this got a pg13 rating instead of an r shows how much more lenient the ratings board is with violence as opposed to nudity and sexual situations daniel m kimmel is a veteran movie critic and author of a host of filmrelated books his latest book is a film criticism parody can your heart stand the shocking facts exploring plan 9 from outer space he is the 2018 recipient of the skylark award given by the new england science fiction association he lives in somerville massachusetts
Dec 22 2023,negative, and now the diabolical director is zapping the enjoyment out of outer space too in rebel moon  part one child of fire on netflix  while that winding buzzwordfilled title sounds like a cheapo parody of a sciencefiction epic this is about as unfunny and unadventurous a movie as you could possibly imagine our tatooine ripoff is an orangehued world called veldt where a group of uptight grain farmers push around dirt all day long and then gather in a meeting house to speak like theyre moses from the old testament they sleep in what resemble 1800s irish peat houses that are incongruously souped up with electric sliding doors and fluorescent lights  actually the overall look of rebel moon is a grabbag of mismatched time periods and multicultural visual references in a desperate attempt to be clever however because they so vastly overdo it none of these places are believable even in the context of spaceships reptillian aliens and villains named balisarius fra fee  when the benevolent king of the motherworld is slain and the totalitarian regent pretty much the emperor from star wars takes the reins he sends a storebrand evil admiral named atticus ed skrein and his jarhead henchmen to plunder and conquer  the thugs demand veldt hand over most of their precious grain supply killing several citizens after they refuse so secret local badass kora sofia boutella embarks on a mission with softspoken farmer gunnar michiel huisman to recruit a crew of warriors to help the town i was taught that love is a weakness and i dont know how that will ever change kora says to love and be loved  i dont know if im capable of either well what i know is that when a character makes a cementtruck comment like that theyll probably tie the knot at the end of part 2 the rescued townsfolk can throw some of that grain at the happy couple spinningandkicking nemesis bae doona gets in an unpleasant bout with a halfwomanhalfspider who is stealing another planets children a oncepowerful general named titus djimon hounsou has slid into drunkenness tarzany tarak staz nair gets his avatar moment when he tames a wild flying horse and successfully rides it off a rocky cliff kai charlie hunnam is han solo we dont find out that much about any of these people nor do we want to the middle of rebel moon is a failed speed dating exercise in which a second meetup is not in the cards with a second chapter on the way perhaps the clashing finale can be forgiven for being not so grand one person dramatically sacrifices their life and we shrug because weve only just met them a few minutes ago another doublecrosses the group and we shrug because weve only just met them a few minutes ago
Dec 22 2023,negative, nothing causes something to fail at a goal like trying far too hard to achieve it whether its an individual trying to look tough or a science fiction story that wants the viewer to believe that it belongs among the great epics that came before it those who observe these displays do not walk away convinced of the desired message but rather they walk away pitying the level of insecurity and neediness they project while rebel moon part 1 takes some big swings it ultimately falls flat trying to showcase too much too fast and leaving the viewer with that overwhelming feeling of desperation to impress the movie opens with a sizable information dump as it lays out the important elements of the worlds historypaired with the appearance of an impressivelooking starship coming out of this settings version of hyperspace both audio and visuals set the tone and scale for the coming film the cgi is crisp and clean as will the visual effects be throughout the storys twohour and fifteenminute runtime however this is the first element of many that leans into my above critique the film tries too hard to push the scale it boasts one of the ways in which it does this is by calling out things like how the dynastic line of this empire had been unbroken for a thousand years while this sort of scope is good to give a viewer working it into a conversation rather than outright exposition avoids the feeling that it is there to impress as opposed to building out a world seamlessly and naturally from this initial display of the intimidating authority of the central governments imperial power the film jumps to our small farming village where we are introduced to the films lead kora sofia boutella guillermo del toros cabinet of curiosities seen guiding a plow horse across a field with an enormous red ringed planet in the background this shot is visually stunning from here the film begins its work to establish the idyllic life of this small farming village it is a bit ironic that the sequence the film handles best is the one that has nothing to do with epic grandeur the presentation of the town and the joyful if simple life it provides its people is filled with warmth and goodness kora is called from the field to participate in a feast celebrating the coming planting and petitioning the gods to bless their future crops food drink and celebratory mating dont worry its offscreen are all on the menu the sheer joyful energy that fills the gathering ensures that it will hit the viewer when the world comes crashing down around them sure enough the next day the residents of the village begin planting their crops only to have their day disturbed by the appearance of a dreadnaut class starship kings gaze led by admiral noble ed skrein alita battle angel the imperial landing party brings demands of grain to support its troops as they root out local resistance elements here we see snyders vision come in with all the subtly of a sledgehammer the viewer needs to know that the imperial government is evil and the film wastes no time in establishing this fact noble and his men go to such egregious lengths to showcase how bad they are that it borders on the ridiculous harm is not only directed at beloved leaders of the community but the troops waste no time pushing far more indiscriminate violence upon the community all but ensuring an eventual loss of compliance from the townspeople these people arent just evil they seem psychotic so much so that it makes the viewer wonder how they could ever manage to build up such a grandiose empire in the first place it also undercuts noble as the major villain of the film science fiction tales are filled with intimidating bad guys that make not only their worlds but the audience themselves quake noble sadly does not fit this bill rather than a powerful threat noble comes across as a bully one who has more likely earned his lofty spot in the imperial navy through family connections than success in combat or governance wedged in the middle of rebel moon part 1s opening descent into peril for the village is a perfect highlight for another of the films major failings rushed character arcs the rest of the time spent in the village is spent in a worldwide of introducing characters speedily setting up an arc that feels like it could play out over the course of the entire film only to see it resolve less than ten minutes after its introduction making the effect even more lessened is the fact that much of the drama that plays out is telegraphed beforehand making the direction of these character narratives completely predictable this madcap rush through character arcs continues throughout the story once the immediate situation is resolved kora along with another farmer gunnar michiel huisman seeks to make contact with those who may help defend the town from the retribution that will come once the empire learns that the troops left behind have been killed for the next third of the movie we are introduced to an assemblage of rough and ready fighters either looking to be heroes or simply out for vengeance as each is recruited we get a sequence showcasing their talents or the resources they bring to the enterprise the movie is so hardpressed to fit these entries in though that we get little time with the growing cast in between additions making several of rebel moon part 1s final moments far less impactful than they are clearly intended to be sacrifices betrayals and heroic victories feel empty even as the film does everything it can to push how impressed and dazzled the viewer should be while the forced speed of the narrative makes story beats and characters never land the actors themselves feel like they are giving their all to breathe as much life into their personalities as the plot permits charlie hunnam works hard to craft the roughish smuggler energy his character is going for while djimon hounsou breathes as much of the command presence his failed general persona can in the handful of moments he actually gets to speak i genuinely felt sorry for the cast as they seemed to really feel for the roles they had been asked to bring to life but were never given the means to do so furthering the loss of impact for many of these moments is the lessthanstellar choreography in rebel moon part 1 while i would never call it bad it fails to create the image of skillful warriors it strives for kora is clearly intended to be a john wicklevel combat monster slaying large numbers of enemies singlehandedly sadly the choreography never manages to make kora feel nearly so deadly and her opponents never feel like they are as hard a challenge as the ones delivered in the aforementioned franchise half of what makes a hero feel exceptional is overcoming a villain that is equally so kora is never given that chance as her antagonists never fail to elevate themselves beyond forgettable cannon fodder even the climactic final oneonone fight is against an opponent whose only melee accomplishment to that point is beating an unarmed man to death with a glorified walking stick i should hope our mysterious badass lead can handle him the other thing that does the combat in rebel moon part 1 no favors is snyders continued obsession with slow motion if you are one of the many who feels like overuse of this technique sucks the life out of combat sequences you will not enjoy this ride if you do this film may be for you the only element that shines brightly throughout rebel moon part 1 is its score from composer tom holkenborg from start to finish the music is filled with sweeping themes energetic fight music and ominous tones that feel like they deserve to be attached to a better movie it works so hard but music in cinema is like the sauce on a steak if the steak is overcooked no amount of sauce can make it good it can just make the meal pass a bit less painfully while rebel moon part 1 child of fire displays some strong visual effects and a gorgeous soundtrack virtually everything else in the film fails rushed arcs underwhelming combat and the need to push the scale and grandiose nature of the setting bring the narrative down making it underwhelming at best and outrightly bad at worst while rebel moon part 1 child of fire displays some strong visual effects and a gorgeous soundtrack virtually

Dec 22 2023,neutral, in rebel moon  part one a child of fire zack snyder 300 watchmen man of steel justice league attempts to launch his own star warsstyle franchise beginning with two netflix films and with plans for so much more with child of fire snyder demonstrates the vast scope of his imagination but at the same time he fails to provide a compelling enough hook to pull viewers into that vast universe of ideas what we get instead in rebel moon part one is a whole lot of telling and very little showing with a lot of necessary backstory and characterization being delegated to the multitude of spinoff projects that are already in the works  including the real version of this very film which already has an rrated directors cut on the way  the story of rebel moon part one  a child of fire opens at a pivotal point in this universes history a sudden coup in the military empire known as the motherworld a princess gifted with the power of life is assassinated and in her place stands balisarius a senator who seizes the power of regent over the motherworld and renews its campaign of war and conquest across the galaxy that war reaches the farming planet of veldt where the farmers are coerced by balisarius ruthless admiral atticus noble ed skrein into supporting the motherworld and its war efforts with their grain harvests when the farmers resist noble and his men turn savage on them  forcing local girl kora sofia boutella to reveal her true identity as a former member of the motherworlds elite warrior force the imperium  when kora finds herself exposed and her adopted home on veldt threatened she joins pilotmercenary kai charlie hunnam on a journey across the galaxy to recruit other infamous warriors who hate balisarius andor the imperium the group kora gathers is filled with souls as broken as they are skilled and together they try to find either salvation redemption or both by defeating noble  on a positive front rebel moon is indicative of just what a talented visual creator zack snyder is the world of this franchise is a clear hodgepodge of ideas from different genres and periods of history scifi fantasy ancient mythology eastern influences like samurai and anime and ideas unique to snyder and co all cooked together into one strange brew the film inspires confidence that an entire franchise universe can be built off of this beginning  but then again that potential for a bigger franchise comes at the cost of this standalone chapter  rebel moon part one  a child of fire plunges us into this franchise universe as if we understand all the events that preceded it and the impact on the various characters little is done to make us feel those emotions andor connections with the ensemble of characters  and its impossible to fully understand how their individual stories inspire each character to form an unspoken bond with the others as warriors willing to die together by the time the third act reaches the climactic battle and the guns are blazing its equally hard to feel any stakes or fear of losing anyone it all plays out and at best it inspires the intrigue to learn more  as for the cast its equally hard to gauge just how the actors approached their roles if this standalone project was their sole focus for developing their characters or were they playing out just a small part of a much larger arc thats been mapped out for them each of them is suitable in their parts but not one of them is all that distinct dynamic or memorable it feels like we get initial sketches of these players but the real dramatic meat is being saved for later  rebel moon part one  a child of fire is a flashy but hollow advertisement for the larger multimedia ip that will follow could we one day look back at this first chapter  with the full context of the franchise behind it  and feel more emotional impact about its events possibly but that day is not today 
Dec 22 2023,negative,im watching this wishing more franchise movies looked for visual grace notes the way snyder does at the same time im watching this wishing someone gave snyder script notes saving us the tropes and operatic cheesiness he leans so heavily on
Dec 22 2023,negative, crumbling under the weight of its own visionary grandiosity zack snyders rebel moon is a series of amazinglooking sets and costumes and effects looking for a story characters emotion  really anything that might raise the pulse maybe part of that is due to the fact that this like so many other movies nowadays is a part one  subtitled a child of fire which could mean that the real fireworks will come in the next installment but the films constant missed opportunities suggest otherwise as it lumbers from uninspiring set piece to uninspiring set piece with little drama charm or personality the background of rebel moon actually presented some cause for optimism director snyder apparently pitched the idea initially to lucasfilm as a star wars project they said no but he made it anyway  for netflix changing little more than a few proper names along the way thats a great zack snyder story i may not love the mans movies but i do admire his doggedness the film even begins in star warsy fashion with some belabored narration from anthony hopkins giving us the portentous backstory of the mother world a planet of decadent kings and queens who used up all their resources and now send imperial dreadnoughts into the far reaches of space to mine and plunder other worlds of course in george lucass original star wars movies such opening information presented as an onscreen crawl occupied a middle ground between pomposity and cheese their florid portent tempered by the fact that they were in the end giant words flying through space to the operatic strains of john williams brass those opening crawls announced the kind of movie we were about to see sincere but playful here the opening voiceover also announces the kind of movie were about to see selfimportant confusing clichéd snyders story is a variation on akira kurosawas assemblingaraggedteamofwarriors saga the seven samurai  a premise already borrowed by films ranging from the magnificent seven to a bugs life not to mention roger cormans infamous 1980 scifi film battle beyond the stars itself a star wars ripoff but no matter its a sturdy premise which is why it tends to work this time the person doing the assembling is kora sofia boutella a young refugee hiding out as a farmer on the planet veldt her life is upended when her small village is visited by imperial emissaries led by the fascistic admiral atticus noble a deliciously reptilian ed skrein who promptly kills the local chief and announces they are seizing the villages grain harvest kora who we soon learn has a past connection to the highest rungs of the mother world runs off with her guiltridden farmer friend gunnar michiel huisman to try and assemble a small army to fight off the invaders one reason why the seven samurai setup works is that it allows for a diverse set of characters who can be introduced in creative ways and then interact with each other in entertaining fashion snyder has done one part of this work as our heroes travel to eyepopping new planets and moons to recruit their champions we meet the statuesque disgraced aristocrat tarak staz nair on a farm where hes being held captive due to a gambling debt and where he has to tame a giant winged creature called a bennu we meet nemesis doona bae a grieving sword master as she fights a pissy babystealing spider played by jena malone general titus djimon hounsou is a disgraced former military leader who once turned his forces on the mother world we find him collapsed drunk and ragged at the entrance of a massive gladiator coliseum there isnt nearly as much action in the film as one would expect however  precious little gladiatin for example despite that impressivelooking coliseum  and when there is its filmed in that hyperslowmotion style that snyder loves so much perhaps he feels it gives these characters a sense of mythic grace thats how it worked in 300 2007 the hit that made his career and helped kick off the modern action speedramping craze but as it did in some of snyders superhero movies the slomo overkill actually renders a lot of the fighting less impressive and surprising at that speed everything starts to look the same even boutella a former dancer who has given some physically exhilarating performances in films like kingsman the secret service and climax winds up looking like a generic actionmovie lead in snyders hands the director does deserve his share of credit for how visually impressive all these environments are not to mention the fascinating design of the various creatures that populate them besides the human spider theres a glowing tentacled parasite brain that speaks through animated corpses and pale grasshopperfaced kings and all sorts of variations on orc even the occasional cutaways reveal fascinatinglooking bits of costuming and makeup but all that makes the letdown that much greater when most of the vignettes in the film are resolved with little drama or interesting conflict tarak basically wrangles that bennu with just a bit of fuss in a flying sequence thats a pale retread of similar scenes from the avatar movies after a nice shower and a brief bit of complaining general titus is pretty much ready to go after kora tries to convince rebel leaders devra cleopatra coleman and darrian ray fisher to join their fight darrian gives his soldiers a rousing speech before asking for those volunteering to step forward it feels like the kind of stirring scene we might see at the climax of a film in which we actually got to know these people here these are faces weve never seen before without any prior context darrians speech comes out of the blue and the stirring score and dramatic staging all feel like a huge miscalculation now look rebel moon  part one a child of fire is hardly the first or worst offender in what has now become a pandemic of films that have been split in half and thus feel like all premise and no payoff but when the setup itself is this dull the lack of payoff stings that much more ideally by the time a child of fire ends we should be invested in these characters and eager to see more of them otherwise whats even the point i think back to the original star wars the one from 1977 the one were now supposed to call episode four a new hope i remember how excited i was to discover luke and han and leia and chewbacca and the two droids how fun it was to spend time with them even before that films climactic space dogfight if star wars had ended before the big attack on the death star it would still have been star wars it would still have been lifechanging for an entire generation and now consider rebel moon and uh these guys who are they why should anybody care what happens to any of them of course the original star wars itself is a pretty high watermark for any movie even a good one to live up to and maybe snyder will deliver something exciting at the conclusion of his fake star wars saga but right now the only reason i might want to see part two would be to feel something anything because rebel moon  part one a child of fire is in the end just a nicelooking lifeless slog
Dec 22 2023,negative, western scifi is littered with orientalist tropes from touchstones like dune to modern films like the creator so its refreshing when something like rebel moon  part one a child of fire comes along with its lucid view of imperialism that steers clear of that ugly influence unfortunately the netflixproduced space saga quickly squanders its storytelling potential after a powerful first act its the rare star warsbased pastiche with somewhat innovative ideasin fact it was born from director zack snyders unrealized pitch to lucasfilm about a jedi version of kurosawa akiras seven samuraibut the projects twopart structure leaves this first entry feeling simultaneously overwrought and incomplete the pg13 rebel moon now playing in select theaters arrives on netflix today with a sequel slated for april but snyder has already gone on record as saying his rrated directors cut for part onewhich like the highly demanded snyder cut of justice league will probably stream at some pointis almost like a different movie upon watching the version netflix has put out its surprisingly easy to imagine a longer and superior edit much of the violence and characterization is implied but rarely depicted with intriguing characters being dropped from the movie wholesale while others spring up at random for only a few minutes of screen time its as messy and haphazard as they come and while the dichotomy of different cuts usually implies a tension or disagreement between studio and filmmaker snyder claims to have been in on the idea from the start the film therefore feels incomplete on two fronts structurally its a frankensteins monster of a movie and it also ends on a cliffhanger just as its getting started a frequent problem in 2023 between blockbusters like fast x and across the spiderverse it opens much like the thor movies do with voiceover from anthony hopkins imbuing extraneous exposition about millenniaold lore with surprising weight none of it really mattershopkins voice scores scenes of enormous battle ships floating through spacesince its the verbal equivalent of an opening star wars text crawl all you need to discern from it is that theres a space king somewhere and that the story unfolds in his empire beyond that information is conveyed in mostly charactercentric ways at least at first the major setting is a quaint anglo saxoninspired agrarian community on veldt a planet colony lit by an enormous red star encompassing the entire horizon veldt is home to kora sofia boutella a quiet hardworking outsider who diligently plows the fields even as her doting friend gunnar michiel huisman and her adopted fatherfigure hagen ingvar sigursson gently suggest a suave local hunter as a potential husband kora has only been on veldt a year and marriage would be a way for her to become a fullfledged member of the community while the idea of ethnicity doesnt explicitly come up in dialogue it hovers over every scene veldts villagers are all played by white actors putting on vaguely scandinavian accents while boutella is algerian the specter of race becomes entirely unavoidable when a convoy of imperial officersled by atticus noble ed skrein righthand man to the kingtouches down on veldt in search of rebels against the empire known as the motherworld if it sounds exactly like star wars that is perhaps the point because it draws from the same well of influences and then multiplies them the empire in star wars was naziinfluenced but in rebel moon the villains wear nazi uniforms practically unaltered except for a lack of actual nazi insignia the predominantly white soldiers all have either british or south african accents the scars of realworld colonialism are woven into rebel moons creative dna these imperial forces play on the trust and naïveté of veldts farmers only to meet them with violence skrein is quite imposing in his role and the only person who seems appropriately afraid is kora given that shes not only seen this kind of violence enacted on her people but shes been a pawn to it herself having been kidnapped and trained by the motherworld as a child in distinctly snyder fashion flashbacks in the form of vivid slowmotion action tableaus take us through koras backstory as a victim of the motherworlds fascism when her sandy home planet was invaded by ruthless military forces this too screams star wars in concept but it goes a step further rather than simply using a nebulous middle eastern setting it invokes realworld imperial politics with a clear and direct rebuke of american foreign policy the narrow streets and crowded buildings of koras home world have hints of islamic architecture while the soldiers who unrepentantly reduce it to rubble are adorned with a beigegreen armor overtly inspired by modern us military gear the film in this way aligns itself spiritually with george lucass original star wars from 1977 which in addition to modeling its villains off the third reich sought to subtly critique the nixon era of foreign policy with the empire being opposed by bands of scrappy militants organizing in jungles akin to the viet cong this united statesasempire trend would continue in lucass early2000s star wars prequels which all but put george w bush speeches in its villains mouths during their power grabs but the disneyowned sequel trilogy of the 2010s would largely avoid such entanglements rebel moon picks up that dropped political baton by crafting a space opera in which the united states prolonged war on terror in west asia and north africa is likened to nazi occupation these contemporary and realistic overtones are laced with plenty of fantastical elements too from spaceships and laser weapons to ceremonial guards with ornate masks and enormous red headdresses bearing witness to the soldiers merciless ambush like a silent externalization of some unspoken religious fanaticism thats driving the motherworld the first act sees kora wrestling with how to respond to her place of refuge being invaded by familiar foes her first instinct is to runits all she knows how to dobut when the battalion placed on veldt attempts to sexually assault a local girl this is a much rougher and grimier star wars shes forced to make a vital decision she isnt the only one either the film goes to great lengths to set up not one but two conscientious objectors to this revolting act a compassionate motherworld soldier named aris taiwanese actor sky yang and a humanoid imperial robot jimmy voiced by hopkins who has a change of heart after being shown kindness on veldt the flashpoint that kicks the plot into motion is this tiny act of rebellion staged by kora aris and jimmy involving guns axes and other blades all filmed in snyders signature speedramping style from left doona bae as nemesis ray fisher as bloodaxe staz nair as tarak michiel huisman as gunnar sofia boutella as kora charlie hunnam as kai e duffy as milius and djimon hounsou as titus in rebel moon unfortunately after meticulously building to this moment this is also where the movie starts to break down the action choreography while fluid and conceptually stunning falls victim to editing that sanitizes every bit of impact and bloodshed it has echoes of brutality but the film always cuts around violence or presents it out of focus in the background once the sequence ends and kora has inadvertently attracted the wrath of the motherworld she and gunnar are forced to embark on a secret mission to round up fellow rebels and soldiers to defend veldt once noble and his forces return its seven samurai the japanese classic in which seven scattered fighters join forces to protect a village from bandits readapted numerous times including in hollywoods the magnificent seven and bollywoods sholay in all but setting and name with four warriors already on veldts roster it doesnt seem like it ought to be long before rebel moon gets to the action well that would be true if there were any purpose to setting up aris and jimmy as such vital and interesting characters but for some headscratching reason not only do they not join kora and gunnar on their quest they also dont show up in the movie again as alluring as the films first 40 minutes may be they arent followed by what youd typically describe as a story either progressing or building to anything of note instead it simply cuts to kora and gunnar arriving on different planets without scenes of them even traveling there and recruiting various other potential fighters with their own histories against the motherworld in scenes that grow progressively truncated rebel moon is essentially a first act followed by five more first actseach shorter faster and more confounding than the lastin which brand new characters are introduced seem reluctant to join the cause but are quickly convinced to do so usually by means of an empty speech from kora that amounts to so you dont want to fightbut what if you did cue triumphant music apart from charlie hunnams scumbag mercenary and escape pilot kaiwho all but turns to the camera and says im han solo but with an irish accentthe litany of characters introduced on koras journey do actually have the potential to be fun and interesting indianrussian hunk staz nair plays tarak an enslaved indigenous man with a connection to animals which in this universe include enormous griffons resulting in an avatarinspired scene of a warrior connecting with a flying beast korean actress bae doona plays nemesis a cyborg and reluctant vigilante plucked from a gothic western who wields flaming swords that may as well be lightsabers she shows up fighting a spiderlady played by jena malone but by the time the movie introduces the likes of washed up general titus djimon hounsou and sibling revolutionaries darrian and devra bloodaxe ray fisher cleopatra coleman the screen time theyre afforded becomes increasingly condensed until the movie devolves into less of samurai riff and more of a samurai parody depicting the outward shape of familiar story beats before accelerating forward to the next recruitment this happens ad nauseam until the story arrives at its sudden climax some two hours in but instead of having the decency to end it keeps going for nearly another twenty minutes through an extended epilogue meant to tease the sequel theres a good movie hiding somewhere inside rebel moon  part one snyders passion for this burdened battlemaiden saga shines through in every scenehes intent on presenting boutella as both ripped and thoughtfulwhile the scifi setting is rife with tangible weathered material awash in foggy atmosphere snyder doubles as cinematographer and led by a visually exciting multiethnic coalition of heroes teaming up to fight space nazis its a film that looks and feels alive but beyond its first act its completely dead on arrival unfolding mechanically while maintaining only the barest appearance of kurosawas classic and its handful star wars hallmarks while it avoids hollywoods penchant for orientalism and instead uses its designs to create an explicit antiimperial and anticolonial text it fails to live up to both its eastern and western influences and exists only as a malformed piece of marketing for something better from left michiel huisman as gunnar sofia boutella as kora doona bae as nemesis staz nair as tarak and charlie hunnam as kai in rebel moon
Dec 22 2023,negative,snyder has his obsessions and his directorial sameness struggling to sell a child of fire as something intense and involving when the viewing experience is quite the opposite
Dec 22 2023,negative,not as awful as many people are making out but a frenzied scifi wannabe epic where the talkie scenes land with all the emotional impact of video game cutscenes hey some of us like video games
Dec 22 2023,negative, beginning with an epic musical score and grand voiceover before cutting to a vibrant alien sky zack snyders rebel moon sets the tone for an eyewidening scifi adventure unfortunately despite the directors knack for spectacle it soon transpires that this first instalment is a bland amalgamation of various other scifi flicks with little in the way of personality or originality of its own the plot follows a plucky farmer named kora sofia boutella who flees her peaceful home after a tyrannical rulers ruthless soldiers demand all the villages harvest her goal is to assemble a group of warriors strong enough to fight back against the invaders and thats about as far as the script goes in terms of its plot much of the film sees kora and her growing band of companions zipping across various planets and getting into fights along the way its essentially seven samurai in space with elements of dune and star wars sprinkled on top dragged across an over twohour runtime the protagonists journey takes them to a host of distinct and interesting locations that are home to some strange creatures these inclusions give glimpses into a vast world full of intrigue but theres never enough time spent developing these ideas one scene for example sees jenna malone play a halfhumanhalfspider creature who captures the children of settlers as revenge for what happened to her rather than explore this subplot to give the world some flavour the script blasts past this encounter with another flashy action scene this absence of worldbuilding likewise extends to the band of heroes whereas a large part of the charm and humanity of kurosawas samurai classic came from the characters gradually forming bonds with each other theres rarely any interaction between rebel moons warriors most of what viewers need to know about them is told through some quick exposition before they vanish into the background it doesnt help that the actors feel like theyre going through the motions delivering their lines lifelessly the exception to this being ed skrein who enjoys every second of playing the villainous admiral although its gorgeous panoramic shots and slick action scenes make rebel moon a goodlooking film its paperthin plot and underdeveloped characters are what ultimately cause zack snyders space odyssey to fall disappointingly flat
Dec 22 2023,negative, a shallow imitation of star wars rebel moon part one  a child of fire indulges in all of zack snyders traits as a director while only constructing the illusion of character and place had both been achieved it would have made the films excellent visuals more than just a pretty screensaver as a huge star wars fan the prospect of zack snyder and netflixs take on george lucas critical work was fascinating star wars itself is a mishmash of lucas take on several genres and directors but produced a world that was still wholly original and filled with interesting themes amazing characters and analytical themes so any work based on it brings expectations of similar quality well watching rebel moon part one  a child of fire should quickly remove that notion lucasfilms rejection of snyders idea for a star wars film however should have been the first warning that a child of fire would be nothing like its source material sure a child of fire has an evil empire rebels and takes inspiration from pop culture and the history of the world but this is all surfacelevel poke at it attempt to interrogate it further and rebel moon reveals nothing of substance but worse than this is that it applies snyders trademark grime and selfseriousness that misses the point entirely rebel moon part one  a child of fire is an introduction to a whole new galaxy where audiences find themselves on the farming planet veldt where the community works and lives harmoniously one day the evil imperium shows up demanding that the village sell its surplus grain for a seemingly fair price this offer is refused by the village leader corey stoll with a terrible beard as before kora sofia boutella a relative newcomer advised him that the imperium wants everything things inevitably turn sour and the village leader gets his head bashed in by admiral atticus noble ed skrein who says he will be back in ten months for their next harvest leaving a garrison behind to make sure this is accomplished  a child of fire has the foundations for an intriguing galaxy but it never goes beyond this the film visits many places in which to recruit its many characters but theyre no more than short vignettes that hint at how interesting a planet could be if more time was spent developing it there are worlds with glorious cliffs polluted mines and even a world with a gladiatorial colosseum but none of them feel like places just planetary backdrops for the film to stick characters on for kora to then whisk away on her quest  with snyder at the helm its unsurprising his trademark style is present except its dialed to 11 the atmosphere is thick with grime alongside an overbearing sense of selfseriousness and the oppressive slow motion present in nearly every action beat drags it to a crawl theres also the oversexualization of the characters at the films start kora is pressured to get with a village boy and two action sequences happen to prevent rape its an attempt at edginess but its just crude this hints at the fact that this was an rrated film since theres also an obvious lack of blood from action scenes  something has been held back for a snyder cut an expected element to please the mans fanboy cult its this dark and grungey tone that strangles out a sense of happiness a feeling conveyed by kora herself in one of her exposition dumps there is an attempt at the theme of found family something that star wars is built upon but the characters are too wrapped up in their own personal dramas to build upon this idea characters are also introduced and then quickly folded into the wider ensemble preventing any meaningful connections from forming hopefully this is something that can be improved upon in rebel moon part two  the scargiver one of the more interesting parts of star wars and scifi in general is its ability to take parts of realworld history and current politics and use them to influence their worlds to comment on society and history rebel moon does this in a superficial sense with its evil colonist empire inflicting its will on the galaxy its also very much modeled on the roman empire with the senate names of admiral atticus noble and regent balisarius and their overall attire but this goes no deeper  there is no clever criticism of western powers or comment on modern politics that might make the audience think about the situation around them and reflect on their world scifi doesnt always have to be this but the deeper imagery and themes it can inspire are absent and this is disappointing for a film that wants to follow in the footsteps of lucas work snyder certainly watched some star wars films  some of a child of fires locations are ripped right from lucas galaxy  but overlooks their political purpose entirely kieran burt

Dec 22 2023,negative,rebel moon part one  a child of fire just circles around the same pattern
Dec 22 2023,negative, american fiction is the directing debut of watchmen series writer cord jefferson in this adaptation of percival everetts 2001 novel erasure jeffrey wright plays an uncompromising and frustrated novelist named thelonious monk ellison the story follows monk as he takes a forced sabbatical to care for his ailing mother played by leslie uggams when his latest book doesnt sell monk writes under a pseudonym an offensive and exploitative tome that hes sure will be lampooned when the book is a runaway hit the confused monk must cope with his secret success while balancing the emotional crises in his life seeing where monks grand charade takes him is funny and provocative as publishers go crazy for the book and hollywood comes calling this pitchperfect combination of dry observant satire and relatable family drama elements is one of the most accessible endoftheyear awards contenders the performances are topnotch with jeffrey wright a lock for an oscar nomination the attractive supporting cast features terrific work by sterling k brown who crushed it in the highly recommended biosphere earlier this year director michael mann see heat worked for 20 years to bring this passion project to the big screen the film a biopic about enzo ferrari is a dull telling of events in the summer of 1957 when the ferrari empire was in jeopardy in ferrari adam driver plays the middleaged italian automobile entrepreneur when his top spot in racing and highend sports car manufacturing is threatened enzo pushes his team everharder to win meanwhile the relationship with his toughasnails wife laura penélope cruz is deteriorating as details about his affair and child with lina lardi shailene woodley are revealed while some viewers have noted the distracting computergenerated effects related to the showy automobile crashes i found them shocking and exciting but the drama and industrial intrigue came off as limp and unengaging and the final race sequence seemed strangely detached from the rest of the narrative as i struggled to understand how all of enzos efforts on the racetrack managed to save his business kingdom performances are uneven as driver does his level best to look stern and maintain character with a sometimesshifting italian accent cruz gets the juiciest role and does the finest work in the film while woodley is miscast and never finds her characters center cast fantasia barrino taraji p henson danielle brooks colman domingo corey hawkins phylicia pearl mpasi halle bailey ciara gabriella willson her david alan grier jon batiste and louis gossett jr this handsomely made second cinematic adaptation of alice walkers seminal novel struggles to justify its existence while also trying to separate itself from steven spielbergs arguably perfect 1985 classic the musical elements give this new production an added boost but for those schooled in spielbergs film its hard not to attribute the emotional feelings to nostalgia the story focuses on celie played as a teen by phylicia pearl mpasi and as an adult by america idol winner fantasia barrino who is forced to marry the cruel mister colman domingo we see celie grow up under misters oppressive rule which involves sending away her beloved sister nettie played as a teen by halle bailey and as an adult by ciara isolated and abused celie must cope with years of mistreatment until she is visited by singer shug avery a terrific taraji p henson but this new friend might only make misters cruelty worse while barrino is the lead she is overshadowed by supporting performances danielle brooks plays the straighttalking sofia a character previously played by oprah winfrey who received an oscar nomination in 1986 part of barrinos problem is that the script requires her to be defeated until a critical turning point but in the spielberg film whoopi goldberg conveyed more in her quiet and trembling calm than barrino can muster of course barrinos singing voice is strong and blends well with the rest of the spirited cast led by the showy and infectious brooks who like oprah understands the demands of playing the tragic sofia but the musical theatricality which involves fantasy sequences akin to the broadway show upon which this is partially based undercuts the gritty drama that undergirds alice walkers mature source material and where spielbergs film hit us hard with celies despair and sofias complete meltdown director blitz bazawule plays things a bit too cheery at well over 2 hours in length the song and dance numbers weigh down narrative coherence cutting a few of these sequences especially ones that dont appear to have a plot purpose could have made those that remain even more significant but several numbers are stunning like a scene when shug arrives at the bayou honkytonk aboard a boat and a fantasy sequence that has celie belting while being surrounded by men on a chain gang wrestling fans might find the iron claw moving but this abridged telling of the cursed von erich family isnt the transcendent take on the sport it could have been the story follows three brothers who became professional wrestlers in the 1980s while the outcomes of their matches are all predetermined the action in the ring is the product of careful training and athletic prowess we meet the von erich patriarch fritz a very good holt mccallany as he moves from the ring to wrestling management his goal is to make his beefy boys into stars even if they have no desire to wrestle the eldest kevin a more muscledup than normal zac efron is tapped for greatness but despite having the brawn he struggles mentally to convey television charisma david harris dickinson moves up in the ranks and is joined by former olympic hopeful kerry the bears jeremy allen white the three men make a fierce and competitive presence gaining notice from other leagues who are always clamoring for talent but the pressures to perform exact a horrible price and the curse of the von erich family is their legacy instead of their achievements on the mat this movie story casts aside steroid use only showing it briefly and ignores entirely one of the von erich brothers writerdirector sean durkins dour handling of a notable highprofile american tragedy fails to break through even though performances especially from a devoted efron are strong and the wrestling is sometimes exciting but the problem is partially the sport itself professional wrestling isnt a fake sweaty activity the competition isnt related to who is ultimately declared the winner balancing the athletic elements with those related to raw showmanship proves tricky as durkins script turns overly sentimental in the final act the closing sequences almost seem to be lifted from an inspirational religious film lost is the irreverent often hokey fun associated with the sport as this vision depicts it as a desaturated damaging wasteland that leaves few unscathed where the iron claw could not figure out how to depict the sport of wrestling the boys in the boat might have some viewers hitting the rowing machine this wholesome and wellmade adaptation of daniel james browns bestselling book is an excellent sports movie the true story chronicles the efforts of the university of washingtons rowing team to compete in the 1936 berlin olympics in this depressionera tale coach al ulbrickson joel edgerton assembles a team from open tryouts most members including joe rantz callum turner have never rowed before but ulbrickson knows his sport and is committed to molding these young college students into olympiccaliber athletes the film has fun showing the process of training and early competitions and turner is good as joe a loner struggling to pay for school without parental support joes relationship with boat builder george pocock a great peter guinness is the heart of the movie as the two men are shown bonding while crafting and maintaining the tools necessary to make a run at the gold clooneys conventional directing is just what is required because the story is so inspiring that no amount of tinkering is necessary and the production design immerses viewers in the time and place in one sequence crowds watching a race are shown sitting in stands erected on open train cars that follow the boats along a river the boys in the boat wont likely compete for endoftheyear prizes but its one of the holiday seasons most pleasing movies suitable for audiences of all ages writerdirector andrew haighs odd fantasy romance contains excellent performances from hot actors paul mescal and andrew scott the movie has scott playing adam a screenwriter living a lonely existence in an almost abandoned highrise apartment building when he begins a relationship with harry played by mescal the buildings only other resident adam explores memories of his parents who tragically died when he was twelve the movies illusory elements have adam returning to his family home to discover his mother and father played by jamie bell and claire foy alive and well as though they havent changed in over 30 years as adam spends time with his parents he gets closer and closer to harry all of us strangers is a deliberate narrative that will frustrate some viewers who might consider it a languid horror movie and less a moving drama rebel moon  part one a child of fire is like the first draft of a juvenile star wars fan fiction tome this comically bad science fiction adventure will remind viewers of other space opera misfires like 2012s john carter or the wachowskis 2015 epic jupiter ascending the shame is that for all of director zack snyders undeniable talent in managing special effectladen extravaganzas he has trouble telling a wholly satisfying story moon started as a star wars universe pitch and while there are elements that will remind you of george lucas classic blockbuster those homages are merely window dressing for a seven samurai the magnificent seven knockoff lowbudget producing and directing master roger corman set those stories effectively in outer space way back in 1980 with the pleasantly entertaining battle beyond the stars unfortunately none of cormans comic and campy sensibilities extend to snyders take that plays things way too seriously in moon former soldier kora sofia boutella must assemble a ragtag group of fighters to repel an attack on a peaceful farming village on a distant fertile moon the risky search brings her in contact with a range of dangerous rebels hunted by the evil ruling class and the disgusting admiral atticus noble ed skrein in a turn that approaches tongue in cheek but never quite gets there unfortunately snyders script written with two other screenwriters fails to understand the need to give each chosen warrior a distinct identity and they come off as clumsy brutes with little understanding of sophisticated battle tactics for example one of their crew members is the revered supposed genius general titus djimon hounsou who demonstrates little military acumen koras hapless team doesnt instill the slightest bit of confidence when challenged by the admirals vast forces its too bad snyder didnt remember what worked for luke skywalker and his small but clever xwing pilots to beat an overwhelming threat youve got to outsmart them rebel moon proves to be one dim bulb
Dec 22 2023,positive, theres no denying that rebel moon  part one a child of fire which follows a pair of farmers as they seek aid from fighters to make a stand against the space imperials who would rob their village of its harvest is derivative of other films beyond the fact that the film is an obvious seven samurai and star wars fusion theres also the fact that battle beyond the stars did the same thing more than 40 years ago but does that really matter and if it does why cant it be a good thing like sucker punch more than a decade ago a child of fire feels like a playground for story writerdirector zack snyder to mix and match elements from things he loves in what can just as easily be called a celebration of influences as an uninspired pastiche like the multiple fantastical sequences in sucker punch the many planets in a child of fire allow snyder to freely play with varied and seemingly disparate aesthetics early on sleek dark metal multiple rocket propelled landing ships of the villainous motherworld land at protagonist koras sofia boutella adoptive home village that looks very much like the medieval scandinavian inspired rohan in peter jacksons the lord of the rings series later a flashback draws on a different city in jacksons adaptation the blue gray city of ruins osgiliath and fills it with bright red laser gunfire another sequence has the aidseeking characters stop at a classic western ranch but instead of horses the corral is home to a jet black griffin or rather bennu a creature that gives the film its greatest scene of true movie magic wonder when it takes a human character for a ride theres also an entirely wooden city plucked out of any jidaigeki and a city evocative of the blade runner films where the farmers witness one of their recruits battle a humanoid spider monster played with relish by jena malone the only worldbuilding problem with the rebel moon universe is one that applies to star wars as well that the main players are all human when kora and her companion gunnar michiel huisman begin their search for fighters they visit a bar in the nearest city and as with the mos eisley cantina in star wars a child of fire takes the opportunity to show off a variety of creative alien designs but in both these imaginatively designed alien characters highlight that the core cast of these films are humans who dont require hours in makeup chairs or hours of postproduction to render fantastical as in star wars those frustrations are forgivable though especially when the film delivers on the action that snyder has become famous for sometimes comically so the fights are full of the slowmotion and speedramped combat snyder perfected in 300 the sound for handtohand blows are deafeningly heavy thumps whether the visual calls for level of sonic impact or not laser gunfire is even louder and farther down the low end while blade cuts offer some of the sharpest sounding slice sounds accompanied by blood soaring through the air its joyously over the top stuff in the best way similarly over the top or at least overly on the nose is the majority of the dialogue that brings to mind the i know writers who use subtext and theyre all cowards joke but its all delivered with such sincerity both from the very game alist actors and from snyders framing of them as they speak that its impossible to be cynical about like the aesthetics snyders playing with you can feel his adoration for the narratives hes pulling from and just how seriously he takes their themes of redemption and hope in the face of oppression that adoration makes it clear that a child of fire is a movie from a filmmaker who loves movies and just wants to make movies for other people to love and we certainly cant hold loving movies against him or the film
Dec 22 2023,negative, rebel moon bored the hell out of me bored with a capital b zack snyder has made a series of mediocre movies such as sucker punch and army of the dead but his latest movie breaks a new record as he hits rock bottom with a socalled epic scifi adventure opera that seems like the next big thing it was a cross between star wars and seven samurai where he even originally pitched his idea to lucasfilm as a standalone star wars movie not connected to the skywalker saga it didnt work out as planned snyder went to warner bros twice but got rejected before netflix agreed to his idea and granted him the budget to film a twopart movie event with the followup titled rebel moon  part two the scargiver slated for an april 2024 release date but till then the first part of rebel moon itself is already doa the story goes like this kora sofia boutella is a former imperium soldier with a dark past who has since laid low on the farming planet of veldt everything looks fine at first until the looming arrival of the imperium ship above the sky the soldiers led by the sadistic admiral atticus noble ed skrein demand all the farming villages harvested grain and he will return in 10 weeks to ensure the farmers were doing their jobs he deployed a small group of soldiers to watch over them kora on the other hand chooses to leave the place before an incident revolving around an attempted rape of one of the villagers prompted her to kill the soldiers soon with the help of fellow villager gunnar michiel huisman the two set out to assemble a ragtag group of warriors as they journey to multiple locations this includes smuggler and pilot kai charlie hunnam beasttamer tarak staz nair cyborg swordmaster nemesis doona bae former imperium general titus djimon hounsou as well as warrior darrian bloodaxe ray fisher and his sister devra cleopatra coleman clocking at 134 minutes long the movie overstays its welcome long before it reaches the end everything here screams clichéd as snyder shamelessly borrowed and ripped off movies from star wars and seven samurai to dune the lord of the rings and even at one point inglourious basterds i dont mind the lack of originality in a movie as long as it is entertaining enough to keep me invested throughout the running time too bad thats barely the case for rebel moon  part one a child of fire snyders usual stylised slow motion is on full display but his penchant for employing that effect annoys me more than ever the action sequences have none of the palpable thrills and highstakes energy while the story which snyder also cowrote alongside kurt johnstad and shay hatten is disappointingly bland from the getgo there are no emotional and dramatic stakes as snyders selfserious direction sucks the life out of the movie it doesnt help either when the protagonist played by the otherwise welltoned and physically fit sofia boutella is devoid of any personality she is nothing more than a depressingly glum former warriorturnedrebel trying to defend veldt against the tyrannical imperium army its hard to care whether her character can make it throughout the journey since the movie strangely forgoes the importance of developing a strong character arc the same also goes for the rest of the supporting characters namely charlie hunnams cutrate han sololike kai while michiel huisman disappoints with his feeble supporting turn as gunnar then theres the scenerychewing ed skrein whose antagonist role of admiral atticus noble is trying to ape christoph waltzs colonel hans landalike role from inglourious basterds the special effects are a mixed bag even though the movie does feature some cool creature designs theres a brief but wellchoreographed action setpiece between nemesis lightsaberlike double swords against the humanoid spiderlike alien harmada played by jena malone anthony hopkins in the meantime provides an aboveaverage voiceover role as the sympathetic robot jimmy there has been news about the rrated directors cut of rebel moon  part one a child of fire which reportedly contains nearly an additional hours worth of footage whether or not it would be a better version remains to be seen but for now what we have here is a colossal misfire that im not sure its worth waiting for the second part next april
Dec 22 2023,negative, its time to accept that those release the snyder cut tshirts arent aging well because as joseph campbell taught us the most important element in any heros journey is to pick a hero worth following writerdirector zack snyder isnt that hero the clumsilytitled rebel moon part one  a child of fire is a scifi epic crippled by the limits of big budget scifi movie imagination whatever one thinks of  mr 300 justice league and watchmen his rebel moon is corporate content engineering at its most cynical campbells hero of a thousand faces reiterated the idea that there are only so many plots and basically only one heroine or hero to lead the reader listener or viewer through them  its a humorless mashup of a new hope and the seven samurai and its old west remake the magnificent seven a tale of imperialism and brutal repression with lawless towns and saloons cantinas britaccented robots shootouts swordfights and rumors of a chosen one the tech is just a rejiggering and somewhat more art moderne streamlined redesign of all the rebels vs empire futurism of every scifi movie of the past 50 years  there are gladiators and bounty hunters and farmers in bib overalls and undisciplined goons as soldiers wearing recycled american gladiators armor insectoids and humanoid insects and hints of interspecies kink  supernaturalism fascism native mysticism fantastic beasts and where to find them sure theyre mixedin with gigantic planet killer space dreadnoughts and ed skrein as a pastyfaced sadist out to foil a rebellion  the fights are filled with slomo the cast peopled with generic characters played by actors with skills and just enough cachet to merit their paychecks  the great sir anthony hopkins voices an empathetic and utterly superfluous robot charlie hunnam is an irishaccented han solo substitute djimon hounsou is a rebel general reduced to gladiatorial combat and fangirl and fanboy favorite sofia boutella of recent installments of the mummy kingsmen and star trek is kora a space war survivor laying low on a nordicaccented moon named veldt just a farm gal in overalls and a parisian pixie haircut waiting for the moment when we learn she is the most wanted fugitive in the known universe all that slomo as she fends off occupiers imperial minions and treacherous locals of every stripe its to minimize the incredubility of the fight choreography  koras village is visited by soldiers from the realm who want their harvest dont stop and ponder why this grainnegotiation would be carried out at an eat local level by a large armed occupying force itll give you a headache a murder or two and one vengeful slaughter later kora and sweetonkora farmer gunnar michiel huisman are off on a quest to find the rebels and get some help for their village as for other help toshiro mifune and yul brenner arent available maybe this general hounsou this swordslinging vixen nemesis bae doona a freedslave tarak staz nair and can be enlisted in flashbacks kora doles out bits and pieces of her past to gunnar and we see cary elwes as a bearded uniformed heir to the romanov crown the powers of a possible chosen one as prophesied and we never for an instant grasp anything resembling whats really at stake here all these petty crimes against originality wouldnt matter a whit if snyder  co mashed it all up into something fun or at least more distracting  ive liked some of these actors in other roles but even with hunnams downtha pub accident there is nobody here id care to follow down the primrose path of this heroines journey no wellhandled action beat that isnt literally recycled from a thousand other action films and a dozen other star wars outings with comic book and star wars content tumbling into oversaturation and finally losing their cultural currency the timing of this imitation galaxy far away is pretty bad as well but maybe part two of rebel moon will work better if not im sure some rocket scientist will start screaming for the snyder cut soon enough 
Dec 22 2023,positive, is zack snyder a villain or hero depending on which corners of the internet you lurk the filmmaker who served as chief creative architect of the dc extended universe which comes crashing down this holiday season with the lameduck release of aquaman and the lost kingdom is either the worst thing to happen to hollywood since joseph mccarthy or the saviour were all too marvelpacified to properly appreciate the truth is of course far less incendiary or interesting basically the guy is a superhack bursting with ideas that are not his own able to execute them with a façade of flair that evaporates once you look at any one image for longer than a superslowmo second does this make snyders new netflix epic rebel moon  sorry rebel moon  part one a child of fire which is being sold as onehalf of the first film in a trilogy  an abomination hardly this is instead inimitably watchable trash the kind of highgloss nothingness that doesnt matter unless you really want it to so highly imitative as to strip the word derivative of any meaning rebel moon is fanfiction writ large as if snyder believes hes outsmarting everyone from george lucas and george rr martin to the estates of frank herbert and hr giger perhaps there is a modicum of earned wit in how snyder goes back to lucass original star wars inspiration akira kurosawas seven samurai to patch together this story of an outerplanetary farming community that when threatened by intergalactic colonizers who look an awful lot like space nazis enlist warriors from different corners of the universe to defend their homeland but just because snyder once pitched rebel moon to lucasfilm as a dark star wars spinoff doesnt make it the genuine article and yet all the recycled elements are put forward with such deluded bravado by snyder  and financed with such ridiculously bountiful netflix resources  that you cannot help but resign yourself to sitting back and letting the guy get it out of his system my what a nice little facsimile of the mos eisley cantina youve recreated here zack oh how clever of you to pit the two actors who traded the role of warrior daario naharis on game of thrones against one another with michiel huisman playing a brave farmer and ed skrein a bloodthirsty spacefascist and um sure good for you in getting jena malone to play a xenomorphy alien spider who faces off against a lightsaberwielding wicked witch of the west the descriptions above might make things sound more intriguing than they actually are but also consider that the charismafree sofia boutella plays a farmland hero whose intensely complicated back story mixes luke skywalker with guardians of the galaxys gamora and that british actor charlie hunnam adopts the wildest irish accent ever conceived to play a character who can only be described as han solo but also an ira leprechaun do you want to hear about how anthony hopkins voices a robot warriorturnedpacifist named jimmy possibly but there are only so many hours in the day scratch that  there is apparently a blackholes worth of inverted time for all things rebel moon given that part one just barely assembles its heroic team by the twohour mark only snyder  or perhaps lucas james cameron and denis villeneuve  knows what comes next in part two the scargiver or the rrated extended  cut that is set to hit netflix this spring bring it on if you absolutely must just dont expect audiences to champion a space opera they have seen so many times before we will however definitely watch it with one eye maybe even two halfopen
Dec 22 2023,negative, whatever the tonnage of the cashladen trucks that netflix presumably backed into anthony hopkins garage before parachuting him in to save the indefensibly dull rebel moon at the last moment it wasnt enough the recent oscar winner has seen it all in his day  he once played a transformers historian for optimus primes sake  but youd be hard pressed to find a project in which he was as underutilised as he is in director zack snyders latest eyesore hopkins is literally reduced to an exposition device in a movie where one character greets another not with a customary hello but with youre the legendary assassin known only by the name of nemesis assassinated 16 high ranking imperial officers and their security detail all in a hunt to avenge your slaughtered children what even the films protagonist a rebel warrior named kora sofia boutella isnt spared from having to deliver lines like this in one of her first scenes she tells her friend i am a child of war the very idea of family was beaten out of me they literally live in the same house did he not know snyder is hardly known for his writing  more than his usual visual ticks the directors biggest tell is probably getting one of his characters to say the words the why of  but rebel moon often feels like a firstdraft its uncommonly lousy even by his standards the filmmaker might cite respectable influences such as george lucas and akira kurosawa but youll never catch him admitting that rebel moon actually seems like it has been cobbled together from the rubble of his nemesis joss whedons shortlived television series firefly set in an alien universe ruled by a fascist regime  theres frankly too much lore to keep track of  the movie opens on a peaceful planet named veldt this is where kora has been living as a farmer for a couple of years after having been discovered in the wreckage of a spaceship in the aftermath of a war unbeknownst to the imperial regime the citizens of veldt are living on some of the most fertile farmland in the entire universe but their cover is blown one day when a squadron of soldiers arrives unannounced and demands the entirety of their produce ed skrein plays the commandant atticus noble as a cross between colonel hans landa from inglourious basterds and captain russell from lagaan in his cruel demands there are echoes of the bengal famine when british colonialists stole from india to feed their people and fund their war leaving millions dead snyder makes the odd decision to portray kora as a reluctant hero but after having backed himself into a corner decides that she cannot remain passive any longer as expected kora turns on a dime and finds the motivation to fight back after witnessing villainy firsthand its disappointing to note that even now  years after being pummeled for the gender politics in sucker punch  snyder relies on violence against women as a narrative trope to propel his plots in rebel moon kora kicks into gear only after watching one of her friends nearly get gangraped by the nazi cosplayers who serve as the films antagonists snyder also somehow finds a way to be homophobic in this faraway fantasy land  an impossible feat youd imagine seeing as were talking about a world in which jena malone plays a humanoid spiderwoman but there you have it the ugliness of rebel moon isnt limited to its visuals its probably worth pointing out that kora doesnt lead the fight against the imperialists herself but chooses instead to put together a ragtag team of warriors she is joined on her quest by her suitor a man named gunnar michiel huisman and subsequently by a han soloesque rogue named kai played by charlie hunnam with who knows why a northern irish accent rebel moons origins as a star wars project are apparent in addition to the shameless use of lightsabers and the solo standin snyder also sends his protagonists to a cantinastyle hive of scum and villainy populated by skeevy characters whose faces seem to have been fashioned out of leftover prosthetics from his previous netflix movie army of the dead it has been suggested  this is purely speculative of course  that netflix tried to reverseengineer a release the snyder cuttype movement for rebel moon the version of the movie that has been presented to us was edited down from a more sprawling directors cut which will no doubt be released in some weeks if this is true it has to be the most comically inept decision made by a studio since well the snyder cut movement itself almost unbelievably rebel moon might not be the best film about an armed conflict in a mythical kingdom this week indian army to raise new division with 1400015000 troops for possible deployment in eastern ladakh division to be reorganized from existing personnel and placed under northern command aims to maintain stable and balanced deployment in entire command theatre and keep strike corps prepared for their roles in jk and ladakh
Dec 22 2023,negative, jason mamoa returns for possibly the last time as the aquatic dc superhero in aquaman and the lost kingdom theres over 200 million worth of eye candy in the story of our heros attempt to save the world from black manta and global warmingand about 5 worth of originality in the screenplay its a merely adequate aquatic adventure emma stone gives an oscar caliber performance in the bizarre horror comedy poor things a feminist rethinking of the themes from frankenstein its bold original visually spectacular and very disturbing with irreverent adult content that barely misses an nc17 rating for openminded audiences its a playfully nutty experience the iron claw is one unique bird an arthouse pro wrestling drama zac efron leads the cast in the true story of the von erich clan a family of grapplers who experienced more than their share of triumphs and tragedies its edgy tone may be grating to some viewers but its surprisingly empathetic file the animated comedy migration under the pleasant surprises category the makers of the minions movies offer a tale about a family of ducks that encounters many dangers when they decide to fly off to jamaica its a witty imaginative and fastmoving family feature take a star wars movie remove the sense of humor and adventurous fun and you might have something that looks like the netflix space opus rebel moon zack snyders dreary and derivative scifi flick is sad to say the first in a trilogy it delivers the action and visuals but its a bloated and humdrum drama
Dec 22 2023,negative, zack snyders rebel moon  part one a child of fire immediately announces its presence as a giant mound of derivative fertilizer in the opening moments when we hear the clichéd sounds of an important story choir as an intergalactic dreadnought emerges from a freudianimagery portal and we get a voiceover telling us about the evil and oppressive motherworld that is seeking to control the entire galaxy and kill all the rebels that kind of thing  unless this is a parody of star wars it looks like were in for a long and ponderous cgidominated slog filled with stock characters slowmo battle sequences and interminable flashbacks designed to give clarity to a murky and convoluted story clocking in at an interminable 134 minutes rebel moon devotes an entire movie to the assembletheteam part of the story that usually takes about a halfhour in a typical action film whether its a western or a heist film or set in outer space rebel moon  part two the scargiver is set for release on april 19 2024 in an unsettling scene in which a group of soldiers attempt to gangrape a local girl a hero arises in the form of sofia boutellas kora a newcomer to the village who as it turns out is a legendary warrior with a complicated past that she keeps having to explain in extended flashback sequences after kora wipes out a dozen or so soldiers its on she has no choice but to lead the rebellion against the motherland time to draft a team of warriors charlie hunnam is the han soloesque mercenary starship pilot kai djimon hounsou is a harddrinking gladiator who was once the great gen titus staz nair is tara a fierce and noble imprisoned warrior who gains his freedom by taming and riding a hilariously cheesylooking giant griffin and doona bae is the cyborg sword master nemesis whom we meet while shes doing battle with an enormous spiderhumanoid poor jena malone who has kidnapped a child because shes mad about her infertility i kid you not theres also cleopatra coleman and ray fisher as the sibling rebel leaders devra and darrian bloodaxe who sport such elaborate badass looks that it must take them like three hours every morning to do hair and makeup all this recruiting takes us from one planet and outpost to another most of them rendered in murky and unconvincing fashion we feel were more in green screen land than outer space wed be remiss not to mention the main villain in rebel moon the psychopathic and sadistic atticus noble ed skrein who wears a uniform with distinct third reich influences and sports a haircut that indicates he might be a big fan of jim carreys look in dumb and dumber what a drooling creepy evil weirdo  rebel moon ends with the promise or maybe its a threat of a great and final battle to come in april whether we want it or not
Dec 22 2023,negative,for now though its arguable that rebel moon stands as an overloaded space opera that offers too much too late
Dec 21 2023,negative,    warning    i am a scifi fan down to my atoms i read watch listen to and debate it thus this review comes from a place of disappointment as i search for a new scifi classic if youre sensitive to critiques of your faves read no further  i wanted to like it ive been desperately chasing more scifi on screen i want epic adventure from galaxies out there somewhere not to be confused with somewhere out there give me space opera that moves the multitudes however when i left the theater after rebel moon  part one a child of fire i said a little prayer  it went like this jesus take the reel the movie reel or maybe the muses could send us a script doctor to heal this mess  rebel moon part one should be good it has all the component parts a seasoned director a story based on the seven samurai plot engine akira kurosawa 1954 gorgeous production design a charming and really really ridiculously goodlooking cast and several million stacks in budget yet somehow what we end up with is a patchwork of scifi with no real impetus of its own ill explain what i mean the story starts on the planet arrakis i mean tatooine okay a world that looks like a desert but is abundantly fertile despite its redparched earth and rocky terrain im not saying this isnt possible but i am foreshadowing the lack of worldbuilding that would usually give us a clue as to how this land yields abundant crops the first thing i noticedafter the narrator anthony hopkins sets up a galaxy torn apart by war betrayal and a slain kingwas the backdrops they look like literal landscapes painted and theatrical perhaps this is a love note to the golden age of hollywood from director zack snyder but it felt overdone and overly accentuated and i kept staring at them thinking this would have worked nicely on broadway  the first person we meet is kora sofia boutella shes out in the fields alone plowing the land with a horselike creature that has a huge bony plate on its head we can tell shes strong mentally and physically wiry and battleweary we soon learn were in an oldworld scandinavian farming village and the work is hard but the life is good theres also a young blonde woman savanna gann who stands out and later becomes part of the inciting incident that fuels the coming quest what sets everything off is the arrival of a battleship called the kings gaze kora nearly freezes in fear because she knows this ship means destruction its from a planet called the motherworld an imperial collective led by the tyrant regent balisarius fra feethe man kora is running fromand his enforcer admiral noble ed skrein the leader of the village tries to bargain but things go sideways and kora is forced to reveal her military training she is lethal and that is good  however the village has 10 weeks until the kings gaze returns which means kora is going to need an army of mercenaries to fight them off with the help of gunner michiel huismanthe guy who fumbled the bag in the first placekora aims to find the bloodaxes ray fisher cleopatra coleman a sisterbrother duo who leads the rebellion but along the way she picks up a ragtag squad of talented fighters each with a grudge against the motherworld which we find out too late to matter thats where the seven samurai trope comes in much like lone wolf and cub the seven samurai story engine rarely fails but rebel moon  part one finds a way to flop around uselessly like a goldfish transported to arrakis imagine dune but for no reason completely without purpose we meet each character as though snyder is a dealerdungeon master and this is the hand of roleplaying cards weve been dealt kai charlie hunnam the thief nemesis bae doona the sword master tarak staz nair the noble indigenous prince titus djimon hounsou the fallen general and hopkins as jimmy the droideach member of the band gets an intro scene that highlights their special skill and ends with them stating their mantra but why did they say yes to protecting the village whats going on in their lives what are their backstories the movie barely gives you enough thread to string together its relentless stream of massive action set pieces rebel moon plays out like a digital recording of its creators dreams which is mostly a bunch of you know what would be cool moments  for some of you that may not sound bad but i need storytelling worldbuilding and motivation to understand my heroes and to know why i should believe in them if given a choice id rather watch cut scenes from video games they have better more cohesive stories and i know the time i spend watching them will pay off with rebel moon i kept wondering how many levels id have to defeat before i could get the full backstory on a character i still dont know i had a hard time defeating eyerolls at the dialogue and boredom if rebel moon  part one had been made in the 80s i mightve enjoyed it but were way past that now or maybe were not that far away because you could create a quiz podcast out of all the references here seven samurai krull clash of the titans dune star wars pitch black 2 gladiator harry potter john carter and many more seriously this movie seems to rely on our knowledge of all the scifi that came before as though we should be pulling from a hivemind compendium for context what is the magic system shrug is it sciencebased idk who was the war with maybe the narratorandroid said something at some point but ill insert another shrug here  the best parts of this movie are a betrayal you could only miss if you fell asleep but is still clever on the part of the betrayer when a bunch of teeth get knocked out and go flying and the quality of the hair styling and beardgrooming  when asked my thoughts afterward i said a pointless pile of scifi leftovers maybe the fact rebel moon was pitched as a star wars movie but had to be flipped back to the original idea is what makes this movie such a pretty mess im not sure i do know im not mad im disappointed
Dec 21 2023,negative, directed by zack snyder starring sofia boutella djimon hounsou charlie hunnam michiel huisman staz nair doona bae ray fisher cleopatra coleman e duffy anthony hopkins jena malone ed skrein fra fee stuart martin corey stoll cary elwes alfonso herrera rhian rees ingvar e sigursson ray porter charlotte maggi sky yang samantha win josefine lindegaard claire liz phillips stella grace fitzgerald quinn zheng dustin ceithamer dominic burgess meredith vancuyk sisse marie savanna gann danielle burgio kingston foster and christopher matthew cook when a peaceful settlement on the edge of a distant moon finds itself threatened by the armies of a tyrannical ruling force a mysterious stranger living among its villagers becomes their best hope for survival the one positive rebel moon  part one a child of fire part two will be on netflix next april going for it is that even if the scifi journey plays like director zack snyder also cowriting alongside shay hatten and kurt johnstad pulling from a grab bag of clichés and tropes every five minutes he is a visionary filmmaker with a general idea of how to weave in aesthetic elements of his entire filmography to provide a slight distinct flair to the familiarity at times the imagery feels like star wars colliding with greek mythology all with the expected unnecessary nonstop slow motion during action sequences that typically dont add much aside from a rare moment where it allows for the filmmaker to home in on some facial emotions presumably by accident the real frustration comes from not just how derivative the narrative is but the uninteresting simultaneously boring but rushed execution that feels like watching someone play a series of video game miniside quests rather than a fullon story of building a rebellion team where each member comes across as a fully fleshed out character with motives to understand and emotion to get involved in each recruitment sequence is shorter and sloppier than the last and somehow more random as if zack snyder is trying to shove any scifi staple he can think of into the movie aliens robots humanoid spiders lightsabers spaceship battles bounty hunters without any consideration as to why it should be there or if its serving an entertaining or stimulating purpose one minute youre watching a character bond with mystical animals which feels blatantly plagiarized from avatar and then a south korean swordswoman is taking down a childmurdering spider creature as for the main plot it is centered on kora sofia boutella a former highranking member of motherworlds military regime the imperium having escaped that life to hide out amongst a small band of villagers selling their harvest sometimes to rebels kora has a tragic past at one point working for the sadistic general that murdered her family and entire homeland rising her way up the ranks to working closely with the king and his young daughter a much kinder person with the potential to bring some peace back to this galaxy one day a dreadnought appears led by admiral atticus noble a shouting ruthless villain played by ed skrein demanding the harvest for the motherworld he tries to cut a onesided deal where kora hiding her true identity with a completely new appearance is aware that these people dont stick to their word and will take whatever they want with force initially kora plots to run away and start anew knowing full well that this land is about to be overtaken this also wouldnt be a zack snyder movie without some form of attempted sexual trauma so kora decides to stay and fight for the villagers once a group of soldiers distractingly looking like they are wearing cheap knockoff halo spartan armor threaten to rape a woman which prompts the first fight sequence brimming with slowmotion and ground sliding while firing guns she then sets out on a journey slapped with uninteresting locations and set pieces to assemble the perfect team to defend the land if anything the periodic flashbacks to koras time serving the motherworld make for a more dramatic thorny story that unfortunately isnt explored much here this is part one so thats also pretty much all the film amounts to in terms of storytelling there is some lategame betrayal one or two revelations that dont generate much interest in the sequel and an inconsequential final action sequence there are small bits of inspired character design and flourishes of excitement but otherwise rebel moon  part one a child of fire is a tedious stroll through anything and everything you have seen before done better in another scifi movie with no emotional hook or any reason to care about whats happening on screen it is bursting with everything and nothing at the same time
Dec 21 2023,negative, kalel help us zack snyder believes in himself whatever one thinks of his dour steroidal opuses  the rockchord operas he pulls from splash panels or his own imagination  the director has the stubborn perseverance of a true artist did he give up on his vision when warner bros essentially wrested justice league away from him no he convinced the studio to release a mea culpa less a directors cut than a costly rebuke to the creative decisions of those who funded it not even the outright cancellation of a project is enough to stop him apparently told that lucasfilm would not on second thought be inviting him to play in its sandbox snyder reached for a shovel anyway as its mouthful of a title reveals rebel moon  part one a child of fire is not technically speaking a star wars story but it was intended to be one snyder originally pitched it as seven samurai with jedis pulling into more explicit focus akira kurosawas influence on the franchise would that be in the patchwork spirit of george lucas or merely redundant either way snyders offbrand realization of the idea defiantly broadcasts its ip origins with every droid stormtrooper and glowing fire sword never referred to as a lightsaber for copyright reasons its a total mockbuster star wars but cheaper and  given the man responsible  grimmer and grayer too at least snyder resists the urge to scroll the opening exposition down the screen opting instead for solemn voiceover narration delivered under an ominous junkie xl score thats a far cry from the triumphant strains of john williams this galaxy far far away is a feudal star system known as the motherworld not to be confused with motherboxes caught in the iron grip of an imperial government after the assassination of the king parsecs from the seat of power sits a quaint lunar colony a land of simple but horny farmers introduced via a striking establishing shot that fills the horizon with the loom of a ringed planet the image recalls both

primitive irony lets just say you could not imagine him played by gregory peck his falsely civil ramping up to murder is vintage christoph waltz one of the more fascinating contradictions of snyders work is the special delight he takes in obliterating fascist bullies while also adopting a style of rather riefenstahlian bombast commanded to prepare nearly its entire seasonal harvest for the empire

guard laying low in the colony after going rogue sets out with her casual farmboy lover michiel huisman to assemble a cavalry of reinforcements building the team is a reliably entertaining aspect of any seven samurai gloss and theres the superficial impression of fun in this episodic stretch even as snyder treats it as a license to cherrypick images and ideas from a library of other blockbusters including avatar mad max fury road dune and even gladiator derivative can be okay the problem with rebel moon is that its a pastiche leeched of joy a star wars depressed by snyders delusions of grandeur theres no range of personalities no spunky innocent of the luke variety or sardonic rogue of the han stock every one of the recruited warriors  an ensemble filled out by the overqualified underutilized likes of doona bae djimon hounsou staz nair ray fisher and more  is a snyderian strong and silent type an archetypal badass even the apparent toshiro mifune figure a mercenary played by charlie hunnam turns out to be less playful than he first appears in rebel moon the characters have much less dimension than the spare elements of worldbuilding like a parasitic puppeteer that shows up during the obligatory cantina pit stop or the spindly robotic capture devices deployed by the bad guys in both a micro and a macro sense rebel moon moves like vinyl slowed by turntable debris it takes an interminable 45 minutes at least even to set boutellas furiosalike fugitive on her way is the agonizingly deliberate pace a way to assure that this story will spill into multiple chapters or is the bifurcation a byproduct of snyders indulgent antiefficiency his apparent inability to do genre at traditional featurelength anymore the man certainly loves to screech action to a crawl at times his famed ultraslowmotion takes on the unmotivated quality of a video setting toggling on and off at random must we see villagers toss rice at the velocity of the flash entering the speed force snyder thinks in tableau perhaps especially since he started serving as his own director of photography like most of his work rebel moon has moments of painterly beauty indebted to the graphic novels he sometimes adapts and the art of 70s rock albums he presumably spins while conceiving his projects the one perfect shot crowd may well drink up some of the heropose sprawlingalienplanet imagery particularly on 70mm snyder gets a lot of mythic mileage out of placing his characters including a melancholy mechanical ronin voiced by anthony hopkins who deserved more screen time against brilliant vistas nearly every shot of the movie could probably function as an enticing netflix thumbnail or a variant cover for the comicbook adaptation but no emotional vibrancy or even variation lurks behind the visual grandiosity of this material rebel moon only comes to life when the heroes are seized by wrath and killing in style when one of them informs another that theres a difference between justice and revenge you have to wonder if snyder knows or cares what that difference is for all that he shaped the last decade of dc movies hes always seemed more like one of the image comics defectors  a firstrate illustrator and secondrate storyteller obsessed with edginess and rippling masculinity like a rob liefeld of the big screen snyder knows how to make characters look cool but maybe not how to imbue them with soul and by splitting his newest epic in half the filmmaker fails to even deliver on the promise of his original pitch the movie just kind of stops instead of ending demanding a few more months of netflix subscription fees before we get to see the presumed defense of the colony the kurosawadoesrogueone payoff rebel moon which comes with the promise of its own future syndercut why not just deliver that from the start is already being billed as the beginning of a new multimedia franchise which seems presumptuous frankly the film is proof that snyder still has the drive to get his vision up on screen disneys authorization be damned but it also suggests that whats really twinkling in his eye is another monument to his own cult of personality a brand new snyderverse built atop the rubble of earlier better science fiction rebel moon  part one a child of fire is now playing in select theaters it begins streaming on netflix on thursday december 21 for more of aa dowds

charlie hunnam djimon hounsou bae doona and ray fisher in a movie not based on preexisting ip called rebel moon rebel moon is a scifi story that stars sofia boutella as a young woman living in a

Dec 21 2023,negative, rebel moon is what happens when someone is handed unlimited money and complete creative freedom without having anyone around them who is willing to tell them no when director zack snyder was presented with a blank check from one of the biggest streamers in the business and creative freedom he released rebel moon a film without an original moment in its body to the point that it would be funny if it didnt take itself so incredibly seriously director zack snyder summary when a peaceful settlement on the edge of a distant moon finds itself threatened by the armies of a tyrannical ruling force a mysterious stranger living among its villagers becomes their best hope for survival snyder lives the life many creatives would cut off a limb for the partnership he appears to have with netflix is the kind that directors spend entire careers hoping they might someday get a fraction of attaining someone is giving you whatever resources you need to make your vision a reality and you dont need to force it into some recognizable ip youre able to explore original worlds and concepts its hard to say how rare it is for someone to be in the position that snyder is currently in regarding not only rebel moon but his army of the dead films as well no one appears to be telling him no or reigning him in he has access to anything so what he has put on screen with rebel moon is everything because thats what it is this film was made under the ideal circumstances for any filmmaker this is why it is painfully ironic that rebel moon  part one a child of fire doesnt have an original bone in its body when presented with the opportunity to do anything snyder decided that copying everyone elses homework in terms of storytelling character beats character arcs and even the look of the world was the way to go there is not a single moment in this film that feels original or fresh this isnt familiar places with a fresh coat of paint this is just the same repurposed tropes with some slow motion and decent cinematography and thats about it you know these stories because you have seen them before you know where all of this is going and snyder has given zero indication that he will be subverting anything in future installments because the tone of this could not be more serious there is not a single moment of levity in this entire film no joy because apparently the only way to be dark is to be joyless all of this is bad enough and would kneecap any film but rebel moon also has to contend with the fact that it is half a movie and all of the challenges that come with that when you are half a movie you are by design working under a handicap because you have to make up for the fact that youre not giving your audience a satisfying ending you have to make up for the fact that most of your film will be set up worldbuilding and exposition you need to excel in everything else to make up for those facts and rebel moon does none of that it expects you to be fine with 85 worldbuilding a long drawnout backstory explanations of flashbacks and gathering of the allies while doing nothing else of interest as previously stated nothing is new here we have seen it all before and now we see it with the added baggage of not even being a completed movie then there is the issue surrounding the directors cut snyder has been nearly bragging that this directors cut will be very different from the first version of the film as if that is somehow a good thing this was not dictated by a studio that took a movie and cut it up so it didnt even resemble the original version see kingdom of heaven this appears to be something that snyder wanted to do the entire time however suppose this movie is everything which it very much seems to be because everything is up on screen and snyder had the opportunity to do everything why is it under those circumstances he still couldnt find a consistent throughline for this film why are we staring down the barrel of four films rebel moon 1 rebel moon 1  directors cut rebel moon 2 rebel moon 2  directors cut why was everyone making this film so unsure about where they wanted it to go that they had to make two versions and somehow think that it was something worth bragging about directors cuts are not a bad thing but when that hour of footage changes things to the point that the director himself is saying its almost like a different movie its almost a different universe that the rrated cut lives in than this movie youre left wondering why no one could come up with a definitive direction for this movie that two were necessary the impressive cast of this film is doing their best with what they are given but its hard to become invested in any of these characters when you can see where they are heading five minutes after meeting them there are several major deaths at the end of the film and a twist that was initially teased as a cliffhanger that you could have called five minutes after meeting the respective people involved its almost impressive how unoriginal all of this is to the point that they somehow got an unoriginalsounding score out of tom holkenborg the best part of the film is the cinematography but snyder has always made pretty prettylooking movies in terms of that so it would be weird to expect anything less from him at this point rebel moon is what happens when someone is handed unlimited money and complete creative freedom without having anyone around them who is willing to tell them no snyder can make good films but in the last decade after the cult of fans began to surround him its clear he has started to believe the hype and do no wrong mentality the only people who think two radically different cuts of the same film is a good idea are the creative way too in love with their own lore and a studio executive who sees it as the opportunity to release a movie twice this is the foundation that snyder and his team are building not only a second film on but a new cinematic universe and much like his version of the dc universe it is a fundamentally broken foundation right out of the gate this weekend we are witnessing the end of the snyder era of the dc universe and how it all fell apart because of that broken foundation while also seeing history repeat itself all over again on netflix unlike justice league there is no time to course correct part two of rebel moon so this is what they have a copy of a copy of every science fiction story and seventh samurai adaptation that we have seen and nothing more
Dec 21 2023,positive, rebel moon begins on the veldt a bucolic paradise where kora sofia boutella has crash landed the community adopts her as she tries to escape her troubled pastbut the fascist motherworld comes knocking when admiral noble ed skrein arrives and demands their harvest to protect her new home from oppression kora must venture into space and assemble a crew to protect the simple farmers and take a stand  writer and director zack snyder made a name for himself for going big rebel moon goes bigger and farther than any other snyder project the film was once pitched as a star wars movie and has many parallels to the original george lucas saga where lucas battled against a shoestring budget and limited special effects snyder had the resources to let his imagination run wild rebel moon doesnt reveal one or two planets we visit a handful of places each vastly different from the previous one each planet and town has diverse populations of humanoid and nonhumanoid creatures one planet being mined for its resources has a halfspider halfwoman decrying the pollution from overindustrialization another planet looks like a dust farm where they are training a bennu space griffin theres also a peaceful robot named jimmy voiced by anthony hopkins that may have turned to animism the biggest flaw in the film is packing in too much we already know there is a part two on the way and the first film feels like a big setup for the next step there isnt enough time to get to know the characters or develop emotional attachments to them as they assemble the team they toss the new characters at you so quickly that you cant appreciate their uniqueness every character along with their outlandish names could be their own main character but why have one person harmed by the motherworld when you can have a whole team of them this is a space opera and snyder gives it the overthetop production a space opera needs with several scenes that subvert tropes in unexpected and hilarious ways snyder took the formula and went in a direction that may not make sense to most its spacewhos to say what makes sense once again snyder proves he is masterful at creating stunning visuals the film is beautiful to look at hes also brilliant at shooting a fight scene they are always exciting and move like a choreographed dance rebel moon puts the snyder spin on a space epic and delivers a wild ride from start to finish its not shakespeare but it sure is fun
Dec 21 2023,negative,rebel moon might look big and splashy even on a tv screen but in terms of working as drama its less a rebel yell than a lowkey rebel grunt
Dec 21 2023,negative,simply registering the title of zack snyders rebel moon  part one a child of fire takes more time than the film deserves
Dec 21 2023,neutral, its hard to know if rebel moonpart one a child of fires issues stem solely from its intentional truncation how much blame can fall on director zack snyder americas sweetheart and the embattled visionary behind the snyder cut among other films too if you can believe it long before rebel moonpart one a child of fire hit theaters prior to its streaming release on netflix it was obvious to those in the know that the film we were going to get was not the real film or it was but edited down by about 50 and then seemingly a little bit more with scenes skipping merrily along from point a to b with no clear path which connects them a twohourand13minute film that feels like five minutes in a bad way characters appear and barely speak djimon hounsou is maybe done the dirtiest in this respect relationships are forged with little foundation and somewhere along the way were all meant to not only care about what we just watched but care enough to watch a second film its difficult to even fault this most pressing issue when the film that you just watched is both obviously a hack job and explicitly intentionally made for the sole purpose of snyder cut 20 the rebel moonpart one directors cut snyders actual intended film will be released allegedly sometime next summer as explained by snyder himself the directors cut which will be rated r is almost like a different moviewell because it probably is a different movie based on what i and everyone else has already watched as of right now rebel moonpart one a child of fire is less a movie and more a collage of barelyconnected scenes according to snyder it was netflixs idea to release the movie in two cuts something he admits he had never experienced before as a director usually compelled to release his own cut after the demand for it presented itself over time he further explains that netflixs reasoning had to do with the scale and cost not being responsible with an r rating which just doesnt make sense at all when the film wasnt produced with a meaningful theatrical release in mind the rating of the film shouldnt actually matter if its just going to streaming at any rate here is what rebel moonpart one a child of fire is about for now in a universe referred to as the motherworld kora sofia boutella lives on the prosperous farming planet of veldt led by corey stoll wearing a fake beard doing a weird european accent and his horny wife on veldt kora moves rocks broods speaks in platitudes and spurns the affections of handsome goodhearted farmer gunnar michiel huisman kora was rescued and brought to live there many years ago after working for and living with the imperium the imperium are a bloodthirsty entity which hops from planet to planet forcing the inhabitants into subjugation and whose armed forces had slaughtered koras own family when she was a child but the imperium finally makes its way to peaceful veldt where atticus noble ed skrein the rulers righthand man carries out a brutal execution and announces his plans to overtake the community after a bloody altercation kora and gunnar break from veldt and the imperiums presence on a mission to one might say assemble a team in order to take on the bad guys its weird while watching rebel moon scenes happen characters are introduced and speak to one another things move along the narrative and visual rhythm are undeniably off but i can understand whats happening and why in the moment nothing feels terribly egregious but when you step back everything suddenly becomes amplified and you see that rebel moon is held together with spit and glitter glue and pipecleaners by the time the credits rolled i realized i dont think id ever watched a movie this long that still felt so brief and bewilderingly abridged where so much happened and yet nothing happened at all  individually scenes are often enjoyable enough like the star wars cantina ripoff scene or the harry potter hippogriff ripoff scene or the jena malone spider humanoid scenethe latter of which might be the best in the whole film malone plays harmada a grotesque arthropod monster whose home in a mining village was colonized to the extent that she now struggles to bear children like harmada there are other moments of unpleasant body horror a patron at the not cantina who relays info to kora and gunnar is a netherworldly creature with tentacles affixed to a mans body using him like a puppet to speak but as to be expected in a pg13 movie meant for an r rating its all missing something more its annoying to know that were going to get it and that its been withheld from us for nonsensical reasons theres a story here but all we have right now is a corkboard covered in photos tacked on with pins and connected by a series of strings and yet is the story that snyder gave us going to be any better with nearly two more hours appended rebel moonwhich the director began cooking up when he was a childwas explicitly intended as a star wars project before his pitch to lucasfilm went bust and snyder was forced to go back to the drawing boardand it feels it like george lucas snyder took inspiration from akira kurosawa theres a chosen orphaned warrior destined to save the galaxy a snarky pilot they need to help them a fascist movement seeking galactic domination what does the imperium sound similar to  yet its all missing the juice of the star wars universenot terribly surprising even as a parttime snyder apologist myself acting as his own cinematographer as he did for army of the dead snyders scenery is as dour and neutraltoned as ever alternating between gorgeous setpieces like the harmada sequence and a truly overbearing lack of imagination or visual flair for a movie thats billed as a space opera the action and violence snyders notorious wheelhouse are full of his usual trademarks but boring to look at and poorly paced and on top of the iffy visuals and even iffier story every character seems woefully miscast aside from skreins cosmic hitler youth boutella excels in fight scenes and she can be an incisive presence but she doesnt have the charm to be what is essentially a female luke skywalker her lines fall flat spoken like she wants to will gravity into them in her defense they were written flatly and who the hell gave her that fuckass bob in space towards the end of rebel moonpart one a child of fire after the epic battle has been fought and won hounsous character delivers the perfect victory monologue and says that their situation feels like its the beginning of something he might as well have turned to the camera and said stay tuned for rebel moonpart 2 the scargiver streaming on april 19 i admire zack snyder partly because hes a difficult guy to dislike and primarily because hes ambitious confident and singular in his artistic vision even when it doesnt always work for me and for many many other people im a huge fan of watchmen i really enjoy army of the dead and 300 and all his dceu installments make me want to kill myself but his nick cave needledrops in zack snyders justice league are legendary artists are more interesting when theyre divisive and some might say snyders career has become defined by that word whether or not the extended version of rebel moon is much of an improvement on the initial version ill always be eager to see what kind of division snyders cooked up nextits just disappointing to see his work cheapened by netflix meddling its clear that the savvy geniuses over at netflix incorporated were eager to cash in on the frenzy of the snyder cut phenomenon by manufacturing their own in snyders epic space opera of course as other studios will likely realize once they try to artificially replicate the success of barbenehimerwhich we all know they absolutely willcorporations cannot replicate the organic fan momentum of grassroots social media movements like barbenheimer or release the snyder cut no matter how toxic the latter has proven to be theres no zealous demand for release the snyder cut rebel moonpart one a child of fire and not just because the title is far too many words we all know that its already coming its cheap its being handed to us willingly it wasnt won after a hardfought battle it wasnt made by the people for the peopleit was made by ted sarandos and who the hell wants that brianna zigler is an entertainment writer based in middleofnowhere massachusetts her work has appeared at little white lies film school rejects thrillist bright walldark room and more and she writes a bimonthly newsletter called thats

Dec 21 2023,negative, once a discarded pitch for a star war now even before its released an alreadytruncated first half of an eventuallysixhour technofantasy epic zack snyders rebel moon  part one child of fire offers its creator a massive canvas almost unlimited resources and promises the primary influence of no less than kurosawas seven samurai and yet its the worstcase scenario of that potential a hopelessly derivative technically awkward clumsily expository half of a movie so apparently there was a fascist galactic empire that lasted for thousands of years razing and pillaging world after world and subjugating their peoples but then one day some even worse fascists staged a coup took over and blamed the whole thing on insurgents who had already been fighting the first set of marginally nicer fascists now those bad guys  the motherworld  have come to the peaceful farming world of veldt like the bandits in seven samurai to steal the grain from this one village and so it falls to kora sofia boutella to seek out warriors from around the galaxy to help the farmers make a stand against the evil admiral noble ed skrein and his troops what follows is scene after scene of endless plot and character exposition as our heroine and her cadre of cohorts hop from planet to planet gathering help theres rogueish kai charlie hunnam slave tarak staz nair miserable swordswoman nemesis bae doona and so on and so forth its at roughly the halfway point that viewers will start to wonder if djimon honsou is going to show up as a grizzled warrior dont worry he does each one of these players is granted a lengthy showcase scene like taming a wild giant bird or fighting a deadly spiderlady with what were at some point in this films life probably lightsabers between character introductions kora gives one speech after another delineating her backstory at one point she even says im telling you this so you know who i am which its tough to imagine isnt an intentional joke sadly it isnt throughout all of this explication of character snyder insists on the idea that theyre all escaping from some central trauma  something he clearly believes in full is the ultimate project here  but its all treated with such blunt obviousness that you can guess the stories before theyre even told one longs for a story that allows its archetypes to tell their stories through action  being who they are rather than explaining it the worlds these characters inhabit are also woefully underimagined over here is a familiar desert world over there is another dank evil empire spaceship populated by bad guys with vaguely british accents and then theres yet another industrial dystopia one world is even just a greenscreened backdrop of blue clouds there is admittedly some cool creature design  the aforementioned spiderlady played by jena malone a squidfaced regent a little bug parasite that sucks its victims brains out while it puppeteers them  but most of our lead characters are blandly human its enough to wonder why the swordwielding badass couldnt at least have four arms or something at least all this plot is welcomely broken up by snyders action punctuated by his trademark speedramped tableaux theres a remarkable clarity to it as always and hes working as his own dp here  as he did in the equally misbegotten army of the dead but here with much less handheld  and he offers his cast the chance to finally shut their mouths and get to work doing what they were hired for to look awesome posing its clear that the violence and therefore the cutting has been defanged to get a lighter rating but theres still a frankness to the bloodshed that is too often missing from stuff like this that said its unclear that another hour of story will be worth slogging through to get some extra action rebel moon is clearly full of enthusiasm and fueled by earnestness but snyder is totally lost in the weeds especially regarding the needless promise of so so much more of what already doesnt work here for all his sincerity hes poured his heart into something thats just air meat director zack snyder  cast sofia boutella djimon hounsou ray fisher bae doona ed skrein  distributor netflix  in theaters december 15  streaming december 21  runtime 2 hr 15 min
Dec 21 2023,neutral, his newest project a collaboration with the streaming service netflix had been germinating in his brain for a decade before he was able to film it  rebel moon  part one a child of fire had a limited theatrical release last week before making its way to netflix just in time for the holiday weekend years after the king cary elwes the princess bride and his niece princess issa charlotte maggi summer love were murdered the motherworld is ruled by a dictator balisarius far fee hawkeye who has created a seemingly unstoppable empire  meanwhile living a peaceful life as a farmer on a planet called veldt is kora sofia boutella atomic blonde a former highranking imperium soldier who looks to bring together an army of rebels to fight balisarius henchmen when they threaten the people of veldt rebel moon  part one a child of fire is unquestionably snyder with his slowmotion sequences and actiondriven plot  he also draws out some scenes to the point of ad nauseam but one cant expect anything less from a director who made a fourhour film for warner bros  however within the 133minute runtime there are some excellent scenes while there are also some that miss the mark  for example when balisarius interrogates admiral atticus noble ed skrein deadpool after he loses a battle to kora and the rebels the dialogue could have been truncated to the same outcome boutella is no stranger to stunt fighting having portrayed strong yet villainous women in previous roles  she adds a layer to her strong performance by not only showing off her action skills but by also offering a sense of humanity and heart to a hardened and fierce warrior  she is matched in her intensity by skrein and the two offer one of the better battle scenes in the film  charlie hunnam sons of anarchy michiel huisman game of thrones and djimon hounsou guardians of the galaxy all do a fine job providing emotional moments for boutella to feed off of the rest of the cast is hit or miss with some fine performances intertwined with mediocre ones where snyder is really at fault is in the pacing of rebel moon  while it should be a cohesive story it instead reads like a television show with each subplot having a clear beginning and ending in which to interlace some commercials  it makes for a choppy feeling overall that takes the viewer in and out of scenes which is very distracting the cgi is also awful looking amateurish and as if it were produced on older equipment conversely the fight scenes are impressive and wellchoreographed  for example when nemesis bae doona cloud atlas fights the spider creature their entanglements seem like tango as they dance around the room there are also some interesting weapons including nemesis swords that can be set on fire to increase the damage they can inflict on an enemy rebel moon drawing inspiration from anime and star wars was initially pitched as a star wars film in the 2010s to disney however its disjointed plot segments hinder smooth scene transitions falling short of its influences  unfortunately rebel moon  part one a child of fire isnt going to translate into a triumphant return to film for snyder and doesnt remotely resemble his earlier creations like the 300 and man of steel hopefully either the rrated director of cut or rebel moon  part two the scargiver will clarify the story more for more information about rebel moon  part one a child of fire visit the flickdirect movie database                  for more reviews by allison rose please click here allison rose a senior correspondent and critic at flickdirect is a dynamic presence in the entertainment industry with a communications degree from hofstra university she brings her film expertise to krms newstalk 975 fm and broadcast television and is recognized as a tomatometerapproved critic her role as an adept event moderator in various entertainment industry forums underscores her versatility her affiliations with sefca the florida film critics circle and the online film critics society highlight her as an influential figure in film criticism and media
Dec 21 2023,negative, oddly for a movie thats rated pg13 and often plays like a youngadult fantasy zack snyders rebel moon  part one a child of fire features at least two attempted sexual assaults and a queasily erotic encounter between a shirtless man and a manytentacled alien the films most thorough violation though is of its cinematic bloodline to call rebel moon a star wars pastiche  with a dash of dune a lick of lord of the rings and a whole heap of seven samurai is both glaringly accurate and somewhat redundant in todays fantasyverse derivativeness is virtually a given snyder has long been open about his influences and has been imagining this crossbreeding of mythologies since he was in college somewhere in a distant galaxy you know how far away floats a peaceful planet called veldt where burlapclad villagers till the soil and mind their own business a fascistic empire known as the motherworld has other ideas sending its representative admiral atticus noble a sceneryscarfing ed skrein to demand grain for its army brazenly channeling ralph fiennes character from schindlers list 1993 atticus sports bowlcut bangs an ssstyle uniform and a really big stick so after he promises to return and slaughter the villagers if grain is not forthcoming finding a savior is on top of everyones todo list enter kora sofia boutella a mysterious outsider with a secret past an ultraflexible spine and an expression that splits the difference between tickedoff and smoldering kora has her own reasons to seek revenge on the motherworld accordingly accompanied by the gentle gunnar michiel huisman a confrontationaverse villager who looks at kora the way your dog eyes your dinner plate she embarks on a planethopping quest to round up fellow rebels essentially a gettingthegangtogether movie rebel moon  part one the conclusion one hopes follows next april allows each insurgent a showy set piece and a line or two of grudgefilled back story among these is charlie hunnam as the rascally kai a han solo standin and the sole cast member with a jot of personality bae doona as a master swordswoman with lightsaber forearms and staz nair as a hunky creature whisperer the movies most fun and flawless performance though comes from jena malone as a monstrous spiderwoman who kidnaps small children her design cribs shamelessly from a doctor who character but malone gives her an alice krigeastheborg queen energy thats creepily effective thank you for your patience while we verify access if you are in reader mode please exit and log into your times account or subscribe for all of the times
Dec 21 2023,positive, zack snyders rebel moon is a cornball space adventure thats like star wars lord of the rings guardians of the galaxy and a few dozen other signposts  a little bit of star trek a dash of pirates of the caribbean a hint of starship troopers  all rolled into one to its credit it borrows from a solid slate of sources and while its highly derivative its also highly watchable its referential nature helps it clip along at an expedient pace and while it never feels like youre watching something new it at least feels like youre watching something familiar rebel moon is like coming home in the movie  its full cumbersome title is rebel moon  part one a child of fire and yes a pt ii is due out in april  a peaceful group of farmers on a far off moon known as veldt is raided by an evil group of space nazis known as the motherworld its commander atticus noble ed skrein appropriately dastardly like if inglourious basterds col hans landa was played by cillian murphy wants the planets crops and puts everyone on notice hell be back in 10 weeks and he expects a full bounty clock is ticking kora sofia boutella an exmotherworld soldier leads a resistance against the tyranny and along with gunnar michiel huisman a veldt farmer she cruises around the galaxy to gather up a team to take a stand against the bad guys this is where rebel moon picks up steam as the pair visits planets with names like daggus and moon of pollux the latter of which sounds like an 80s goth band in side missions that feel like tiny episodes inside the larger whole it moves so quickly that at one point snyder stages an elaborate fight between a swordsmith doona bae and a spiderlady jena malone whom weve barely even met wait who are these two again but the point is rebel moon moves and its stakes are always clear charlie hunnam plays a mercenary who joins the squad same with staz nair who plays an imprisoned blacksmith who tames a giant beastly blackbird creature in the films most purely entertaining sequence djimon hounsou plays a warrior the crew picks up along the way while sir anthony hopkins voices a c3po like robot who stays back on veldt while the gang visits different planets he probably should have tagged along on the journey they could have used his banter snyder shoots in heroic low angles pulling from his own 300 playbook while also either nodding to or ribbing jj abrams  its unclear which  by employing an overabundance of lens flares we know where rebel moon is headed and there arent many surprises along the way but its never dull and this dubstep space opera knows when to drop the beat
Dec 21 2023,negative, its not zack snyders originali use that term sarcasticallyrebel moon part one a child of fire is too long and leaves the story with no real closure or ending which you should always keep in mind for the audience the script offers minimal character in terms of development despite endless exposition minutes going nowhere for all its epic scope and worldbuilding rebel moon is a vain and hollow attempt at a love child throupling of grandeur adventure films such as star wars the matrix and the indiana jones franchise that tests your patience immediately after the first act not to mention abandoning an exciting theme of artificial intelligence rebel moon  part one a child of fires story follows kora sofia boutella a beautiful farmhand with a secret kora lives peacefully on the independent planet of veidt with her inner circle a father figure in hagen a white days ingvar sigurdsson and love interest gunnar michiel huisman the communitys expert agriculturalist well koras past is about to catch up to her on the day of the harvest on veidt a planet with rich soil the notorious imperium forces visit led by the evil atticus noble midways ed skrein they take over the earth forcing the residents to work and giving them their only food supply which means they will starve kora is about to leave when the new soldiers attack a young girl and she decides to take matters into her own hands in a way you may wonder if zack snyders rebel moon is some cinematic version of the milgram experiment or in a more entertaining vein communitys the duncan principle pondering how much painstaking neoncolored boredom one can take the first act has some juice with boutella developing an exciting action character that matches snyders faststart slowstop fight scenes then the second act begins most of the mystery dissolves and endless exposition becomes the name of the game for the last 90 minutes your standard clichés spend an hour recruiting characters to bring back to veidt but the scenes are overly long each character is explored in a backstory thats grating these are usually scenes done in a quick montage within a few minutes from djimon hounsous general titus staz nairs fabiolight animal whispering tarak and doona baes annoyingly empathetic cyborg swordmaster nemesis these are all cardboard cutout action film characters youve seen before and when rebel moon finds something interesting kais charlie hunnam character is a storytelling trope with no reason to exist other than to move the plot to a more conspicuous location when snyder shay hatten army of the dead and kurt johnstads 300 atomic blonde script des find a character to spark an emotional impact we meet them so briefly that the big scene the film builds towards isnt entirely earned and the audience feels cheated rebel moon  part one a child of fire is not worth watching in theaters or streaming until we find out where the companion part is headed that leads us to the most interesting character a robot named jimmy voiced by anthony hopkins who explores the theory of autonomous robots however we dont see the character again until a brief shot at the end this is the most exciting theme in the filmyour only hope is if this is explored more in rebel moon  part two the scargiver almost everything else is an exercise of sciencefiction banality in the meantime youll be stuck with the same indiana joness oppressive totalitarian characters the matrixs existentialism regarding reality vs illusion and star wars rebellion recycled thousands of times in our lifetime the second part of mr snyders vision may relieve some criticisms however the likelihood of anyone having the stamina to stomach the second film after this mess is a gamble you shouldnt net the house on mn miller is a film and television critic and a proud member of the las vegas film critic society critics choice association and a  rotten tomatoestomato meter approved he holds a bachelors degree from mansfield university and a masters from chamberlain university however he still puts on his pants one leg at a time and thats when he usually stumbles over when not writing about film or television he patiently waits for the next pearl jam album and chooses to pass the time by scratching his wifes back on sunday afternoons while she watches endless reruns of california dreams mn miller was proclaimed the smartest reviewer alive by actor jason isaacs but chose to ignore his obvious sarcasm you can also find his work on hidden remote insession film ready steady cut geek vibes nation and nerd alert
Dec 21 2023,positive, rebel moon opens in an agrarian colony on veldt a moon orbiting a ringed planet much like saturn when the colony is invaded by soldiers from the imperium its up to the orphaned kora sofia boutella to recruit fighters to help the villagers the problem is the rebels are scattered all over the galaxy before kora departs she takes out a dozen or so enemies armed only with a hatchet  the first of many wellexecuted battles spread throughout the movie on a desert planet kora finds tarak staz nair a warrior who can communicate with the animal world next on a dying world polluted by mining nemesis bae doona displays expert sword skills titus djimon hounsou a disgraced regent general joins the team from a gladiator planet meanwhile the rebels are pursued by admiral atticus noble ed skrein a ruthless killer who commands the kings gaze spaceship no one is safe from his men not even the mercenaries trying to betray the rebels if it seems like youve seen this before you probably have the director has cited the dirty dozen and the lord of the rings among his inspirations its easy to pick out nods to other bigbudget blockbusters as well rebel moon is as easy to read as a billboard and about as deep once it gets going the movie sprints at a furious pace stopping only to indulge in too many slowmotion leaps kicks and punches because not everything in rebel moon makes sense baes nemesis is fascinating and her battle scene deep in the bowels of a cobalt mine is a highlight of the movie but her powers are confusing and like the other rebels she doesnt get much chance to explain herself snyder who also shot rebel moon and cowrote its script has huge ambitions for the project the second part arrives in april and an animated series and rpg computer game have been announced thats to say nothing of extended rrated cuts of parts one and two will fatigue set in first
Dec 21 2023,negative, the allusionism is strong with this one zack snyders latest visual extravaganza the loftily titled netflix production rebel moon  part 1 a child of fire draws more than a modicum of influence from akira kurosawas samurai cinema and george lucas galactic franchise of course lucas already appropriated bushido honor and aspects of japanese culture along with story elements from kurosawas the hidden fortress 1958 to develop the original star wars 1977 snyders movie merely draws out the connection further with an amalgam of both filmmakers offering a hodgepodge of ideas from better movies repurposed here to lackluster effect aside from a few neat aliens and a rousing laser gun battle or two theres not much in these familiar proceedings to maintain the viewers interest the movie plays less like an affectionate homage and more like a lifeless and derivative composite underserviced by snyders interest in cool images over compelling characters armed with a talented cast and occasionally impressive visuals rebel moon neither transcends nor pays adequate respect to its influences making for a flagrant and pedestrian imitation of better material  the story is an unmistakable copycat of seven samurai 1954 that kurosawas alltime classic goes uncredited is troubling if not grounds for a lawsuit after all italian filmmaker sergio leone was sued when he remade kurosawas yojimbo 1962 into the spaghetti western a fistful of dollars 1964 without permission and while john sturges credited kurosawas sprawling and human epic in his remake the magnificent seven 1960 pixar also borrowed the story structure for a bugs life 1998 without an official acknowledgment to that end at least snyder who conceived the story and cowrote the screenplay with kurt johnstad and shay hatten has some precedent for not giving kurosawas film an inspired by reference here despite his story following that films first half almost beat by beat lucas has less of a case against snyder who merely borrows the intangible flavor of star wars for his worldbuilding detailsscifi movies have been doing that for years still one wonders if rebel moon  part 2 the scargiver set for release in april 2024 will continue with kurosawas story structure probably so given that part 1 has so few original ideas  accented with overblown choral music the story takes place in a galaxy ruled by an imperialist motherworld whose assassinated king cary elwes was replaced by a brutal ruler regent balisarius fra fee determined to quash any dissenters balisarius orders atticus noble ed skrein to hunt down rebels landing on the habitable moon called veidt home to a vaguely icelandic community of peaceful farmers who have just completed their annual harvest orgy to appease their gods noble orders the locals to hand over the bulk of their next reaping in ten weeks to feed his army kora sofia boutella a farmer and former warrior with a mysterious past connected to the motherworld refuses to comply and sets out with her villages harvest manager gunnar michiel huisman to find others who will fight the imperial forces on their behalf instead of visiting a local village as in seven samurai kora and gunnar enlist the help of a rogue bounty hunter kai charlie hunnam to help them travel to nearby planets and convince proven fighters to help their cause  while kora and gunnar profoundly uninteresting characters search for help snyder introduces us to a familiar band of renegades and freedom fighters each drawn from tropes in kurosawas work a master of swordplay nemesis doona bae a former general on a gladiatorial world who wants to forget that he surrendered djimon hounsou tarak staz nair a perpetually shirtless warrior who can bond with animals and darrian bloodaxe ray fisher an insurgent leader who commands the rebellion most of these personalities are so thin that the plot mechanics not the characters and their choices drive the story like seven samurai the movie finds them outnumbered and clashing with their enemies building to what will probably be a much larger showdown in the sequel but unlike kurosawas masterpiece snyder isnt interested in giving the farmers much gradation his treatment is rather like star wars in that respect where good and evil are polarized snyders grasp of the dimensions in kurosawas film is about as tenuous as the remakes by sturges or antoine fuqua in 2016 though the plot follows kurosawa most of rebel moons presentation resembles a star wars movie snyder originally developed the idea for lucas universe and his cinematic sampling is unsubtle from alienfilled cantinas to bad guys imbued with nazi characteristics even the sound effects recall ben burtts beeps bloops and pewpews from star wars among snyders innovationsnay odditiesis the selfaware droid named jimmy voiced by anthony hopkins who has a few small scenes early on and for whom snyder has big things planned apparently given its obscurely and unexplained horned appearance in the finale on the plus side jena malones appearance as a spidery humanoid makes for a creepy inspired sequence though it leads to snyder revealing nemesis veritable lightsabers another dull reference but the allusions to better movies dont limit themselves to kurosawa and lucas a sequence straight out of harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban 2004 finds a character bowing to a creature that looks suspiciously like a hippogriff  as ever the directors capacity for grandioselooking cinema remains impressive serving as director of photography snyder is a compelling visualist creating iconic images the ambitions of which often outweigh the capabilities of his reported 160 millionplus budget the result occasionally has the look and feel of lucas prequel trilogy with flat backdrops and a deadened digital sheen nevertheless this is unmistakably a snyder production complete with his signature use of slow motion to create a sense of awed suspension during action scenes but even that is a kurosawa technique to be sure kurosawa employed a similar tactic in seven samurai where he edited slowmotion sequences into otherwise fastpaced action creating a dramatic juxtaposition of film speeds thats been one of snyders tricks since his earliest work and its used here on dramatically falling seeds and a spearwielding soldier leaping into the airimages that recall snyders own dawn of the dead 2004 and 300 2007 if this all sounds like im dwelling too much on snyders inspirations know that if rebel moon featured better storytelling perhaps i wouldnt only see or care about its pilfering for instance lucas wasnt exactly reinventing the wheel when he made star wars he pieced together aspects of flash gordon serials and japanese samurai cinema to create something familiar but new but lucas distinct characters the actors who played them and the worldbuilding were so inspired that the antecedents hardly registered he transcended his influences which is the mark of compelling art snyders efforts have too few new ideas to distinguish rebel moon from its iconic antecedents making it feel more like a pastiche than an inspired piece of filmmaking that uses its sources as a launchpad even as a melange of better material the pg13rated rebel moon fails to impress making the prospect of his promised rrated extended cut far less intriguing than his alternate take on justice league 2021 rather the upcoming extended version feels like a netflix gimmick designed to replicate the faux hullabaloo around the whole releasethesnydercut campaign which as marketing goes proves as hollow as the movie its attempting to promote 
Dec 20 2023,negative,the bulk of the narrative feels like the middle of a story stretched out over two hours with the ending lopped off
