"Jul 24, 2023",neutral," Synopsis: Journalist Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy) is trying to take down Carlton Drake (Riz Ahmed), the notorious and brilliant founder of the Life Foundation. While investigating one of Drake's experiments, Eddie's body merges with the alien Venom - leaving him with superhuman strength and power. Twisted, dark and fueled by rage, Venom tries to control the new and dangerous abilities that Eddie finds so intoxicating. Unfortunately, in today's world, a film isn't good or bad because it's truly good or bad. There must be an excuse for each of these cases, especially if we're discussing a big franchise-related flick. Being Venom a superhero movie, obviously, there's no ""middle ground"". Either you love it or hate it. Usually, if you think it's just ""okay,"" you're the anomaly. This time that didn't bother me as much as the next thing... Since every fanboy must defend their favorite studio, the reasons for Venom's poor reviews were apparently due to Lady Gaga fans blindly trashing this film since A Star Is Born also premieres this week. It's not even a DC x Marvel dispute! Fans' reluctance in accepting that a movie from their favorite cinematic universe can be disappointing reaches unbelievable levels. Even more when it is, in fact, a complete boredom of a story, with a generic plot, paper-thin characters who only serve as plot devices, and extremely terrible editing (Maryann Brandon, Alan Baumgarten). There is some good stuff to write about, so I'll start with the absolute standout: Tom Hardy (Dunkirk). When you have such a remarkable actor saying ""they cut off my favorite scenes"", you can't possibly have high expectations for the respective film. Hardy fantastically incorporates the character of Eddie Brock, delivering tons of scenes where the actor simply shines. His versatile ability to interpret such an expressive character makes Hardy himself the best thing about Venom. The interactions between Eddie and the symbiote are the most fascinating aspect of the movie. From the funny banter to the unusual method of character development, their relationship is, by far, the strongest in the entire film, which ends up becoming a negative point as well.  Unfortunately, the screenplay written by Jeff Pinkner (The Dark Tower), Scott Rosenberg (Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle), and Kelly Marcel (Fifty Shades of Grey) is packed with numerous useless subplots and secondary characters who don't add anything to the main narrative or the protagonist's arc. The first half of the movie has no Venom whatsoever, which wouldn't be an issue if the story and characters were compelling. While Eddie has indeed an engaging personality, literally every other character in the film is either a cliche stereotype or an on-the-nose plot device.  Michelle Williams (The Greatest Showman) blandly portrays Eddie's lover Anne, someone I don't even have words to describe based on her development. Riz Ahmed (Rogue One), an actor I adore, tries his best as Carlton Drake, a forgettable villain who holds the generic villain hunger for power. Finally, there are a bunch of scientists who only serve as exposition devices to explicitly explain to the audience everything that's happening. Dealing with these characters becomes astonishingly dull and tiresome. Most of the comedic scenes don't really work without Venom's voice to provide a different take on them, so Hardy finds himself carrying the whole thing by himself. However, the worst aspect of the movie is undoubtedly the editing. It doesn't matter if it's an action scene or a simple dialogue in a diner, the editing is a total mess. Exceptionally frustrating, to be honest. Ruben Fleischer (Zombieland) is a talented filmmaker, but I can't defend cutting a simple dialogue on every single line while weirdly switching the positions of each actor. Despite a couple of riveting action sequences, the vast majority is filled with quick cuts and blurred camera movement due to an abusive employment of shaky-cam (Matthew Libatique). The final battle is extraordinarily underwhelming since it's impossible to understand most of what's happening. When an occasional fight between Venom and some random bad guys is better than the supposed climax of the film, you know something's not right. The PG-13 rating clearly affected the movie. Some scenes were cut because there was no way of toning them down, and the lack of blood or heavy language is definitely a setback. The score is actually pretty great (Ludwig Göransson), and it helps revitalize some slow moments. Tonally, the film is well-balanced overall, even if Fleischer irregularly loses control here and there. I don't consider it one of the worst movies of the year, but I won't ever feel the need for a rewatch unless a sequel is made. Venom is yet another missed opportunity to deliver a great movie about the symbiote anti-hero. This time, the character of Eddie Brock is beautifully handled, with Tom Hardy offering an impressive performance. The actor carries the entire film, which finds its entertainment peak in the interactions between Eddie and Venom. Unfortunately, the movie is drastically brought down by a generic narrative with an incredibly dull first half, an unnecessary focus on uninteresting subplots, and a disappointing amount of paper-thin characters. The shockingly terrible editing basically ruins any sort of excitement that could be found during the action sequences. The production issues condemned this film to be a letdown. Let's just hope the next one isn't worse."

"Nov 16, 2022",negative,"Ironically, the film lacks a bit of bite... "
"Aug 21, 2022",neutral," “Venom” had two encouraging things going for it since its initial announcement. First it stars Tom Hardy, an actor I’ve really liked since his 2001 debut in Ridley Scott’s “Black Hawk Down”. Second, it features a truly great Marvel comic book villain (and eventual antihero) with a compelling backstory and formidable superpowers. Those are two big steps in the right direction. Does Sony Pictures make the most of Hardy and the titular title character? It seems critics would say no as most have panned the film. Moviegoers seem to have had a different reaction, not being nearly as harsh and having helped the film rake in $205 million globally on its opening weekend. Let’s say I fall somewhere in the middle. Versions of “Venom” have been in the works since 1997, but this particular iteration had its own set of challenges. Fans of the character will immediately notice how far the movie strays from his comic book origins. The filmmakers aren’t entirely to blame. Sony’s deal with Marvel Studios to allow Spider-Man into their carefully guarded MCU handcuffed the writers forcing them to create a webslinger-free origin. Interestingly they did shelf the idea of an R-rating leaving the door open for a potential crossover. Hardy plays Eddie Brock, a Bay Area investigative reporter with a knack for uncovering deep-seated corruption. He sets his sights on the Life Foundation and its CEO Carlton Drake (Riz Ahmed). Turns out Drake has discovered and captured samples of splotchy alien lifeforms he calls symbiotes. Eddie gets a whiff of potential human testing and confronts Drake during an on-air interview. It goes bad for Eddie who loses his job and even his fiancé (Michelle Williams) who works as a Life Foundation attorney. Six months pass and a down-on-his-luck Eddie is contacted by a Life Foundation scientist begging him to blow the lid off Drake’s experiments. While secretly infiltrating the labs Eddie is exposed to the symbiote which instantly gives him superpowers and a gruesome appetite for violence and human heads. Check that, it isn’t Eddie who has those appetites. They belong to his new parasitic alter-ego Venom. From there the movie becomes a weird blend of horror and humor set within the framework of a superhero movie. I kind of like what it’s going for even if its tone can be wildly uneven. Eddie’s back-and-forths with the menacing Venom voice in his head can be amusing. There is also the intriguing duality of two distinct characters warring within one man. The film flirts with the idea more than exploring it which seems like a missed opportunity. This is also where the action amps up but not in a particularly thrilling or impressive way. Most of it is encapsulated in the trailer – a big chase sequence in downtown San Francisco and several fight scenes featuring a reluctant Eddie and the more violent Venom’s stretchy tentacles. It all culminates in a CGI-soaked finale that doesn’t do the movie any favors. Tom Hardy does his best to bring energy and nuance to his character. It’s a good performance with several interesting layers. Director Ruben Fleischer clearly wanted to make an atypical superhero movie with a distinct edge to it. I applaud that aim and see glimpses of what he’s going for. But ultimately it’s the script and some pretty uninspired action that left me feeling a bit deflated. Sadly a good Tom Hardy, Fleisher’s edgy ambition, or even a killer end credits scene can’t quite keep “Venom” from disappointing. Ahmed really is getting some great roles. I loved him in Nightcrawler. Films in production for such a long time do tend to get negative reviews. AhmedIs a really good actor but did you feel he was a bit shortchanged here? That is the thought that kept ringing in my head for the entire movie. As for the movie, I really felt going in that the changes that have been made over the years sounded like good ones. And I truly believe there are ingredients here for a much better movie. I feel the same. I’ll eventually get my thoughts up. Kinda excited for the 2nd, but they may really be handcuffing themselves with a refusal to consider a R rating. You may be right, but I don’t really think an R-rating is essential. This one felt darker and edgier to me. I felt it really came down to the script and some pretty mediocre special effects. True that. Maybe an R isn’t needed, and I’m far from one of those ratings hounds. But, Im intrigued to see how they do the sequel with one of the more violent characters in Marvel’s lore.  If it wasn’t for Tom Hardy’s performance and the character of Venom, the film would have been just another generic origin story with a generic villain.  We’ve had way too many of those.  The problem here is Sony.  They’ve never been able to really get their Marvel movies right in any fashion.  Even Sam Raimi’s Spider-Man movies weren’t that great.  The only reason Spider-Man Homecoming was any good, was because Marvel had a direct hand in it, more so than Sony.  I did enjoy Venom, but it feels like there was a lot of stuff cut out, that needed to be in there, so I’m hoping for an extended cut on Blu-Ray. It’s funny, I was t nearly as high on “Homecoming” as most were. Don’t remember the exact score I gave it but there were several things about it that pushed me away. I will say that I liked Raimi’s “Spider-Man” and loved “Spider-Man 2”. The third movie though..ugh. I love Tom Hardy but I think I’ll wait for it on TV.  I just hope it’s not as bad as… The Amazing Spider-Man 2. I don’t think it’s a bad movie.  It’s just not the movie it could have been.  It’s definitely worth watching at least.  If you can catch it on 5 Dollar Tuesday at your local theater, then do so, but don’t expect anything revolutionary. It’s not terrible. You’re right. For me it’s a case of a movie trying new things but falling short in some pretty key areas. I felt it ended up being a very okay movie. Good move. Just wait for it on DVD. It’s definitely not as bad as “Amazing 2”. In fact I almost gave this 3 stars. Just too many disappointing elements though. It does get credit for trying new things. “Amazing 2” was just plain bad! Which is why I’m curious if there’s going to be an extended cut of the movie for home video.  I want to see what was cut out, and see if it would’ve improved anything.  It might not, but it would still be interesting to see.  For me, Venom wasn’t the disaster that The Predator was. Great review Keith! I went into this one expecting the worst so I was quite pleasantly surprised. It definitely has it’s faults but all in all I’m quite looking forward to a sequel. Thanks. I felt it was better than the drumming it took by critics. Still I felt it left so much potential on the table. I do think there is enough there for a good sequel. I’d sure watch it. I was disappointed here the best thing about this move was the after credits scene. Hardy was great but your right the writing and direction made this film hard to watch. Nice write up! I’m among the vocal bunch who never wanted this film in the first place. Whether that makes me a monster or not, I cannot judge, but the fact this film succeeded in the face of such opposition is, frankly, surprising. One wonders whether its mediocrity will generate interest in a sequel, and although I suspect the law of diminishing returns won’t work in Sony’s favour, there’s an argument to be had that the box-office return is enough to warrant such an investment. What I’m keen to examine is whether or not this was just a fluke, or whether there are enough people keen to see a Villainverse (so to speak) from this studio without the core heroes they sprang from. I’m still in denial about that, but if it works, I’ll shut up and enjoy. I don’t think the idea of movies centered around villains is a bad idea.  The problem is that in order for them to work properly, you need strong writing in terms of script and character development.  You also need to have film-makers and a movie studio that truly understand the character they’re making the movie for.  Venom didn’t really have any of that.  The only real reason that a lot of people enjoyed certain parts of the movie were because of Tom Hardy’s performance, but even one person’s performance cannot carry a movie that is hindered by sub-standard writing.  I’ll be honest:  I’m very curious to see if they can correct the mistakes made in the first movie with a sequel.  You never know.  Some sequels have ended up being much better than the original film. I really wanted this to be good and there are some promising things here. I feel if they could get a better script things could work. We shall see. I think Sony had a choice – either copy marvel or jump on the Deadpool bandwagon  but by choosing to satisfy both, it somehow completely misses the mark!  That’s an interesting way of looking at it and it makes sense. They do seem to be straddling that line which ultimately hurts the movie. It would have been better for Sony to jump on the Deadpool bandwagon.  The film would still have been successful and not divided the audience as much.  Deadpool and Logan proved that there IS a market for hard R-rated Marvel movies.  That being said, considering the weak script that the movie had, I seriously doubt that an R-rating would have helped.  Venom reminds me a lot of Alien Vs. Predator.  An enjoyable romp that ultimately didn’t live up to the hype and was sabotaged by a studio that was trying to appeal to everyone.  But by doing that, it ultimately ended up pissing everyone off.  I keep seeing it happen and nobody seems to learn from it. 100% agree the R-rating not curing the film’s script woes. I don’t mind the ratings but I’m not a fan of writing towards an R-rating. That said this did looked like an example of a movie that would have benefitted by having more of an edge.  Certainly agree here – Hardys performance would have been far more enjoyable if it hadn’t been for the fact that everyone else in the film were going in the completely opposite direction! Better than some of Sony’s other Spider-Man related movies. Granted that Hardy saved it from being below average. The sequel could be cool if it has a stronger script and better action. I hate to bring up the rating again, but while the first movie managed to get away with a PG-13 rating, the sequel must be rated R.  If they plan on bringing Carnage into the fray, then you can’t have it PG-13.  If you’ve read the comics, Carnage and Kasidy are two of the most violent villains in comic book history.  If you really want Carnage, you need to be able to let him off the leash.  You can’t do that with a PG-13 rating.  Again, writing is very important, but they have to take the character and violence of Carnage into consideration.  If they screw up Carnage, you can kiss any more Venom movies goodbye."
"Apr 6, 2022",negative," So basically Sony went a bit mad, and the first result was the 2018 comic book adaptation Venom. It has taken me a long time to watch it; so long, in fact, that its sequel has already come and gone. I am, in addition to being a film enthusiast, a big comic book fan. It’s been mostly wonderful watching Marvel Studios and Warner Bros bring a host of childhood favourites into live-action cinema. Of course, before setting up their own production studio, Marvel Comics bought its way out of bankruptcy by farming its suite of characters out to the highest Hollywood bidder. 20th Century Fox scored the rights to the X-Men and the Fantastic Four. New Line Cinema made good bank on second-stringer Blade. Universal Pictures grabbed the Incredible Hulk and Sub-Mariner – although they never did wind up making anything out of the latter. Sony, through their subsidiary Columbia Pictures, bought the film rights to Spider-Man – one of the most popular superheroes there is – and as long as they continue making films with the character they never have to give it back. This worked well at first, with Sam Raimi directing three immensely successful films starring Tobey Maguire in the lead. Then, feeling that the third film didn’t wow audiences the way they wanted it to, Sony rebooted the franchise with Andrew Garfield in the lead. At the same time Marvel Studios surprised everybody with their box office-smashing interconnected universe of superhero movies. Rather than make a third film with Garfield, Sony elected to reboot Spider-Man a second time – only this time the films would be produced by Marvel Studios on Sony’s behalf, and the character was allowed to also appear in Marvel’s own Avengers pictures. It was a canny method to cash in on Marvel’s success. Clearly at least one executive at Sony felt particularly canny, because of course the rights to Spider-Man also came with the rights to all manner of supporting and subsidiary characters. If Spider-Man allowed Sony to profit from Marvel’s achievements, then surely Sony could exploit those extra characters for a shared universe of their own? Of course in practice this is a terrible idea. Why make a film about a Spider-Man villain if they have no Spider-Man to fight? It is a bit like watching a princess without a ball to go to, or a ping pong match with only one player. Sony are fixated on the idea of a shared Spider-villain universe, and have already produced two Venoms and a Morbius towards that goal. Kraven the Hunter is already in production. Madame Web shoots soon. Thus far I see no indication that this continuing franchise is sustainable. Venom made a lot of money; it is clear Morbius will not. I am generally not one to place a bet, but if you are I suggest Kraven is much more likely to be a Morbius than a Venom, commercially speaking. In Venom, investigative journalist Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy) is infected with an oily black alien symbiote, and uses his newfound powers to strike back against a diabolical genius billionaire who is murdering people for scientific research purposes. It would be the best superhero released in 1998, were it not released in 2018: two decades out of date in terms of script, plot, character, tone, and content. It is a bizarrely old-fashioned film. Tom Hardy is actually rather enjoyable as Brock, and manages to lift the first half of the movie into something broadly entertaining. It is in the second half that the film wobbles, and then flounders. A need to actually drive a plot results in some terribly underwhelming choices and action sequences, culminating in my least favourite Hollywood tradition: the climax where two visual effects punch each other. Decent supporting actors like Michelle Williams and Riz Ahmed get very little to do, and seem to run through the motions. Both are definitely worthy of much better fare than this, as is Hardy to be honest – but he at least likely scored a bigger pay cheque. Ruben Fleischer directs this first instalment, although sadly brings little of the humour that made his Zombieland films so delightful. There’s a line in the opening scene of Aaron Sorkin’s failed TV drama Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip that has always resonated with me. I goes like this: ‘there’s always been a struggle between art and commerce. And now I’m telling you art is getting its ass kicked.’ All Hollywood blockbusters are commercial exercises, but the best ones – even the mediocre ones – make room for the art. Venom feels like 100 per cent commerce. It is there to create a shared universe via blunt force. It is there to make a lot of money, and it did – grossing more than $800 million in cinemas alone. There is no room for art though, not in Sony’s live-action Spider-Verse. Venom blandly wants you to shut up and consume. It really is worth pondering whether or not you should. I’m also not a fan of CGI pixel stoushes as the climactic boss battle of a superhero movie, particularly when they’re filmed at night to make the SFX easier to render."
"Mar 11, 2022",negative," Tom Hardy stars as Spider-Man’s professional-rival-turned-archnemesis in Venom, an anti-superhero movie that neither features New York’s friendly neighborhood arachnid-person nor exists in the same cinematic universe as Tom Holland’s current iteration for the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Topher Grace appeared as Venom, however briefly and frustratingly, in Sam Raimi’s second sequel to the Tobey Maguire-starring Spider-Man series, and fans have been clamoring for a proper deployment of the character ever since. Hardy gives a spirited, always-watchable, occasionally mumbling performance as Eddie Brock, the reporter who becomes the host to a brain-eating alien organism. The actor’s commitment to his Jekyll and Hyde routine is admirable, if comically absurd, as opposed to the terrifying quality usually associated with the character. But not even Hardy’s presence can distract from the script’s tired use of wisecracks, bombastic action sequences, and a complete disregard for the characteristics that made Venom a memorable character in the comics. A stand-alone feature about Venom is a desperate move on Sony’s part. Although they own the rights to Marvel’s web-slinging hero, their last three attempts to make a Spidey movie that connected with audiences—Spider-Man 3 (2007), The Amazing Spider-Man (2012), The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (2014)—failed, quite miserably, despite making hundreds of millions at the box-office. Seemingly incapable of making a movie that pleases comic book fans, or anyone else, Sony has since loaned Spider-Man out to the MCU, along with a select few of his associated villains. Meantime, they’ve made a desperate attempt to produce a number of spin-off movies. In a cart-before-the-horse move reminiscent of Universal’s Dark Universe that began and ended with The Mummy (2017), the studio has given a lofty name to their planned movie continuum: the Sony Universe of Marvel Characters. Venom is the first of them, and it plays as though some Sony executive who’s been locked in his office since 2003 finally emerged and dictated the movie’s banal, kitschy tone and cheap-looking CGI. The result looks and feels like it’s from the same era as The Punisher (2004) and Fantastic Four (2005). The traditionally New York-centric Eddie Brock arc has been resituated to San Francisco, a move explained in a throwaway line about Brock’s renegade brand of investigative journalism getting him ostracized from the East Coast. (But really, it’s a choice meant to rationalize why Spider-Man isn’t swooping in and saving the day.) Now with some celebrity from his news show, “The Eddie Brock Report,” Brock lives a comfortable life with his fiancée, Anne Weying (Michelle Williams), a high-powered attorney. When Brock is tasked with interviewing tech mogul Carlton Drake (Riz Ahmed) as part of a puff piece, he can’t resist asking the tough questions about Drake’s shady deals and rumors of human experimentation. As a result, the vindictive Drake arranges it so that Brock loses his job. Anne leaves him too, as her firm represents Drake, and they fired her over Brock’s confrontation. And so, Brock hits rock bottom. Nevermind that in the comics he was an unhinged lowlife and bully. Here, he’s a strangely incongruous mixture of activism and motorcycle-riding rebel that feels like an excuse by the many-credited writers to make him a hero. At the same time, a space shuttle owned by Drake crash lands on Earth carrying several alien symbiotes—goopy slime creatures that need a host to survive. Drake hopes to achieve human-symbiote integration to allow people to explore space, and in his dastardly Elon Musk way, he’s willing to sacrifice a few homeless test subjects to achieve his vision. Meanwhile, a whistleblower (Jenny Slate) approaches Brock to expose Drake’s plan, and the down-on-his-luck reporter’s snooping exposes him to Venom—a black symbiote that speaks to Brock in a monstrous voice and grants him, among other advantages, super strength and a greasy organic suit with stretchy tendrils. Drake orders a group of mercenaries to capture Brock/Venom, and a series of chases, goon-bashing, and infrequent head-eating ensues. It’s all delivered with a light PG-13 quality that robs the Venom character of its potential for an alternative kind of superhero movie that splices together science-fiction and horror. Director Ruben Fleischer (Zombieland) concentrates on comic book action first, characters second. Eventually, Drake finds himself bonded with a symbiote of his own, a baddie named Riot who intends to bring millions of symbiotes to our planet. The battles between Venom and Riot look like two CGI blobs of Gack! smashed against each other in an indecipherable mess. The climactic showdown has a mind-numbing quality that causes the viewer’s eyes to gloss over from an overdose of computer-generated nonsense. Unfortunately, the scenes with Brock as a human aren’t much better, regardless of how much effort Hardy puts into every gesture or exaggerated vocal inflection. Moreover, the character itself is poorly articulated. Although Venom should be augmenting and twisting Brock’s inner darkness, the writers of Venom suggest that Brock’s goodness turns Venom into a hero. It’s a dull trajectory for the character and a particularly gutless approach by the studio commanding this intellectual property. Worse, it’s all capped by a lousy Eminem song over the end credits, featuring the cornball lyric, “Venom… They ain’t gonna know what hit ’em.” Venom spends most of its runtime with Hardy, giving little screentime or development to the characters played by Williams, Ahmed, or Slate. Not even Brock or Venom have more than two dimensions, aside from both being losers of their respective species, who then become heroes as a result of their newfound partnership. Given its disregard for the integrity and nature of the comic book property, one has to question why this movie exists. Those unfamiliar with Venom probably won’t care about the movie anyway, while casual Spider-Man fans, the target audience, are bound to feel disappointed by its treatment—doubly so after Sony messed up Venom once before. Who was Sony trying to appease, besides their investors? Because Venom looks and feels like a slapdash attempt to exploit the rights to a Sony property in the wake of the MCU, the movie apparently exists as a commercial enterprise and not much more. At least MCU titles mask their commercialism in their devotion to characters and telling a good story. By contrast, Venom seems like a knock-off, or perhaps a throwback to the early-2000s era of superhero movies that is best left forgotten."
"Feb 11, 2022",negative," By the time Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy) and his snarky symbiote Venom (also Tom Hardy) intertwine, director Ruben Fleischer’s excursion into the Spider-Man villain (er, antihero in this edition) finally starts to link with what it’s capable of. The latest in “well, we want in on the Marvel money, too” studio excursions, Venom, a film about the big-teethed, gooey black space alien shapeshifter with a taste for tater tots and people, crawls around in confusion for about an hour before it really starts to figure out what it wants to be. As many have noted, the film straps its audience back into a pre-Marvel Cinematic Universe mode where heroes and villains fought through angst, pulp, Danny Elfman scores, lager-than-life performances and alt-rock soundtracks to entertain audiences. The pinnacle example would be Sam Raimi’s first two Spider-Man movies, art-pop masterpieces of dazzling style and emotion. Venom feels like a dorky, fast food spinoff of the Raimi films, with mounds of Barry Sonnenfeld’s first Men in Black movie thrown in for good measure. How dated does this movie play? It should’ve ended in a Sum 41 theme song. Hardy, one of or most prolific, gifted actors working, only gets so much to do before he nearly gets too much to do as the titular character. For about 30-45 minutes, he’s walking around with a weird TMZ reporter accent until a jaunt into sketchy Life Foundation (run by a sorely misused Riz Ahmed) to do some investigative reporting gets him in contact with the Venom Symbiote (which apparently is not a real word; go figure). The stretch where everything is established just struggles to take root. You’re practically begging an already-rushed into to go even faster to get to the reason we’re here. From here on, the film gets weird, and chunky, and shamefully fun. Hardy goes into overdrive to play the body humor of being infected with a talking parasite that can transform him into a man-munching alien monster at the drop of a hat. It’s grand comedy to watch him power through Venom’s bizarre instincts (one moment sees a ghoulish Hardy hop into a lobster tank at a fancy restaurant and eat one live in front of flummoxed patrons). Venom’s not really a bad Symbiote (trust us, those come later as the film’s obvious plot churns on), and his and Brock’s back-and-forth can be quite charming, in a fresh burger from McDonald’s sort of way. Their banter is corny and contrived, but Hardy’s skittish overacting and the creepy Venom CGI combine for one of 2018’s oddest cinema pleasures. Everything outside of our antihero lacks bite. Ahmed’s Carlton Drake (a tech guru and business maven who tests the Symbiotes that come to Earth on unwitting humans) needed more pop to sizzle; as he is, he’s just a monologue in a suit-and-tie. Michelle Williams also gets the shaft as Brock’s ex-fiancé who he wrongs earlier in the film. She’s too talented an actress to make this role completely a stock role, but the script tries its darndest. Fleischer (of Zombieland fame) uses need blue-tinted lighting in select action scenes, though only an assault in the lobby of a building really meets the typical bar for a superhero brouhaha. Everything else is just kind of static. That’s where Venom lives and dies; in the margin between how goofy and trashy fun it is and how boring its structure stands. It’s too endearing to write off just as it’s too basic to really make a mark. It’s a film you’ll connect with just as you’ll withdraw from it. For a movie that was seemingly shot for a certain rating and edited down to meet another, that’s not a bad spot to be in."

"Aug 17, 2021",neutral,"The first half hour of the film feels very rushed, as if the director is trying to get all the backstory and all the set up out of the way, sucking away all the emotional investment that the viewer is supposed to have."
"Jul 13, 2021",positive," Ten years ago, if a superhero movie had characters with a passing resemblance to their comic-book counterparts, a semi-intelligible story, and acting that wasn’t laughably bad, it was considered a pretty good movie — for a comic-book movie, that is. Sony Pictures’ Venom arrives in theaters at a time when every comic book movie is expected to either be a faithful, blockbuster preamble for the next “nothing will ever be the same” event, or a dramatic, nihilistic deconstruction of heroism and the human condition. All things considered, it’s not exactly the most welcoming environment for a wacky, odd-couple comedy about a head-chomping alien and the poor guy who’s forced to share a body with it. Directed by Zombieland filmmaker Ruben Fleischer, Venom casts Hardy as Eddie Brock, a crusading journalist who ends up becoming the reluctant host of a powerful, symbiotic alien creature. The alien, which goes by the name “Venom,” gives Eddie amazing abilities that make him practically invulnerable, but it also has a mean streak and an appetite for human heads (among other body parts). As Eddie struggles to reconcile the co-habitation of his body and the recurring need to convince Venom not to take a bite out of the people they encounter, the reluctant partners soon find themselves battling a powerful genius trying to harness the alien’s power for his own, nefarious reasons. Hardy throws himself into his performance with all of the manic energy he has at his disposal, and elevates one scene after another that could have easily devolved into something more campy than comedic with a different actor. The Mad Max: Fury Road and Bronson star has always been at his best when there’s an underlying current of crazy in his character, and Venom wisely provides him with more than enough material on that front, whether he’s fighting the alien for control of his own body or engaged in what appears to be (to everyone around him, at least) a heated, violent argument with himself. Although the film relies heavily on computer-generated elements to bring Venom to life, the creature’s fluid-like composition plays to the strengths of the film’s digital effects. Venom has always been a morphing, viscous entity that doesn’t shy away from sprouting the occasional tendril or shape-shifting into whatever object is needed. With the exception of a few wonky scenes that try to blend Hardy’s face with Venom’s toothy maw, the film’s visual effects team generally finds a good balance between the alien and the organic in what appears on the screen. In a supporting role, Riz Ahmed feels similarly invested in his performance as the film’s diabolically brilliant antagonist, but the premise of Venom turns the typical hero-villain relationship on its head in ways that make it difficult for the story’s bad guy to stand out. In any other comic book movie, a sociopathic scientist experimenting with alien-human hybrids would be the craziest person in the room, but the frantic, bipolar nature of Hardy’s “hero” character makes the most cold-blooded villain seem calm and collected in comparison. On the down side, four-time Academy Award nominee Michelle Williams feels a bit under-utilized (and out of place) in a script that doesn’t give her character much to do. Venom offers a nice reminder that there’s still a lot of entertainment to be had in a film that just wants to be crazy fun. In the run-up to the film’s release, there was no lack of debate regarding the studio’s decision to tone down the violence to a more family-friendly PG-13 rating. To its credit, Venom doesn’t feel stunted or held back by its general-audience rating, though. The film’s relatively bloodless brawls don’t appear to be watered down, and the aliens’ affinity for eviscerating, bludgeoning, and chewing humans doesn’t seem conspicuously reined in. That’s not to suggest that Venom couldn’t have been improved by adding a few more severed limbs and gory encounters — only that the film doesn’t feel like it suffers for the lack of those elements. It will be interesting to see whether Venom can find its audience in the current comic book movie environment. If Sony had brought the same film to theaters a decade ago, it would have made a fantastic year for comic book movies even better. Released in 2008 instead of 2018, Venom wouldn’t have received the critical acclaim The Dark Knight earned, and it wouldn’t be the career-redefining project for star Tom Hardy that Iron Man was for Robert Downey, Jr. that year, but the darkly comedic, crazy niche that Venom carves for itself would have been celebrated as another win for the genre. The bar has been raised significantly for comic-book movies over the last decade, and that’s a good thing. Still, Venom offers a nice reminder that there’s still a lot of entertainment (and escapist value) to be had in a film that just wants to be crazy fun — and then delivers on that promise. It’s never a bad time to watch an action movie. They provide perfect escapism from the stressful day-to-day grind. They are thrilling, exciting, and offer high-octane storylines that keep you engaged the entire way through. Like clockwork, a plethora of movies and TV shows are added to and taken away from almost all streaming platforms each month. With Barbenheimer pulling everyone to movie theaters, those streaming queues have quickly piled up, and some selections may disappear as the end of August brings about changes in streamers' content libraries. It's not an overstatement to say Tom Cruise is the last real movie star. The actor is back on the big screen with the larger-than-life action flick Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning, the seventh entry in the long-running and acclaimed Mission: Impossible series. Cruise is among the last actors capable of mobilizing global audiences on name alone, with many still willing to pay for a movie ticket just to see him doing his thing.

"Apr 29, 2021",negative," When Sony released Spider-Man in 2002, it was hard to deny that they had seemingly pioneered the winning formula for a multiplex-slaying superhero movie in the 21st century. Far from being the perfect package for fans who prefer their (anti)heroes to literally have a little bit more bite, Venom is a flawed beast that feels every bit as outdated as it does confused. Tom Hardy is fearless investigative reporter Eddie Brock, who lands himself in hot water after probing reports of sinister experiments at a shadowy corporation owned by Carlton Drake (Riz Ahmed). Acting on a tip-off, he finds himself alone in Drake’s facility late at night – and it isn’t too long before a series of escalating events end with a mysterious alien parasite taking over his body. Of the film’s many faults, this depiction of Brock’s origin story is perhaps the most pressing. It’s crucial to establish his background, but it’s tediously stretched to the point where Hardy’s full transformation comes at the end of the film’s overwrought first hour. Marvel fans will also baulk at the absence of Spider-Man in the origin story – in the canonical version, the alien symbiote latched on to Spidey as a ‘living’ costume during the intergalactic Secret Wars, explaining Venom’s similarity with his image. When the transformation finally does happen, so too do the film’s few highlights – a sequence that sees Hardy dispatching a group of goons on the streets of San Francisco is deliciously dark and effortlessly skews Marvel’s sense of moral responsibility on its head. But the fun soon stops. As the pressure ramps up, Hardy finds himself plodding his way through a series of increasingly anonymous fight sequences that lack the engaging thrills of other modern superhero movies. As for Hardy himself, he’s a satisfactory fit as a grizzled Eddie Brock – but he’s let down by a script burdened by dated comic book cliches that should be relegated to another era entirely. It’s the same for Michelle Williams as Eddie’s girlfriend Anne Weying – she’s entirely wasted in a role that lacks empowerment and righteousness – right up to the moment where she’s saved by the strangest of interspecies romances. Still, it’s not an entirely wasted venture. Hardy’s relationship with the titular beast’s voice inside his head often proves to be unexpectedly funny – there are several zingers that offer a small glimpse of what could’ve been. Venom could have been so much more, a real chance for Sony to mark the beginning of a darkened alternative universe that was capable of taking on the multiplex slaying might of the MCU. As it stands, it seems that there’s very little for Disney to worry about."
"Mar 1, 2021",negative," “Venom,” the first film in the brand-spanking-new Sony Marvel Universe, gives us not one but two Tom Hardy performances. In a dual role the Oscar nominee plays Eddie Brock, an investigative reporter with an aw-shucks accent and the title character, an amorphous sentient alien who requires a host, usually human, to bond with for its survival. It’s kind of an anti-superhero Jekyll and Hyde situation where Ed and Venom are a hybrid, two beings in one body. When we first meet Brock he’s the host of a popular television show. When he is assigned to interview genius inventor Carlton Drake (Riz Ahmed), he goes off script, asking some difficult and embarrassing questions. His rogue behaviour costs him everything, his job, his girlfriend (Michelle Williams) and his house. To get revenge he breaks into Drake’s facility with an eye toward exposing Drake’s evil doings. Instead he ends up merged with the extraterrestrial symbiote Venom, becoming a toothy creature with a tongue that would make Gene Simmons envious. Bestowed with superhuman strength and power, he must learn how to manage his not only his new gifts but also his rage. “The way I see it we can do what we want,” Venom says to his host. “Venom’s” advertising tagline, “The world has enough Superheroes,” refers to the titular character’s anti-hero status but could also be a comment on the surplus of comic book characters seen on screens in recent years. So, is Venom one superhero too many? Maybe, depending on your level of fandom. Comic book heads may complain about the absence of Spider-Man, the symbiote’s original host, and other deviations from the canon. But, on the flip side, the body-horror aspect of Venom’s metamorphosis coupled with the inherent humour of Eddie and Venom’s interactions are brought to vivid life by Hardy’s commitment. Structurally, for fans, “Venom” offers something different from the Marvel formula. By the time Hardy is flailing around in a restaurant lobster tank there will be no mistaking this for anything that came before it. Casual viewers may not be as interested. The first half, the origin story, gloomily drags on leading up to the Eddie’s transformation. Then it’s followed by a series of darkly lit chase scenes as Drake’s baddies try and stop Venom. The there are the women. In the “Wonder Woman” world we live in it’s a disappointment that Williams, as Eddie’s girlfriend, and Jenny Slate, as a scientist working for Drake’s Life Foundation, are underwritten, acting as placeholders more than actual characters. “Venom” has its moments, but it’s hard to tell whether we’re laughing with or at the movie. It feels unintentionally funny, as if all the actors except for Hardy understood they were acting in a generic comic book movie. He’s a hoot, the movie isn’t.

"Feb 17, 2021",neutral," A bad sci-fi, horror, thriller that’s weakly directed without joy or imagination by Ruben Fleischer (“Zombieland”/”30 Minutes or Less“) and flatly written with a silly plot by the team of Kelly Marcel, Jeff Pinkner & Scott Rosenberg, who adapt it from Pinkner &  Rosenberg’s story. It’s based on the Marvel comic created by Todd McFarlane and David Michelinie. Venom was introduced in Spider-Man comics in 1984. This could be the most inane Marvel put on the screen. And it also might be the worst acted one despite its talented cast.A spaceship containing alien specimens crash-lands at East Malaysia. An astronaut (Chris O’Hara) who is a symbiote escapes alive, while the other dead ones are taken to a lab in San Francisco for testing by the suspicious conglomerate called Life Foundation that’s run by its crazed, wealthy and sociopathic British CEO, Carlton Drake (Riz Ahmed).The motorcycle riding investigative TV reporter Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy) discovers that Drake despite his fame and prestige in the science world to be a bad guy, a mad scientist, one who does harmful experiments in which he makes a lot of money and gets to be a world power-broker. Brock gains this intel by using the computer of Anne Weying (Michelle Williams), his blonde prosecutor girlfriend, and checks out court documents on the site that indicate Drake has been accused of doing illegal human experiments–getting unwitting volunteers off the street to be guinea pigs for his deadly experiments.Forced by his station boss (Ron Cephas Jones) to interview Drake and told to make it a soft-ball interview, Brock instead comes on hard to Drake when they meet in an intro before the TV interview as he confronts him with his misdeeds. A vengeful Drake cancels the interview and uses his influence to get both Eddie and his girlfriend fired. Thereby Anne dumps Brock and hooks up with a medical doctor Dan Lewis (Reid Scott). For the next 6 months the blackballed reporter is despondent having lost his girl, his apartment and his career. In this state he is out of the blue contacted by the guilt-ridden assistant of Drake’s, Dr. Dora Skirth (Jenny Slate). The researcher wants Brock to collect evidence to put the evil genius out of the science business and in jail before he destroys the Earth with his diabolical experiments. At first reluctant, Brock soon accepts the challenge and sneaks into Drake’s secure, fancy facility with her help. Inside the facility, the nice guy people person Brock tries to help a homeless lady (Melora Walters) he knows from the streets, who is a captive, but she turns on him when he frees her from the glass cage and he becomes the host for another symbiote. In a rage, she turns out a parasite (CGI created) and it looks like a piece of slimy, squirmy bluish-black seaweed, that merges with him by going up his backside. He now becomes a powerful badass Venom, who is able to change appearances as a monster, regenerate himself and become super-strong (the gooey creature visuals are the best thing about this misguided film).All Drake can think of, is to get the missing creature back. So he sends his sadistic para-military security force team after Brock, and a fight between them ensues. In the comics Venom is a villain, however the movie keeps him as a good guy.The more the story goes on, the more absurd it becomes.None of the characters have a personality to give the film a jolt (especially the film’s lead character Tom Hardy, who received praise for his recent films yet doesn’t have any appeal to carry this dumb film). All the characters are underwritten and the story is told without humor. The only funny thing was the film’s advertising tagline: “The world has enough Superheroes.” My tagline would be “The world has had enough Marvel comics put on film to ponder for a lifetime.”"
"Dec 7, 2020",neutral," hen investigative reporter Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy) is assigned an interview with technology giant Carlton Drake (Riz Ahmed), he picks a fight he can’t hope to win. Instead of inquiring about Drake’s Life Foundation space exploration, he hounds the science prodigy about unethical pharmaceutical maneuvers, which quickly results in Brock losing his job and his relationship with fiancee Anne Weying (Michelle Williams). Months later, distressed scientist Dr. Dora Skirth (Jenny Slate) approaches Brock, offering evidence of Drake’s heinous practices, resuscitating the washed-up journalist’s sleuthing savvy to help expose the subversion. What he uncovers is far more shocking than anything he could have imagined: the Life Foundation’s otherworldly excursions have brought back alien parasites, with which Drake has been conducting human trials. Before Brock can abscond with proof of Drake’s atrocities, he’s attacked and infected by one of the lifeforms, giving birth to the half-man, half-alien mutation known as Venom. The first act of “Venom” plays out like a zombie movie, rife with horror elements that set a specific tone. It’s definitely a different take on superheroes, considering that intentional scare tactics are a rare combination for Marvel’s universe. Of course, this entry isn’t a traditional Marvel entity, as Sony/Columbia still retains production and distribution control. Curiously, the horror moments soon dissipate, replaced by the duality of a buddy-cop (or good cop/bad cop) routine, wherein heroism and mischief are continually at odds. Additionally, the comic relief ramps up, with slapstick-oriented mishaps occurring during host acclimation, along with the humor of adapting to Venom’s ravenous appetite, the tension with love-interest Anne, and the symbiont’s gravelly voice (which might divide fans) steering his newfound pawn. At certain points, the laughs goes so far that the filmmakers probably should have taken their subjects more seriously. As with “Suicide Squad,” the antihero of this latest venture must also be redeemable; few audiences would embrace an unwaveringly evil character as their only guide into the drama and adventure. Unfortunately, it takes awhile before Venom shows up in the form that allows for Brock to bicker with himself, or to unleash havoc on armed goons who strive to retrieve the valuable space alien. A good 20 minutes or so are devoted to introductions, which couldn’t be more generic. From the organism sample being valued above human life, to the interview of a crooked billionaire, to a date night, to a montage of “The Eddie Brock Report” television program, to small talk with a front desk guard, to a tour of the Life Foundation facility, the dialogue manages not to present any originality. It isn’t until the phrase “fake news” is spoken that viewers will note a hint of something out of the ordinary, though it’s a largely incompatible utterance that will likely distract from the fantasy of the sci-fi happenings; a sizable suspension of disbelief is already necessary, and those words certainly don’t help. Brock isn’t sympathetic at the start, which makes it even more challenging to welcome him as the protagonist. His egotism and thoughtlessness, disguised as a mission of uncovering corruption, are exacerbated by a rock-bottom downward spiral that finds him unwilling to hold onto the morals he initially claimed to have. As these films go, it takes very little for him to do an about-face, perhaps because he’s the only character designed to fall into that role; Skirth contacts him to ease her mind about disreputable human testing, yet he’s in no real position to utilize her information. After the horror and comedy disperse, the film transitions into an action picture, full of flurries of CG tendrils and sludge. Venom’s design is fascinating when the commotion slows down enough to take in the complexity of his shape-shifting capabilities. And those same frenetic qualities stifle the effectiveness of the action choreography as well. Whether it’s close-quarters combat or car chases, the frenzied editing only detracts from the stunts (a motorcycle chase through San Francisco boasts some impressive destruction, if nothing else). This contributes to the mediocrity of the climax, which suffers from the same problems seen in “Wonder Woman”: when the action-packed showdown is a computer-animated muddle, it only appears as chaos – and not the carefully orchestrated duel that it could have been. Still, the film is a notable effort in giving Venom his own theatrical episode, proving – to debatable degrees – that he doesn’t have to be relegated to a supporting part or as an antagonist for another superhero.

"Nov 10, 2020",negative," In the end, Ruben Fleischer's film will leave you wondering if there was another cut of the film, if this was his actual intention, and how he will explain this to Hardy's kid , who reportedly sparked his Bane-playing dad to do the film. All the questions are valid and troubling, because this is clearly not a good movie.  By now, you should know the story behind this thing, that is if you did manage to delete Spider Man 3 from your mind. Eddie Brock (Hardy) is an overly courageous reporter who goes after the most timely stories, much to chagrin of his employers. The latest involves a large corporation led by Carlton Drake (Riz Ahmed, who is in everything this week), a rich man with too much ambition risking human lives to make a scientific breakthrough.  As most comic book flicks do, the movie opens with a ship carrying devious things that obviously aren't groceries crashes to Earth, and a deadly parasite that can take human form gets loose. I think your mind can take it from there. Let's just say it effects every character in the film, namely Eddie. Fights ensue with lots of uneasy voiceover from the creature who becomes Eddie's alter ego, Venom.  I'll be honest with you and admit this movie may become a parasite that attaches itself to your brain for exactly 112 minutes before letting go and instantly disappearing. It's a sloppy mess that lost me with the very first sight of the comic character in action, and then found me periodically with humor.  Was the comedy intentional? When Venom and Eddie have a discussion about whether it's okay or not to rip a bad guy's head off, I found myself quite giggly in my chair. When Eddie watches his ex-fiance (Michelle Williams) turn into a crime-fighting Venom sister clone mere months after dumping him, I also laughed a bit. The first question I'd ask the director was rather he intended to make me laugh so much. If that was his goal, more power to you.  Hardy can make most train wrecks watchable. He's that good, being one of Hollywood's greatest actor-movie star hybrids who can fill the skin of an outlaw who wears a mask or a cardigan. But the only thing he accomplishes here is saving the film from being a Catwoman-Daredevil level abomination. It's like watching a guy try to dead-lift more than he possibly can in a gym, but look good in his efforts. There's no endgame where Hardy can save this film, but if you love the guy, his squinting and obliviousness to the entire idea of the plot could nurse you through it.  Williams and Ahmed are literally wasted here, playing types instead of true organic characters with a purpose. They show up and put makeup on, but fail to produce an actual performance. I'm just glad John Turturro didn't show up like he did in multiple Transformers films. Good on you, John.  The special effects sequences are amateurish, lacking the wow quality of even the second Sam Raimi Spider Man film. A motorcycle sequence could have ignited the film like a certain car chase did in Tom Cruise's Jack Reacher, but it ends up coming off as a CGI-infused bike ride instead of an exhilarating launch. There's way too much CGI in this film, making the very concept of a Venom film highly debatable.  Fleischer became somebody with 2009's Zombieland, but lost a lot of favor with 2013's Gangster Squad. While he nearly achieved brilliance in breathing fresh air into the zombie franchise with the Woody Harrelson (who shows up here for a second) action-comedy, he wasted a great cast with the the Mickey Cohen gangster drama. While harboring the ability to ride between great and garbage, he appeared to be a nice choice for this Sony-Marvel joint, but in the end fails to leave his mark.  The story feels like four separate brains and pair of hands were applied to it, lacking any shred of nuance or poignant grace to separate it from the rest of the noisy late summer offerings. Maybe the writers passed the laptop around trading ideas and finally decided to stop at some point. Someone could have screamed out, ""mercy!"" In the end, I'd avoid this film. It's a film without intent and carrying little enjoyment or entertainment factor. I thought Hardy could no wrong, but then we both met Venom, and things changed.  The tag line for the film reads, ""the world has enough superheroes."" I think the world has enough Venom films as well. You can stop now. "
"Oct 28, 2020",positive," A pretty random review here, but I literally had nothing to do for two hours at the end of Sunday and so stuck this film on after seeing it on Netflix and going “Oh yeah, I always wanted to see what that was like”. So, what was it like? Erm… It was okay. I was originally turned off at the idea of Venom without Spider-Man, it seemed like it just wouldn’t work, but I’ll at least give them credit in finding a work-around that was good enough. What about the rest of the film? Read on! While trying to take down Carlton, the CEO of Life Foundation, Eddie, a journalist, investigates experiments of human trials. Unwittingly, he gets merged with a symbiotic alien with lethal abilities. As I mentioned in the opening paragraph, the way they dealt with introducing Venom without Spider-Man was fine. Basically the Symbiotes are taken to Earth as specimens and Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy), still a journalist, ends up merged with one while investigating around the lab they were kept in. While I still think skipping the whole Venom fighting Spider-Man thing and going straight to anti-hero Venom is a shame (especially as our only live action depiction of the two fighting was… less than stellar) it didn’t go too badly here. There are some good action moments in the middle of the film, Brock finding out about his Venom powers while they protect him from a bunch of thugs trying to assault him in his flat was entertaining, and a subsequent motorcycle chase down the streets of San Francisco was good bit of fun. There was also a big shootout in Brock’s old news corporation building that was really fun, plus one or two scenes of Venom chomping people’s head off, much to Brock’s disgust. All entertaining way to pass the time, even if they won’t win any awards for beautifully written drama or anything…(and if that’s what you expected going in, then… Huh?) I’ve seen online criticism about Venom’s voice for being really cheesy, but… I mean, yeah. I found it the funny kind of cheesy though, given Venom is a product of his times and hard to actually take seriously I think it works. As a fan of the Spider-Man Cartoon growing up in 90s I wouldn’t want a more serious sounding, grounded Venom anyway. So we all know that with a few exceptions the main problem with Marvel, and indeed comic book movies in general, is the villain is often underdeveloped due to more screen time being devoted to establishing the hero. Well, the same is absolutely true here. Riz Ahmed as unethical genius Carlton Drake is extremely generic, to the point where “unethical genius” is literally his entire character, never straying from it at all. Towards the end he merges with the Symbiote known as Riot but that doesn’t change his character much beyond wanting to find a new place for the Symbiotes to conquer rather than finding a new place for humanity to live. Either way he’s killing innocent humans, just one is bit more dramatically… bad. Michelle Williams plays Anne Weyin, Brock’s fiancée who rightfully dumps him when he uses her secret, password protected legal documents to try and nail Drake in an interview. She comes back into the picture when he creepily hangs around outside her house as she and her new boyfriend Dan Lewis (Reid Scott) return home. Dan is a doctor and helps Eddie several times, while Weyin starts to feel sorry for her old flame as he goes through hell and helps him at several points, including becoming “She-Venom” briefly in order to transfer the Venom Symbiote back to Brock when it gets ejected due to soundwaves towards the end of the film. The problem is… well, I didn’t really care for either of these support characters, they’re both nice (especially helping Brock when he’s clearly a complete knob even pre-Venom) but neither exactly exude anything other than being slightly spoiled rich people with amazing, well-paying jobs. That’s about it for characters, really. There is a female scientist who helps Brock for a bit, and a few recurring thugs but other than that it’s quite focused on Brock and his mental battle with Venom. Venom is a mixed bag. It has some fun set-pieces and worked around the lack of Spider-Man quite well, but the finale is disappointing and every character who isn’t Brock is rather dull and one-dimensional. Still, it passed two-hours reasonably, especially given it was just a part of one of my regular streaming services, if I’d paid a bunch of money to see it in the cinema I think the flaws would’ve annoyed me a lot more. A middling score it is then!"
"Sep 26, 2020",positive," But yeah, almost despite itself Venom is a pretty entertaining film if you're willing to surrender to its chaotic lunacy and just go with it.  So, if you're going to try to make Venom then why not also toss into the mix an Academy Award-nominated actor, say Tom Hardy, who should be able to handle the character's complexities but who won't be so familiar to American audiences that it'll be distracting if it doesn't quite work. Ruben Fleischer (Zombieland, Gangster Squad) directs, though if rumors are true that didn't work particularly well for Hardy as it's said the two had more than a few creative differences along the way. If true, my gut tells me that Hardy was probably right because Fleischer does an awful lot wrong here.  It all starts off with Eddie (Hardy), a laid back investigative reporter who takes his work seriously and who isn't particularly thrilled when his boss tosses anything less on his desk. So, he's not exactly enthusiastic when assigned to do a profile piece on Carlton Drake (Riz Ahmed), a human hating entrepreneur who prefers finding superior life in the universe rather than dealing with earth's weaklings.  Much to its detriment, Venom starts off quite a while before Eddie and Venom are united, a union resulting from a rocket carrying a lifeform crashing in Malaysia. Destined to be known as the symbiote for reasons I never quite grasped, this lifeform sort of transplants itself inside alternative life beings either killing them or serving up superhuman powers or, hey, maybe even both.  The only real reason to see Venom, but it's a really good reason, is for the performance of Tom Hardy turning in the ultimate buddy performance as both Eddie and Venom. Hardy, I can't help but believe, actually gets this film and gets this character and throws himself, at times quite literally, into the film's dark humor turned pitch black and humor that is so ridiculous that it's downright funny if you've allowed yourself to surrender to it all. Hardy has a better chemistry with himself than with Michelle Williams, his love interest in the film, nor do things really click with Jenny Slate as Dr. Dora Skirth, a scientist who tips Eddie off as to what's going on. Rather fortunately, both Williams and Slate are tremendously underwritten here and Hardy spends most of his time, at least in the film's latter half, in his hilariously off-kilter dual roles.  There will be some, especially purists, who will complain passionately about a certain well known absence in the film that I won't spoil here but is likely already known by everyone who is passionate about seeing Venom. While the complaint is valid from a purist's standpoint, the truth is that considering the film's narrative arc and tone it was a valid choice that works really well.  I wasn't expecting to enjoy Venom, a film that I skipped when critics had their promo screening in favor of catching it when it was convenient to me and with a more authentic audience. I'm glad I did. While the haters were vocal, the laughs were even louder and it looks like the film's scathing reviews won't translate into anything resembling box-office poison. "
"Aug 30, 2020",neutral," Dirigida por Ruben Fleischer y protagonizada por Tom Hardy, Michelle Williams y Riz Ahmed. La película del famoso villano/anti-héroe que se divorcia por completo de los orígenes de su historia, y por tanto de la esencia que hace el personaje interesante. Con un gran elenco, “Venom” desaprovechó por completo la capacidad de adentrarse en un punto de vista nunca antes visto dentro de las películas de superhéroes. Un punto de vista oscuro, para adultos y con ganas de explorar nuevos terrenos. Sin embargo, en el afán de mantenerse entretenida e igual a las demás, cuenta una previsible y repetida historia. Tambaleándose dentro de la acción y el drama/comedia, la película recae, en varias ocasiones, dentro de lo absurdo. Puesto que lo único cómico del personaje original se establece en su ausente contraparte, Spider-Man. Una película de Venom sin este, de por sí estará coja. A diferencia de muchos, no sentí para nada esa conexión entre Tom Hardy y Venom, me desagradó inmensamente el diálogo de este último y aunque por momentos tiene escenas de acción entretenidas e interesantes, se pierden dentro de la rapidez de todo lo que ocurre."
"Jul 25, 2020",negative,"[I]t all feels so constrained by its PG-13 rating, and with the anarchy appearing so anesthetized, it's up to Hardy to carry the picture to the finish line."
"Jul 18, 2020",negative,Venom is basically The Mask with a slobbery tongue and none of Jim Carrey's slapstick charm.
"Jul 17, 2020",negative," Since the beginning of time, we have seen many a comic book movie covering a character's origin story. OK, maybe it's only been in the past ten years' worth of the Superhero Boom, but isn't it hard to remember a time before these movies? What happens, though, when you want to show the beginnings of a character, but you need to separate it from its source material? You get a movie like Venom. Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy) is a down-on-his-luck former journalist who's had a rough time over the past six months. After he went off script during an interview with Carlton Drake (Riz Ahmed), the Elon Musk-esque head of the Life Foundation, asking him about topics Eddie should know nothing about, he was fired. His girlfriend Anne Weying (Michelle Williams), a lawyer whose firm represents the Life Foundation, also got fired as a result of Eddie's actions, so she dumped him. Meanwhile, a Life Foundation spacecraft crashes while returning to Earth. It's carrying four samples of organisms of unknown origin called Symbiotes. Three are recovered, while the other attaches itself to a human and escapes. The recovered Symbiotes are taken back to the Life Foundation for study and experimentation. When Drake authorizes testing of the Symbiotes on humans, Dr. Dora Skirth (Jenny Slate) has an attack of conscious. She seeks out Eddie to get him to report on the story, which could help him also prove everything he accused Drake of doing, everything that got him fired for saying, is true. While in the lab gathering the evidence he needs, one of the Symbiotes, the one that calls itself Venom, gets loose and attaches to Eddie. Here's the good news: Because of the backlash they received after the first trailer was released, the filmmakers went and redubbed every time characters said Symbiote, correcting the pronunciation. And…well…um…let me see, here…that's…yep, that's about it. Venom is an origin story that feels originless. Some of this is the fault of the filmmakers. Almost every moment of the movie feels rushed. The crash happens in the opening moments. We don't spend much time with the characters before the six month time jump. We don't spend much time getting to see Eddie's post-breakup life before he's infected. Even the action scenes are too rushed. Moments like the central car chase sequence and the climactic fight happen in such quick, frenetic edits that it's difficult to tell what's happening. If the editors could've kept just a few more frames before making their cuts, maybe the movie would've succeeded in being exciting. Instead, everything is simply fast-paced, and speeding things up doesn't build the intended tension better. In fact, it has the exact opposite effect. It almost feels like the filmmakers wanted to keep things moving at a fast speed so the audience doesn't have time to notice any flaws. Yet, the biggest flaw is the plot. For those of you who don't know, Venom is a villain that first appeared in the Spider-Man comics. It began as a cool looking new suit Spidey got while on another planet, but was soon revealed to be a living organism. When he finally got rid of it, it attached to Eddie Brock and became Venom. Since Sony Pictures has loaned Spider-Man to Marvel Studios, for the time being, they had to try to make a Spidey-based origin film without the Spidey connection. While I went in with an open mind about this, I just couldn't shake the feeling like a piece was missing. They make an admirable attempt, even incorporating the spaceship crash that the '90s cartoon show came up with because it couldn't tell the story from the books, but the end product feels flat. Another thing to consider is even though Venom is a comic book movie, and Venom a very popular character, there are some scenes that could be downright frightening for younger viewers. I'm not here to tell you how to parent. I'm a firm believer that you, and only you, know what your children can and cannot handle. Just be aware that some of the parts with Symbiotes, especially where they're being used in experiments, are pretty intense. There is the occasional, if not rare, moment that shows this franchise has some potential. The relationship between Eddie and Anne is a nice element I'd like to see expanded upon if this goes to additional movies. The back-and-forth between Eddie and Venom has brief flashes of fun, even making me smile a few times, and is also something I'd like to see more of in the future. Overall, Venom feels like something Sony made so they could retain control over one of the few aspects of the Spider-verse they still owned. Without Spidey to anchor the storyline, though, it just feels adrift.

"Jun 30, 2020",positive,"I can't say I like Venom and I can't say I hate Venom, but I am glad I watched it. It's a bizarre slice of schlock insanity that's simultaneously the product of out-of-control interference by the studio and the singular dedication of Tom Hardy."
"Jun 23, 2020",negative,"I suppose one could say that about just about any bad movie, but Venom's energy and a couple of its performances elevate it above the worst of the worst... It's also a very bad movie, make no mistake."

"Mar 3, 2020",positive," Not since Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance (2011) has a Marvel Comics adaptation centered on such a splendidly weird lead performance. Tom Hardy, speaking in a made-up American accent, plays a disgraced investigative journalist who becomes the host for an intelligent parasite from outer space. Before the parasite completely takes over his body, turning him into a super-powered killing machine, the journalist engages in lots of strange behavior (uncontrollably moving his limbs, eating live lobsters) that doesn’t require special effects to look interesting. Director Ruben Fleischer (Zombieland) maintains an agreeably cartoonish tone, establishing an atmosphere in which Hardy can get as nutty as he wants. The film devotes way too much time to exposition (the first act feels like it goes on for about an hour), but once it gets going it’s decent fun. With Michelle Williams, Riz Ahmed, and Jenny Slate."
"Jan 23, 2020",positive," The Last Exorcism: A child preacher turned (Protestant) exorcist/grifter wants to get out of the faith business, even though it pays his family’s medical bills. He invites a TV crew along for what he intends to be his last job, in which he hopes that his sleight-of-hand magic and Bible salesman’s patter will bring some comfort and peace to an isolated family whose grieving father thinks a devil has gotten into his daughter. Of course, we know the exorcism won’t go as planned–but the particular way this narrative twists, and then twists again, genuinely surprised me, and added depth to what could’ve been a cheap-thrills horror quickie. Director Daniel Stamm is also responsible for the American remake of 13 Sins. Both movies quickly but unsentimentally evoke financial pressures, and the love and responsibility a caregiver feels for a disabled family member. You’ll know within the first fifteen minutes if this movie is for you: If you care about this disillusioned preacher, if you believe in his cynicism, his confusion, and his attempt to do the right thing in the labyrinth of circumstance, you’ll be richly rewarded. (If you believe–isn’t that what they all say?) The movie has sympathy for its characters, exactly the right number of twists (not too many!), a terrific final image, and–maybe most importantly–a sense that life is baffling and desperate, but not meaningless. Evil is not the only or the most interesting truth. Whoever Slew Auntie Roo?: One of those ’70s deals with an aging grande-dame actress, an OTT horror plot, and a question mark in the title. It’s good! It’s a sad, weird movie about former vaudeville belle, now castle-dwelling orphan-gatherer “Auntie Roo” (Shelley Winters) and her infected grief for her long-disappeared daughter. There are heavy-handed Hansel and Gretel themes, a sublimely creepy footman (Michael Gothard and his gigantic teeth), and a surprisingly strong, iirc organ-driven score. Camp factor is high as Winters shows a bit of stocking to the orphans, but like the greatest camp, Auntie Roo is unafraid to strike a frankly tragic note. There are distorted and wasted lives here alongside the usual harridan-horror pleasures. Venom: When a reporter with extremely shaky professional ethics and an alien invader with a violence problem love one another very, very much, and they want to be as close as possible…. This is a Spiderman type joint, and it has the usual flaws of contemporary superhero flicks e.g. perfunctory character turns (who is this guy firing the reporter and why do I care?) and long bland CGI fights between tall bland CGI monsters. But I was watching it because I’d heard about the bizarre physical and emotional symbiosis between Eddie Brock (an extremely veterinary-grade looking Tom Hardy, all hangover bleariness and slurry teeth) and oil slick/shark alien Venom. And that relationship is the heart of this movie. Brock gets “infected” with Venom because of a devilish plot by San Francisco tech idol Carlton Drake (Riz Ahmed). Venom’s initial antipathy toward the human race gets knocked off course when he realizes that Eddie is, like himself! (itself? theirself??), “a loser.” This is so smart, you know, for so many reasons. First of all, there are two obvious kinds of personalities that might volunteer for what we eventually learn is Venom’s mission. And one of those personality types is “guy who massively flamed out in his hometown.” It makes a lot of sense that Venom would turn out to relate to a driven, smart, but extremely failurous guy like Eddie. So we get to watch them learn one another’s capabilities and slowly begin to enjoy one another’s company, and it’s a delight. Venom ends up being a “you and I against two worlds” story, which lots of people like under any circumstances. Then you add “honestly, my situation is not as bad as it looks, I am starting to like this,” and my ears perk up. (For example, I frequently entertain the self-comforting theory that alcoholics just get more out of alcohol than the normal people do–it’s just fun for you guys whereas for us it is sublime–you get what you pay for….) And then you throw in “being with you exposes me to constant public humiliation, I kinda love it,” and I just start throwing dollars at the screen. Eddie’s fiancee is also a good, plausible character; I didn’t feel like she got shoved aside. The music is fine and not as one-trick bombastic as, like, Avengers music. Anyway, I enjoyed this. I would like to watch more of Eddie and Venom bantering about their common character defects and possibly eating people."
"Nov 19, 2019",negative," Venom is looking to launch Sony's Marvel Universe, an isolated world from the Marvel Cinematic Universe filled with its own interconnected stories and Tom Hardy's Eddie Brock at the forefront. But, does the film deliver enough to warrant sequels, spinoffs, and ensembles? At the front of the film is Eddie's relationship to Venom, a symbiote from a foreign planet. The film certainly takes its time with their introduction, establishing Eddie's rise and fall as a journalist and fiancé first, as well as Dr. Carlton Drake (Riz Ahmed) and his Life Foundation's transparently evil schemes. When the human-symbiote relationship does take the screen, Venom finally gets a bit of excitement and the pacing picks up. Slowly, audiences get to know the character who prospered in his career as an investigative journalist. When assigned to an interview with Dr. Drake, he is asked to tone down his instincts and allow the piece to be puffy, if a bit dishonest. Knowing Eddie's history and inability to do so, Eddie's boss asks him anyway, prompting the first question of the film from audiences of why he would get such a task to begin with -- because of course he goes off the rails with the interview to create the film's plot and ultimately house a symbiote. Still, Hardy gives the film everything he's got. He impressively trots around Atlanta streets disguised as San Francisco acting like a wild, skitzophrenic-looking former journalist who has lost everything. Some scenarios will tee the performance up for mocking, such as a sequence seeing him jump into a lobster tank which wasn't intentionally funny, but Hardy is clearly committed to the part. More of the actor as Brock and Venom could be a good thing in the future, if a more compelling or original narrative comes along for him. Like Eddie Brock's body under alien control, the movie doesn't know if it wants to be gritty, funny, tough, or something else entirely. When a random feeling bout of hip hop music takes over the theater's speakers early on, it feels as though Venom is trying to identify as something else which has worked for other movies, but suffers from never committing to a certain tone. Above all, it's a poorly conceived script which hurts the film in the end. Awkwardly nuanced attempts at comedy often clog up scenes which Fleischer gave his best efforts to direct. Despite crowded environments and wild choreography, Fleischer kept the mayhem easy to follow and brought out the best possible from his stars. Ultimately, Fleischer shouldn't be blamed for the stiff moments and simple scenarios which were written into the movie. The action sequences are very entertaining, often offering a sense of raw terror and grit. Many push the boundaries for the MPAA's PG-13 rating, as the film also makes full on its quota for colorful language. Fans of the character will also love to see Venom's wild tongue letting loose in clouds of smoke before he takes out a entire SWAT team. However, the movie could have only thrived if it came before The Incredible Hulk -- or about five years before The Incredible Hulk. It not only offers vibes of that decade old Marvel movie in its CGI fights but also feels a bit creatively dated by comparison to today's super hero epics. Inevitably, Venom shows clear plans for sequels and expansions, but the studio should take a look at the few bits of Venom which worked and scrap the larger portions which didn't if they're going to continue. That said, more of Tom Hardy in this part wouldn't be the worst thing to come of it."
"Oct 29, 2019",neutral," From the indie darling to the tips you need for day one of the biggest games to classic cheats and codes, Cultured Vultures has you covered when it comes to gaming. Join Cultured Vultures as we bring you some of the biggest news from the world of wrestling. Whether it’s WWE news or something from across the sea, let’s talk shop. When director Sam Raimi was creating his original Spider-Man trilogy, Sony Pictures approached him with the idea of using Venom, a fan favorite character from the comic books, as the villain for the series’ third installment. Raimi passed on it, saying that he simply didn’t understand the character, and tossing him into a film that already had two villains written in might muddle the story being told and not give justice to that character. Sony realized that they were being too polite; Venom had to be in Spider-Man 3, and so it was done, and so ended the first iconic superhero franchise in cinema history (in Spider-Man 3, Venom gets the line “My spider sense is tingling, if you know what I’m talking about!” as he gestures down towards his groin).  Eleven years and another failed Spider-Man series later, Sony is back to try this again, this time with star Tom Hardy (do I even need to list what this man has been in?) and director Ruben Fleischer (Zombieland) at the helm. What’s the result? Still bad. How bad? Not the worst thing ever, but still pretty bad. Venom is just a rushed mess. The pacing and editing is all over the place, the tone shifts rapidly back and forth (is it supposed to be dark, scary monster horror or fun, silly Marvel Studios shtick?), and most of the acting is lackluster. Here’s the silly plot: Billionaire Carlton Drake (Riz Ahmed) retrieves three samples of an alien symbiote from out in space. One of them escapes and is on the loose, the others are held in Drake’s laboratories, until one day reporter Eddie Brock (Hardy) breaks in and accidentally becomes infected by one of the symbiotes known as “Venom”. Here’s where it gets weird. Venom has a personality all of his own, becoming a literal voice in Eddie’s head. He tells Eddie where to go and what to do, tells him that he wants to eat people, that he and the other symbiotes are going to take over the planet, and tells Eddie to apologize to his girlfriend. Venom also calls Eddie a pussy at one point. And his voice popping in and out just becomes a really bizarre choice. Whatever threatening presence Venom has at the start of the film is immediately lost when he gets inside of Eddie, and the film does a strange shift where Venom basically becomes comedic relief. He also quickly becomes a good person(?), fighting for the good side, and the shift from an alien monster that literally bites people’s heads off to Earth-saving good guy is a little jarring. Venom is certainly an anti-hero, but his change of heart happens much too quickly and with almost no explanation, other than it’s time to wrap this movie up. Tom Hardy is an immense talent, and Eddie Brock is a fun enough character. Oddly enough, even though Venom gets neutered once he and Eddie combine, that’s when Hardy gets to really shine. The infected Eddie is a ton of fun to witness, and Hardy, whose face is usually hidden behind a mask of some kind in his films, goes into full Jim Carrey mode, making the most ridiculous of expressions. It’s honestly a delight to see Hardy acting so manic and being so expressive. It makes you wish that they had committed to making Venom more of a straight comedy as opposed to whatever they were going for with this. Venom feels like a comic book movie that escaped from 2003. It’s stupid without having fun with it, the action is loud and dizzying (but Venom’s powers are pretty cool to watch), and most of the characters are thin. Poor Michelle Williams is stuck as simply “Eddie’s girlfriend”, and lacks a personality that’s any more than that. Near the end of the film, she has the line “Sorry about Venom.” It might as well be an apology to the audience, but the real apology is owed to everyone involved in this.  It’s thankless and only further proof that Sony still cannot figure out how to put together a superhero universe correctly. The film ends with a mid-credits sequence that blatantly attempts to set up a sequel, and it’s something that should be met only with eye-rolls.

"Oct 18, 2019",negative," With audiences’ insatiable thirst for superhero movies, it was inevitable that the villainous foils would start headlining their own films as well. One of the first out of the gate is “Venom” and it tells the origin story of one of Spider-Man’s key enemies. Spidey is nowhere to be found in this film, and that’s part of the problem. Other issues mar it more like the wildly uneven tone, as well as rushed and choppy editing. The final product looks like the result of a lot of last-minute reworking and indeed, stories have circulated online for months about efforts to save this from becoming another dud like 2015’s “Fantastic Four” reboot. “Venom” isn’t that bad, but it is a big disappointment, especially when you consider what it could have been – a dark and scary take on the duality of those in the superhero universe. Early on, the film seems set up to be just that. Like “Deadpool,” this one too is built around a snarky cynic in antagonistic TV reporter Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy). He’s a self-absorbed man-child, always picking a fight, always shirking responsibilities, even with his elegant, attorneygirlfriend Anne (Michelle Williams). He doesn’t seem to be capable of even feeding her cat, let alone following directions from his network boss (Ron Cephas Jones). Despite all that, Eddiedoes manage to be the champion of the little guy in his reporting, especially when he takes oncorrupt business tycoons like Carlton Drake (Riz Ahmed). Drake is up to all kinds of skullduggery, and Eddie will soon discover that the megalomaniac is sending rockets into space in efforts to harvest a parasitic alien that takes over other life forms and infuses them with super powers. Drake’s latest ship crashes upon re-entry, yet two specimens manage to be salvaged. A containment tank holding one symbiote with all its oozing, tar-like texture intact is safe, as is another hiding inside the body of the sole surviving astronaut. Back in San Francisco, Drake’s scientists start testing the symbiote on homeless people they’ve snatched off the streets. The other one is traveling towards them by jumping from body to body along the way. Dr, Skirth (Jenny Slate), one of Drake’s more noble colleagues, hates that patients are being eaten from the inside out by the parasite when their DNA doesn’t meld with theirs, and calls Eddie to make him aware of the nefarious goings on. Soon, he breaks into the compound to investigate and before you can say, “Radioactive spider”, he’s infested by the symbiote. Surprisingly, the alien invader takes to Eddie, even though he’s a hard-living, shambles of a man. Just exactly why isn’t explained well enough, but soon the horrifying parasite stops being so serious and turns comical. “Venom”, as the symbiote calls himself, even starts conversing with Eddie in his mind. The alien also shares his super powers with Eddie to keep him from harm, as Drake’s henchmen come after him. When they show up at his apartment to kill him, Venom uses his morphing skills to help Eddie combat them. As the fight turns into a chase scene, Eddie and Venom start bickering about who’s controlling his body like an old married couple bickering about who’s driving the car. Their banter is amusing at times, albeit miles away from the more serious tone of the first act. Did writers Scott Rosenberg, Kelly Marcel and Jeff Pinkner intend the tone to turn so silly, or was dialogue between Eddie and his new id rewritten to make the movie less dark and mean? No matter, the confusing tones are confounding to an audience trying to get a handle on it 30 minutes in. Other inconsistencies plague the proceedings too. Why doesn’t Venom just kill the henchmen who come to harm Eddie, especially when the parasite has shown no problem with slaughtering innocent people? For that matter, why does Venom allow for the ludicrously long and damaging chase happen following the intrusion? All Venom had to do is have Eddie stand still and swat all the villains and their drones that come at him with elongated gooey tentacles. For such a vicious villain, the ooze quickly turns into a snooze, literally and figuratively pulling punches. As the movie churns on, director Rubin Fleischer seems to let everything become more and more comedic as Eddie and Venom practically turn into Oscar and Felix sparring throughout every moment they’re together. Logic lapses too as Venom exits Eddie’s body for a time and feels comfortable taking over Anne’s body, or even that of a yapping dog. Now, everyone’s DNA is an acceptable match, even a canine’s? Even Venom’s serpentine tongue and racks of fangs are played for comic effect. The symbiote has a lot of teeth, but little bite. Hardy tries to give it his method all, but he’s often illegible and at times seems to be channeling Nick Nolte…a sixty-year-old Nick Nolte. Great actors like Williams and Ahmed are given precious little to do as the film grinds on, and Williams isn’t even given a proper wig to wear. Even the comic talents of Slate and featured player Reid Scott are never properly exploited here. Scott is a droll foil as Anne’s rebound boyfriend at least, and it’s nice that Venom doesn’t kill him. That’s one of the better surprises in the story. Fleischer brought us the superb “Zombieland” and the writers have done well before, but what shows up onscreen feels like there was too much interference from the powers that be who clearly chopped this one up left and right. Some transitions don’t match, a lot of the CGI seems rushed, and Hardy has gone on record stating that many of the best bits he filmed ended up on the cutting room floor. In the end, some of the action is fun and some of the dialogue gets laughs, but this materialshould have stayed edgy and more serious. The narrative could have examined themes of duality and the “Jekyll & Hyde” aspects of those who play vigilante, but film would rather snicker. One scene towards the end finds Eddie and Venom stopping a thief by biting his head off with the symbiote’s ginormous fangs. Then they walk away like it’s no big deal. Committing murder should’ve eaten Eddie alive, but he laughs it off. He smirks at his amorality as if it’s nothing to marvel at whatsoever.

"Aug 29, 2019",positive," It’s well known that superhero films are empowerment fantasies. It's less well understood that horror films can be too. Yes, Jason and Freddy and Michael Myers stalk and terrorize. But at the end of each movie, some final survivor gets to pick up the axe and kill the monster while the audience cheers. More, horror movies often encourage you to identify with the monster itself. Who doesn't get a rush of satisfaction in “Aliens” when the xenomorph devours smug, oleaginous Paul Reiser? Superhero and horror narratives both imagine beings with great power. And it's fun to imagine yourself as having great power, even if that means wearing embarrassing tights or trailing chunks of gore. “Venom” takes the parallels between superhero and horror films and squeezes them into a single gleeful glob of ooze. The movie follows investigative reporter Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy) as he discovers that wealthy mad scientist Carlton Drake (Riz Ahmed) has brought gelatinous alien life forms to earth. Drake is worried that earth is overpopulated and doomed; he hopes humans infected by the alien parasites will be able to survive on other planets. Eddie inevitably gets possessed by an alien named Venom, giving him (you guessed it) superpowers and an appetite for biting people's heads off. The movie grinds through its first half, and takes far too long to get Venom and Eddie together. But once the monster and man do become one, the plot picks up dramatically. Eddie early in the movie loses his job, his fiancé and his self-respect after failing to expose Carlton Drake. He's depressed and useless, living in a run-down apartment next door to a rocker who plays his guitar at ear-melting volume in the middle of the night. Once Eddie is possessed by a demonic toothy alien, however, everything changes. He beats up phalanxes of thugs. He engages in awesome car chases. He even terrorizes his neighbor into turning the music down. Many of the film’s funnier moments involve Eddie and Venom’s internal conversations, in which they essentially argue about whether they're in a superhero film or a horror one. In a deep, guttural, voice Venom keeps urging Eddie to feed on the bad guys. Eat their heads and pile the bodies in a corner, the parasite insists. Eddie, for his part, tries to explain to his symbiote that in superhero stories there are good people and bad people, and you're not supposed to murder the good people. ""How can you tell them apart?"" Venom asks, speaking for horror films in which everybody is guilty, and everybody is eaten. “Venom” ultimately leans much more towards the superhero genre than the horror one. The monster eats a few people's heads, but the movie keeps the gore to a minimum. “Venom” ultimately leans much more towards the superhero genre than the horror one. The monster eats a few people's heads, but the movie keeps the scenes of gore and dismemberment to a minimum. Venom himself actually has a character arc that feels more like a hero than a demon. The alien glop admits that he was a ""loser"" on his home planet. But inspired by Eddie's selflessness and general nobility, he decides to become a heroic glop and fight for what's right by joining with Eddie to try and prevent an alien invasion of earth. Giving a noble empowerment story to a nightmare demon with a Gene Simmons tongue is obviously ridiculous. But it's charming too. Horror movies are sometimes denigrated as violent fantasies which appeal to viewers’ worst sadistic impulses. But “Venom” suggests a less invidious reading. Maybe horror films are really just a chance for people to imagine they're stronger, faster and more effective than they really are. We don't watch horror films because we are filled with hate and rage. We watch them because we all want to be like Venom, that little ichor that could. If ""Venom"" allows us to see the innocuous side of horror films, though, it also points to the toothy maw hidden beneath the superhero narrative's mask. Superheroes are generally careful not to kill people — but deep down do they really just want to tear people's arms off? “Venom” has some of the same queasy charge as Robert Kirkman's Marvel Zombies comics, in which noble characters like Captain America are infected with a zombie plague and murder everyone they hold dear. Spider-Man even eats his beloved Aunt May. With great power comes great appetite. After watching Venom, you half expect superheroics in other films to be accompanied by that distorted monster voice bellowing, ""feed me!"" This is the darker side to the empowerment narrative. There’s nothing really wrong with dreaming about being able to get far above all your troubles, as Venom does when he climbs a skyscraper and looks down admiringly on the city below. But there’s something more insidious about a yearning for dominance, control and satiation. You can want power to right wrongs, or you can want it to revenge yourself on everything and everyone who ever dared to thwart your ambitions. Superhero stories usually focus on the good impulses, but “Venom” suggests the darker ones are there too, crawling around inside. The desire to be the noble savior and the desire to eat everyone are symbiotic, so twined around each other's black tendrils that you can't pull them apart. “Venom” is an indifferent movie. But it deserves some credit for suggesting that inside many heroes lurks a nightmare horror, with teeth."
"Aug 21, 2019",negative,This is one hot mess that will enrage Marvel fans and confuse newbies.
"Aug 8, 2019",positive," Venom admittedly gets off to somewhat of a rickety start, but it’s in these awkward moments that the film lays the groundwork for its unusual overall nature — and very well may lose many viewers in the process. Flawed investigative journalist Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy) isn’t the typical comic book character and centering his conflict on a commitment to exposing hard truths versus remaining loyal to those who love him — in this case, fiancée Anne Weying (Michelle Williams) — may be basic “this or that” Marvel storytelling, but it feels more fleshed out and shaggier (in a good way) than the studio’s usual hero dilemma. On a collision course with Eddie, the crash of a spacecraft carrying important samples, controversial testing by the Elon Musk-like Carlton Drake (Riz Ahmed) and the moral conundrums of Dr. Dora Skirth (Jenny Slate) are developed well enough to propel the story forward and encourage audience investment, and the biology-gone-wild design of the symbiote being tested in the lab is just weird enough to want to see more. Venom really takes off, however, when the titular alien pairs with Eddie. Like Upgrade’s A.I., it speaks to its host and can control his actions — a handy feature when Drake dispatches his army to retrieve his missing specimen. Entertaining fights and chase sequences follow, enacted through slick special effects and steady camerawork under the guidance of director Ruben Fleischer (Zombieland), but it’s the banter between Eddie and the titular visitor that gives the film its distinct personality. The funny, often random things said by each echo a classic vaudeville duo and allow Hardy to display an exciting, awkward comedic side rarely seen from the often serious actor. The chatter is sure to fall flat for plenty of moviegoers, and the sudden appearances of another symbiote’s master plan and a crucial decision by Venom don’t help matters, but an epic climactic battle does, along with the set-up for a sequel with a character more appealing than anyone introduced in an Avengers film tag scene. Charming in its messiness, Venom joins the ranks of Thor: Ragnarok and The Guardians of the Galaxy movies as welcome wackos under the Marvel banner, even though — true to its outsider vibe — it’s technically a Sony product."

A spacecraft re-entering Earth’s orbit has a collision with a comet and crashes into Malaysia. As the vehicle shatters, some of its cargo of alien organisms escapes and finds its way to San Francisco.    In San Francisco, Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy), a successful investigative journalist, overrides his editor’s directive and adopts means fair and foul to tear into interviewee Carlton Drake (Riz Ahmed).    Drake — a billionaire with a God complex — is not a man to take the insult lying down. With the wave of a hand, he destroys Brock’s life. Brock loses his job, fiancee Anne (Michelle Williams) and home.    Luckily for Brock, Venom, the alien squatting in his body, is not all bad. He also has a sense of humour and is willing to adapt to the local culture. Though this is a great set up for some comic moments, it’s anything but funny when Venom takes a physical form – showing his sharp teeth, scaly dark skin, eel-like slithery tongue, unbeatable physical strength and appetite for human organs.    Not all Marvel comic books translate to jaw-dropping, repeat-worthy big screen extravaganzas. It takes a while before one gets accustomed to the tongue-in-cheek humour of ‘Venom’ as hotshot actor Tom Hardy’s body becomes a nesting ground for the alien parasite. Perhaps this origin story would have worked better if it had been more of a pastiche, after all how can you take seriously a creature that announces it’s ‘hungry’ before biting off a bad person’s head?    Hardy holds things together as best he can, and when the sequel comes, it will be interesting to see how Venom/ Brock woo Anne back and how they continue their tenuous co-habitation arrangement.    Director Ruben Fleischer (Zombieland, 2009), amps up the action with a few creative chase scenes and a stylised fight between two computer generated reptilian creatures, but he dials down the IQ. The result is so infantile that you barely care to wait for the mandatory mid-credit Marvel teasers. Unlock a world of Benefits!

"Jul 17, 2019",negative," Ever since Marvel brought Spider-Man into the MCU, Sony has been greenlighting multiple projects starring supporting characters from his corner of the Marvel Universe, creating an umbrella of productions best described as “Spider-Man Without Spider-Man.” Venom, the first and (sadly) most viable of these endeavors, may also be its last. It is, without question, one of the worst superhero films in recent memory, in a crowded landscape where even the pretty good ones feel worthy of eyerolls.  While later stories would see him grow into something of an anti-hero, Venom is one of Spider-Man’s most iconic villains, already having appeared in Sam Raimi’s rightfully maligned Spider-Man 3. But here, the character has been reconceived as a quirky protagonist, the strange center of a world designed, if nothing else, in the hopes that no audience member’s mind will drift to the natural question, “where the fuck is Spider-Man?” So, the action moves from New York City to San Francisco. Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy), instead of being a jock bully, is a pathetic but well-intentioned muckraker. Eddie is engaged to a hot lawyer, Anne (Michelle Williams) and does a second-rate version of his once popular news show, where he uncovers corruption in a city that doesn’t seem to give a shit about his work. Elon Musk-type nutjob Carlton Drake (Riz Ahmed) is obsessed with finding a life for humanity beyond Earth, so one of his rockets comes back with alien life forms known as symbiotes, gross little goo monsters who need host bodies to survive. Eddie tries to expose Drake’s shifty practices, then Drake ruins Eddie’s life, then one of Drake’s aliens possesses Eddie, and you’ve got a makeshift superhero origin story. In almost every way, the film’s generic structure loosely calls to mind the Raimi interpretation of the wall crawler, with its mixture of weird humor and horror, but it lacks Raimi’s coherent vision and his gift for actual filmmaking. It’s also a movie blatantly written by several different people with conflicting aims, because none of the film’s disparate elements line up to form a coherent whole. The dialogue is often terrible, the action messy and even the basics of visual storytelling fail from scene to scene. It feels like a movie from 2003, not 2018, complete with awkward comic book frames culled from Ang Lee’s Hulk film.  Fleischer, since Zombieland, has made nothing but critical and commercial failures, yet gets this cushy gig directing a mega-budget superhero flick anyway? He brings nothing unique to the table and trails the pack of similarly experienced music video helmers turned feature directors. Karyn Kusama was stuck in director jail for ages after Aeon Flux bombed, but given that he’s a youngish white dude in Hollywood, do not expect Venom’s demonstrably poor filmmaking to deter the industry from lining him up another sweet job in a calendar year’s time. That his movie turned out watchable at all is a major testament to his talented cast, each of whom are trying their damnedest with material very much beneath them. Williams deserves some kind of award for transforming her threadbare love interest role with enough chutzpah to feel like a real character, even when that couldn’t be further from the truth. Ahmed, as the film’s villain, is miscast, but he doesn’t let not belonging anywhere near this production stop him from trying his ass off. But really, it’s the Tom Hardy show.  For the film’s doughy first third, his decision to make Eddie Brock so whiny and pathetic is pretty grating, but by the time the symbiote comes into play and he gets to play an over-the-top alien monster that’s equal parts Seymour from Little Shop of Horrors and Eddie Murphy’s Buddy Love from The Nutty Professor, it’s impossible not to be entertained. Had this movie been a little less toothless and not wasted so much time getting to the absurd magic of Tom Hardy talking to himself during an otherwise boring motorcycle chase, it would at least be guilty pleasure territory. Hardy, through sheer force of will, nearly makes the relationship between Eddie and the symbiote seem like a fully-fledged buddy film, a dynamic heavily teased for a sequel that’s unlikely to ever be made.  But outside of the odd thrills to be found in his actual portrayal of Venom, the movie is basically trash, a project destined for a home alongside Catwoman and Elektra in every Bad Superhero Movie listicle to be published until the end of time. Early Water doesn’t have much of an arc — after all, it’s a rehearsal tape. But it does have a surprisingly plentiful array of textures and transitions within its somewhat narrow parameters. "
"Jul 12, 2019",negative," Not every adaptation into film needs to be 100% faithful to the source material. There have been tons of successful works that have changed, combined, or left out major narrative elements of stories and characters that audiences love—but the films work just as well. The two main questions one should ask when watching an adapted film is 1) does it capture the essence or spirit of the original story? and 2) is it a good movie? When it comes to VENOM, directed by Ruben Fleischer, the answers are “kinda” and “no, it is not.” While there are moments that honor the inherently silly X-Treme nature of the Spider-Man antihero’s ’90s origins, far too often it is a boring, uninspired piece of cinema that fails to engage or do anything truly entertaining. Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy) is an investigative reporter that loses his job and his fiancée, Anne (Michelle Williams), when he decides to look into the nefarious underbelly of billionaire Carlton Drake (Riz Ahmed). Months pass and Brock finds himself once again investigating Drake’s shady dealings, this time as it relates to fatally exposing homeless subjects to extraterrestrial creatures known as “symbiotes.” When Brock and Venom, one of the symbiotes, merge, they must work together to survive, escape Drake’s army of cronies, and foil the mad corporate titan’s ultimate evil plan. There were a lot of possibilities in telling VENOM—multiple directions that filmmakers could go that would make the movie stand out. It could be an ultraviolent antihero story where the protagonist rips through the city, inflicting pain to many in gruesome ways, but ultimately stopping a greater evil. Or VENOM could’ve been a superhero tale via a weird cerebral body horror story in which Brock and Venom fight over control of the body and explore the weird ways they interact to fight off others. There are a myriad of other possibilities—but instead of something distinct or new that would involve combining various genres, Fleischer and company deliver a completely bland superhero origin film. The action is pedestrian, there are no character arcs to speak of, the comedy is easy (though sometimes winning)—there is nothing that truly works well in VENOM. Hardy is employing a weird, mush mouth New York accent (his character is from NYC but the movie takes place in San Francisco). He is dedicated to acting foolish and out of sorts as he freaks out about the alien parasite bonding with his biology. But there isn’t a lot for him to do, with dialogue or action or really any defining character traits. Brock goes from a flawed do-gooder that occasionally does the wrong thing for the right reasons to….a flawed antihero that occasionally does bad stuff in the pursuit of doing good. There is no growth, no lesson, nothing; at best there’s an awkward (but intentionally funny) scene where Venom makes Brock apologize to Anne. It doesn’t pay off in any way and doesn’t lead to anything at all, but it’s a feigned attempt at showing some sort of change. Too much of VENOM is lethargic and feels lacking any sort of charm or energy. There are a few intentionally funny moments that work, but there are also just as many unintentionally funny moments that are pretty funny (lots of serious glancing and awkward phrasing that provides a glimpse of the ludicrous movie it could’ve been). Ultimately, it is a forgettable film that doesn’t properly entertain and feels completely unnecessary. For those looking for a good movie about a charming but flawed bearded white dude working with a presence in his head to take out scores of bad guys, see UPGRADE.

"Jul 10, 2019",negative," Lo que ha hecho Marvel con su universo de superhéroes tiene un mérito increíble. Sus películas gustarán más o menos, pero ha tenido la capacidad de construir algo que conecta entre sí de forma bastante natural y además ha conseguido que el público acuda en masa a verlas. Es lógico que los demás quieran seguir sus pasos, pero cuesta hacerlo cuando no tienes los ingredientes necesarios para hacerlo, algo que no ha impedido a Sony intentarlo. Es verdad que Sony tuvo que llegar a un acuerdo con Marvel para relanzar una vez más a Spider-Man en la gran pantalla, pero también que el estudio llevaba un tiempo intentando explorar el universo del trepamuros a través de otros personajes. La primera consecuencia de ello ha sido ‘Venom’, una cinta con un guion desastroso y un director incorrecto para potenciar sus virtudes, que alguna tiene. Hay tantas cosas que no funcionan en ‘Venom’ que creo que lo más adecuado es intentar dar con la raíz de sus problemas e ir tirando. Lo primero que llama la atención es que la naturaleza del personaje poco menos que exigía una película orientada al público adulto que no se cortase lo más mínimo en términos de violencia y que también diera barra libre a su protagonista para usar un tipo de lenguaje poco presente en los blockbusters. En la propia película se ve que se está intentando estirar al máximo los límites que imponen la decisión del estudio de recibir una calificación por edades más favorable en Estados Unidos, pero lo que eso provoca es un problema de tono tremendo, ya que por un lado no quiere ser una película de superhéroes al uso -ahí llama la atención que tanto narrativa como visualmente recuerda más a propuestas previas al nacimiento del universo de Marvel-, pero tampoco se decide a ser nada en concreto. Eso lleva al guion a un callejón sin salida que además se potencia en un lamentable tratamiento de personajes. Es obvio que la estrella es Tom Hardy y que eso debía notarse, pero reducir a Michelle Williams a mera comparsa y la forma de abordar las motivaciones del villano son penosas -y mejor no hablemos del resto…-. Sobre esto último conviene apuntar que hay un par de momentos en los que Riz Ahmed parece que va a encarrillarlo, pero pronto naufraga todo. Tampoco ayuda tener detrás de las cámaras a Ruben Fleischer, un realizador que nunca ha sabido cómo manejar una película para compensar sus debilidades. Tan pronto algo resulta espectacular como marea al espectador durante las escenas de acción, mientras que su manejo de la emoción, el suspense o cualquier cosa que se le parezca sí que es digno de situar a ‘Venom’ como uno de los puntos más bajos del cine de superhéroes reciente. Estoy convencido de que Tom Hardy es un gran actor y que cualquiera debería sentirse afortunado de poder contar con él en una película. Precisamente a él le debemos que no odiemos directamente a Eddie Brock antes de que comience realmente la acción. Aquí vuelvo al pobre tratamiento de personajes, ya que ‘Venom’ construye a su héroe como un cabezón un tanto despreciable que ni siquiera ayuda a una conocida cuando está en una situación de peligro. Muchos actores hubieran sucumbido a ello y a nosotros ya nos daría igual que en realidad esté luchando contra un mal mayor, pero Hardy mantiene cierta cordura en todo esto precisamente hasta el momento en el que cree que se la ha ido la cabeza porque escucha la voz de Venom en su cabeza. Lo que de entrada parece el mayor disparate de todos acaba convirtiéndose, aunque a veces sea de forma no intencionada, en lo mejor de la función. Esa dinámica que se establece entre Brock y Venom nos regala momentos bastante divertidos, a veces por cómo segunda reacciona ante la actitud del primero y en otros casos porque todo resulta tan ridículo que te acaba entreteniendo. Puestos a maquillar la personalidad del simbionte, casi hubiera agradecido que todo resultase ridículo, porque caminar entre dos tierras le sienta fatal. Es cierto que no es para nada algo que esperase de una película de ‘Venom’, pero ahí está la diversión que la película nos había negado hasta entonces y depende de nosotros abrazarla y pasárnoslo bien o simplemente decir que menudo desastre estamos viendo. Luego llega la escena post-créditos y nos deja con curiosidad por lo que puede salir de ahí, pero, por favor, que cambien de director y guionistas si la secuela finalmente se hace. O que Sony apueste por un enfoque para adultos. En definitiva, ‘Venom’ está en todo momento al borde del precipicio y tiene tantos puntos débiles que nunca jamás se la recomendaría a alguien, pero también hay algo ahí que acaba funcionando probablemente de forma accidental que evita que se hunda en la categoría de títulos como ‘Catwoman’. Pese a todo, la decepción es enorme para lo que pudo ser."
"Jun 18, 2019",positive," Everything is weird and stupid lately, so why should movies be any different? At this point, why not have a movie about a Spider-Man villain without Spider-Man in it? Sure, go ahead and let Tom Hardy do a 112-minute audition for Benecio Del Toro’s Secret Society of Actors Who Give Every Character a Drunken Cartoon Voice. What’s that, Jenny Slate and Riz Ahmed want to be in it? Fine. But she has to play a lady-scientist whose character name is one letter away from “Dr. Skirt,” and he has to basically be Elon Musk with actual charisma. Oh, and add in loads of very muddled gay subtext in the relationship between Hardy and his CGI costume that is actually a sentient space alien. Venom is an almost irritatingly fun total catastrophe. If you can endure the wretched and boring first hour, wherein everyone involved briefly pretends this is a regular movie and not one where Hardy will eventually converse with a monster coming out of his butt, the last half is a willfully silly spectacle that is oddly satisfying. It’s enough to make you wonder if the whole thing could have been legitimately great if it wasn’t for the transparent studio interference and a hobbling PG-13 rating. Frustratingly, Venom has an incredibly thin plot that was spaghettied into being annoyingly time-consuming during the editing process. Eddie Brock (Hardy) is a hip, cool journalist who is obviously beloved by millennials because he does video reports while wearing Johnny Depp’s bracelets. Carlton Drake (Ahmed) is a hip, cool billionaire who is attempting to get alien creatures that one of his rockets found to bond with human beings. Drake’s lead scientist, Dr. Dora Skirth (Slate), is troubled by the fact that Drake’s experiments are killing tons of homeless volunteer test subjects, so she gets Brock to investigate. Of course he accidentally bonds with one of the aliens, which gives him crazy powers. The alien also talks to him inside his mind, often eats people’s heads and turns Brock into an 8-foot-tall creature with a 3-foot-long tongue. With the help of his ex-girlfriend, Anne (Michelle Williams), and her hilariously patient new boyfriend, Dan (Reid Scott), Brock becomes the anti-hero known as Venom. Please insert franchise dollars to continue. If you don’t have a good time watching Hardy slur-mumble in Brooklynese as he talks to a gooey alien that “emerges from his body,” that’s fair. For those of us who prefer captivating oddness, the more preposterous director Ruben Fleischer’s film gets, the more an R-rated cut of Venom seems kinda fantastic. Honestly, a thousand wacky body-horror/rom-com/superhero sendups before one more stale and “grounded” comic book origin story, please. Venom is a narrative nightmare in which every scene feels rushed. And yet, by the power of slimy black tentacles, possessed dogs and children, and Hardy’s fearless lunacy, it is a wickedly watchable experience. Despite a class-clown Rotten Tomatoes grade and conservative projections, remember who told you this will be a tongue-heavy French kiss at the box office. Hooray?"
"Jun 3, 2019",neutral,"a surprisingly generic, listless film, filled with poorly rendered CGI effects and painfully tin-eared dialogue."
"May 21, 2019",positive," I walked out of “Venom” with the dopiest smile on my face. It’s slightly disorienting that “Venom,” which in its promotional materials leans in heavily, too heavily, on its dark-action-oriented premise, is least effective when it works at being a superhero/action movie. Of course, “Venom” is an anomaly. Despite being based on a Marvel Comics’ character, Venom is not part of the extended Marvel Cinematic Universe from Marvel Studios (that includes last year’s “Spider-Man: Homecoming”), but rather the first in what’s expected to be a series of Sony-produced Marvel-inspired films that include the characters from the Spider-Man Universe, except for Spider-Man, who is currently part of the extended Marvel Comics Universe. (The battle between Sony and Marvel battling for rights to Spiderman is as fascinating as it is confusing, buoyed by ambiguous statement from Sony’s Amy Pascal and Marvel Studios’ Kevin Feige as to whether or not Venom is part of Holland’s Spiderman Universe.) So, who exactly needs “Venom” in a superhero world already overwhelmed by the exploits of Marvel’s Avengers and DC’s Justice League? What does Sony have to contribute to the superhero film genre? It’s that difficulty of placing the purpose of “Venom” in a larger scale that I suspect has had so many scratching their heads, trying to identify a point to it all. Except, it is this outlier quality of “Venom” that the film effectively harnesses to deliver a superhero that is perhaps less effective at being a superhero, but it is relentlessly rewarding at being something else altogether. For “Venom” works best not when measured in the comic book ethos but as a chaotic and bizarre and relentlessly personable shaggy dog of a comedic character study. For that dopey smile I mentioned earlier? I can’t think of another live-action superhero film that ended on just the right beat to emphasise its casual humour rather than its real-world import. “Venom,” the film, and Venom, the character, depend on the leading man – Oscar nominee Tom Hardy. Hardy plays Eddie Brock, perhaps the most regular person he has portrayed on screen in at least a decade. He is an investigative journalist, known for his politically charged pieces, and he finds that he cannot keep the personal away from the private when he betrays the trust of his fiancée in an attempt to deliver a hit-piece on the bioengineering mogul Carlton Drake.  Brock’s entire life is pulled out from under him and at his lowest point – both professionally and personally – the symbiotic life-form Venom enters the picture. Venom is one of four such life-forms from space that end up on earth for nefarious reasons, and through an unlucky twist of fate, Eddie Brock becomes the unwitting host for one of them. Whatever you think of “Venom”, Tom Hardy’s performance is a weird sort of marvel in the context of the film and his career. The film depends on him in an aggressive way that is only matched by the Sam Raimi Spider-Man films as far as recent superhero films go in my memory. Even as the machinations of Riz Ahmed’s Dr Drake take up a great deal of the narrative (Hardy doesn’t appear until ten minutes into the film, for example), everything subsequently depends on Hardy and it’s either to Hardy’s credit or my incredibly idiosyncratic taste that this is possibly the most I’ve enjoyed watching him on screen. This is not the visceral manliness of his work in “The Revenant” or the seductive elusiveness of his tiny role in “Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy;” instead, in a mix of fitful irony, the increasingly anxious and paranoid Eddie Brock and then Brock as played by Venom allow for Tom Hardy to deliver one of the loosest and most naturalistic performances of his career. Also, reader, he is funny. It’s the funniness that caught me off guard, for even at his best Hardy exudes a quality of seriousness that seems less inherently funny and more amusing after the fact. The gruff demeanour of his Bane in “The Dark Knight Rises,” for example, is cripplingly pseudo-serious but has a delightful memeable quality to it that makes it work in retrospect. But here, Hardy is fun, funny and incredibly moving in my favourite performance in a comic book film this year. Certainly, the film is less certain of itself, and yet I’m suspicious of the somewhat viscerally negative reaction to it. “Venom” is decidedly low stakes on world building but its structural stiltedness seems charming in a strange way as it argues for the value of the homeless, and ruminates on our destruction of the world on a global scale that feels idealistic and warm, even amidst the body engrossing hosts that seem out of a very 90s horror picture. I tend to be charmed by the sincerely frenetic despite myself, and “Venom” is very much chaotic and frenetic, but tonal symmetry seems pointless in the world the film represents – a world that is destroying itself for no real purpose. And even as “Venom” flirts with romance, horror, and social realism, it is its comedy that keeps it most firmly planted in reality. There’s a plot-defining kiss that occurs late in the film that mixes horror, humour and romance in a way that would be difficult to explain without seeing it. In theory it is almost aggressively ridiculous, and yet if you’re willing to suspend your disbelief, there is a slightly childlike sincerity to it that becomes irresistible. Just like the film."
"May 15, 2019",negative," Director: Ruben Fleischer
Summary: When Eddie Brock acquires the powers of a symbiote, he will have to release his alter-ego ""Venom"" to save his life. It's been almost twenty years since the 1-2-3 punch of Blade, X-Men, and Spider-Man and while those movies are good in their own way, the genre has changed a lot in that span of time. Of course it has, because that is the way of things (tastes change, as does the various forms of cinematic language that are used to construct these films). Unfortunately, it seems that Sony and all of the people involved believe that time has stood still, and they can keep doing the same things that worked back then today and it really does not work. The entire movie feels like a blast from the past in the worst possible way. The tone is all over the place with moments that are supposed to be funny, and other moments where the audience will break into hysterical laughter. Even when it's really a moment that was supposed to be serious. The tonal yoyo-ing makes it hard to take anything seriously, and every moment that is supposed to emotionally resonate falls flat. There is a ton of set up at the beginning and it throws the pacing off. It makes the first act feel overly long, the second act is all over the place, and the third feels rushed. The movie makes the mistake that the earlier superhero movies did – taking no time to develop the villains. There isn't any reason to care about Riot. His motivations are simply ""I am a comic book villain 101"" while Riz Ahmed is utterly wasted as Carlton Drake. We see that he has motivations and we understand why he is doing what he is doing, but there isn't any moral ambiguity to him. He might be talking about doing the best for humanity, but we also see him sacrificing people and not even blinking. It is a waste of a performance and by the time Riot gets involved no one cares and it makes no sense. Then there is the problem of Venom himself: he is just not very interesting. Half of the movie is star Tom Hardy reacting to a voice that we can barely understand, and a bunch of jokes that only work maybe half of the time. Venom tells Eddie to do things like apologize to Annie or do anything like character growth. At one point Venom says that it has changed but it's all tell and no show. In fact, Venom literally says ""I have changed"" and we are supposed to take it at face value. Then the is a big emotional moment toward the end that ends up falling completely flat because we haven't had enough time with Eddie and Venom to believe they have any sort of connection. The movie, once Venom gets involved anyway, takes place over the course of a day or two. Much like movies that try to make us believe a romantic relationship that rushes to the finish line this movie does the exact same thing. That dynamic between Eddie and Venom is the backbone of the movie and it is broken. Venom is a bad movie but it is bad in a way that feels lazy and unfocused rather than rage inducing. You'll wonder if you watched a movie that came out twenty years ago rather than today and then promptly forget about it a few hours later."
"May 7, 2019",positive,"From the comic book nods, to the amazing battles, and on point CGI - comic fans will love Venom. A few plot holes & some humor is a miss, but overall a super fun movie!"
"May 1, 2019",neutral," The road as of late for Venom hasn’t been the smoothest to travel. The trailer failed to live up to the expectations of salivating fans, and those hoping it would follow in the footsteps of Deadpool and Logan by embracing its more adult classification were bitterly disappointed when it was announced the film would be catering to a more general audience. So now that it’s here, where does one stand? Feeling like a product ripped straight from the cinematic scene of 2004, Venom is immensely flawed, packed full of cheese and occasionally hokey effects, and far removed from any of the grandeur achieved within the Marvel Universe…but that doesn’t mean it isn’t fun. After an uninspired turn from Topher Grace in the much maligned Spider-Man 3 (2007) the character of Venom hardly left an impression, so it’s safe to say that an actor of Tom Hardy’s ilk feels like a vast casting improvement. Re-imagining Venom as more an anti-hero as opposed to a straight villain, director Ruben Fleischer (Zombieland) and screenwriters Jeff Pinkner (The Dark Tower), Scott Rosenberg (Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle) and Kelly Marcel (Fifty Shades of Grey) have fun letting the reins loose on the character’s more playful nature, which in turn allows Hardy to completely unhinge and run the performance far from the grounds of reality. Prior to Venom taking front and centre, it’s reporter Eddie Brock (Hardy) that the film focuses on, showcasing his will to break any news story regardless of the consequences. His latest target is smarmy Carlton Drake (Riz Ahmed), a millionaire doctor of sorts who is planning space travel and has been involved in a series of mysterious deaths due to his questionable experiments. Drake’s been successful in spinning positive PR for himself but Brock isn’t buying it, and when he learns about wrongful death claims he intends to corner Drake in a bid to evoke an admission. Losing his job and his fiancee (Michelle Williams) as a result of the unauthorised interview, Brock’s life begins to spiral out of control, but after being approached by a whistleblower working for Drake, Dr. Dora Skirth (Jenny Slate), he comes into close contact with a Symbiote that’s been brewing in Drake’s laboratory, essentially transforming him into an alien-like form who is near-invincible and has a thirst for eating humans. Sounds delightful, right? The dark, more violent tone that was expected of the film in its initial stages is evident throughout some of the story beats – namely Venom’s lust for eating human flesh and Drake’s relentless experiments on the homeless – and whilst it’s violent in nature, there’s next to no actual bloodshed on screen, and the eventual jokey tone the film adopts leaves Venom to play out like an over-the-top creature feature that embraces its sense of humour. This isn’t masterful storytelling, but it would appear the film is aware of itself (or I’d like to believe it is) and is enjoying its ridiculous mentality. There’s a messy, 1980’s vibe about the film that will undoubtedly irk a lot of devoted comic fans, but for the uninitiated and those who have lowered their expectations, Venom could very well entertain with its nonsensical temperament and surprising comedic tone. Though far removed from even the more middle-ground Marvel titles (Iron Man 2 and Thor: The Dark World for example) Venom still holds as passable entertainment value, even if for nothing else than being inexplicably fascinating due to its uneven mentality of an R rated story watered down with tween-friendly shtick. Hardy is having an absolute ball, and the mental unbalance he displays throughout could very well be worth admission alone. This won’t convert comic book film naysayers, nor please the faithful masses, but when most productions within the comic realms are taking themselves seriously, it’s difficult to not be a little charmed by a title that seems to just not care about its perception. Journalist Eddie Brock is trying to take down Carlton Drake, the notorious and brilliant founder of the Life Foundation. While investigating one of Drake’s experiments, Eddie’s body merges with the alien Venom — leaving him with superhuman strength and power. Twisted, dark and fueled by rage, Venom tries to control the new and dangerous abilities that Eddie finds so intoxicating."

 ★★★1/2
Father Gore is admittedly not a huge fan of comic book movies, but a huge comics lover. A few of the Marvel movies are downright fantastic (ex. Captain America: The Winter Soldier is a favourite) whereas some others are just a series of set-pieces with CGI designed to usher audiences from one movie to the next on a factory line. Often it’s the movies willing to be different, even weird, which stand out. Venom is, at its worst, incredibly messy, though at its best it’s fun, slightly horrific, and an accidental slice of superhero socialism. Tom Hardy’s Eddie Brock is less morally sketchy than in the comics, allowing the character, and in turn the story, to take a definitively moral stance against the slick-talking, meek-looking banality of evil that is late capitalism. The screenplay takes a dollop of Marxism and adds it to societal fears about outer space, cramming everything into a strange comic book flick. Listen, if you were looking for a site to either trash this movie or put it up on a pedestal: keep looking. Father Son Holy Gore is a place for critical theory. Many of the articles here aren’t ultimately about movies being objectively good or bad. This wasn’t an amazing movie in a lot of ways, though it has exciting things to offer.
Venom‘s story – the screenplay written by Kelly Marcel, Jeff Pinkner, and Scott Rosenberg – encompasses our fears of what space exploration could reveal. Namely we’re concerned with being top of the universal food chain. Symbiotes represent the possible terror that venturing into space will irreparably change us on a fundamental level, symbolic of human narcissism in believing ourselves galactic apex predators, untouchable by all other species’. The symbiote attaching itself to Eddie acts as an element of body horror confronting these anxieties in our postmodern world. Suddenly what’s outside our world becomes a part of it— what was alien becomes us. Because the symbiote can’t survive on Earth without a human host, its essence suggests there’s an element of its monstrosity not actually alien to us after all. The animalistic, violent, and uncontrollable aspects of the Venom symbiote posit these are innately human aspects buried deep below our seemingly evolved surface. Several great moments between Eddie and Venom are shown similar to the relationship between a schizophrenic and the voices speaking to him, and they’re hilarious. They double as unsettling moments illustrating Eddie’s reluctance to accept this dangerous and volatile part of human nature. When the symbiotes are deliberately used for villainous purposes, other societal fears emerge.
 Likewise Carlton Drake’s (Riz Ahmed) exploitation of the symbiotes is representative of the Venn diagram where capitalism and technocracy collide. Again the postmodern state of a Western capitalist society drives our fear. Drake uses economically disadvantaged people tossed to the wayside of society – namely the homeless – for “human trials” in the name of “scientific breakthrough.” Drake, as Brock puts it, has built an empire on “dead bodies.” He’s the embodiment of capitalism at its nastiest core: using the lower classes to make capital, their blood providing the grease to keep the world’s wheels turning. Carlton fittingly mentions fake news to Eddie, before turning around and ruining the journalist’s life over truthful allegations. It’s not hard to see the Drake-Brock rivalry as a reflection of the current sociopolitical climate with President Dementia in the White House. Drake is (figuratively) scarier because he’s a technocapitalist – an actual smart man – posing as someone looking to help humanity make scientific advancements when he’s only concerned with making money and moulding himself in the image of God. In one scene, Drake’s overseeing a test subject’s body receiving a symbiote, which he hopes will create an entirely new species. He sees himself as God, only better, remarking to a lab tech how humans were made with “such poor design.” Eddie’s body horror struggle with Venom is a perfect microcosm of the working class struggle, in that the symbiote causes him to become alienated from himself— exactly what Marx saw as one of the effects of capitalism. In the beginning of the movie, Eddie represents the many casualties mowed down genuinely trying to affect change an unjust world. Although he becomes alienated from himself, he’s able to embrace the symbiote – in a sense, one of the Life Corporation’s means of production – and defeat him.
 Venom‘s body horror and its outer space/technological thrills pull together all the anxieties we face living amongst a postmodern society in which corporations control space travel and its advancements, human beings are experimented on in the same cruel way as poor animals are today, and every level of society’s rotten with corruption. In order for Eddie to regain any sense of control/power, he must ironically give his mind and body to the symbiote. Drake, as capitalist, literally becomes a monster because of his heartless manipulation of other humans, whereas Eddie’s able to retain his humanity and co-exist with the symbiote. This is a fun movie, giving in to its darker themes while never losing sight of its foolish excitement, either. Hardy’s a huge reason why this is so enjoyable. If not for his charisma and the obvious fact he’s having a blast acting as Eddie+Venom, this wouldn’t be half as engaging. Plus, there are wonderful, if not accidental socialist themes that creep in through a critical engagement with the screenplay. Others are going to think it’s crazy. Such is the subjective journey through cinema everybody takes on their own. You’ll never convince Father Gore one of the screenwriters isn’t a fellow Marxist. (Yeah, you read it right.)"
"Apr 16, 2019",negative," Most superheroes have a secret identity. But Venom might be unique in that he's in a constant fight with his secret identity, as normal guy Eddie Brock is taken over by a viscous, vicious murder machine from outer space that only he can hear. when he accidentally bonds with a very hungry alien symbiote called Venom. It's only the latest blow for Brock, who lost his fiancée and his job when he stumbled onto the nefarious plans of a Silicon Valley tech billionaire. and the pair make an entertainingly deranged odd couple. One highlight involves Hardy causing a scene in a restaurant, a hilarious moment of slapstick lunacy that deserves to be remembered alongside The Blues Brothers, Scarface and other great restaurant-based causing-a-scene scenes. but the delirious double act really begins to sing when Venom's own personality emerges, suggesting the slurping symbiote is more than just a straightforward nasty alien. Whether dispensing surprisingly sound relationship advice or revealing unexpected motivations for bonding with Brock, the quirky symbiote has the makings of a genuinely funny foil for its human host. who in turn seems content to run a high-tech, highly illegal lab that anybody can apparently wander in and out of. But this isn't the kind of movie where you pick apart the logic -- this is the kind of movie where you just roll with the B-movie shenanigans. The opening of Venom straight-up rips off the opening of Rampage, previously the dumbest movie of the year. Why would you do that, Venom? Did you see the Rampage guys around town and they were all sad they made the dumbest movie of the year, so you were like, ""Hold my beer""? It's no Infinity War, but Venom delivers flashes of Saturday night silliness when the unhinged human-alien two-hander are onscreen. Like Eddie Brock himself, the movie is fairly unexciting until the bad guy pops out."
"Apr 9, 2019",neutral,"It often feels like the bad ideas are methodically consuming the good ones - not unlike the symbiotes themselves - but if you can stay awake through the dreadful first hour, there's definitely some fun to be had."

"Apr 2, 2019",neutral," En medio de un mar de críticas, se estrenó Venom, la más reciente historia de origen de un superhéroe -o supervillano- marvelita. Venom, como bien sabrán, es uno de los más populares némesis de Spider-Man y una figura profundamente querida por todos los que crecimos en los ochenta y noventa leyendo los cómics del amigable vecino neoyorquino. Desde que empezaron los rumores sobre la película, la emoción de los fans crecía: ¿Venom arrancando cabezas? ¿El director de Zombieland al frente del proyecto? ¿Tom Hardy como Eddie Brock? ¿Un elenco completado por Michelle Williams y Riz Ahmed? ¿Posibilidades de ver a más simbiontes? ¿Tal vez a Carnage? Todo esto sonaba maravilloso. Sin embargo, la relación de Venom con los fans no ha resultado idílica. Los que odiaron la película tienen razones de sobra para justificar su enojo, pero hay comparaciones que no son justas: esta cinta no es peor que Daredevil, Elektra, Fantastic Four o el bodrio de Catwoman. Venom es una mala película, con fallas en el tono, en la dirección, en la fotografía, en el terrible guión y en los efectos. Pero lo que en realidad frustra de esta cinta es que nos hizo creer que podíamos esperar algo diferente. Venom está inspirada en las historias de origen del personaje, allá en los ochenta, que nacieron de las polémicas mentes de David Michelinie y Todd McFarlane. Claro, hay una cosa esencial que cambia en el nacimiento del personaje: por cuestiones de derechos, Spider-Man no aparece en este universo. El origen de este Venom no está, entonces, relacionado al hombre araña: no fue Spider-Man el que trajo al simbionte, por error, a la tierra, no fue Spider-Man el que expulsó al simbionte con campanas y no fue Spider-Man el que creó un enorme odio resentido en Eddie Brock. El hecho de que Spider-Man no aparezca aquí motivando el encono de Brock modifica toda la historia de origen del personaje (como pudieron notar en los trailers, Venom no tiene la araña blanca en el pecho). Ahora, el origen de los simbiontes está en la ambición paranoica de Carlton Drake (Riz Ahmed), uno de los villanos de Lethal Protector, que busca salvar a la humanidad del apocalipsis mudando a todo el planeta al espacio exterior (a diferencia del cómic, en donde crea refugios para magnates). En una de sus búsquedas en el espacio, un equipo de la nefasta Life Foundation de Drake (que amalgama a Steve Jobs y Elon Musk en versión muy malito) se encuentra con un meteorito lleno de vida y, por la maldita curiosidad de los magnates de Silicon Valley, lo acaba trayendo a la tierra. Pronto se va a dar cuenta de que estos seres son simbiontes, es decir organismos que necesitan de un cuerpo huésped para sobrevivir. Al comprender las implicaciones que esto puede tener para nuestra supervivencia en el espacio, Carlton Drake comienza a experimentar con seres humanos. Pero los simbiontes son caprichosos y no siempre resulta su fusión con nuestros organismos. Sin importar las consecuencias, Drake y su Life Foundation matan a sujetos de prueba escogidos entre los parias de la sociedad como si fueran conejos. Desde este punto de vista, vemos la inspiración esencial que esta película toma de Lethal Protector y la necesidad obsesiva que tiene Venom por proteger a los más desprotegidos. En efecto, en la miniserie de cómics de 1993, Eddie Brock se afana por defender a indigentes refugiados en el subsuelo de San Francisco frente a los intereses capitalistas de empresarios de enorme cupidez. Así , tomando inspiración del cómic, vemos en la cinta cómo Eddie Brock intenta confrontar a Carlton Drake, a pesar de todas las advertencias de sus productores. Al intentar desafiar a un hombre tan poderoso, Brock termina perdiendo su trabajo, posibilidades futuras, a su futura esposa (Michelle Williams) y, en general, toda la agradable vida que tenía (y aquí vemos el origen del personaje truncado hacia un odio contra Drake en vez de un odio hacia Spider-Man). Frustrado y solo, Brock decide seguir la pista de una doctora (Jenny Slate) que trabaja con Drake pero que se opone a la brutalidad de la Life Foundation. Al escabullirse al laboratorio de Drake, Brock entrará en contacto con un simbionte. Enfermo, asustado e incrédulo por la locura que está viviendo, Brock tendrá que impedir que la megalomanía de Drake acabe en una enorme invasión de extraterrestres. Mientras, deberá hacer las paces con su demonio interno y sobrevivir a las ocurrencias cada vez más sádicas que le obliga a hacer el hermoso monstruo mejor conocido como Venom. Como vimos, entonces, el argumento de la cinta es una mezcla de Lethal Protector (en la aparición de Carlton Drake, los otros simbiontes -en particular Riot- y en la idea de Eddie Brock como protector de los inocentes) y Planet of the Symbiotes (por la amenaza apremiante de una invasión alienígena), además de una relación muy pequeña y torcida con las primeras historias de origen del personaje. Así, Venom no es una película particularmente apegada a los cómics a pesar de preocuparse constantemente por hacer una interpretación respetuosa de los personajes. En todo caso, se nota la enorme diferencia frente a la terrible idea de Sam Raimi y Spider-Man emo. Gracias al señor. En esta cinta, Venom es un personaje muy cuidado y diligentemente realizado. Olviden el debate estéril sobre los efectos especiales. En ciertos momentos, es cierto, el póster horrendo le hace honor a la película y parece que estamos viendo más un inexperto juego de video que un blockbuster de verano. Pero los efectos especiales pueden resultar irrelevantes ante una buena creación de personaje. Aquí, el diseño no es malo y Tom Hardy hace todo el resto para rellenar los huecos de la postproducción. De entrada, el actor inglés actúa las dos voces que conforman la dualidad de Venom: actúa el acento americano de Brock y la refinadísima voz profunda de Venom (que llega a ser hasta amable y diligente en su tono sádico). Con esto, entendemos la complementariedad de los dos personajes -y también su diferencia-, observamos el crecimiento de Venom y de la relación simbiótica y llegamos a momentos particularmente emotivos. Cuando Venom, por ejemplo, se sincera sobre la existencia que lleva entre la sociedad de los simbiontes, un personaje particularmente terrorífico se convierte en algo mucho más profundo, tridimensional, emocionalmente cercano: Venom, como todos nosotros, es también un paria y un perdedor. Mientras conectamos emocionalmente con un monstruo alienígena incomprensible (que ya es un logro en sí), es imposible no reírse con la relación del simbionte y el humano. Es aquí en donde está el verdadero valor como director de Ruben Fleischer (que ya nos había mostrado sus habilidades para la comedia en ese clásico instantáneo que fue Zombieland). Porque Hardy se vuela la barda con una interpretación profundamente histriónica y física que recuerda un camino medio entre Marlon Brando y el Johnny Deep de Pirates of the Caribbean. Eso puede sonar terrible, pero de hecho funciona (y no hay nada más bello que escuchar al simbionte llamarle “pussy” a Brock por no querer saltar de un edificio). En cualquier caso, el personaje de Venom fue trabajado con gran énfasis por el director y el actor principal, fue cuidado en el diseño y más o menos realizado a la altura de lo que queríamos en la postproducción. El problema de esta cinta es que, tal vez, en todo este esfuerzo por darnos un Venom que valiera la pena, se les olvidó hacer algo de valor con todo el resto. Hacer un recuento de los errores de esta cinta es un poco fútil. Así que me gustaría abarcarlos, más bien, desde el pésimo guión y la pésima realización. Primero, el asunto con el guión es que hace un esfuerzo extraordinario para darle algo de coherencia a una premisa completamente alocada. El origen de Venom no es algo fácil de tragarse como evidente; es una locura espacial en la que se involucran otros superhéroes, hijos del simbionte, rayos sónicos, científicos locos, asesinos descarnados y un largo etcétera. La idea de este guión era respetar el origen del personaje mientras le daban un giro coherente al hecho de que Spider-Man no iba a aparecer en ningún momento en la cinta. Y digo, más o menos lo logran (a pesar de que nos hubiera gustado más que Sony hubiera hecho la relación con Life para ganar una profundidad que fueron incapaces de dar aquí). Pero, después, el equipo de tres guionistas (que entre todos suman maravillosos logros de escritura como The Dark Tower, The 5th Wave, The Amazing Spider-Man 2, Kangaroo Jack y Fifty Shades of Grey) tiraron todo por la ventana. Al concentrar los esfuerzos narrativos en los ricos intercambios entre Eddie Brock y Venom, los guionistas se olvidan completamente del mundo que los rodea. Y todo pasa entonces por rápidas frases de explicación contextual que no tienen ningún sentido y una construcción apresuradamente burda de personajes secundarios. Gracias a eso y a la torpe dirección de Fleischer, los esfuerzos de enormes actores como Michelle Williams, Riz Ahmed, Ron Cephas Jones y Jenny Slate quedan totalmente desperdiciados. Todo esto se diluye aún más si observamos de cerca la ridículamente caricaturesca encarnación de Carlton Drake por Riz Ahmed; un actor que puede llegar a profundidades impresionantes y que aparece aquí como una contraparte chaparra del pésimo villano de Bond, Elliot Carver (Jonathan Pryce), en Tomorrow Never Dies. La paranoia de los mega empresarios iluminados no nada más se está convirtiendo en un cliché fácil sino que está volviéndose cancina. Aquí, para colmo, el final del personaje, como todas sus motivaciones en la cinta carecen absolutamente de sentido (¿por qué ataca al simbionte con explosivos si no lo quiere dañar? ¿Por qué piensa que es más fácil salvar a la humanidad con un traje de extraterrestres que con inversiones ecológicas? ¿Por qué piensa que una invasión alienígena va a salvar la tierra cuando todo le indica lo contrario? ¿No era un genio este vato?). Y aquí llegamos a nuestro segundo punto: la realización. El guión, en sí, lucha por mantener un balance adecuado entre la solemnidad requerida de Carlton Drake y el alivio cómico constante de Brock y Venom. Pero Fleischer nunca logra hacer coincidir la necesidad de comedia con la acción, el desgastante esfuerzo de los actores por darle profundidad a personajes mediocremente escritos con la fluidez de la trama, la seriedad con el peligro. Para colmo, los productores se esforzaron enormemente en darle el PG-13 para poder retacar las salas de niños. Me dirán que esto es inconsecuente y que no se necesita sangre para hacer una buena cinta de superhéroes. De acuerdo, pero explíquenme la necesidad de cautivar a un público infantil que no creció leyendo a Venom frente a las hordas de millennials consumistas que deseaban una película brutal de este personaje. ¿Por qué no apostar por lo que tan bien le resultó a Deadpool? ¿Por qué decidieron adoptar el camino mediocre y seguro de Suicide Squad? En esta cinta, el personaje de Venom constantemente habla de mutilaciones, decapitaciones, homicidios y nunca vemos nada. La violencia se sugiere y se evita, sin ninguna elegancia, para dejar un vacío molesto. Porque, al no retratarse la violencia como lo exige el guión, nos quedamos sintiendo que todo esto está sanitizado. Hay algo de la suspensión de la incredulidad que se pierde y, en serio, la película sufre por la falta de violencia gráfica. Aunado a esto, la fotografía de Matthew Libatique (un cinematógrafo que ha hecho trabajos impresionantes con Aronofsky y, más recientemente, con Bradley Cooper en A Star is Born) es bastante torpe. Para una película constantemente a oscuras, los contrastes son terriblemente deficientes y la acción recreada en postproducción con un atasque de GGI es confusa, al punto del aburrimiento. Al final, incluso, en la pelea central que definirá el destino de la tierra, pelea en la que se enfrentan Riot y Venom, los golpes se ven tan turbios, tan borrosos y tan mal definidos que en poco tiempo dejan de importarte. ¿Todo esto quiere decir que la cinta de Venom es una basura al nivel de Catwoman, Elektra y Daredevil? En lo absoluto: comparada, incluso, con Batman v Superman -y no lo digo por mi corazón marvelita- esta película es respetable. El asunto aquí no es lo mala que sea la cinta, porque creo que, en una producción de superhéroes, la mala factura y el guión torpe pueden superarse. El asunto aquí es que Venom merecía mucho mucho más. El camino por el que comienza a ir la cinta, la gran representación del personaje principal y el interés que despierta la rarísima actuación de Tom Hardy, se van al traste por las deficiencias de un director que, tal vez, no estaba listo para el tamaño de esta responsabilidad. Si Aquaman resulta ser un bodrio, lo puedo entender (digo, ¿qué más se le puede pedir a ese personaje en el agónico DCEU?); pero es imperdonable que Venom, con tantas posibilidades, con todo lo que nos importa, acabe con este resultado tan confuso y tan mediocre. A pesar de una dirección deficiente, de la absoluta falta de imaginación en la fotografía, la postproducción y el guión, de desperdiciar a un gran elenco y arruinar la posibilidad de explotar un gran personaje, Venom no es tan terrible como la pintan. Hay momentos verdaderamente interesantes en la relación de Eddie Brock con el simbionte, hay momentos inspirados de comedia y grandes posibilidades para una película mucho más interesante que esta. Lo terrible aquí es que, con tanta hermosa ñoñería y posibilidades cinematográficas reales, pudieron darnos una gran versión de un personaje entrañable. Lo que duele aquí no es lo que hay, sino lo que pudo ser."
"Mar 25, 2019",negative," IT IS such a let-down when you so badly want a badass anti-hero like Deadpool, but end up being served a hot mess called Venom.  You are not sure if this movie is supposed to be a drama, horror, or comedy, and that is one of the reasons Venom will not resonate with many people. Despite having some great talents involved, the film lacks any sort of depth to make it memorable. It begins with a rocket crashing into the jungles of Sibu (woo hoo!), and the paramedics discovering one of the scientists onboard still alive. Turns out the rocket was carrying some alien life-forms, and one of them has gone missing. You kind of expect what happens next, and this particular alien parasite thingy starts moving from body to body. We are then introduced to Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy), a committed investigative journalist who seems to be enjoying a good career and also a great life with his lawyer girlfriend, Anne (Michelle Williams). Given a simple assignment to interview genius inventor and billionaire Carlton Drake (Riz Ahmed) for a public relations-type segment for his channel, Eddie decides to pose some very hard questions about some controversial experiments that Drake’s company has been carrying out. With no proof to back his claims, Eddie gets fired and also loses his girlfriend after he not only breaks her trust but gets her fired from her job as well. Months later, a completely down-on-his-luck Eddie is approached by Dr Skirth (Jenny Slate), a scientist who works for Clayton. Appalled by Clayton’s human experiments with the symbiotes (aka alien life-forms which were taken off a rocket), she sneaks Eddie into the lab but Eddie ends up getting infected instead. When Clayton sends his goons after Eddie, the symbiote – which has become one with Eddie – unleashes havoc. The best parts of the film are obviously in the trailer, while Eddie’s constant wisecracks (not as enjoyable as Deadpool’s) during tense scenes are neither funny nor necessary. The actors try to do their best with their roles, but it is a pity that Riz never got to utilise his considerable talents fully. There are two post-credit clips, one of which shows there are plans for a sequel. Maybe the studio executives should consider waiting until they see how well (or badly) this does at the box office."
"Mar 21, 2019",positive,There's a lot of fun to be had if you go in and turn your brain off and go with it.
"Mar 5, 2019",negative," So apparently we’re now watching comic book movies where the hero bites off people’s heads. And it’s funny and cool because he also eats Tater Tots, okay? And the movie totally deserves a PG-13 rating since it’s not terrifying for kids at all or completely disgusting for adults. It’s edgy, right? Like Deadpool is edgy. So shut up and laugh or whatever. Septic shock is the only acceptable reaction to Venom, a pitiless, strangely dark dry-heave into the perpetually-expanding Marvel Cinematic Universe. Except this is an alternate universe to the actual MCU, where lots of Spider-Man’s bad guys exist without the hope of Spider-Man ever appearing, because he belongs to another corporation. It’s intellectual property, but not very intellectual, and the property’s cheap. VENOM ★ (1/5 stars)
Directed by: Ruben Fleischer

Starring: Tom Hardy, Michelle Williams, Riz Ahmed, Scott Haze, Reid Scott
Running time: 112 min.  
Bay Area news reporter Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy) becomes unsuspecting host for the titular monster, an insecure outer-space parasite with a deep inner voice that looks like black latex phlegm and sounds like a wannabe James Earl Jones. “Back on my planet, I was kind of a loser,” he huffs. Guess what? You’re a loser on Earth, too, Venom. It’d be nice to say that Hardy, a fine actor, is actually given a chance to act. But he’s basically just a Looney-Tunes punching bag. Dude is flung through windows, rammed against brick walls, thrown from a motorcycle in mid-collision, and forced to slide down the side of the Transamerica Building. “Pussy,” laughs his parasite. Up yours, parasite. Venom is on Earth because of ersatz Elon Musk visionary Carlton Drake (Riz Ahmed), whose Life Foundation has been combing the galaxy for superior life forms called Symbiotes so they can fuse with human beings and turn them into homicidal dicks. Otherwise capable actor Ahmed clearly realizes that his villain character is dead inside, so he’s cut his losses by going on glassy-eyed performance auto-pilot while screeching “Launch the drones!” and “Find my Symbiote—now!” Speaking of Symbiotes, this movie has more than just Venom: there’s also Riot and She-Venom and a post-credit tease for somebody named Carnage. They travel from body to body, giving us joyless visions of an old Malaysian grandma shuffling away from heaps of corpses and a little blonde girl staggering blithely through airport terminals and high-security skyscrapers. (Wait—how does the girl not get noticed by anyone? Oh, fuck it, who cares.) Multiple Oscar nominee Michelle Williams is in this hot mess, too, doing her level best with dialogue like “Oh, no! I just bit that guy’s head off!” Her special skills include being Brock’s ex-girlfriend and also the ability to find a volume knob anywhere and deliver intensely loud high-frequency noises. The movie ends with a pact to keep up the cannibalism—but only with very bad people—and also hints at a possible interspecies Devil’s Triangle. Because kids are watching and it’s a Marvel movie. Oh, and Woody Harrelson is Carnage. So you can look forward to that. Stephen Garrett is the former film editor of 'Time Out New York’ and has written about the movie industry for more than 20 years. A Rotten Tomatoes certified reviewer, Garrett is also the founder of Jump Cut, a marketing company that creates trailers and posters for independent, foreign-language, and documentary films."
"Feb 25, 2019",neutral," So I haven’t done one of these mini-review posts since August. Honestly I have been so busy with both of my podcasts I haven’t had much room to breathe lately! My Hallmarkies Podcast just keeps growing each week and I am so primed for the massive Countdown to Christmas season (starting in October!). I have also done some really interesting things on my personal podcast Rachel’s Reviews including monthly Talking Disney podcasts and Obscure Animation with my friend Stanford, Animated News posts, previews and wrap ups with my friend David and various podcasts with another friend Conrado. Talk about false advertising! I’m someone who really enjoyed 47 Meters Down so I like a silly shark movie but this was just boring and bland with hardly any of the fun moments promised in the trailer. It made the fatal mistake of taking itself seriously which made the terrible dialogue stand out because I couldn’t laugh it off as silly fun. What a disappointment! Very entertaining film with strong performances especially by Adam Driver who has to play the racist as a Jewish man. Some of the choices feel self-indulgent and are a bit distracting but overall a really interesting/thought provoking (and even funny) movie. Lana Condor is super charming as the lead character Lara Jean in this perfectly pleasant teen romance. However, is it one of the best high school movies ever made as some have said? HECK NO! If we think about the truly great high school movies more than just the lead grows and changes. The boys in this movie are just there to do LJ’s bidding. Someone like Josh in Clueless had dreams, ideas, thoughts of his own. Not so much here. That said it’s perfectly harmless. I did not like director Masaaki Yuasa’s film Lu Over the Wall from earlier this year. It made me nauseated watching it and the cute moments felt very derivative of Miyazaki’s Ponyo. Fortunately, I felt the opposite about this film. It is completely bonkers so it won’t be for everyone but I enjoyed it. It’s basically about a female college student who goes on a giant bender and the crazy things that happen to her. Along the way the animation is so bright, colorful and inventive and the story is random but very fun. It even evolves into a musical at one point and you know I love that. This movie is pretty terrible. The director seemed to have a strange fascination with the lead taking off her shirt and wearing super short skirts, and the camera lingered on her in ways that made me uncomfortable (she’s supposed to be underage for goodness sakes). Also, her ‘friend’ was the worst. He was completely selfish and even claims ownership of her at a point and the screenplay never calls him out on that. This Deutch/Thompson family collaboration had moments, and I’d be very interested to see what they do next as I feel there is a lot of potential (obviously they all have chemistry). Unfortunately, the script was just too uneven for me to recommend. Most of the humor falls flat and it didn’t go anywhere interesting or charming. Some people will describe this as a Stranger Things copycat and they would be right but I think it is a pretty well executed copycat. It definitely has nostalgic elements so if that isn’t your thing than you won’t like it but I enjoyed it. The boys all have chemistry and the mystery was fun. It definitely gets a little gory by the end but I thought it was a good little horror movie with some genuine scares. This movie is about a billion times better than it has any right to be. I joked that it is like The Revenant for teens but about a nice person. Kodi Smit-McPhee is practically a one man show and he is does a fantastic job. The cinematography and music are tremendous. I really enjoyed it and would watch it again if given the opportunity. As a Hallmark movie fan you’d think I would love a movie like this but I did not! The leads are very charming but the script was vulgar and unpleasant from start to finish. These kind of movies work because they are light and fluffy entertainment. You don’t want unending sex jokes and cynicism in a movie like this! Because I wasn’t enjoying the romance, the stereotypes were tough to ignore especially a gay character that felt right out of 1995. I will try to find time to write a legit review about this soon but for now this 4th attempt at telling this story is surprisingly decent. The chemistry between Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga is fantastic and the singing is amazing! For once a modern musical has good singing and great songs! All the supporting work, particularly Sam Elliott, is tremendous and I was invested despite it being a story I’ve seen many times (not just in the previous iterations but in movies like Walk the Line). Still it is proof a formula story isn’t necessarily a bad thing if it is executed well and this is. This movie was really strange. Everything from the messaging, to the story, to the weird musical choices, to the bloated voice cast was odd. It was kind of interestingly odd but I don’t think I’d ever want to watch it again despite it having some nice animation. Whoever said this is as bad as Catwoman probably hasn’t seen Catwoman in a long time. It definitely is a big mixed bag but not one of the worst superhero movies ever. The main problems is all the supplementary characters to Venom/Eddie are lame and it’s 30 minutes too long so a lot of it drags. However, there are fun parts with some inventive action and humor that worked for me. Tom Hardy is pretty good and I’d be open to seeing a sequel where they could iron out the bugs. I can’t really recommend it but it’s not awful. I think A House with a Clock in its Walls is the only one of these movies that I’d wanna see that I haven’t already. Venom’s definitely not as bad as Catwoman – everything about Catwoman was awful while Venom does have a few good things about it (Venom’s design, Eddie and the symbiote’s interactions). But I did find it a disappointment after the later trailers and clips were looking promising."
"Feb 13, 2019",negative,"  Up until Avengers: Infinity War  in April this year, the Marvel Cinematic Universe managed to successfully up the ante with every release. Then came Ant-Man and the Wasp  which, while exceedingly entertaining, couldn’t quite whet the excitement Infinity War  created. The latest comic book character to get a stand-alone film is Venom — a Sony release ‘in association with Marvel’ which exists in a separate universe — an anti-hero with a heart of gold.  Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy) is a reporter intent on taking down Carlton Drake (Riz Ahmed). The latter, a filthy rich inventor, is the founder of The Life Foundation who’s using homeless people to explore the symbiosis of alien organisms and humans. In a twist of fate, the symbiote from outer space, Venom enters Eddie giving him superpowers.   While Venom  takes almost the first half of the film to pick up, when it does, it has its few thrilling moments. That said, without Hardy, it would have nothing going for it. It’s the British actor’s nervous, diffident vibe that separates his disposition from the alien within him. He alone injects the extremely sparse humour into a tepid and predictable screenplay. And it’s Hardy’s chemistry with the ‘parasite’ within that supplies most of the entertainment. Supporting characters remain forgetful right till the credits roll: case in point Michelle Williams as Brock’s love interest.  Unfortunately, director Ruben Fleischer fails to maintain a grip on the film’s tone and flavour — oscillating between dark and bland — often leading to very confusing and incongruent feelings. Though, he deserves a hat tip for the single extremely brilliant fight sequence between hero and villain and their respective symbiotes. Even the film’s soundtrack can’t rouse audiences to get the adrenaline pumping. The otherwise talented Riz Ahmed as Drake, the film’s primary antagonist also fails to impress or in this case intimidate audiences. As a villain who’s lost the plot on his way to saving the world, Ahmed ends up flat and unidimensional. That’s perhaps because writers Scott Rosenberg, Jeff Pinkner, and Kelly Marcel fell short of succinctly blending together proper character development and an origin story. Venom  is a treat only because of Hardy but try as he might (he does very much so), the actor cannot shoulder the disappointing film.  Comments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

"Feb 10, 2019",neutral,"Though Tom Hardy is game and the ""friends with Venefits"" shtick is fun and clever, the overall story is too messy and cornball for the combination of the two to stick the landing."
"Feb 7, 2019",negative," There’s a line in Venom about a “turd in the wind” that seems tailor-made for angry critics. But to use it in a review would give the screenwriters too much credit. It would be easy to blame all the film’s problems on its troubled production. Originally envisioned as an R-rated answer to the likes of Logan and Deadpool, it’s clearly been hacked to pieces for the sake of reaching a wider audience. Plot holes have been widened until a bus could pass through them; characters make huge decisions seemingly at random; and the few meagre (and oddly bloodless) action beats would give even Michael Bay a headache.  Tom Hardy has complained that his favourite 40 minutes ended up on the cutting-room floor, but this one won’t be saved by a director’s cut: the badness goes right down to the bone. Venom comes from the early-2000s school of superhero movies, where everyone wore black and the only acceptable facial expressions were scowls. Everything, from the cringe-inducing dialogue to the awful Eminem single that plays over the credits, feels specifically designed to please a particularly unpleasant specimen of teenage boy. There are brief, manic flashes of what might have been. Hardy gives an unhinged performance even by his own unique standard, and what little amusement there is to be had comes from watching him frown in puzzlement as he performs inhuman stunts. He’s the only person having any fun. Riz Ahmed wears the defeated look of a promising actor watching his career stall before his eyes, while Michelle Williams and Jenny Slate can barely disguise their boredom. Venom is an appalling trainwreck of a film; a bad idea, executed poorly in an attempt to make a quick buck. Come back, Justice League – all is forgiven. Phil is a copywriter from Sheffield with an unhealthy addiction to Lotus Biscoff cookies and Henderson's Relish (though not at the same time, that would be weird). When he's not writing, he spends his time fruitlessly trying to convince people that The World's End is the best movie in Edgar Wright's 'Cornetto Trilogy'."
"Jan 31, 2019",negative," Venom is not a bad movie, it’s just not the movie most people were expecting. From the trailers, it looked set to be a rather sinister and scary interpretation of the Eddie Brock-Symbiote dichotomy, offering a sort of Jekyll & Hyde dynamic, but the final movie turned out to be more of a buddy comedy and that’s disappointing. The character is one of Marvel Comics most legendary villains, an iconic adversary of Spider-Man who has kept the web-slinger on his toes since the ’80s, but it wasn’t until the Symbiote bonded with Eddie Brock that it truly became the superhero’s worst nightmare. Even the moniker given to Brock’s alter-ego reflected the venomous tabloid stories he was writing after being fired from the Daily Globe, an incident he blamed on Spider-Man. For years, Venom tried to kill Peter Parker, both in civilian and superhero form, but with Spidey out of the picture, much of the storylines focused on the duo’s antihero antics, like in Venom: Lethal Protector, which is what Sony’s movie is based on. Sadly, in the transition from page to screen the character becomes a hero too quickly, leaving out much of the villainous traits that he’s famous for, which is a shame considering who is playing the role. Tom Hardy has a penchant for peculiar characters and so often we’ve seen him bring an intensity and nuance to his roles, especially those that err on the more Machiavellian side of caution. It made sense that he was cast as this dual Marvel character, but he would have done a better job if he was allowed to bring out the darker sides of both Eddie and the alien parasite. The Symbiote feeds off of Brock’s hatred for Spider-Man but also the man himself.  Remember, this is a parasite who is simultaneously making the body it attaches to both stronger but weaker too. It’s a terrifying concept, but the film doesn’t push hard enough to showcase this or the lack of moral code that Venom brings to proceedings. And even without Spider-Man as a target, the writers could have still focused Brock’s vengeful, murderous attitude on another character like Carlton Drake or even Anne’s new boyfriend. The same problematic interpretation can be seen in the X-Men franchise. Many fans were disappointed (and still are) with Jennifer Lawrence’s portrayal of Mystique who is far more antagonist than heroic protagonist in the Marvel Comics. On screen, Raven pretty much always ends up being the hero – this is Fox seemingly trying to cash in on Lawrence’s Hunger Games popularity – thus retconning her villainous persona established by Rebecca Romjin in the original trilogy. One could argue that Lawrence should have been cast as Emma Frost instead as at least the source material corresponds with a transition from supervillain to superheroine, but that’s a whole other matter.  With Venom, there’s no denying that he has become an antihero on the page and with Spider-Man out of the picture for Sony’s Cinematic Universe (right now) the Lethal Protector route was a far easier direction to go in, but that hasn’t made for a better film. If they had amped up the darker, cannibalistic side of Venom contending with a more tortured and jaded Eddie Brock, making the movie focus on the issues of that relationship – rather than doing the knee-jerk ‘end of the world’ narrative we’ve seen so many times before – it would have paid a better homage to both classic and contemporary iterations of the character as well as be more convincing. Sony themselves have come up with some great Spider-Man villains in Willem Dafoe’s Green Goblin and Alfred Molina’s Doc Octopus, bringing to the screen the human side of these bad guys that have been reflected in the MCU universe too. Erik Killmonger, Hela and Thanos are nuanced villains that are victims of their own background and/or warped sense of morality.  Elsewhere, Punisher and Deadpool are great examples of the super-antihero that has been brought to life without sacrificing the violence or moral ambiguity they are known for. And there’s a reason why Logan is considered the best Wolverine movie, and for some the best Marvel one too, because it was allowed to showcase the real brutality of the iconic character and he doesn’t pull his adamantium punches. Maybe if Sony trusted the audience more to embrace this kind of character they could have empathised with the Eddie Brock-Venom dynamic that comic book fans have for years. And it’s not like we haven’t seen this type of split personality done well on screen already. Leigh Whannel’s Upgrade is a tense, gritty and violent thrill ride that tells the story of a quadriplegic who is taken control of by an ominous computer program after a chip is implanted in his neck. Then there’s M. Night Shyamalan’s Split which showcases James McAvoy’s 21 distinct personalities (seven we meet) that scare, charm and creep you out in equal measure.  Both movies show that the lead can be likable but it doesn’t mean the film has to end with them on a heroic pedestal. They can lose, or their bad side survives, and the audience is still satisfied with the results. As the comic book movie genre expands and studios look to more than just superheroes to lead their output it’s important that they remember this. Obviously, Sony had an angle for where they want Venom to go, the mid-credit scene pretty much confirms that, and with rumours they are hoping to have him cross over into Spidey territory at some point one can understand the sanitised version they put out. But we’re talking about this film, this establishing of an iconic Marvel character and it seems too many variables have led to a shallow antihero that doesn’t hold up to Fox or Marvel Studio’s offerings. Zendaya finds herself in a love-triangle in sports-drama Challengers from Call Me By Your Name director Luca Guadagnino. Here's everything we know about it so far."
"Jan 30, 2019",negative," When Screen Junkies released their Honest Trailer for Avengers: Infinity War a few months back, they described Spider-Man’s role in the film as essentially being “the boy who’d rather hitch a ride into space and die than stay home and be in Venom”, and to be honest, they weren’t far off the truth. Spidey dodged a massive bullet when it comes to this particular film, since despite having a new lease of life thanks to his inclusion in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the recent Into the Spider-Verse animated flick, Sony still acts like the desperate studio that wants to launch their own Cinematic Universe, even though they fell flat on their faces last time they attempted this trick with the terrible Amazing Spider-Man duology. Their pitch this time is having a universe that involves Spider-Man-centric characters but is completely removed and disconnected from Spider-Man and his world. What we have with Venom is an origin story that bears no resemblance to his comic book history and mythology that’s hugely connected to Spider-Man – already there you’re losing his motivations and why he’s called Venom in the first place! Instead, Venom goes for a completely different origin that involves generic evil corporations and secret experiments that go wrong, along with plenty of forced conveniences and plot contrivances along the way. To be fair, a solo Venom movie could’ve worked (at least a good one!), but the last thing anybody wanted was a Venom movie made by Avi Arad, Matt Tolmach and Amy Pascal, a Venom movie that takes place in a universe where Spidey doesn’t exist and, most of all, a Venom movie that was essentially made in order to screw over both Marvel and their MCU. Yet that is what we got and, sadly, this schizophrenic misfire makes Spider-Man 3 look like Citizen Kane. Venom is a cobbled-together trainwreck that Sony constructed as a means to try to catch up with Disney/Marvel’s MCU without putting any real time or effort into making it functional or coherent in any way, shape or form. There is a clashing of tones in this film from one scene to the next, with the first 40 minutes or so being this very bland, drawn-out prologue with long exposition scenes (the dearth of drama) and dull character moments that don’t make that much impact – in the end, you don’t even care whether or not Eddie Brock is going to get his job and girlfriend back. In fact, Eddie has no character development in this film at all, since he starts the movie as an arsehole and ends as an arsehole, making his character completely flat. Each minute of the prologue feels long and ponderous – with some really bad editing – and once Eddie bonds with the alien symbiote and transforms into Venom, all of a sudden the film becomes this incredibly goofy, awkward, ridiculous black comedy. It goes from being an increasingly boring movie to being a very bizarre and stupid one, where we have a wet and sweaty Tom Hardy puking his guts out, making weird sounds, eating live lobsters in water tanks at a public restaurant, and making out with his symbiote. It’s such a bizarre mixture of tones that Venom feels like the perfect successor to The Amazing Spider-Man films, almost to the point where you begin to wonder whether or not this was originally intended to be a spinoff to those films. Apart from Tom Hardy and his awkward performance, Michelle Williams is sorely underused in a thankless role, while Riz Ahmed is very miscast as the cold CEO businessman that acts like a cardboard cutout baddie with clichéd, generic motivations. Even though the translation of Venom in both voice and design on screen is brilliant (but it’s still annoying that he has no white spider symbol!), the rest of the CGI is very rushed and corny to look at (especially during the motorcycle chase sequence). It’s quite hard to see at times, particularly during the climactic battle between Venom and Riot, which appears to be nothing more than a CGI sploosh-fest. The action sequences are also a real let down, since they are choppily edited and completely bloodless despite the fact there are people getting their heads chewed off and spat out, which makes you wonder if the filmmakers involved were trying to make an R-rated flick but were constricted to a PG-13 by Sony. It’s a real shame since director Ruben Fleischer has made notable movies in the past, like the amazing Zombieland, the middle-of-the-road 30 Minutes or Less and the mediocre Gangster Squad, but this is easily his worst film to date as it’s everything a movie shouldn’t be: boring. This feels more like a Sony cash-grab than a true Ruben Fleischer film, and it’s pretty shocking that acclaimed screenwriter Kelly Marcel was involved with rewriting Scott Rosenberg and Jeff Pinker’s screenplay. Sure, some of the interactions between Eddie and Venom are nicely played, but does that matter when the rest of the film is so lacklustre? If you want a great recent Spider-Man related film from Sony, then just check out Into the Spider-Verse. It’ll give you more happiness and joy than this will!"
"Jan 29, 2019",positive,"The Venom relationship isn't swoon worthy, but it's actually a whole lot of fun."
"Jan 28, 2019",negative,"Jenny Slate, kudos to you for getting one of those superhero movie paychecks. If only this film were worthy of your talent..."
"Jan 28, 2019",positive,"Takes what it has, runs with it and bounces around within its parameters to mostly engaging effect."
"Jan 28, 2019",negative," An entertainingly skittish performance by Tom Hardy keeps  things lively, but Venom falls short  of the bar raised by other Marvel fare, thanks to mediocre filmmaking and a  refusal to push the boundaries. When it comes to adapting Marvel’s anti-hero characters  to the big screen, a crossroads has emerged: either honour the tone of the  character and risk losing a younger demographic. Or, neuter that character in  service of creating a more “accessible” product. Venom firmly belongs to the latter. Venom stars  Tom Hardy as Eddie Brock, an investigative journalist who is fired from his job  after ruffling the wrong kind of feathers in his attempted expose of bioengineering  CEO Carlton Drake (Riz Ahmed), whose discovery of alien symbiotic lifeforms  leads to illegal human experiments. One of the Symbiotes – known as Venom –  infests and bonds with Brock, as an at first reluctant partnership turns into a  deadly union.  It is Hardy’s portrayal of Brock which is the films  strength. Charmingly skittish and even funny at key moments, Hardy brings a  unique energy to the proceedings, propping up what is in many ways a generic  VFX laden superhero movie that could – and should – have utilised that Keven  Feige (Marvel Entertainment CEO) magic, just as Spider-Man: Homecoming did last year. The interplay between Hardy’s Brock, and his alien Symbiote virus  turned alter ego, is quite fun. Yet the films inconsistent tone (swaying from  superhero cartoon to one-man buddy comedy), along with some truly bad  supporting turns (a miscast Michelle Williams the lowlight), results is a truly  farcical example of what this genre of movie can do.

"Jan 22, 2019",positive,"If nothing else, it's a mostly fun monster movie that proves Tom Hardy can put on any mask and shine through."
"Jan 19, 2019",neutral,"It's too much of a stretch to say Venom is ""good,"" but it's certainly not terrible, and maybe worth seeing for Hardy alone."
"Jan 9, 2019",positive,"The action is not bad, and as rubber-stamp superhero films go, it's adequate."
"Dec 27, 2018",negative," Incluso si nos obligamos a creer que puede haber una película de Venom sin Spider-Man, el primer spinoff del simbionte es un debacle por donde se lo mire. Los avances y los penosos efectos visuales habían anticipado que estábamos ante un fracaso similar al de Spider-Man 3 (Sam Raimi, 2007) y aquella espantosa encarnación de Topher Grace como Eddie Brock, y aunque Tom Hardy le hace más justicia al personaje – esto es lo más flojo que se ha visto del británico desde ¡Esto es guerra! (McG, 2012) –, la película es tan inconsistente, tan retrógrada en cuanto a la evolución del cine de superhéroes, que remite al abismal reboot de Los 4 Fantásticos (Josh Trank, 2015). Eddie Brock (Hardy) es un reportero que va directo al grano. Al tanto de las prácticas inhumanas de la Fundación Life, Brock denuncia a su desalmado director ejecutivo, Colton Drake (Riz Ahmed), durante una entrevista televisiva, lo cual provoca que él pierda su trabajo y que su prometida, Anne Weying (Michelle Williams), sea despedida de la firma que iba a defender a la Fundación de las acusaciones. Mientras Drake experimenta con humanos cuando un asteroide trae consigo simbiontes al planeta, Brock es contagiado por uno que tiene sus propias motivaciones (y un gran apetito) llamado Venom. Sin embargo, cuando Drake experimenta consigo mismo para ser el huésped de Riot, otro peligroso simbionte, ambos acuerdan ir al espacio para traer a los demás a la Tierra. A partir del fracaso de The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (Marc Webb, 2014), la desesperación de Sony los llevó a considerar películas dedicadas a los Seis Siniestros (una super-agrupación de villanos) y, no estoy bromeando, la Tía May. Poco tiempo después se conoció que el estudio colaboraría con Disney y le devolvería los derechos del universo de Spider-Man, pero eso no los detuvo de querer desarrollar un spinoff de su némesis,Venom. Más allá de los mediocres efectos visuales y que el villano de turno sea un espejo de Venon (el final recuerda mucho al último acto de Hulk: El hombre increíble) con una motivación ridículamente grandilocuente – y trilladas – como la de “salvar a la humanidad”, el spinoff fracasa desde un nivel más elemental. En teoría, el montaje debería arreglar los errores de una película, pero ese no es el caso en Venom, pues además de contener escenas inconexas que no guardan relación entre sí, el montaje hace que el libreto luzca aun peor. Narrativamente hablando, Venom es un desastre con inconsistencias tonales, no sólo por cómo está montada, sino porque es una película que camina sobre los pasos de otras en las que un personaje atraviesa una transformación. Asociar Venom al horror corporal (algo por lo que el legendario David Cronenberg se dio a conocer) o ir al extremo de levantar una comparación entre la relación de Brock y el simbionte con la del Dr. Jekyll y el Sr. Hyde es darle mucho crédito a una película que reúne lo peor que el género puede ofrecer: humor forzado y una excesiva dosis de acción. Eso sin contar líneas como “excremento en el viento”. Es refrescante ver que una película de superhéroes se sitúe en San Francisco, pero es imperdonable ver desperdiciados a Tom Hardy y Michelle Williams. Al igual que otras películas del género, Venom no añade absolutamente nada, pero lo peor es que se sienta como un completo retroceso."
"Dec 22, 2018",negative," DARK OF THE SUN (1968). Based on the best-selling novel by Wilbur Smith, Dark of the Sun appears to have been one of the first films to cash in on the landmark success of the previous year’s Bonnie and Clyde in allowing more violence to make it onto the screen. This is a startlingly brutal movie, with Rod Taylor and Jim Brown cast as two mercenaries who agree to rescue a group of civilians trapped deep in the Congo by rebel forces while also taking time to locate and retrieve a stash of diamonds. Taylor’s Bruce Curry is only in it for the money, while Brown’s Ruffo is fighting for his country; those under their command include Wreid (Kenneth More), a perpetually soused doctor, and Henlein (Peter Carsten), a former Nazi who’s not above murdering small children. Much of the action takes place aboard a train, although the two most jolting set pieces are set on terra firma: a chainsaw battle between Curry and Henlein, and the African rebels’ capture and slaughter of a group of civilians. Released in the UK as The Mercenaries and filmed in Jamaica rather than on the African continent, Dark of the Sun was directed by Jack Cardiff, who helmed a handful of films over a two-decade span but was better known as a cinematographer for over 70 years (including an Oscar win for Black Narcissus). Blu-ray extras consist of audio commentary by filmmakers Larry Karazewski (Ed Wood co-scripter) and Josh Olson  (A History of Violence scripter) and film buffs Brian Saur and Elric D. Kane, and the theatrical trailer. FORTY GUNS (1957). “May I feel it?” “Nuh uh.” “Just curious.” “Might go off in your face.” “I’ll take a chance.” As powerful rancher Jessica Drummond asks U.S. Marshal Griff Bonell if she may fondle his phallic pistol, it’s clear that the double entendres will continue to fly at a fast and furious pace in writer-director Samuel Fuller’s rowdy Western saga. The great Barbara Stanwyck stars as Jessica, whose status as an Arizona territory’s most prominent citizen is reinforced by the fact that she has 40 gunslingers constantly at her beck and call. Barry Sullivan, no match for Stanwyck but managing to hold his own, plays Griff, who rounds up criminals with the assistance of his brothers Wes (Gene Barry) and Chico (Robert Dix). His latest assignment requires him to arrest one of the 40 cowboys in Jessica’s employment, although even more dangerous than this desperado is her own hotheaded brother Brockie (John Ericson) as well as a sniveling sheriff (an excellent Dean Jagger) who’s as cowardly as he is corrupt. CinemaScope productions in the 1950s generally cried out for eye-popping color, but Fuller’s offbeat Western instead unfolds in black-and-white, lending the film a suitably nitty-gritty feel that adds extra depth to the unexpected bursts of brutality scattered throughout. Blu-ray extras include a new interview with Fuller’s widow, Christa Lang Fuller, and daughter, Samantha Fuller; a 1969 audio interview with Fuller; and 2013’s A Fuller Life, a feature-length documentary (directed by Samantha Fuller) in which various filmmakers and actors (including William Friedkin and Mark Hamill) read passages from Samuel Fuller’s memoir. THE HAPPYTIME MURDERS (2018). A clever concept — people and puppets living side-by-side — gets off to a roaring start before eventually losing its way in this adults-only effort directed by Brian Henson, son of the late Muppets creator Jim Henson and a Muppet veteran in his own right. The plot concerns the stars of the vintage television sitcom The Happytime Gang being systematically murdered by an unknown assailant. Phil Philips (Bill Barretta), a disgraced puppet cop now working as a private eye, becomes personally involved with the case, meaning that he must again join forces with his former partner, Connie Edwards (Melissa McCarthy), to solve the mystery. Along the way, Phil visits a porn shop specializing in such titles as Little Kitties with Big Titties, gets reacquainted with an old (human) girlfriend (Elizabeth Banks) who co-starred on The Happytime Gang, and receives invaluable assistance from his loyal receptionist Bubbles (Maya Rudolph). This begins as a meaningful message movie, as puppets are treated by many humans as second-class citizens and subject to frequent instances of police brutality. Unfortunately, any interest in social criticism gets chucked out the window as the movie continues, with all subtext completely abandoned as the filmmakers become increasingly interested in only offering vulgar gags. Some are quite funny while others are quite flaccid, though there’s no telling which gags will work for which viewers. For example, a restaging of the Sharon Stone no-panties scene from Basic Instinct allows audiences a peek at puppet pudenda — if that strikes you as the height of hilarity, then knock yourself out. HORROR OF DRACULA (1958). Boxers or briefs? Beer or wine? The Beatles or Elvis? And Universal or Hammer? That last query is a particular tug-of-war among film aficionados who lean toward either the Universal monsters from the 1930s and 1940s or the Hammer horror from the 1950s and 1960s. Personally speaking, it’s Universal now and forever … with one major exception. Universal’s 1931 Dracula is a bona fide classic that benefits from Bela Lugosi’s iconic performance and a terrific opening act set in Transylvania, but the picture creaks badly once the action moves to London for the second half. Hammer’s Horror of Dracula, on the other hand, is a mesmerizing achievement from start to finish, with director Terence Fisher, writer Jimmy Sangster, and stars Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee managing to produce a picture even better than the previous year’s Hammer legacy jump-starter, The Curse of Frankenstein. Lee’s Dracula is arguably the most sexual bloodsucker ever seen on screen, a suave and debonair aristocrat who nevertheless exhibits pure animalistic lust in those moments when the blood hits his nostrils. Matching him beat for beat is Cushing, registering as the best Professor Van Helsing cinema has ever gifted us. This film further showcases the finest directing of Fisher’s career, particularly in the terrific climax. Known only as Dracula in its UK homeland (it was renamed Horror of Dracula in the US to avoid confusion with the Lugosi version), this was successful enough to spawn eight sequels, six of which are already available on Blu-ray (including 1972’s Dracula A.D. 1972 and 1973’s The Satanic Rites of Dracula, recently reviewed here and here). THE JERK (1979). Steve Martin was already known for his Grammy Award-winning comedy albums and his guest-hosting stints on Saturday Night Live when he elected to co-write and star in The Jerk, a sizable hit that became one of the top 10 grossing movies of 1979 (just above the James Bond adventure Moonraker and The Muppet Movie, the latter featuring Martin in a cameo appearance). In viewing stupidity as an endless source of comic invention, The Jerk seems to be the missing link between the Jerry Lewis comedies of the 1960s (some of which were hilarious, some of which were anything but) and the dumb-and-dumber comedies of the 1990s (nearly all of which were awful, including The Stupids, Jury Duty, and, yes, Dumb and Dumber). Basically a series of skits that are barely tethered to a plot, this works better than expected, thanks primarily to Martin’s infectious performance in the central role of Navin Johnson. Because he was raised since infancy by a black farm family, Navin is shocked when he’s finally told that he is in fact white. Electing to head out into the world for the first time, he decides to journey to St. Louis, whereupon he lands a job at a gas station run by the kindly Mr. Hartounian (Jackie Mason), becomes the boy toy of a tough biker woman (Catlin Adams), and falls in love with the sweet if simple Marie (Bernadette Peters). Middling stretches are easily bailed out by bits that remain comic gold, among them the phonebook scene, the cameo by director Carl Reiner (who would make three more pictures with Martin), the snail sequence, and Shithead the dog. PEPPERMINT (2018). Let’s take a moment to shed a tear for Jennifer Garner, a terrific actress who has received too few breaks from Hollywood. Sensational on TV’s Alias, her film career since then has been a spotty one, as the highlights (a delightful turn in 13 Going on 30, a strong performance in Juno that should have earned her a bushel of award nominations) are often forgotten in the wake of so many box office duds and/or standard “mom” roles. If nothing else, Peppermint at least allows her to flex her muscles — both the internal and external ones — in a leading role; it’s just too bad the film itself is nothing more than a formulaic Death Wish knockoff. Pierre Morel, whose helming of Taken resulted in a satisfying action flick packed with kinetic sequences, isn’t able to muster the same degree of excitement with this yarn in which happy wife and mother Riley North survives a shooting that leaves her husband and daughter dead. Learning that this wasn’t some random drive-by shooting, Riley removes herself from the map and spends five years honing her body and her mind — when she returns, she’s ready to exact bloody revenge on everyone involved with her family tragedy, from the corrupt judge to the oily lawyers to the drug lord (Juan Pablo Raba) who initially ordered the execution. Revenge flicks often offer some measure of catharsis, but the plotting here is so generic and the twist involving the identity of a duplicitous character so obvious that it’s hard to generate enthusiasm for anything aside from Garner’s committed performance. THE PREDATOR (2018). The Predator is the latest (failed) attempt to again jump-start a franchise that has been on life support since the 1987 original. That nifty action flick found Arnold Schwarzenegger squaring off against an imposing extra-terrestrial hunter who, thanks to Oscar-nominated visual effects, was able to shimmer in and out of sight at will. Shane Black, who appeared in a supporting role in the original, here takes on scripting and helming duties, but the result is ultimately a disappointment. Black is known for his he-man casts and quip-heavy dialogue, and both are on full display in this film, which finds Army Ranger sniper Quinn McKenna (Boyd Holbrook) squaring off against more than one predator with the help of his autistic son (Jacob Tremblay), a courageous scientist (Olivia Munn) who got the call to study these predators because (I’m sure I heard this right) she once wrote the US president when she was a little girl and told him she wanted to meet aliens(!!), and a group of ex-army inmates who seem to have escaped from a dinner theater production of One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest. This motley crew of PTSD soldiers is meant to represent the heart of the picture, but their juvenile antics and moldy humor (lots of “your momma” jokes) grow tiresome. Far more engaging is Sterling K. Brown, who’s cast as the primary (human) villain and seems to relish playing such a transparently odious character. A talented cast and some exciting interludes during the first half compensate for the rampant idiocy, but enough is enough. Alas, the ending hints at a sequel, but unless they come up with a new angle, what’s the point? Alien vs. Predator didn’t quite do it in the past – might I suggest Smurf vs. Predator as an innovative way to goose the proceedings? A SIMPLE FAVOR (2018). Far from a cookie-cutter comedy that rolled straight off the Hollywood assembly line, A Simple Favor is basically Gone Girl if it had been played for laughs instead of thrills. Yet even that description doesn’t hint at the murky depths occasionally found in an invigorating effort that doesn’t quite maintain its high-wire act yet deftly avoids a fall and a splat. Anna Kendrick stars as Stephanie Smothers, a widowed single mom who operates a cooking vlog. Her online videos already maintain a solid following, but they become even more popular once she uses it to relate the sordid tale of how her newly acquired best friend, the confidant and no-nonsense Emily Nelson (Blake Lively), suddenly goes missing. Emily’s husband Sean (Henry Golding) claims not to know the whereabouts of his wife, a stance also taken by her boss, fashion designer Dennis Nylon (a funny Rupert Friend). Concerned about Emily, Stephanie opts to do a little sleuthing on her own – an unwise decision since it brings such unpleasantries as incest, adultery and murder floating to the surface. Directed by hitmaker Paul Feig (Bridesmaids, Spy) and written by Jessica Sharzer (working from Darcey Bell’s novel), A Simple Favor is outstanding for about an hour, thanks to its unexpectedly dark themes, its mordant humor, and a knockout performance by Lively. But if the first half is mostly about the characters, the second part is chiefly about the mystery, and the movie isn’t quite as compelling as it works through its convoluted plot (some of which relies on happenstance) and employs dramatic devices that were already growing hoary back in the 1940s. Still, as a robust way for home viewers to close out the year, A Simple Favor gets the job done. TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE: THE NEXT GENERATION (1994). Filmed in 1994, the third sequel to the excellent 1974 horror classic The Texas Chain Saw Massacre scarcely saw release in 1995 under the title The Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre before it was yanked. But in 1996, two of its heretofore unknown players became big stars: Renée Zellweger with Jerry Maguire and Matthew McConaughey with A Time to Kill. To capitalize on their success, plans were set for a major 1997 re-release under the moniker Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation, but the studio cowardly pulled the plug once the stars (particularly McConaughey) began using their newfound clout to squash the film in its tracks. Barely seen in ’97, the film has since emerged as a minor cult item and has turned up in various editions along the way. Admittedly, this is a remarkable amount of backstory for a movie that, let’s face it, remains pretty lousy. Zellweger is the virginal lead who gets stranded with her destined-to-die prom night pals out in the middle of nowhere, while McConaughey plays the murderous redneck Vilmer Slaughter, whose family includes the cross-dressing Leatherface (Robert Jacks). The film manages to pin the Kennedy assassination on this clan, so obviously anything goes as far as the script is concerned. Zellweger acquits herself rather well, although McConaughey’s eye-rolling, over-the-top performance is a matter of personal taste. Shout! Factory’s new Collector’s Edition Blu-ray offers both the R-rated theatrical cut and an unrated director’s cut that runs an additional seven minutes. Extras include audio commentary on the director’s cut by writer-director Kim Henkel; new interviews with co-star Tyler Cone, director of photography Levie Isaacks, and special effects creator J.M. Logan; and the theatrical trailer. VENOM (2018). This week’s theatrical release of Aquaman serves as a reminder that, Wonder Woman aside, DC still has trouble producing quality pictures post-Nolan and continues to be beaten by Marvel on a regular basis. But this month’s home-video release of Venom serves as a reminder that not even Marvel is immune from the occasional dog. Despite its massive box office, Venom is one of the lamest superhero sagas to venture down the pike in quite some time, with Tom Hardy valiantly carrying on the good fight but getting walloped at every turn. Hardy pretty much apes ‘90s-era Jim Carrey as he stars as Eddie Brock, a self-styled investigative reporter whose career is destroyed after he goes after Carlton Drake (Riz Ahmed), the slimy CEO of a bioengineering company. A down-and-out Brock later breaks into Drake’s HQ looking for evidence of his crimes against humanity; instead, his body gets co-opted by an alien entity who enjoys making wisecracks and biting off people’s heads. Venom attempts to break away from the more formal plotting that drives most Marvel movies, opting instead to offer a rollicking approach that hews closer to the likes of the Deadpool and Guardians of the Galaxy efforts. Unfortunately, director Ruben Fleischer and his trio of scripters have assembled a clumsy and chaotic work that’s stridently stupid and eternally annoying. Michelle Williams is wasted as Drake’s ex-girlfriend, and even the obligatory cameo by Stan Lee (RIP) packs little punch. Blu-ray extras include “Venom Mode” (aka a trivia track); a behind-the-scenes featurette; deleted and extended scenes; a piece on Venom and his comic-book and big-screen histories; a look at the stunt work; a short peek at the Easter Eggs hidden in the movie; and the music video to Eminem’s “Venom.”"
"Dec 22, 2018",negative," As far as Marvel superhero movies go, “Venom” ranks as one of the worst. This watered down bore is dumb, loud, and brash with nothing to say. The film suffers from an identity crisis with so many jarring shifts in tone that I struggled to stay engaged with the character and story. Investigative journalist Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy) is seeking out his next big story when he accidentally becomes the host of an alien symbiote that gives him a violent super alter-ego called Venom. Eddie becomes the ultimate antihero as he must rely on his newfound powers to protect the world from an evil bio-engineering corporation. A character like Venom is crying out for the “Deadpool” treatment. It quickly becomes clear that the studio was too afraid to go all-out and make an R-rated villain movie, although making this film for adults would’ve greatly helped. There are feeble attempts at comedy that just aren’t funny. I can think of just two scenes that barely made me chuckle. Even worse are the lame action scenes and cheesy CGI. Director Ruben Fleischer takes the worst parts of Michael Bay’s style (with lots of shaky jump cuts and fiery explosions) and slaps ’em all together for lazy sequences like an animated motorcycle versus drone chase through downtown San Francisco. In a big-budget Marvel superhero movie, I shouldn’t be bored senseless during the action scenes: yet here I was, disinterested and disengaged. Every. Single. Time. Hardy is likeable enough as Eddie, but his nemesis Carlton Drake (Riz Ahmed) and lawyer girlfriend Anne (Michelle Williams) add little to the plot or in terms of on-screen charisma. I wouldn’t go so far as to say the film was miscast, but nothing really clicks between any of the performers. Hardcore fans of the comics may enjoy “Venom” more than an average moviegoer, but the film is ultimately too weird and confusing with an ending that’s just stupid. Good review. Kind of agree with you about this movie. While I love Tom Hardy and he literally does carry the film on his performance, but it wasn’t exactly the best superhero movie. Personally, I think it didn’t live up to its own hype. I’m definitely with the minority on this one – I can’t make a case for it being a great (or even good) movie, but I had a lot of fun watching it!"
"Dec 15, 2018",positive,It succeeds as a piece of entertainment despite the foundational lunacy upon which it was built.
"Dec 13, 2018",negative," Venom is a Spider-Man spinoff movie without a hint of Spider-Man. A cynic may see this as a studio finding ways to make money off the back of their most popular character’s success. Yet in some ways this spinoff movie is more faithful to how comic books work than how Marvel manages their films. Comic books rely on serialized melodrama, where major plots carry on for months or even years. And part of the fun is knowing your favourite heroes and villains may show up in any random issue. Marvel excels at bringing these aspects of the medium to the big screen. But by doing so, Marvel isn’t tapping into a large chunk of the genre’s storytelling potential. Tom Hardy plays Eddie Brock, an investigative reporter who is all about uncovering the truth. His boss assigns him an interview with Carlton Drake (Riz Ahmed), a Steve Jobs-like businessman whose work crosses ethical lines. Though his boss wants a puff piece, Eddie can’t resist sticking it to Drake, so he steals confidential information from his fiancé Anne (Michelle Williams) and uses it to expose the evil genius. The interview goes badly, and his betrayed fiancé dumps him, leaving Eddie a sad, broken, and lonely man. Eddie’s life takes a turn when he encounters an evil alien life form brought to earth by Drake. It’s a gross little pile of black goop that looks like what would happen if a dozen coal miners sneezed into a jar. But looks are deceiving; this powerful alien came to earth with sinister motives. To unlock its full range of abilities it must join with a human in a symbiotic state, and as fate would have it, Eddie is a perfect biological fit. Together, the duo becomes Venom, a hulking nightmare creature that looks as though Tim Burton dreamed up Spider-Man. The alien wants to eat people and reign chaos, but Eddie’s influence “makes it want to be a better man (thing).” Despite their clashing personalities, they’re on the same page about two things: taking down Drake and preventing an alien invasion. You won’t find a blockbuster movie as unusual as Venom anytime soon. It’s dark, violent, and has tone and pacing issues coming out its symbiotic wazoo. But at its heart, Venom is still an action movie. So, it’s disappointing that its action set pieces are a mixed bag. There’s a fun chase sequence midway through the picture where Eddie and Venom get familiar with each other. As men with guns chase them through the winding San Francisco streets, Eddie goes on autopilot while Venom takes over. Venom uses his powers (firing out long, gooey tendrils) in creative ways; ripping a car door off its hinge and using it as a shield; using a tendril as a grappling hook and making an impossible turn. While there’s an over-reliance on shoddy CGI, some impressive practical effects – explosions and flipped cars – help create a genuinely thrilling sequence. This all-too-brief chase is Venom at its best. Much of the film, though, is straight-up bad and falls back on lazy comic book movie tropes. Its heavy reliance on CGI spectacle is the worst offence. The CGI action beats aren’t dynamically choreographed or well-shot, and they feel like watching a sardonic version of Loony Toons – I half-expected Venom to reshape a tendril into an anvil and drop it on some poor asshole’s head. The symbiote versus symbiote fights are real eye-sores. Between the shoddy effects and poorly lit scenes, you can’t make out what’s going on. It feels like watching the first couple Transformers films where Autobot versus Decepticon battles turned into metallic cyclones of metal, sparks, and tire treads. When the movie ended my memories mushed together into an indistinguishable hodgepodge. The movie is so tonally and thematically inconsistent it’s hard to know for sure what he’s trying to do. Venom feels like several competing films – A Jekyll and Hyde story, an odd couple movie, a broad comedy – stitched together into one incoherent mess. Eddie Brock is one of the most passive protagonists you’ll find. He spends the movie running away or getting dragged along with no sense of agency until the final act when the film pivots and discovers its heroes’ purposes. Venom doesn’t show up until 40-minutes in, and it’s longer still before Fleischer hints at what this movie wants to say. At its beating black heart, Venom is about Eddie and his “parasite” merging together and accepting each other. And at the end of the film, they figure out how to live in harmony. The problem here is that the story doesn’t provide examples of how this unlikely pairing reach their blissful bromance. Venom begins as a terrifying presence invading Eddie’s mind and remains so until he starts cracking wise – his wit and comedic timing are as sharp as his rows of jagged teeth. Not only does this alien menace have jokes, but he’s also hellbent on winning back Eddie’s former lady. Why you say? Who cares? It’s funny when his booming voice chimes in with snarky one-liners. This film never finds its groove until it goes all in on the duo’s batshit crazy repartee. Sadly, this doesn’t happen until the tail-end of the movie. Seeing them both on the same page is a blast, even though these moments don’t feel earned. Venom features a cast so talented that a director would have to go out of their way to waste them, and yet that’s exactly what we have here. Hardy is the only standout, and it’s obvious why he signed on to the project. If you think he went too over-the-top with Bane, you ain’t seen nothing yet! At his most subtle, Eddie speaks like a New Jersey plumber with a coke habit. At other times you would swear he’s channelling Al Pacino circa Heat. I understand his intentions, but he feels out of step with most of a film featuring talking alien goop. Talented actors like Michelle Williams, Riz Ahmed, and Jenny Slate have zilch to do. Williams plays the thankless concerned love-interest role, which is well below her pay grade. Slate still exudes charm as a lab nerd who stands out for her dope glasses and not her personality. And Ahmed plays the type of bland, non-threatening, and forgettable villain reserved for old white guys in Marvel movies. I would rather watch a director go for a creative long shot and fail than sit through another by-the-numbers origin story. Venom feels like an artistic gamble but still comes across as generic nonsense. It’s dark but not too dark; weird but restrained; well-cast but lacks personality. Venom had the potential to invigorate the genre much like how its fellow anti-hero Deadpool did in 2016. Instead, we’re left with something closer to a train wreck. Although I didn’t enjoy Venom, I remain (perhaps masochistically) enthusiastic about what the series does next. All You Need Is Death is the latest in the Celtic folk horror genre that will appeal to fans of You Are Not My Mother, A Hole in the Ground and Men. In this Unboxing video, Jason Gorber checks out the Joni Mitchell Archives Volume 3 on vinyl and covers just what you get with this latest release."
"Dec 10, 2018",negative,"Well, sorry to break it to you, but Venom is one massive missed opportunity."
"Dec 7, 2018",neutral," It’s been over a year now since Spider-Man Homecoming gave our favorite webslinger his own solo movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe after debuting in 2016’s Captain America: Civil War. That movie, while the third version of the character since his big-screen debut in 2002, was a commercial and critical success, giving a fun, youthful spin on Peter Parker, where other films seemed to be in a hurry towards adulthood and not dwelling on the high school experience. It was this uniqueness that made the announcement of Venom particularly odd to process. Eddie Brock and his hulking symbiote counterpart was birthed on the pages of Spider-Man comics, and his ties to Spidey go far deeper than just having a large white spider on his chest. His appearance, motivations, and overall purpose are intrinsically tied to Spider-Man, so here we have a film that is created “in association with Marvel” and (***spoiler-alert***) not featuring Tom Holland as Peter Parker or even mentioning him. Ties to anything in the overall mythos are scant (but there are some). So, obviously, there are some liberties taken with the character, but overall, with a lead actor like Tom Hardy, front and center, and big-budget special-effects, it all works out, right? Well, partly. In the film, we focus on Eddie Brock (Hardy), a docu-journalist a’la ‘VICE’, that has much going for him in San Francisco. Engaged to a beautiful lawyer, Anne  Weying (played by Michelle Williams), all is well, until Eddie makes a choice with some sensitive information surrounding Life Foundation and their CEO, Carlton Drake (Riz Ahmed). This shakes things up for Eddie from the top down. Months later, he is wrapped back up investigating Life Foundation, but he brings more than just a story from it; he is infected with an alien parasite, a “symbiote” that comes to call itself Venom. Imbuing Eddie with  incredible powers and abilities, we see him try to come to grips with a foreign presence inside his mind, controlling and manipulating him almost like a marionette. We spend the rest of the film, following Eddie’s struggle and quest to deal with the problems brought about by the symbiote organisms on Earth. With the casting of Tom Hardy, I knew a few things would result. Most obviously, the physique of Eddie Brock would be convincingly portrayed as it should be (sorry, Topher Grace). In addition, I knew that the performance could wind up being a lot of things, but it would definitely be attempting something unique. We get that here, definitely. While not entirely likable, Brock’s problems with becoming Venom create something different than we are used to seeing. And boy, is it different?!? Taking what the comic page shows as duality and really running with it, we get a frantic, muttering performance that displays full commitment for sure, but it isn’t without missteps. The verbal interplay and spats between Eddie and Venom provides some of the film’s highlight moments, but when you slow down and start to think about why Venom would say or behave the way he does over the film, things don’t always add up. The missteps I mentioned in the performance we get come mainly from the writing, I would say. Tom mostly chews through it, like his character does through anyone that gets in his way, but there were plenty of moments where the dialogue and character motivation left me like “What?” It’s hard to imagine who came up with what in relation to the strangeness of it all, but I have to imagine Hardy pushed for the weird, and boy, do we get some here! The supporting cast does their job, but they don’t get near as much material to work with as Hardy. Indie darling Michelle Williams is finally coming into more mainstream material after the success of The Greatest Showman, but I really wasn’t wowed by too much here, as she and Tom exhibited little to no on-screen chemistry. Jenny Slate & Reid Scott, both known primarily for their comedy work, do great playing it straight as their characters here, but neither are given enough to do to elevate the rest of the film. Riz Ahmed is very capable as an actor, but the God-complex speeches he has to deliver here as Carlton Drake feel oddly dated and out-of-touch for a film in 2018. The film doesn’t waste much time in showing him to be a guy with nefarious means in play. Great villains have understandable and nuanced motivations, but none of that really comes together here. What really does shine here beyond the erratic work of Hardy is the special effects. My biggest takeaway from the film is that Venom, even in the crazy ways he is realized on the pages of comics, can be effectively translated to live action. Paradoxically massive yet lithe in his movements, savage in his exercises of strength and horror, and completely strange and horrifying to witness, the character’s realization on-screen is quite an achievement for all of the special effects studios involved here. It’s not all perfect, but it is all effective. Venom was realized on-screen before in Sam Raimi‘s Spider-Man 3, but it’s best we forget about how all that turned out (again, sorry, Topher). Strangely in that film, the effect of Venom worked best when the “suit” was removed from the host, as shown above, but in this film, the symbiote works on the host, off, and wherever else in transition. It’s as if the effects team scavenged every nerdy 90’s kid’s Trapper Keeper and realized what we all were trying to draw when we should have been listening to our teacher. Alluding to the 90’s feels key here, because, while the film implies, at least to me, some interesting parallels with addiction and its effects on lives, it never fully sticks that it seems to be shooting for. This results in there being not much that is very deep going on with the film beyond a story that doesn’t have that much motivation going for it. Prior to the successes of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and even the masterclass that is Christopher Nolan‘s Dark Knight Trilogy, it was enough for a comic book movie to just look right, even if it didn’t have really anything interesting to say. One could argue that the MCU films aren’t saying a whole lot either, and I could see their point; still, a main strength of those films is a dedication to tone and feel, even as that tone may change between Marvel properties. This film doesn’t do too well here, as it goes all over the place with tone. The direction of Ruben Fleischer (Zombieland) amplifies all the horror beats effectively, which is largely where it should have stayed, but the film mixes in strange comedy liberally by way of some truly weird dialogue. I was a fan of the humor that naturally came from watching the physicality that Tom Hardy brought to it all, but that dialogue though! “A turd in the wind”…Yeah, it gets ugly! With regards to content, I did feel the film would have been better suited as an R-rated affair. Everything attempted here winds up feeling stunted by the PG-13 limitations. With no demonstrable links to the MCU Spider-Man here, why wasn’t this film even edgier? That said, with what we do get in terms of language, violence (both implied and shown), implied sex, and just overall darkness, this really isn’t a film to take the kids to. If anything, I see them more likely leaving terrified, rather than mesmerized. As I said earlier, there are speeches revolving around God and Biblical characters like Abraham and Isaac are (erroneously) discussed. Think of these mentions as prompts to discuss with friends what the Bible really shows, and there is some utility there. Listening to how the film portrays the God of the Bible on its own word will only disappoint sincere believers. Showing the effects of a man possessed by something other than himself can be a parallel to understanding sin and addiction, but again, these can be things one lifts out and discusses on their own, rather than seeing them correctly stated by the film. All in all, I liked parts of the film, but it is definitely one of the strangest big-budget films I’ve ever watched. My inner child reveled in seeing the Venom of the page brought to life, but stripping away Spider-Man from it all left it hollow to me. I respect Tom Hardy for his performance, and inevitably, I think there could be more coming (especially, if that end-credits scene is any primer), and I hope to see him develop things. That said, Sony, tie in Spider-Man directly, ASAP, because those ties make Venom interesting. With what we get here, everything winds up forgettable in many ways, and that’s a shame. Tom Hardy brought the goods; now, we just have to have some reasons to care, because this film’s plot, pacing, and inconsistent tone wasn’t compelling enough on its own. The above image says it all: come to enjoy Tom Hardy acting crazy and some slick visuals. Other than that, it’s likely you’ll be disappointed on some level."
"Dec 7, 2018",negative,The entire endeavor has a bitter aftertaste that frequently overwhelms the sensibility of mad spectacle that Fleischer and his performers strive to tease from the material.
"Dec 6, 2018",negative,"It's not a good movie, but considering the box office numbers, it won't be long until we see the sequel that this movie ham-fistedly foreshadowed."
"Nov 28, 2018",positive," Tras el intento fallido de haberle dado vida en la pantalla grande en 2007, justo en la tercera entrega del Spiderman, interpretado por Tobey Maguire, los estudios Marvel decidieron revivir a Venom, el enemigo del arácnido, en la cinta homónima que es protagonizada por el actor británico de 41 años Tom Hardy. En la cinta de 2007 el trabajo recayó en el actor estadunidense Topher Grace, quien alcanzara fama por su trabajo en la serie That ’70s Show. Aunque no es la mejor cinta del Universo Cinematográfico de Marvel, Venom nos hace pasar un buen rato al ser testigos del origen de ese villano alienígena que se vale de un cuerpo huésped, en este caso del periodista Eddie Brock (Hardy) para poder sobrevivir en el planeta Tierra. La crítica cinematográfica internacional no ha sido benévola con el resultado de esta historia que corrió a cargo de Ruben Fleischer, quien de igual manera estuvo detrás de Zombieland; sin embargo, los especialistas coincidieron en que el filme se salva por el carisma que irradia Hardy en la pantalla grande y la química que logra al interactuar con el simbionte que se apropió de su cuerpo. La parte femenina en la cinta está representada por la cuatro veces nominada al Oscar Michelle Williams, quien dejó de lado su carrera en las cintas independientes para involucrarse en este filme de corte comercial por una simple razón: Tom Hardy, a quien califica como un gran actor, un monstruo actoral al que se le puede aprender en cualquier momento o situación. Williams, expareja del finado actor Heath Ledger, con quien procreó una hija, interpreta al interés amoroso de Eddie Brock (Hardy). Su personaje es una abogada que en una parte del filme es capaz de decirle al hombre que ama lo siguiente: “Te amo, pero me amo más yo”."
"Nov 27, 2018",negative,VENOM is fun. But it is not 'good fun' if you understand.
"Nov 19, 2018",neutral,"Feels like a comic book adaptation that was scripted in the late 1990s, filmed in the mid-2000s, and given a CGI facelift in the last couple of years (but not a good one)."
"Nov 17, 2018",negative,A movie that pushes any intellectual connotation warrants much more careful and precise technical values. Halfway through this film and I was ready to pop an ibuprofen.
"Nov 6, 2018",negative," Grab your space goo and bring your Tom Hardy translators! In a second-helping of MAM for the week, we're breaking down box office hit (for some reason) Venom (for some reason). "
"Nov 6, 2018",negative,"A dumb script, bad CGI and poor plotting all combine to make a film that feels as though it is a bad joke at someone's expense. ​"
"Nov 6, 2018",negative,"If you're not going to do right by these characters, go give Marvel them back. Why are you still trying to make all this money if you're not doing right by the fans?"
"Nov 5, 2018",negative," Watching the talented actor’s latest film, it’s easy to tell that no one on screen cares more about their performance or has thought about their character more than Hardy. Everything about his work is nuanced, with immense planning given to the affectation of each line, the physicality involved and the Jekyll and Hyde quality his work espouses. But stuck in a superhero movie not produced by Marvel Studios, Hardy feels like he’s running in quicksand with “Venom,” a Spider-Man spinoff that can’t (or won’t) reference Spider-Man. Hardy stars as Eddie Brock, an investigative video journalist who learns of experiments combining the homeless of San Francisco with alien symbiotes. When Eddie is exposed, he begins an unlikely alliance with his symbiote, Venom, in a struggle of good versus evil. From the outset, it’s clear that Hardy is working the layers of Eddie and Venom (who he also voices) in internal conflict as some sort of mashup of superhero origin story and literary commentary. Each part of the character(s) are distinct and unique and Hardy does an impressive job blurring the lines between normality and insanity. His reluctant charm carries the day, especially opposite Michelle Williams, who doesn’t seem all that interested in participating in the film. Though Williams is intended to be Hardy’s fiancee, they have the chemistry of mild acquaintances. Hardy’s banter with his Venom alter-ego resonates ten times as much. Riz Ahmed has been much more impressive as a villain than he is here as the rather bland Carlton Drake and a talented Jenny Slate is largely wasted with a small nothing part as one of Drake’s scientists that aided Eddie. Hardy has said that his favorite 40 minutes were cut from the film and it’s unclear (but likely) that most of those changes were made as Sony insisted on a more marketable PG-13 rating for the film rather than the intended R rating. All of the violence that resonates in the Venom character through the comics is lost without the gore you might find in a “Deadpool” or “Predator” film. As a result, the film feels unnecessarily handicapped. There are some great sequences within “Venom,” usually involving Eddie and Venom’s inner monologue as they tear through the city. But 15 percent of a good film does not a quality film make. If “Venom” ends up becoming the “Green Lantern” Hardy makes on the way to something better, then all Hardy’s effort will have been worth it. This doesn’t feel very likely, however, given the $80 million opening weekend box office Sony raked and their affinity for churhing out bland, PG-13 material in the quest for the almighty dollar. A sequel is coming whether it’s deserved or not. That nothing would have to be trimmed to make “Venom” ready for broadcast television should tell audiences everything they need to know about a movie where alien lifeforms steal people’s bodies and bite their heads off."
"Nov 5, 2018",negative," Imaginen que hay un ser amorfo que se quiere meter en tu cuerpo y obligarte a hacer cosas sin pensar. Es violento, ruidoso, grotesco y lo único que quiere es devorar… pero tu cartera. No estoy hablando del “simbionte” Venom, sino de la película que lleva su nombre. Esta es una creatura salida de las profundidades más sórdidas del cine de superhéroes, el blockbuster sinónimo de comida chatarra que no tiene nada que ofrecer y le chupa la vida misma a un elenco talentoso. Es lo que uno imaginaría: Sony, ahora que ya vendió los derechos de su Spider-Man a Marvel Studios, insiste en tener su propia rebanada del pastel fílmico de los cómics. Como ya no pueden usar al arácnido en su totalidad, tienen que sacar otros personajes del mismo mundo y hacer con ellos lo mejor posible. ¿Qué consiguen con un villano tan querido como Venom? Si había buenas ideas, murieron antes de llegar a la pantalla. La cinta cuenta la historia de Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy), un reportero famoso con un programa de televisión que parece sobre chismes sensacionalistas, pero es en realidad un profundo trabajo de investigación que le ha ganado el respeto del mundo periodístico. Él vive feliz con su prometida Anne (Michelle Williams), hasta que le encargan entrevistar al empresario Carlton Drake (Riz Ahmed), un tipo obsesionado con el espacio exterior, que tiene una compañía millonaria y aparentemente conexiones criminales. Aunque la idea es que nada más lo entreviste por encimita, él insiste en investigar más allá y logra descubrir que están experimentando con una raza alienígena: los llaman “simbiontes”, son creaturas medio líquidas que necesitan adherirse a otra forma de vida para sobrevivir. Drake se la pasa matando vagabundos en busca de la perfecta unión con un humano, sin saber que lo único que necesitaba es el cuerpo de Brock, el cual es poseído por un “simbionte” llamado Venom. Vayamos al grano: esta cinta es muy mala y nunca tuvo esperanzas de ser otra cosa. Desde su concepción ya estaba mal, pues no era más que el intento de Sony por crear su propia franquicia de superhéroes. No por nada la gran pregunta de todos cuando promocionaban la cinta era “¿y saldrá el Spider-Man de Marvel (Tom Holland)?” Si acaso un poco de curiosidad y un grano de posible creatividad tenía era por la presencia de actores de gran renombre como Tom Hardy, Michelle Williams y hasta Riz Ahmed, cuyas habilidades histriónicas hacen que uno se sienta curioso de verlos casi donde sea, hasta en “Venom”. A todos los talentosos les llega su momento: se aparece una gran productora ofreciendo un gran cheque y deben decidir si aceptarlo o no. Una vez que firman el contrato, se adhieren a ellos como un pegajoso “simbionte”, obligándolos a hacer toda clase de estupideces. “¡Eres mío, Tom Hardy!” (léase con voz de Venom). Hay dos tipos de blockbuster: los que son divertidos y los que son un producto. Bueno tres, porque hay algunos que le echan más ganas y no sólo son divertidos, sino que logran hasta conmovernos. “Venom” creo que ya saben de qué tipo es. Es una abominación ruidosa que grita para llamar la atención: “¡mírenme, yo también juego con superhéroes, yo también soy cool!” Y es la analogía perfecta, una creatura digital monstruosa que toma posesión de las pantallas y las personas, un parásito que sólo quiere comer y destruir todo a su paso. Es el espíritu mismo de las malas cintas de superhéroes. Es muy gracioso ver a Tom Hardy agonizar en este personaje, al verse torturado por movimientos involuntarios de su cuerpo y una voz que le habla en su cabeza. Eddie Brock está en una situación de la que no puede salir una vez que tiene el “simbionte” adentro. Hardy es un gran actor luchando por no ser devorado por una enorme masa digital. Venom es un personaje querido y hasta yo, que nunca he sido fan de los cómics, ni he leído más que un par en mi vida, recuerdo que en mi infancia el personaje me parecía genial. El concepto del mismo realmente sí se presta para hacer un buen filme. Pero pobre, este personaje todavía no encuentra su camino en la pantalla grande. Su primera encarnación la vimos en “Spider-Man 3” (2007), también muy mala y, en aquel caso, opacada por otro puñado de villanos. Aquí tiene todo para él solo, ni siquiera sale Spider-Man. Es terreno libre, un lienzo en blanco que debería aprovecharse. Destacaría dos cosas del personaje: una, que sea una creatura que posea un cuerpo y lo obligue a hacer su voluntad; dos, que visualmente podría prestarse a buenas escenas de acción. De lo segundo puedo decir que esta película es uno de los peores desastres visuales. Estas secuencias son un caos absoluto donde no se entiende nada. El otro aspecto se reduce a una voz en la cabeza de Brock, que termina por ser un asunto de comedia malograda. No es interesante, no es inteligente y no es entretenida. Al menos debería ser divertido ver a Venom pelear, devorar personas, pero no y todavía para hacer las cosas peor, su clasificación PG-13 (B, en México) quita todo dejo de violencia y hace la acción todavía más desabrida. Lo peor es que todo lo demás no funciona. El protagonista ni siquiera es una persona agradable o alguien que logre lo suficiente para querer seguir su aventura. Cuando llega Venom se vuelve peor, de los dos no se hace uno, como dicen por ahí. Se tiene que entender a los protagonistas al menos, aunque no coincidamos con ellos. Debemos, en cierto nivel, sentirnos identificados. Hay una historia de amor y toda la cosa, pero nada basta, mucho menos para la pobre Michelle Williams cuyo personaje no aporta. ¿Qué cosas positivas puedo sacar de esta experiencia, entonces? Quizá la simple curiosidad de ver cómo arruinan todo. Pero al final es como dice Eddie al ver a Riot: “eres la cosa más horrible que jamás he visto”."
"Nov 5, 2018",negative," As Honey Bunny and Pumpkin so sagely taught us in the opening scene of Pulp Fiction, it’s important for petty thieves to think things through before conducting a robbery. It’s a lesson that could have been of great benefit to the four American tertiary students who, in 2004, planned to relieve their university library of a number of extremely rare and valuable books. Their plot, and the impulses that drove them, are the subject of American Animals, an absorbing, detailed, unintentionally humourous account of the hare-brained heist that blends expository interviews with the real culprits with the movie recreation of the events. It’s odd that these four didn’t pick up on the wisdom of Honey Bunny and Pumpkin, too, because they actually reference Quentin Tarantino’s film Reservoir Dogs at one point as they plan their crime. Regarding themselves as cool criminals in the mould of Steve McQueen from The Thomas Crown Affair, they plot out their heist in what they think is great detail, only to witness reality come crashing in once the moment of truth occurs. As amusing as their incompetence is – conducting a major robbery in the middle of a school day in a building full of people should have been a hint that this was a bad idea – the caper is played fairly straight by British director Bart Layton (The Imposter). With a nod to the Rashomon effect,  not all the versions of the plan match up, and the trust they had in each other was certainly not equal. Were there really international buyers ready to pay millions for the books? Or was something else going on? Some heist movies cheekily invite you to admire the ingenuity of the crims and even to get a vicarious thrill out of the possibility the robbers might get away with it. The original Ocean’s 11,  The Italian Job and the aforementioned Thomas Crown Affair are prime examples. You could even include Heat. Here, however, you’re the observer of some very peculiar behaviour that is far from admirable, yet quite enjoyable, not the least because it shows again how ultimately crime doesn’t pay and how greed and the adventure of committing crime can obliterate all traces of common sense. With Venom, Marvel Studios have now officially hit the bottom of the barrell as one of its third-rate, C-grade creations known mainly to Marvel’s fanboy base gets his own mediocre movie. Tom Hardy plays a gung-ho reporter whose body becomes host to an alien sludge that transforms him into a large Alien-like beast with large almond eyes, a smiling mouth full of nasty teeth and a rather winning sense of humour. Apart from a handful of laughs, the film is an ugly, largely incomprehensible mess, its swirls of frenetic action set mostly at night, making it tough to figure out precisely what’s going on. The best of the Marvel films have real personality, the lack of which has afflicted most of the first sequels. Venom comes to us bland right out of the box, its promising moments – such as when the alien spore infects a little girl – overwhelmed by the need to pour on the fireballs and VFX. (For the record, the closing credits list around 420 digital artists.) For those who care, Venom is part of the Spider-man universe and he, in turn, is part of the Marvel universe. But Spider-man and Venom are owned by Sony while Disney owns Marvel. So seeing Spider-man in those Avenger films took a lot of studio wheeling and dealing. And though the Marvel stamp is on Venom’s opening credits, the plan right now is for Venom to stay within Sony’s Spider-man world, though its possible for a deal to be made where he enters the Marvel space to join the other superhero characters. Though Venom is yet to prove itself with audiences – it’s already struck out with critics, who are not the guide they once were to a film’s popularity – there are already two Venom sequels on the books. So there’s faith for you. By the way, Hardy was one of the producers here, obviously keen to get a nice big slice of that lovely superhero franchise action. Smart guy. A small struggling rural town is brought back from the brink via cricket as a forward-thinking local man, Troy Carrington (Damian Callinan) rebuilds the local team by recruiting multi-cultural members through the local refugee centre. Naturally, the small-town setting gives rise to small-minded thinking as stalwart locals, such as Bull Barlow (John Howard), rally opposition to the new team, seeing it as an affront to their Aussie sense of identity. There’s no question the film, directed with careful attention not to offend by Mark Grentell (Backyard Ashes), has its heart in the right place as the film bounces around the idea of accepting people of other lands into the community. If only the film was funnier. There is a stilted feel to the pace and too much caution in its messaging, proving that nothing dilutes fun quicker than preaching. Adapted from the one-man play by Melbourne comedian Damian Callinan (who wrote the screenplay, stars and produces) the film proved a big hit when it played as the centrepiece at the Melbourne International Film Festival, building expectatons for its cinema run. Now on its last legs after four weeks of theatrical release, The Merger can’t be said to have done all that well, with a local box office take of around $400,000. Hope remains that once it hits the stream the film will connect with the audience it struggled to find via the cinemas. With a relentless work ethic, Damian Callinan has been a fixture on the Melbourne comedy scene for two decades. A universally respected live act, he tours relentlessly. A specialist in creating hit one-man shows – The Lost WW1 Diary; Swing Man; Spaznuts; Sportsman’s Night; Proxy Heroes – he has been nominated three times for the Melbourne International Comedy Festival’s Barry Award. Callinan created The Merger as a stage work after being commissioned by Regional Arts Victoria and Vic Health, the brief being to address the problem regional towns were encountering with xenophobia and racism. The piece proved extremely popular once he began performing the one-man show in 2010, a common response to the play being that it would make a great film. A week after the release of The Merger, Callinan was kind enough to carve some time out of his busy schedule to sit down and talk about the making of The Merger, and other things."
"Nov 2, 2018",positive,Imagine if Rick Moranis had an alien in his head that sounded like Freddy Krueger and you start to see where the movie is going.
"Nov 2, 2018",negative," Venom is an anomaly for modern superhero films, existing outside a broader connected universe. The irreverent alien symbiote made its film debut in 2007’s Spider-Man 3, the year before Iron Man kicked off the Marvel Cinematic Universe, forever changing the way studios approach comic book adaptations. Though a few dozen superhero movies have come and gone between the Topher Grace and Tom Hardy versions of the character, Venom as a film seems to want to pay homage to the idea that a movie can exist as a movie without any broader ramifications for future team-ups down the road. Freed from shared universe obligations, Venom never seems sure what it wants to do with its time. The plot never really exists as more than an excuse to pair up Hardy’s Eddie Brock with the titular symbiote. Riz Ahmed plays a competent menacing villain in Carlton Drake, but the character lacks any compelling traits to set him apart from the “mad scientist” trope that defines his place in the narrative. Michelle Williams has a few standout scenes as Brock’s ex-fiancée Anne Weying, but largely feels wasted in a wooden supporting role created more out of obligation to give Brock more human characters to interact with than anything else. Venom shines when it lets Hardy run wild with his alter-ego. Venom is a hilarious character who develops an oddly charming buddy-cop romance with Brock as the film settles into its second act. The relationship produces a number of laugh out loud moments that serve in stark contrast to the film’s otherwise grim tone. Such mood-swings seem to define the entire experience. Like Brock’s relationship with Venom, the movie exists in constant turmoil between dueling desires to be simultaneously formulaic and spontaneous. The action scenes feel wooden, but there’s enough humor to make you wish you were enjoying yourself just a teensy bit more. On the site you will find a lot of naked girls online for every taste: brunettes, blondes and even redheads, young and Mature, shaved and hairy, with small, medium and large Breasts, with sex toys, students who love Squirting and anal. Choose a girl who is online, and communicate with her in freelivesex girls in shorts, fishnet stockings, girls in overalls, in a nurse’s costume. In addition, the girls show anal, Fisting and Squirting. Girls spread their legs, girls spread their Asses and labia. Girls fuck each other with big dildos. Hardy makes the most of what he’s given as an actor, but the narrative is too all over the place to create a cohesive experience. Venom is a very fun mess to watch, but it would be a stretch to call it a good film. Which isn’t to say that Venom doesn’t have a place in the crowded superhero genre. The narrative is far more chaotic than any MCU offering and never as grim as a DCEU installment. Venom gets its titular character right, but fails to supply a worthy vehicle for him to play in. The film is perhaps best enjoyed in snippets on premium cable, where one can focus on the humorous elements while forgetting that movie doesn’t really know how to tell a story.

"Nov 2, 2018",neutral,"Venom poisons the well of its own goodwill by a series of misfiring, illogical plot points and lack of respect for its own universe's rules."
"Nov 1, 2018",negative," An aimless, awful embarrassment for everyone involved, Venom imagines a world where a dopey Peter Parker-type was instead bitten by a radioactive turd. Creatively bankrupt filmmaking from top to bottom, Venom bows under the weight of an insufferable script, flat-out strange performances, and a mishmash tone that tries to levy the darkness of a character that waxes about snacking on eyeballs and fingers and  livers in with scatalogical jokes that truly only the prepubescent in the audience would giggle along with.  Like an import from another decade, one where superhero fare came barreling down the hatch without its fair shake of quality control, Venom is a bold vision of cinematic not-giving-a-fuck. Think the likes of Fantastic Four and Daredevil, Batman and Robin and Catwoman and you’ll have an inkling for the flabbergasting, directionless mania of this shockingly bad Sony outing. Director Ruben Fleischer of Zombieland and Gangster Squad fame proves epically unqualified for the chair, failing to breathe the faintest glimmer of soul into this feral abomination.  Hardy, who has long been a beacon of quality when it comes to the roles he selects, has only once belittled himself with material far beneath his talents, in the rather bad 2012 action rom-com This Means War. And if you thought that was bad, you ain’t seen nothing yet. His signing on for Venom in the first place signaled tantalizing promise, suggesting an out-of-the-box antihero origin story with some real bite. Fans expected R-rated insanity that really focused on character; the madness of a man merged with hubris itself. I mean, why else would the multiple Oscar-nominated actor enroll himself in such tripe?  The answer remains unclear after watching – there is no hint of a grand scheme gone amiss, just a tacked together hodgepodge of lackluster moments and hurriedly written hack-lines. Hardy himself isn’t good by any measurable standard. His performance is all kinds of frantic and bug-eyed, tacked to a weird accent, and constantly demeaning itself with some of the worst dialogue imaginable. Even the interplay between Hardy’s Eddie Brock and Venom, essentially the heart and soul of this whole project, isn’t fun banter. Venom demands, “Food!” He’s the base level of Maslow’s hierarchy given voice. Everything about the character is childish dreck, plain and simple. The plot of Venom, as if the movie is interested in an actual plot and not just churning the laziest cinematic universe imaginable, is pseudo-gritty origin story banality. Ostensibly, a disgraced reporter bonds with hungry alien goo to take down Big Pharma. Eddie Brock is a “no-holds-barred” reporter who will do anything to get a story, including invading his lawyer fiancee’s (played by Michelle Williams, god knows why) personal email to get the scoop on a nefarious pharmaceutical big whig (Riz Ahmed, who also co-stars in this weekend’s excellent The Sisters Brothers). A symbiote from space named Venom crash lands on Earth and hitches a ride on Brock’s immune system (Brock repeatedly refers to this as a “parasite” that he has “up his butt”) and the two pair up to save the world because “they’re both losers.” Nifty. You can’t make this stuff up people. Well that is unless your name is Scott Rosenberg (Kangaroo Jack), Jeff Pinkner (The 5th Wave), Kelly Marcel (50 Shades of Grey) or Will Beall (Gangster Squad), the combined four-top taking responsibility for writing this sludge. A quick review of the four aforementioned movies this quartet have worked on before should speak (nay, scream) volumes about the lo-fi sewage in store. The script is undoubtedly Venom’s Achilles’ heel – the lowest wrung in a ladder from hell. Their choice of words is so unrelenting awful that you may find yourself amazed that Hardy and Williams and Ahmed agreed to utter many of these lines in front of a camera, ever. At one point, Hardy says “My legs were broken, and now they are not broken” with a look of amazement on his face that could only be matched by my own amazement that I was actually watching this happen in an actual movie starring actual Tom Hardy.  Venom is the result of a studio trying to have its cake and eat heads too. Superficially, there is a dark air to Brock’s transformation into a powerful super-sentient ass-kicker but it’s all about as hardcore as smoking e-cigs outside the Hot Topic in your local mall. With its immature humor and barbarically stupid dialogue, Venom will only appeal to the kids in the audience, a decision made evident by its awful musical choices (including an over-the-hill Eminem ballad). This is lowest common denomination debris; the rubble of some unseen insider shakeup that was beaten and battered into “film” form. On the Venom press tour, Tom Hardy commented that his “favorite 40 minutes had been cut from the film” but with what we’ve seen, you’d need a whole new 120 minutes of movie to find anything even half-decent, much less anything worth calling your “favorite.” When not plugging away at his computer, Matt can be found holed up in his Seattle home or hidden amongst the mountains.

"Oct 31, 2018",neutral," Let’s get this out of the way: Venom isn’t a particularly great character on his own. As a dark mirror of Spider-Man, he can work in the right hands, but his lasting popularity is mainly down to the edgelord boom of comics in the late 80s and 90s that still somehow overshadows much of the industry and its film adaptations. There is a way of making him relevant in the modern era, but removing him from Spider-Man completely is an incredibly bad first move. Sony have been trying to get a solo Venom movie off the ground since the Sam Raimi era and, after multiple false starts and despite having just gotten on good terms with Marvel Studios, they’ve gone and finally made it anyway. The final result is as messy and confused as you might expect, but also hilarious enough in its own ineptitude to be worth witnessing for the curious. Throughout its runtime, Venom makes a lot of bold and daring decisions. It’s a shame so few of them are the correct ones. The plot is fairly simple and yet haphazardly told, mainly evident by the inconsistent pacing and jarring mood shifts that suggests this thing was hacked to pieces in post. The first act is relatively grounded and crams in a lot of information, but relies heavily on predictable clichés for character motivation and relationships (when there even is any). Shifting into the second act, the film takes a turn for the absurd with a bizarre mix of body horror and slapstick comedy that plays out like Evil Dead II as directed by a 90s teenager. That then quickly segues into a final act that is an incomprehensible blur that most resembles Street Sharks action figures covered in Nickelodeon slime being slammed into each other by a nine-year-old, then some sudden sequel set-up and a mid-credits scene, then it’s over. It’s a superhero film that feels like it was made over a decade ago, making all of the mistakes this genre has made and corrected in the years since, and it’s never quite clear if this is meant to be a tongue-in-cheek homage or to be taken dead seriously. It’s a sloppy mess that is often endearing in its own ridiculousness, but it’s too unfocused and cynically slapped together to fully appreciate. By the time it’s all over, the whole experience feels like, as the already infamous line from the trailer said, a turd in the wind; it blows by quickly but leaves a distinctive smell. Why Tom Hardy of all times now decided to be in this picture is a mystery to me, but he is pivotal to this whole enterprise remaining afloat. His performance most reminded me of Nicolas Cage in his 90s action movie phase: unhinged and hilarious, and yet still somehow charming. He gives Eddie Brock some interesting depths as an ambitious but pathetic provocateur journalist, which helps differentiate him from the roided-out jock of the original comics or the Peter Parker-but-an-asshole Topher Grace version from Spider-Man 3. Meanwhile, Hardy then goes flipping nuts once the Venom symbiote is inside him, giving full gusto to the variety of absurd situations the script rights him into; it’d be embarrassing if it wasn’t so unbelievable. He also does a good job of playing the double act of being both Brock and Venom as they verbally spar inside his head, but it’s a shame the symbiote itself lacks depth beyond his monstrous image. Venom’s motivations are incredibly tenuous and only really decided upon all-of-a-sudden in the third act, which don’t feel at all informed by the preceding film and also take away much of the creature’s menace. Regardless, if Hardy hadn’t made the potentially career-ruining decision to star in this, we would have a far worse movie on our hands. The rest of the cast feels incredibly wasted, playing stock characters that really don’t demand the high calibre actors they’ve managed to get for some of them. I applaud Michelle Williams for somehow managing to play this whole thing incredibly straight and give depth to a character that has none of the page purely through her performance, but it’s all for nought; any actress could have played this role, and better or worse it wouldn’t have affected the final product much. Riz Ahmed never quite manages to hit the right beat as Carlton Drake, constantly trying to go for the “villain with noble intentions but questionable methods” character when the film really demands a gonzo over-the-top supervillain to match Hardy’s level of performance. Scott Haze and Reid Scott are in relatively thankless roles (though I do applaud Scott’s role as Williams’ new boyfriend for having the decency to make him both plot-relevant and not a jerk), and why is Jenny Slate even in this movie? The role demands someone nowhere near her level and doesn’t even use her comedic talents; methinks there is a lot of her left on the cutting room floor. On a technical level, the film feels just as out of time as the rest of the picture. The action sequences are a Michael Bay-level mess, overloading the eyes with dynamic motion and moving too fast for the eye to register what’s going on. That’s when action is even there, as there is a surprising lack of it; there’s only really two and a half Venom-heavy action sequences in the whole thing. Maybe all of this is because the visual effects themselves look incredibly dated too. The symbiotes actually look worse than the one in Spider-Man 3, going for a slimy goop effect that never looks right no matter the lighting or animation. The Venom design itself is impressive as a faithful recreation of the character, but in motion it ends up looking as goofy as Ghost Rider did on the big screen; some thins just don’t translate from page to screen. The film even has a tie-in Eminem song that plays over the credits; how much more anachronistic can this movie get at this point? Venom is a bad movie. There is no questioning that. It’s a film conceived for cynical intellectual property reasons, telling a near-incomprehensible plot cobbled together from the indecisive minds of behind-the-times producers, featuring a well-respected actor giving a bonkers performance that would be impressive if it wasn’t so confusing, and all slapped together with a veneer that brings to mind early-to-mid-2000s comic book movies for all the wrong reasons. However, if you are in the right mindset, it’s still incredibly watchable as a so-bad-its-good hot mess. Some have compared this movie to 2004’s Catwoman, and whilst there are parts of the comparison that are apt (both concern villains to a more famous hero removed from their source material, star lead actors way too good to be in them engaging in bizarre tick-led overacting, have an evil corporation based near water as the villain, feature CGI that look at least five years past their prime, AND have a subplot where the main character is annoyed by their neighbour playing music too loud and only having the nerve to do something about it after gaining powers), but I’d say that is going too far. Venom is more like the Ben Affleck Daredevil or Nicolas Cage Ghost Rider: tonally incoherent and ripe with edgelord angst, but so blissfully unapologetic about its inherent ridiculousness that it’s hard not to find enjoyment in it. So, if you go into this knowing not to expect anything more than trash, you’re going to have a great time. If you were expecting anything more, then what hole have you been living in since 1997?"

"Oct 31, 2018",negative," Intended as the first film in Sony Pictures’ wider Marvel Universe, the Tom Hardy-starring Venom is a desperately confused piece of work which has only a few compensatory pleasures to offer along the way. Not wishing to dish out another identikit offering of lycra-clad good guys and maniacal bad guys, Sony have taken a risk which, sadly, hasn’t quite paid off. As one of the most distinctive Spider-Man villains, on paper Venom was a smart choice to launch a wider film franchise. He looks like Spidey and does most of the things that a Spidey-like-man can, with one crucial USP. The film’s marketing campaigns have reminded more casual fans that Venom is, as his name might suggest, a villain. This offers viewers the enticing prospect of a step away from superhero clichés: a superhero film, without the hero. Crucially, Venom doesn’t involve Spider-Man in the slightest. The action all takes place in San Francisco rather than New York, where we learn that Eddie Brock (Hardy) has been exiled after upsetting former employers with his rogue brand of gonzo journalism. Things start to go from bad to worse for Eddie when he tries to take on the Elon Musk-like science billionaire Carlton Drake (Riz Ahmed). Drake has been doing some deep space exploration using his private fleet of spacecraft and, in the process, has discovered a collection of strange alien entities which he terms “symbiotes”. After bringing them back to Earth, Drake’s team discover that these creatures require an oxygen-breathing host in order to survive on the planet and Drake will stop at nothing to understand an alien race which he believes can help save mankind from a self-made extinction brought on by global warming and overpopulation. Sound a little megalomaniacal to you? Well, you’d be right, and the “crazy genius” trope is just one superhero cliché which the film circles gamely despite supposedly being cut from new cloth. Ahmed is poorly cast as an unfeeling psychopath and whilst Hardy works hard to bring his central character to life, the script seems just as confused about Brock’s character as it is with the question of what exactly Venom is meant to be. Since Brock has to ‘wear’ Venom in some capacity, the difficulty of representing interactions between the two is a constant problem. The film often resorts to Venom being voiced as an auditory hallucination – giving rise to some very feeble attempts at humour – and the script is plagued by a sense of poor internal logic and two-dimensional characters. Its greatest achievement, beyond a hard-working cast which also includes Michelle Williams as love interest Anne Weying, is the work of its SFX team who make the writhing, sprawling symbiotes look creepily beautiful."
"Oct 30, 2018",negative," Once upon a time, a major studio decided to make a superhero film. They based the film around a character who had been around for decades and had started as a villain but had since become an antihero. The character was part of another superhero’s universe and had already appeared in a film starring that hero, but the franchise was rebooted several times in the 10 or so years it took to get the character’s film made.  Once upon a time, a major studio decided to make a superhero film.

The character was part of another superhero’s universe and had already appeared in a film starring that hero, but the franchise was rebooted several times in the 10 or so years it took to get the character’s film made. Once the film was released, it was revealed that the character had almost no connection to the franchise that birthed it, took extreme liberties with its source material, and was a complete and total mess with lousy CGI, a confused plot, a clunky script, and one singular, over-the-top performance that made it worthwhile-bordering-on-essential. That describes Venom, Sony’s latest attempt to create their own bargain-bin Marvel Cinematic Universe. It also describes Catwoman, the notorious bomb starring Halle Berry from 2004. I could probably end the review right here, but let’s continue. Our…ahem…”hero” is Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy), a hipster journalist with his own muck-racking-style show on an undisclosed television network. When assigned to do a puff piece on possibly-evil-but-actually-really-evil billionaire Carlton Drake (Riz Ahmed), Eddie confronts Drake on camera about alleged crimes and lawsuits against him. Eddie gets fired and subsequently gets dumped by his lawyer girlfriend Anne (Michelle Williams), since Eddie broke into Anne’s laptop to discover incriminating information on Drake. Six months later, Eddie’s contacted by a doctor at Drake’s foundation. They’re concerned with Drake’s most recent experiments, which involve fusing humans to alien lifeforms that Drake’s research team had discovered on a seemingly-routine manned space reconnaissance mission. (You know…as you do.) While snooping around Drake’s labs, Eddie encounters one of the lifeforms. Calling itself “Venom” (also Tom Hardy), it bonds to Eddie in a weird symbiosis, giving Eddie superpowers and sick upper body gainz but also putting his life in danger and making him a target for Drake’s schemes. That’s a lot of plot set-up, and the film doesn’t hold back in dumping it all on us as quickly and unceremoniously as possible. One thing you might have noticed wasn’t in that summary is the name of a certain web-spinning, wall-crawling hero named Spider-Man. You know, the character that Venom originally served as an antagonist for and who gave Venom his start 30 years ago. That’s because this is a Venom film without any connection to Spider-Man or the Marvel Cinematic Universe, which makes about as much sense as a Catwoman film with no connection to Batman. That doesn’t mean the film itself can’t be an interesting, exciting piece of superhero entertainment, of course. That also doesn’t mean that Venom is any of those things, either. The biggest problem Venom has is a clear lack of identity and purpose. It’s a narrative reflection of Eddie’s confusion after he bonds with Venom, but it’s ultimately not a good look for the film. It begins as a serious drama with some mild, tepid attempts at light comedy, but once Venom himself shows up, it turns into a neutered black comedy, a PG-13 attempt to replicate the sarcastic, metatextual vibe of Deadpool that only occasionally works. It’s a film about an alien invader that eats brains and indiscriminately kills people that’s appropriate for the whole family! And it takes forever for Venom to show up. We don’t get Eddie’s first full-on transformation into the big, black mother from outer space until nearly the half-way point of a film that isn’t even two hours long. Eddie doesn’t even get bonded to Venom until at least 30 minutes into the film’s runtime, and before that we’re treated to situations and plot lines so mundane and pointless that they threaten to bury the film before it even begins. Even after Venom starts his rampage and finally injects some semblance of life into the proceedings, the film feels ridiculously earth-bound and restrained. That relative simplicity worked well for direct Ruben Fleischer in his previous film Zombieland, but he seems wildly out of his depth with a (barely) nine-digit-budget superhero tentpole. There’s none of the wit and clever action from Zombieland here. There is plenty of confusing choreography, blurry movement, poor framing, and dated, lackluster CGI work. Venom itself looks great, but the rest of the effects all look second-rate in comparison. Fleischer isn’t solely to blame for the film’s schizophrenic and muddy tone, however. Between the three screenwriters, they’re responsible for The 5th Wave, The Dark Tower, Kangaroo Jack, and 50 Shades of Grey. So maybe we never stood a chance. Aside from the dialogue between Eddie and Venom, which provides the film with some of the only moments of intentional comedy and genuine chemistry, the script feels sloppy, inorganic, and automatic, as if it was generated by a computer program trying to make the hottest superhero film of 1998. Characters tend to be blunt and prone to exposition, and aside from Eddie, nobody’s dialogue has much color or flavor. What makes the film worth watching, however, is Tom Hardy’s committed, off-the-wall performance as both Eddie and Venom. As Eddie, he’s fascinatingly bizarre, slurring and mumbling most of his dialogue and reacting even to the most extreme moments with a strange detachment. It’s like a Nicholas Cage performance if Cage was in it for love and not money. As Venom, Hardy is sinister and wickedly charismatic, and it’s here the we get the most fully-realized moments of the film. This is the Venom we want to see on screen, and this is the Venom that actually works as a main character (sorry, Topher Grace…still love ya, though). The interplay between Eddie and Venom has more chemistry than anyone else in the film, especially between Eddie and Anne. Tom Hardy tries his best, but Michelle Williams seems completely uninterested in selling it or even being on screen. She’s a talented actress, but she’s clearly not checked in here, painfully smiling through her scenes in a discount Vicki Vale wig. There’s also no chemistry between Eddie and Riz Ahmed’s Carlton Drake. Again, a talented actor stuck in a thankless role that he isn’t investing with any of his own energy. Drake is so generic a villain that he barely makes an impact, fueled completely by negative space. In many ways, Venom feels like a film that should have come out in the late 90s or early 00s, more along the lines of more mercenary films like Spawn and The Hulk as opposed to something like Spider-Man: Homecoming. It’s not interested in explicitly setting up its own franchise — even though that’s clearly what Sony has started doing — but it also doesn’t try to make itself anything more than a glossed-up ashcan copy, produced just to keep the character in-house. The “in association with Marvel” credit during the opening titles might as well have read “thanks to Marvel for not buying back the rights to characters we don’t know what to do with.” If Sony does go ahead with their own cinematic universe, though, at least they have a great Venom in Tom Hardy. If only he had a better-equipped director, screenwriters, visual effects, and supporting cast. For my money, Halle Berry would have made a great Catwoman, too. You know, if only."
"Oct 29, 2018",positive," For a movie that’s currently living in the shadow of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, you can tell everyone involved in Venom really wanted to do their best to show off. In the movie, Tom Hardy takes on the familiar comic book character, Eddie Brock, who bonds with the Symbiote known as Venom. And though there are a few messy moments in the condensed hour and fifty-something minute movie, let’s just get this out the way now: it’s a big improvement from Spider-Man 3. The key to seeing this film is coming in with a fresh mind. It may be hard to not think about the smashing success of Avengers: Infinity War or Black Panther, but we have to remember that superhero and comic book movies are about having fun. Sometimes they don’t have to have a profound message or make leave a huge mark on pop culture, and that’s where Venom sits. Described as a movie that somehow escaped from 2004 and found its way to the present day, there is certainly a pre-MCU movie feel to it. They’re not reinventing the wheel here; things are quite formulaic. Hardy starts out as a man who has everything until things get turned upside down, and he’s suddenly a loser. His fiancée, Anne (played by Michelle Williams), dumps him for another guy and he’s out of his high-profile job. The character building for Eddie is a bit elusive at the start, and it’s not quite clear what we’re supposed to think of him. We know Venom is an anti-hero, but that’s not really what Eddie Brock is about until he meets Venom. Although, it’s hard to engage my suspicious of disbelief that Tom Hardy is a well-meaning loser when only a few years ago, he was kicking Batman’s butt as Bane. Needless to say, he’s still pretty ripped from that movie, and it makes it hard to believe that this guy is supposed to be as sweet and innocent as a basket of kittens. The pacing is a bit slow until Venom finally bonds with Eddie. There are a few jokes here and there before that, but it’s Venom’s character that really livens the movie up. It’ll make you ask why he wasn’t introduced much earlier. And it’s his character that ultimately saves the day — or, rather, the movie. Venom’s whimsical moments are also why you’ll understand that this movie definitely deserves a rating of PG-13 and not the R-rating that so many people had imagined. It also seems like a marketing snafu, where many assumed by the trailers that it would be a much darker movie than it actually is. Venom is definitely a more light-hearted movie. And while there are definitely some PG-13 moments, the action and comedy are something akin to the Michael Bay’s Transformers movies. In contrast to Venom/Eddie is the powerful Carlton Drake (Riz Ahmed): the Wilson Fisk kind of guy who appears to be nice on the outside, but on the inside, he’s pulling some series illegal strings (like testing Symbiotes on unwilling subjects kind of strings). Ahmed’s performance isn’t terrible in this. He’s just playing a cut-and-dried villain whom we’ve seen so many times before. Really, he himself is hardly a thorn in Eddie/Venom’s side until the very last moment. And this brings up one of the most glaring problems of Venom: the pacing. With most action/comic book movies reaching well over the two-hour mark, Venom sets itself aside. Technically, the official runtime is 1 hour and 52 times, but that seems to be because of the long credits and two (yes two) mid-credits scenes. The actual movie feels a lot shorter than that. With supposedly around 40 minutes of scenes being cut, you might actually find yourself wondering, “is the movie actually winding up? It seems like this is the end, but everything is happening so quickly.” So much so, in fact, that it might be hard to see what the whole point of the final “boss battle” is about in the first place. All that being said, yes, the movie deserves a bit of criticism. It isn’t perfect, and if you hold it up to the MCU’s or even Fox’s Deadpool’s light, you might come out disappointed. But if you’re just in for a fun time that includes some laugh-worthy moments and a great spin on an old character, then you’ll be in for a pretty enjoyable time. © 2024 Minute Media - All Rights Reserved.
