Apr 13 2024,negative,the most god awfull piece of junk that the world has ever seen
Apr 13 2024,negative,its incredible how dreamworks has turned into a parody studio of its own works
Apr 12 2024,negative,horrible downgrade and it felt like it was one big cutscene that wasnt skippable
Apr 11 2024,negative,despite the original being over a decade older its a lot more entertaining than this garbage and imo has better animation i get that writing is hard but howd it end up this bad and howd the animation deteriorate drastically
Apr 10 2024,negative,its a hate letter to fans of the first movie
Apr 10 2024,negative,not the same actors not very exciting boring
Apr 10 2024,negative,i gave this movie about ten minutes before turning it off how dare they make such a poor sequel to one of the greatest movies of all time 
Apr 8 2024,negative,goes against everything the original movie did and stood for its been rebooted to be just a cheap attempt to attract kids and is probably one of if not the worst animated movies ever made
Apr 8 2024,negative,do i even need to bother explaining why this sucks probably not xd
Apr 7 2024,negative,i dont even think that this movie deserves half a star i sold my soul when i decided to watch this movie and had a notebook and pen in hand because i knew it was going to be bad they had only a few character models with the colour schemes swapped out and claimed to be different for example the same model is used for a police officer a bank teller a donut shop worker a donut shop customer and multiple background characters which sometimes will all be in the same shot i mean its ok to cut corners so that you can use the budget to increase the overall quality of the movie but  1 there is a difference between cutting corners and just being to lazy to use more than five models  2 they definitely did not cut corners to invest more into the rest of the movie which is obvious when shrek 2 came out 20 years ago and is still leagues ahead of this shameful cash grab    the characters are completely diluted into mere shadows of their former selves the villains are dumbed down to stretch the run time and it was so bad that not a single voice actor wanted to be correlated to this movie i will have no more dreams after this movie only terrifying visions of megaminds huge blue forehead which is obviously filled with nothing but helium since the animators made it look like a huge balloon taped to his head that haunt me when i sleep provoking me to wake up to be greeted by my sleep paralysis demon keiko i dont know how to spell her name i only know how to pronounce it and that she is a shameless self insert for the 5 year olds who arent paying attention to the movie because if they would they would probably still say this is cringe and turn it off    the writers should already file for bankruptcy because with megamind vs the doom syndicate on their resume not even mcdonalds will want them and theyre serving rat poison in big mac form

Apr 4 2024,negative,ill be honest i didnt expect much from this film but i definitely thought it would be a little better extremely simple and lazy weak script silly and shallow characters that look like a bunch of clowns but in this case not funny which was probably the intention and the animation that seems to have come straight from a mobile game a shame to receive this after the first film that was so good and creative
Apr 4 2024,negative,this movie was so disposable megamind was a phenomenal movie this part 2 was the worst there could have been  i felt i was watching paw patrol because of the graphics that distracted me so much i cant tell you much more i was so disappointed with this gross movie  i enrolled to rotten tomatoes just to rate this movie

Apr 3 2024,positive,it has a somewhat good story but the dialogue just ruins it and the animation is really good just no cgi to layer it it would say that they tried their best on the animation and the story it fits well with megamind and i enjoy the teamwork that magamind has with others

Apr 2 2024,negative,nothing like the first one
Apr 2 2024,negative,absolute disgrace of a cash grab that baits adult fans of the 2010 film why was this directed at kids people who saw megamind in 2010 are now teensyoung adultsadults  this is even referenced in the opening where he literally says i see old friends followed by countless other references yet this was made for literal infants not only is it terrible but its absolutely kiddified to make the babies happy absolutely atrocious and everyone involved should be ashamed

Apr 1 2024,negative,megamind two is a terrible sequel first of all meg have the dube syndicate as the through the original it was always just him and metro man and nobody else plus this is the first movie plus they literally changed minions name to chum plus that little girl in the movie is super annoying plus they have an end credit seen  like megamind three gonna happen get out of my face thats not even talking about the animation this looks like a dream works animated five year yearold show thats about how none of the original cast returns or the animators get out of my face
Apr 1 2024,negative,i think i lost 2 years of my life from this movie i feel sad and angry my soul does not feel the same ever this movie is the worst movie ever created
Apr 1 2024,negative,after about 15 minuets i turned to my wife and said this kinda sucks she agreed and we watched something else later i finished watching it because i dont like not finishing a movie it was so bad the dialog character story and dialog was so bad my 10 year old could have done better   schaffrillas review made me laugh something the actually movie could not do

Apr 1 2024,negative,whats your least favourite movie  well i guarantee its better then this
Apr 1 2024,negative,not that great a film it had so much potential and dreamworks had to ruin it because of their dreamworks television studio and how they make their shows low budget which i find stupid since they managed to actually make a hit back in 2022 and yet they still manage to make a sequel worse like pixar doesnt have their charm either 110 dont recommend
Mar 31 2024,negative,what was this piece of garbage movie this is just a terrible movie with terrible writing and terrible jokes it was bad enough when i saw the streaming service animation you know what im talking about and worst than this movie just being bad it is a follow up to the masterpiece megamind if this was just some stupid spinoff tv show no one would care but no they hyped us up and this came out as the quote long awaited sequel to megamind this is just insulting what was dreamworks even thinking with this one
Mar 31 2024,negative,aint no way somebody agreed to put this piece of garbage out to the public 
Mar 31 2024,negative,horrible the animation the story this movie ruins everything about megamind and completely destroys what was good about the first movie
Mar 31 2024,negative,oh how do i stop four villains at once shoot them with the dehydration gun
Mar 31 2024,negative,the truth is that the film is horrible in all aspects leaving aside the animation the story of the first film is completely deformed to give it sense to this movie making it if you saw the first movie you are going to  hate this movie there are too many bad things  for a simple review it doesnt deserve even half a star
Mar 31 2024,negative,just why its an insult to a fantastic movie that didnt need a sequel let alone a shitty cringey poorly animated and voiced one
Mar 31 2024,negative,there is no easter bunny there is no tooth fairy and there is no megamind 2
Mar 30 2024,negative,im disappointed in dreamworks for this pile of trash
Mar 30 2024,negative,the animation lacked movement and the charecters were stupid this isnt the dreamworks that i know
Mar 30 2024,negative,honestly this movie is a disgrace to the original megamind it was clearly created by network executives to get more people to subscribe to peacock by advertising this movie to its original audience this movie has terrible animation that doesnt even compare to the originals animation which was 14 years ago the plot is a disaster and it was obviously made for very young children who are probably too young to have seen the original this movie rips the original ideas and narrative from megamind and throws them into a trash compactor to then burn them i urge everyone whos seen this movie to not hate on the animators voice actors or writers but to focus on the diabolical executives who had the idea to release this travesty to the world
Mar 30 2024,negative,howdoyoudofellowkids
Mar 30 2024,negative,they really said your welcome as if they brought us something way better than the original this film is a disgrace to megaminds legacy
Mar 30 2024,negative,we are all living a fantasy there is no easter bunny there is no tooth fairy and there is no megamind sequel
Mar 30 2024,negative,a paw patrol episode is goated compared to this
Mar 30 2024,negative,megamind 2 was something we all wanted but not in this way the animation was very bad and they had 14 years to have better animation than the original ive only slept through one movie and that was super puppies when i was 5 years old this is the most saddest most deranged sequel i have ever seen in my 11 years as a movie critic i will now list off all the things theyve done wrong in this sequel    1 couldve used the dehydration gun on the gofishgang earlier  2 couldve used the dehydration gun on the doom syndicate earlier  3 forgot to animate a character at the rave in megaminds quarters  4 bad animation  5 jokes that are either unfunny or dont make sense in general  6 voice acting is bad  7 character design is mediocre  8 unfunny meme references  9 no megamind and roxxane relationship when the original movie clearly stated they were dating in the end  10 mayor is dumb and roxxane has to help everybody including trained paramedics and firemen  11 doom syndicate was never mentioned in the original megamind saying that it was him and minion against the world in the original  12 post credit scene doesnt make sense because megamind learned all of his villainy in prison in the original movie
Mar 30 2024,negative,it was just horrible it seems that the directors didnt remember the first movie i just want  to save you some time   do not watch the movie if you are a fan of megamind

Mar 29 2024,negative,id love to say that i passionately hate how cheap and lame this turned out to be but i have no passionate feelings for this its just saddening that this was announced as the masterpiece sequel we waited 14 years for and then it ended up being the most boring and frustrating experience 2024 has offered so far
Mar 28 2024,negative,id rather watch paw patrol on repeat than to ever watch this again this is such a spit in the face to the ones who love mega mind my 3 year old asked for me to turn it off within the first 15 minutes of watching it dreamworks proved to us that they just wanted a quick cash grab with this one the original was legendary and will forever to down as one of our favorite animated movies but this one will forever be an epic fail do better dreamworks

Mar 28 2024,negative,bad animation unexpected cast change i wanted that this didnt exist but no  i also wont count as a dreamworks movie
Mar 28 2024,negative,would love to go lower than half a star but i dont blame the people who made this they were just doing there job and maybe they actually tried but it wasnt good but i blame the executives who didnt care was so bored i didnt even watch the film and watched youtube instead i wouldnt watch it 010

Mar 27 2024,negative,megadipshit vs the drug addiction syndicate
Mar 27 2024,negative,theres an occasional joke that lands some of the voice acting isnt terrible and the new theme song is an unironic banger yet its a sequel that lacks all charm of the original where most jokes dont land and its riddled with weird story elements that contradict the superior first film
Mar 27 2024,negative,this movie fucking sucks absolute ass  not only does it just suck but it also ruined a classic  dreamworks come onnn dude i wanna like you man
Mar 27 2024,negative,no explanation needed this movie is gutter trash
Mar 27 2024,negative,this has to be a prototype for ai generated movies right
Mar 27 2024,negative,this movie was by far the worst movie ive ever watched what was dreamworks and peacock thinking it was so bad i quit watching it after 13 minutes into the movie had to painfully watch the rest of the movie megamind 2 destroyed everything the first megamind movie gave us destroyed the entire franchise and now they have a series clearly the writers didnt know what they were doing what a joke
Mar 27 2024,negative,that graphics was  i cant believe dreamworks letting peacock to cook
Mar 27 2024,negative,this movie is just absolutely terrible the animation is bad the voices are annoying the jokes suck the entire plot of this movie utterly wrecks not only its own movie but the original megamind as well the doom syndicate takes the timeline and the charm the original had and throws it into a toilet craps on it and then flushes it into nuclear waste infected waters and remember megamind you know the genuis funny and witty character who learnt how to be humble and by the end of the movie is a genuine good guy say goodbye to that he forgets that he has the easiest solution to the problem at his side 90 percent of the time with the dehydration gun and is just an utter douchebag i refuse to acknowledge this movies existence in comparison to the original that alongside the tv show i dont even want to try and watch
Mar 27 2024,negative,never in my life have i watched a movie that bad to where i had to take a break after 2 minutes each time it was so retarted its actually crazy the animation by the way wasnt wven animation i could have made something more aesthetically pleasing with chalk and a pavement the only funny joke in this entire movie is that megamind or whatever says you are welcome for this sequel at the start 
Mar 27 2024,negative,i do not even have to say anything about this movie the worst movie of the century
Mar 27 2024,negative,didnt even watch it the trailer was trash and the animation team sucks the old megamind is better to be honest i dont like the transition between megamind suddenly becoming a villan 110 do not recommend
Mar 27 2024,negative,they completely ruined one of the best dreamworks movies of all time none of the characters are in personality and the writing is absolutely terrible shallow plot and clearly a cheap movie for attention speaking of attention they probably made this movie awful on purpose so that it would be more popular even though its megamind 
Mar 26 2024,negative,this is an insult dreamworks thinks they can win us over because were nostalgic for the first film and marketed it towards us specifically instead of kids but dreamworks forgot that we are all 20 something now and we actually like substance in movies now and not just bright colors and wacky characters the amount of words that arent swears cannot contain my distain towards dreamworks for thinking megamind deserved a watered down dead on arrival trying to be hip straight to streaming sequel while boss baby a movie that was absolutely awful undeserving of being oscar nominated next to pixars coco and made me lose faith in their entire company until puss in boots 2 got a theatrical sequel one that unironically thinks calling someone a boomer is till funny dreamworks what happened you used to be cool but now youre just illumination sad and depressing
Mar 26 2024,negative,no just no its megamind but made in a rush
Mar 26 2024,negative,iv only seen the trailer and im dissapointed it feels like dreamwork didnt even try and yet the 2010 version is better go watch if you want hour tooken away lololol
Mar 25 2024,negative,why cant i make this zero stars  no will ferrel no bueno  just not good
Mar 25 2024,negative,if youre looking for a movie that will redefine your standards for bad look no further than megamind vs the doom syndicate its a masterclass in disappointment with graphics that make you question if its intentionally retro or just lazily designed the script oh its as if the developers threw in every cliché and called it innovation and lets not forget the storyline  its like they put plot points in a blender and hoped for the best in short its the perfect example of what not to do when creating a game so if youre into that sort of masochistic experience this is the game for you enjoy the mediocrity
Mar 25 2024,negative,a piece of  that does not comply with the original movie and an animation worse than that of a 7yearold child it is only made to advertise their horrible seriesun 1 de 10
Mar 25 2024,negative,this movie is not as bad as wish its just boring its not atrocious but its boring why did you change megaminds personality he was a fun character so why change him if this movie was just a super hero movie it would have worked megamind rules would have worked as just a superhero show but making megamind a social media influencer is a stupid idea especially if it means changing megaminds personality
Mar 25 2024,negative,worst movie of the decade doesnt look good and and no original voice actor for megamind i also hated the character keko  also mega mind is stupid in this movie
Mar 25 2024,negative,so bad i didnt think it was possible to make a sequel this bad i wanted another megamind movie since i was a kid if the was the movie i was shown i would have told you not to bother
Mar 24 2024,negative,this movie is absolutely garbage a bunch of voice actors from the original moviethe trailer is so cringeworthy    the movie megamind vs the doom syndicate 2024 is a terrible sequel to the popular animated film megamind 2010 which was one of dreamworkss best animated films the movie has a great voice cast 3d animation and many funny and memorable moments however the sequel is terrible due to poor voice acting bad 3d animation bad action and poorly written humor    the character minion has a bad name change to ol chum and a voice actor that doesnt work well for the character he is left on his own working somewhere else which is too weird for a movie like this roxanne ritchi is also not voiced well and does not do much in the movie except be part of a big lie keiko morita a fan of megamind is annoying and added in to scenes where she did not need to show up    the doom syndicate with members lady doppler lord nightyknight pierre pressure and behemoth are awful villains who get annoying and use their abilities for stupid things that make no sense the 3d animation is terrible looking like a lowbudget movie dumped on a streaming service it makes the characters not look good and doesnt make any of the action scenes fun to watch the movie is filled with dumb scenes that make it hard to watch and feels longer than it was    the sequel is not worth watching at all i highly recommend watching the original megamind 2010 because while that movie was funny and fun to watch this movie was boring badly animated and not funny making it hard to watch the only reason to have it on is to put it on for little kids as a distraction if you want a continuation to the first movie i recommend checking out the short from dreamworks megamind the button of doom 2011 because it has the same voice actors great 3d animation and funny humor from the first movie spend your time watching that instead of wasting your time on this terrible sequel
Mar 24 2024,negative,i would rate lower if i could the writing and animation were lazy i am convinced the entire movie was produced by an ai fed the first megamind movie terrible ruined megamind for me forever sad very sad

Mar 23 2024,negative,sad to see honestly from such a masterpiece to this garbage quality was not it it actually is worse and thats surprising since the first movie came out 14 years ago the animation was horrible and the character development just disappeared nothing about this movie and its characters have anything of the previous personalities that we once knew and loved dont waste your time wanna watch megamind just watch the old movie youll save yourself

Mar 13 2024,negative,that film is bad and that does not have will ferrell in the film neither did the original cast there
Mar 13 2024,positive,i really enjoyed watching this i thought that it was a good time full of laughs and giggles with my family glad megamind is back
Mar 13 2024,negative,an offensive sequel to a great original horrible cgi writing and some obnoxious characters
Mar 12 2024,negative,i dont even think they even tried on this one majority of the voice actors of the original show wasnt even on it so it was so out of place
Mar 12 2024,negative,i think that this movie is mostly for younger people for the most part i liked the beginning of the movie but it wasnt good all the way through the only good scene was the jean paul gaultier parfum meme
Mar 12 2024,negative,its quite pitiful how a movie that came out 14 years ago has better animation dont waste your time watching it it is the worst sequel if not movie i have ever seen
Mar 12 2024,negative,bad animation bad plot megamind was ruined in this movie megamind 1 is better
Mar 12 2024,negative,terrible movie couldnt sit through more than 20 minutes
Mar 12 2024,positive,megamind vs the doom syndicate beautifully captures the hilarity and heart of the original megamind movie while bringing the beloved big blueheaded hero into a new chapter
Mar 12 2024,negative,youre welcome to turn off the tv with none of the original cast or animation style the movie feels like a parody of the original movie and its subsequent shorts the movie never needed a squeal and this creation highlighted the original masterpiece even more
Mar 12 2024,negative,worst movie ive ever seen in my life
Mar 12 2024,negative,i do not recommend for anyone
Mar 12 2024,negative,at this point peacock would rather pay people to watch what id call a youtube video rather than a movie
Mar 12 2024,negative,the worst thing i have ever seen
Mar 12 2024,negative,just an obsolete trash movie  its really pity that dreamworks has no longer any scruples
Mar 11 2024,negative,do not watch this movie it is a waste of time dare i say effort and a pecock subscription you can feel the cheapness in it and you can also tell that dreamworks even declined it and sent it straight to pecock
Mar 11 2024,negative,they only made this movie to push out the new series thats why its so bad i was on my phone the entire time of this movie when i was watching it i wish i could give 0 stars but oh well dreamworks has disappointed us
Mar 11 2024,negative,this is the worst movie ive watched this year  its an insult to the first movie
Mar 11 2024,negative,it was disappointing to say the least
Mar 11 2024,negative,this movie mixes everything that is wrong with mediocre sequels megamind and this ugly cgi dreamworks tv show artstyle
Mar 11 2024,negative,when i had originally put this movie on my tv screen i was expecting the quality of the original 2010 megamind looking through the cast list not many from the original movie are in this it lacks the animation spark the original had and its a little strange seeing the uncanny i cannot describe it to a tee but something feels off and it feels a little too bright the colors and backgrounds feel a little bit like an animated show on a budget the closest show i can relate this to is miraculous ladybug although no hate to said show the new characters werent bad although they lacked some structure like metroman and titan in the first movie   the characters feel thrown in because nothing of them was mentioned in the first movie megamind seemed as a riding solo type of villain unless it was with minion so hearing about a villain group had me puzzled i think it was an odd choice to have this set two days after megamind defeats titan i feel as if the civilians and roxanne wouldnt trust megamind immediately as much as they did in this movie allaround it felt very 2d and it didnt feel like it had the magic of the original i may be biased because i really enjoyed the original movie but this feels rushed and has very surface area themes and lessons
Mar 10 2024,negative,if 0 stars were an option i would have done that dont waste your time
Mar 10 2024,positive,it was genuinely enjoyable is it as good as the original no is it still a good movie definitely
Mar 10 2024,negative,awful sequel to such an amazing first film this ruins megamind cheap animation and no effort was put in to this at all how disappointing
Mar 10 2024,negative,terrible a low quality piece of garbage that spits into the faces of old megamind fans megamind vs the doom syndicate should be deleted and sent to the shadow realm
Mar 10 2024,negative,simply the worst movie ever dreamworks have made so far definitely dont waste your time to watch this cheap cashgrab
Mar 10 2024,negative,i couldnt last more then 15 minutes and the only good thing in the 15 minutes was a quote by the bad guys
Mar 10 2024,negative,moviereview megamindvsthedoomsyndicate    dreamworks megamind vs the doom syndicate may not be their finest work but its not as dreadful as you might anticipate    one major downside is that the characters seem to play second fiddle only to take the spotlight later on with none of the original cast returning and the new voices feel somewhat out of place the movie is exclusively available on peacock which may deter some viewers    the plot meanders and the execution feels disjointed with sporadic fun moments amidst a sea of inconsistencies ultimately its a watchitifyoufeellikeit kind of film personally i dont see myself revisiting it anytime soon it simply exists without leaving a lasting impact
Mar 10 2024,negative,this thing has a perfectly fluent in english megamid that has none of the original charm and has faces that could have been edited better on a free trial of a photo editor there is also the fact that in the original megamid and metro man were the only differentsuper powered beings therfore creating the problem of where the  did the other supers come from this movie also reeks of plain stupidity aswell as the fact that i was bored out of my damn mind  despite the fact that there was multiple plot points and action scenes dont waste your eyesight on this shameful disgrace of a creation that should never have been released
Mar 10 2024,negative,undoubtedly the worst movie dreamworks has ever made
Mar 10 2024,negative,i give it 010 the movie is extremely cheap and awful to watch  dont recommend it

Mar 9 2024,negative,an awful watch what a waste of my time and efforts
Mar 9 2024,negative,its as if the sequel was ordered from wishcom
Mar 9 2024,negative,in addition to the fact that the budget for this is two pizzas and a coke it seems that dreamworks only did this so that people would stop asking them for a megamind sequel there is no effort or heart in this sequel
Mar 9 2024,negative,that was garbage did they spend 50k on stuff again cuz that was low budget 
Mar 9 2024,negative,fuck you you fucking dick

Mar 9 2024,negative,this is a movie that does not respect the original work everything learned in the first film here it is as if it never happened apart from it looks horrible and very low budget everything is wrong

Mar 9 2024,negative,the single worst dreamworks movie of all time
Mar 9 2024,negative,why did they make this monstrosity
Mar 9 2024,negative,it horrible man i waited 14 years for this  the animation is gross the little girl is so annoying   the story is dispointing me but megamind said hello instead of ollo  but im pretty sad that minion name is chum instead of his original name and this movie will be the worst movie of 2024 i ever seen in my life before
Mar 9 2024,negative,one of the worst dreamworks sequels ever made
Mar 9 2024,negative,thank you dreamworks for hiring a south american animation company and slapping your name on it liked when it ended disliked the 123 runtime before the ending
Mar 9 2024,negative,this breaks my heart so much time wasted and we didnt get the sequel we wanted but i know they can be redeemed because we all make mistakes and i know that in megamind 3 things will get better i hope
Mar 9 2024,negative,abysmal outdated and cringe references super boring overall if they are going to make another megamind and release it in theaters ignore this movie and dont make it canon please
Mar 9 2024,positive,ignore the negative reviews this is peak cinema the part when megamind says its doom syndicating time and proceeded to doom syndicate all over metrocity was truly one of the moments of all time doomsyndicatesweep
Mar 9 2024,negative,this was just as bad if not worse as the last airbender movie how can you mess up this bad i couldnt even sit through five minutes of it
Mar 9 2024,positive,this movie although not as great as the first instalment is surprisingly good given the track record animation movies now days have

Mar 8 2024,negative,my dead dog is more alive than this movie
Mar 8 2024,negative,the animation looks like a 12 year old made it the actors are even worse the story is clunky and megamind looks he is a virgin this is disrespectful to the original movie negative 100 worst movie of 2024 no scratch that worst movie of all time
Mar 8 2024,negative,this movie lacks any of the spirit in the first one is horribly executed and isnt even safe and adapted for the more little viewers  there are several nasty scenes with a big hairy brown cockroach in the film i definitely dont recommend that sequel for any age range just skip it
Mar 8 2024,negative,do i need to say anything

Mar 8 2024,negative,the first was a timeless masterpiece and this is like they got an ai to watch half of the first film and generate a poorly animated short film from it
Mar 8 2024,negative,it was really bad the first movie was one of my childhood favs so when i watch this i felt so disappointed and his voice just didnt sound right sorry but what the hell was that
Mar 8 2024,negative,notmymegamind this sucks
Mar 8 2024,negative,this movie definetly is not canon in the mega mind universe the animation sucks the voices sucks the characters sucks lost the love and soul of the first movie this movie is only a big and bad attempt to make money with a movie that all loves the first movie

Mar 8 2024,negative,my boy theyre killing my boy
Mar 8 2024,negative,only streaming is the new straight to dvd
Mar 8 2024,negative,though it contains none of the narrative genius of the first movie megamind 2 has enough nice moments to entertain at least 3 of its viewers
Mar 8 2024,negative,it was horrible bad animation bad characters bad plotthe story makes no sense with the last moviethe movie in general its just the worst movie made my dreamwoks
Mar 7 2024,negative,looks like it was made before the real megamind dont spend your time watching all you will get is a headache from the ps2 graphics
Mar 7 2024,negative,horrible just watch the original megamind movie
Mar 7 2024,negative,the most this movie has going for it is the addition of the doom syndicate and even then theyre basically an offbrand vicious six
Mar 7 2024,negative,the animation style looks terrible
Mar 7 2024,negative,useless and annoying sequel so out of touch with the original
Mar 7 2024,negative,no plot no continuity completely cuts out the whole villain perspective thing
Mar 7 2024,negative,ive never even seen this movie and seeing these reviews must mean its that bad i bet myself this movie would get at most 30 on this website but i guess i wasnt far off     i just read the plot on wikipedia just a couple hours ago and megamind does the same mistake he already did in the first movie in the movie minion im not calling him chum feels like he was not a good sidekick so he confronts megamind and he fires minion funny because in the first movie minion leaves megamind after he sees that megamind doesnt want to be the bad guy anymore then minion comes back to aid megamind and they both forgive each other in the end so basically they learned nothing from the events from the first movie which is set 2 days earlier so then minion builds a donut shop      in the movie megamind reveals to the doom syndicate his old allies apparently that he had a plan to send metrocity to the moon that removes the point of wanting to own metrocity for himself in the beginning of the first movie it is explained that megamind always wanted to defeat the good guy metroman all megamind wanted to do was to defeat metroman and claim metrocity as his own city to wreak havoc upon sending metrocity to the moon just makes it pointless to defeat metroman in the first place megamind loved attempting to defeat metroman over and over again and when he eventually won he had fun making metrocity his own personal playground to have fun in sending it to the moon would make it irrelevant now that he would basically destroy the one thing that he wanted in the first place      in what i read on wikipedia a scene in the movie involves megamind attempting to fight the doom syndicate alone which is dumb enough already after losing to the doom syndicate all alone he hides in an alleyway to which roxanne finds megamind in the alley way and teaches megamind that its ok to ask help from others what she doesnt realize is that megamind already reached out for help from roxanne 2 days earlier in the first movie megamind in the first movie comes to roxanne for help to try to stop titan hal from destroying metrocity so once again that makes the first movie irrelevant to the second movie megamind doesnt need to learn what he already knows      if megamind wanted to stop the doom syndicate by himself then he shouldve used the battlesuit he had when he fought titan hal by himself sure it shows the battlesuit blowing up but it shows up at the end of the first movie with a boombox and minion in the cockpit megamind would have a better chance of winning using that robot in the first place due to the fact that it can take hits from street poles razors for shoulders spike boots and a flexible body making it good for trying to defeat the doom syndicate so why doesnt megamind use that suit to stop the doom syndicate in the first place he has an amazing intellect according to himself    side notes i dont really mind the actor change for the characters of the movie the actor for megamind for this movie is the same as the video game adaptation of the 1st movie so i dont blame the creators for picking the person out due to their previous works as the same character in defense of the actors its not their fault that they say the cringeworthy lines that were in the movie they are reading from the script given to them      so all and all the movie sucks not just as a sequel but as a movie itself the movie makes the first one irrelevant by making the characters not learn from what happened 2 days ago keiko being a character i never mentioned because i dont think she serves that much to the movies plot the animation is garbage the plan of sending metrocity to the moon is completely idiotic the doom syndicate was never even mentioned in the newspaper montage from the beginning of the movie and the movie ending on a poo joke if i had the option to i would give this a 025 star instead of the 05 star i already have so in summary this is a bad movie and an even worse sequel wow thats a lot of words just to say a movie was bad
Mar 7 2024,negative,this is probably one of the worst most waste of time movies anyone has ever made    theories of this being ai generated is probably correct with how obscene this entire movie was remove this movie from the list because theres no way this was made by an actual person
Mar 7 2024,negative,title megamind vs the doom syndicate a disappointing disaster    rating 15 stars    review    megamind vs the doom syndicate is a soulcrushing disappointment that fails to live up to its potential in every aspect from its lackluster plot to its uninspired characters this film is a prime example of how not to make a superhero showdown    the story follows megamind a former villain turned hero as he faces off against the doom syndicate a group of forgettable foes led by the bland and forgettable malice right from the start its clear that the filmmakers have run out of fresh ideas recycling tired tropes and clichés without adding anything new or exciting to the mix    the animation is equally underwhelming with stiff character movements and uninspired designs that lack the creativity and charm of other animated films in the genre even the action sequences which should be the films saving grace fall flat lacking the adrenaline and excitement needed to keep viewers engaged    but perhaps the films biggest sin is its complete lack of humor despite boasting a talented voice cast including will ferrell and tina fey the jokes in megamind vs the doom syndicate fall flat with awkward timing and predictable punchlines that elicit more groans than laughs    adding insult to injury is the films shallow message of redemption which feels tacked on and insincere megaminds journey from villain to hero lacks any real depth or emotional resonance making it difficult for audiences to invest in his character arc    in the end megamind vs the doom syndicate is a forgettable and poorly executed film that will leave viewers wishing they had spent their time and money elsewhere save yourself the agony and skip this disaster of a movie
Mar 7 2024,negative,this movie would have been really good if it came it out in 2002
Mar 7 2024,negative,a score of 0 really bad 
Mar 7 2024,negative,this is genuinely awful how did anyone watch this and think this was a good idea
Mar 7 2024,negative,the animation sucks and the sidekick is annoying the trailer told everything about the movies quality its trash just a cashgrab for peacock
Mar 7 2024,negative,honestly ive watched literally a hundreds animation movies in my life so far and i really cant remember a more terrible and choppy animated feature than this and a worse and more downgraded sequel to an animated film than this one  even sequels like the return of jafar rio 2 hoodwinked too and sherlock gnomes are way more acceptable adequate and appropriate for watching  this movie just hit the rock bottom megamind vs the doom syndicate isnt suitable even for little kids and toddlers theres a scene with a flying cockroach in the film its really disgusting and disturbing that socalled megamind sequel which is pretending to be canon is simply the pinacle of greed and miserliness of a descending animation studio and company which doesnt really care for anything beyond just making some more easy lazy cash
Mar 7 2024,negative,scale doesnt go low enough  0 stars  horrid piece of trash
Mar 7 2024,negative,it was bad and the original movie was better than megamind 2 and it should be thrown into a firepit its the worst experience i have ever seen it was good at the beginning seeing og megamind and all that hype took of when i saw off brand megamind very disappointed
Mar 7 2024,negative,the worst piece of garbage i dont have to say anything else

Mar 7 2024,negative,this went from megamind to nevermind this was not needed and did not need to exist
Mar 7 2024,negative,id rather watch cocomelon
Mar 7 2024,negative,megamind vs the doom syndicate is a disappointing addition to the megamind franchise with lackluster animation a convoluted plot and uninspired dialogue the film fails to capture the charm and wit of its predecessor the character development feels forced and the introduction of new villains falls flat overall its a forgettable experience that fails to live up to the original megaminds standards leaving audiences longing for the wit and humor that made the first film a hit
Mar 7 2024,negative,absolute garbage never in my life will i ever watch that again i would rather watch grass grow
Mar 7 2024,negative,this movie was so terrible its actually offensive made an account here just to give a disclaimer to anyone wanting to see this movie dont the entire movie drags on and feels like a short plot that was stretched out into an hour although some of the humor is funny the mind numbingly staleness of the animation voice acting and action ruin it completely great for a 3 year old horrible for anyone else
Mar 7 2024,negative,the most soulless and bland sequel ive ever seen a disgrace to the original megamind i hope it completely flops so that dreamworks gets the message
Mar 7 2024,positive,it was funny at some parts but it was just ok
Mar 7 2024,negative,my brain is so rotted from this movie nothing happened within the entire eon that it took to watch this absolute filthy trash god damn landfill of a movie end my life it was so bad i would rather watch all 1000 episodes of motu patlu
Mar 7 2024,negative,ill give the movie 110 i think the movie could have had a lot of good stuff in it it just can never be the original i laughed when it first came on and they low budget between words and into they had to skip it and they took it off paper of the dreamworks into so yeah i really hope we do get a real sequel please

Mar 7 2024,negative,it suck its the worst i hate it  i recommend not watching it
Mar 7 2024,negative,an absolute joke of a movie a terrible way to continue the megamind legacy it is truly dissapointing to see dreamworks sell the megamind image to peacock to absolutely destroy this beloved character we are tired of soulless sequels and reboots and we just want quality original content
Mar 7 2024,negative,nighty night is the only good thing to come out of this movie

Mar 7 2024,negative,dont even waste your time just rewatch the first movie 
Mar 7 2024,negative,its a waste of time this movie just made a megamind devolution ignoring everything from movie 1 even roxan is a simple accessory and nothing makes sense 
Mar 7 2024,negative,in a word abysmal i dont think there has ever been a worse case of a low effort cashgrab dragging itself over the legacy of a beloved movie you could get better animation from a class of second graders in half the time it took them to make this pile of trash lowkey fire whoever suggested this movie be made
Mar 7 2024,negative,im sorry i dont even want to watch the whole thing because im afraid this sequel will ruin my first perspective of the original megamind

Mar 6 2024,negative,if there was a 05 i would do it a stain on the original
Mar 6 2024,negative,my dearest morbius    as i sit down to pen these words i find myself overwhelmed by the sheer magnitude of emotions swirling within me how does one even begin to articulate the depth of affection that courses through every fiber of my being yet here i am driven by an undeniable urge to pour out my heart to you in this letter    from the moment our paths first crossed i knew there was something extraordinary about you perhaps it was the way your eyes sparkled with intelligence or the graceful confidence with which you carried yourself whatever it was i found myself utterly captivated by your presence    in your company i discovered a kindred spirit someone with whom i could share my deepest thoughts and aspirations without fear of judgment you listened to me with a patience and understanding that i had never encountered before and in doing so you opened up a world of possibility i had never dared to imagine    but it wasnt just your intellect that drew me to you morbius it was your heart  so full of warmth and compassion  that truly captured mine in a world where cynicism often reigns supreme you remained steadfast in your belief in the inherent goodness of humanity and your unwavering optimism inspired me to see the world through fresh eyes    every moment spent in your presence is a precious gift a treasure to be cherished for eternity whether were engaged in spirited debate or simply enjoying each others company in comfortable silence every second spent by your side feels like a glimpse of paradise    and oh how my heart sings at the mere thought of you your laughter is a melody sweeter than any symphony and the mere sound of your voice sends shivers down my spine i find myself intoxicated by the mere scent of you longing to drink in every last drop of your essence until i am consumed by it completely    but perhaps what i love most about you morbius is your capacity for growth and selfdiscovery you are not content to simply coast through life on autopilot  you actively seek out new experiences and challenges constantly pushing the boundaries of what you thought possible your insatiable curiosity ignites a fire within me urging me to embrace lifes uncertainties with courage and enthusiasm    in your arms i have found a sanctuary from the chaos of the outside world a safe haven where i can be my truest self without fear of reprisal with you i am free to love and be loved in return unencumbered by the shackles of doubt or insecurity    morbius my darling i cannot imagine a future without you by my side you have become my confidant my companion my soulmate  the very essence of my being and so as i commit these words to paper i do so with a heart overflowing with love for you and a fervent hope that you will accept them in the spirit in which they are given    forever and always    golden
Mar 6 2024,negative,yeah the animation is bad plus bad plot
Mar 6 2024,negative,dear god this movie was god awful
Mar 6 2024,negative,it looks a high school student forgot about a project until 2 hours before it was due and this was the final project
Mar 6 2024,negative,just watch the original megamind movie instead
Mar 6 2024,negative,an utter disappointment megamind vs the doom syndicate had its moments but fails to deliver the same kind of punch that the first movie brought a packed plot that feels slapped together a drop in quality of animation and the absence of will ferrell make this a feel like a cheap cash grab and an insult to the first movie
Mar 6 2024,negative,this is already guaranteed to be the single worst film of 2024 quite possibly the worst superhero movie of all time
Mar 6 2024,positive,just use the dehydration gun peice of donkey shizzle
Mar 6 2024,negative,it sucked for the already good first movie the film is a down grade from the first and is not good a self contaned movie jokes and character are too old set up so badly and dont fit the world we got bad villans and dumb support character a lazy dolloar store jade jackie chan adentures just existing in this story this writing is so bad and need a better class of writer the tech and powers was fun in the first movie but now their all stupid and kid like that they are all bad and forced it feels out dated in animation and story telling
Mar 6 2024,negative,incomparison to the 1st one what a load of poo such a shame when the first was so good
Mar 6 2024,negative,god this was straight up awful
Mar 6 2024,negative,horrible wheres the humor cast and originality from the first movie it lacks of everything
Mar 6 2024,negative,oh boy its that bad and awful   megamind doesnt deserve a sequel the 2010 film was already perfect in every way it ended nicely and it didnt need another round at all
Mar 6 2024,negative,its like watching paint dry but without paint and without eyes boring to hell and back the worst way to ruin megaminds legacy something we never asked for this movie  truly does not have a single redeeming quality it retconned everything from the first movie making megamind into a hollow shell of his former self horrible writing horrible animation characters sounds literally everything i could go on and on about why its bad but im sure everyone already noticed im trying to preserve my sanity here
Mar 6 2024,negative,this moviewas something im not sure what but it was something the characters lacked their motives and personalities from the first the quality was extremely downgraded but i guess it was made with a tv budget so i can kinda get over that the story felt very unnecessary and just ruined a bit of the first movie and the worst part for me was the characters they lacked any of their personalities voices sounded nothing like the original no offense to the actors they are still great and the new character designs are just boring and uninteresting that basically states the whole movie if you want to watch a better sequel watch the button of doom
Mar 6 2024,negative,i cried watching it not cause it was good it was horrible but because of how off it was
Mar 6 2024,negative,a disappointing sequel with none of the original cast members and a horrendous plot the characters are terrible as well if you wanna see a megamind sequel read fan fiction instead
Mar 6 2024,negative,a disgrace of a sequel i wouldve rather perished before the movie and the series for that matter was ever announced i can no longer die with a good conscience knowing this ever existed
Mar 6 2024,positive,i really liked the movie i think that it just lacked the budget to be as good as it could have been looking past the surfacelevel it has fun characters and tells a fun story
Mar 6 2024,negative,it was just a soulless money grab i really wish it wasnt produced the money could have been spent on a different project where they could have made something unique but it perfectly represents the current state of the movie industry
Mar 6 2024,negative,bloody vile absolute disgrace to the original movie
Mar 6 2024,negative,the animation is disgusting the acting is horrible and most importantly this movie was supposed to be a great sequel that would amaze me but the characters and the plot ruined it
Mar 6 2024,negative,damn ai still has a long way to go if it wants to write genuinely intriguing stories and characters the animation somehow looks worse than the cutscene graphics from the old megamind game on xbox 360 villains look like fortnite skins none of the original cast returned sidekick girl nobody asked for the entire citys population died because theres barley any background characters   minion i refuse to call him chum might as well not be in the movie and megamind went from megamind to micromind     but above all this movie lacks one major aspect of the original      presentation
Mar 6 2024,negative,would give zero stars if possible
Mar 6 2024,negative,what a disappointment definitely compared to the original which subverted the superhero genre and made me laugh my as off but this one is just a cash grab hero movie that has no tiein with the originals story dont watch it watch the original i would also stay away from megamind rules as well just to be safe
Mar 6 2024,negative,this movie actually sucked i actually went out of my way to see it and i was flabbergasted 0100000000000000000000000000000000 absolutely do not recommend the graphics suck the animation is lazy and sloppy and sometimes it doesnt even make sense the story sucks and in the original there was never any doom syndicate so this is just a cash grab a sloppy one too instead of watching this id recommend watching a different movie coming soon like dune or deadpool 3 or kung fu panda even anything but the megamind movie and we are not even gonna talk about the megamind show no just no

Mar 5 2024,negative,trash disgrace to part 1 megamind and the button of doom is the real sequel megamnd is megacringemegamid
Mar 5 2024,negative,this is a disgrace to the brilliance of the 1st movie
Mar 5 2024,negative,just go watch the first film from 10 years ago after watching this movie i feel like i got ripped off and i pirated it
Mar 5 2024,negative,megamind vs the doom syndicate is so sloppishly made lazily idiotic and excruciatingly mindblowingly stupid it makes the emoji movie look like a pure artistic statement by comparison    its so bad its laughably disappointing
Mar 5 2024,negative,one of the worst movies ever seen dont waste your time on this garbage
Mar 5 2024,negative,megamind 2 is a total disappointment for the fans of the first installment the movie lacks originality humor and emotion the characters are flat and predictable the animation is poor and full of clichés and the plot is so convoluted that it becomes absurd megamind faces his old team the doom syndicate who have no charisma or motivation everything is solved easily and conveniently without any challenge or risk in addition the movie has many flaws in the animation that make the experience even more frustrating the characters glitch move strangely or disappear from the screen it seems that the animators have not tried to give life to this world megamind 2 is a movie that is not worth watching neither for its story nor for its visual aspect
Mar 5 2024,negative,as a fan of the first movie this was a total major letdown somehow the animation looks 10x worse than the first movie that came out ten years ago looks like a ps2 game they assassinated every character in the worst way possible and the plot makes no sense and is horribly boring to watch dreamworks you had the opportunity to finally do right to this amazing franchise but decided to blow it with a total cashgrab i dont think 7 year old me would even enjoy watching this
Mar 5 2024,negative,you know this was the same studio that brought us masterpieces like shrek 2 megamind puss in boots the last wish kung fu panda and how to train your dragon this is beyond the level of bad that shrek the third and boss baby brings to dreamworks catalogue this is just embarrassing it looks like a high schoolers final project for a cgi class hopefully kung fu panda 4 is better
Mar 5 2024,negative,i couldnt make it past the first 10 minutes this just felt like one of those 1 season spinoffs of good animated movies that were made with 15 of the animation quality and none of the orignal voice cast was a hard pass for me
Mar 5 2024,negative,this movie is the worst most pathetic sequel i have seen ever the animation looks like the boss baby show despite it was on a tv show budget all the actor that practically carried the movie are replaced by cheap clown like imitations and they ruined the story  megamind was told in the first movie to have been locked in a prison his whole life and influenced to become a villain with a crew then all of the sudden he had a whole crew of basic looking villains it just does not make sense this movie is just a cash grab and i dont recommend it
Mar 5 2024,negative,i really wish i could un watch this movie it while being one of the most boring sequels ever still manages to captivate me in how old the animation looks this movie really should not have been made and taints megamind brand the animation is so bad i thought it was rendered on a ps2 please for the love of all things alive dont watch this
Mar 5 2024,negative,there was a short film called megamind and the button of doom and it looks better then this somehow a short film has better animated better story and acting then a film a streaming movie     2 thumbs down
Mar 5 2024,negative,this movie is a sad excuese of a movie    the villains feel like written in a few minutes    and how is it possible that the girl knowing her name is a waste of time is mostly smarter than megamind  and tf is megaminds role even supposed to be he feels like some useless character that no one care about    the background is straight up mostly made lazy  oh boy the first movie was good enough
Mar 5 2024,negative,it is definitely garbage and disrespectful to consumers
Mar 5 2024,negative,its incredible how one of dreamworks best films is destroyed with this mediocre sequel they threw away all of megaminds character development from the first film a lot of nonsense in the film and horrible animation what a way for dreamworks to start the year 
Mar 5 2024,positive,if only dreamworks recognized the goldmine theyre sitting on and stopped using it as a toilet yes the animation leaves something to be desired compared to the og movie from 2010 thats because this is a big story being crammed into a tv format and only given a shamefully tiny budget the movies purpose clearly is to tee up the series which is much better blame dreamworks execs for not giving this the cinematic movie treatment it properly deserves recognizing how much fans of megamind have come to love the franchise despite the fact they have completely ignored it for 13 years setting aside the rampant hatred being spewed on social media by people who obviously enjoy being part of a lynch mob this story is compelling viewing for those invested in the world of megamind
Mar 5 2024,negative,the movie was a mess terrible animation unfunny jokes and a plot that didnt make sense at all megamind was raised in a jail cell and when he got to school he started a rivalry with metro man then the rest was history megamind didnt have an old crew he was on his own with minion this movie disrespected megamind and the 2010 movie as a whole dont watch
Mar 5 2024,negative,how can you screw up so bad and still think yep youre sure welcome we made that movie of all the things that could have happened to megamind that has to be the worst one
Mar 5 2024,negative,they made a worst movie than shrek the thirdhow was that even possible
Mar 5 2024,negative,poo movie  noothing made sense and lost my megamind over it    stay in school kids

Mar 5 2024,negative,horrible obviously just wanted to get a new megamind out and put absolutely no love into it
Mar 5 2024,negative,not as bad as people are saying but still pretty atrocious
Mar 5 2024,negative,hey guys just a quick question who made puss in boots the last wish im genuinely curious because i refuse to believe the same studio that made an oscar nominated piece of art made this direct to dvd quality pilot to eventual if really animated series on a streaming service ive yet to find anyone but me has
Mar 5 2024,negative,this movie was the worst movie of 2024 because the animation was disgusting the original cast didnt came back and the story was bad

Mar 5 2024,negative,genuinely bad animation sucks along with story line also they add a superhero team and i dont know why they exist
Mar 5 2024,negative,its so bad i couldnt even finish the movie it felt like a they designed for a 3 toddlers to watch the jokes were bad the animation felt so toddlers show the characters felt way worse than the 1st movie the stupid joke about minion being copyright strikes for being called minion and was renamed as old chum the villain cyndicate had the most simple designs ever
Mar 5 2024,negative,imagine you have a freshlymade pizza homemade ingredients and everything its perfect then you save it in the fridge and 8 hours later you microwave it the cheese burns slightly onto the plate and you have to let it cool down for half an hour before you can even touch it when you finally get a bite the taste is a diluted and texturally offputting remnant of what it used to be and its so disgusting that you dont even want to finish it thats basically this movie
Mar 5 2024,positive,i really loved it it was so good who cares about the redesign of megamind
Mar 5 2024,negative,how did they turn an original classic into this hot steaming pile of garbage the animation looks like it was made by a 10 year old in blender it feels as if they got someone who watched the first megamind high and told them to write a sequel we waited 14 years for the worst dreamworks movie ever released
Mar 5 2024,negative,dis ees bullsheet  dont fucking watch  look at how they massacured my boi
Mar 5 2024,negative,imagine wait so much time for this gb left the movie at 20 mins

Mar 5 2024,negative,the razzies are gonna have a field day with this one
Mar 5 2024,negative,completely takes a dump on the original movie and the animation is terrible and they didnt even try to find a sound alike for megamind
Mar 5 2024,negative,just a cashgrab to promote peacock i cant believe the original writers returned for this destroyed their own canon and made one of the worst sequels of the history
Mar 5 2024,negative,the fact we waited 13 years to get a rip off cocomelon is just so disappointing 
Mar 5 2024,negative,yeah this movie is unsurprisingly awful lol
Mar 5 2024,negative,i just want to learn the thought process in the making of this movie why they thought this was a good idea
Mar 5 2024,negative,oh i hate it i hate this movie an worst animation film ever im going to watch megamind 1 instead
Mar 5 2024,negative,this movie puts no effort in to make a good or entertaining story all it does is be incredibly predictable and soulless all to make a quick buck and stain the legacy of the original
Mar 5 2024,negative,agamind 2 had no right of exisiting     bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad    would not recommend    atleast they didnt ruin metro man
Mar 5 2024,negative,the poorly written script and the uninspired characters makes this movie hard to watch through they try to redeem the movie by adding new characters but that backfires because of the fact that they couldnt even get the old characters back
Mar 5 2024,negative,absolute garbage cashgrab of a sequel none of the original charm from the original movie was back in this so called sequel of this dreamworks original the quality dropped from looking actually really clean in a 2010s perspective to now being one of the worst animated movies ive seen the plot is what the original movie tended to make fun of completely shatters megaminds original story as he was considered to be loner taught to be villain with the only friend in his life being minion renamed to ol chum in this movie for whatever reason to now in this movie having an apparent villain band before the original megamind movie completely demolishes megaminds original story and the attempt of villains that where the villains in this movie is a whole other topic that i dont even want to emphasize apart from just stating that they are just horrible in this movie   010 would not recommend to anyone who is actually invested in megamind as a character this so called sequel is poorly animated with a god awful story completely breaking what megamind originally was  dreamworks has made phenomenal work before they have made amazing sequels shrek 2 and puss in boots the last wish are perfect examples of dreamworks sequels actually working as a continuation i get megamind vs the doom syndicate was not completely made by dreamworks but still this is definitely not it
Mar 5 2024,negative,bad just awfully bad
Mar 5 2024,negative,the older actors where better than the new one  they didnt even have the budget to get the old cast all in all this movie sucks and had no budget so instead they gave it off to a chinese company because dreamworks hated it them self i expected them to make a better movie then the original but i guess they failed poorly
Mar 5 2024,negative,with the animation quality having a huge downgrade by looking like miraculous ladybug animation and the story being so generic and uncreative megamind makes me and others hurt to see a classic film have a sequel with no way of showing care for fans
Mar 4 2024,negative,terrible movie bad story and low budget animation and not even trying to make a good movie or in this case with my review something good
Mar 4 2024,negative,id rather sit through m night shyamalans avatar before i sat through this sorry excuse for a sequel ok maybe not but still
Mar 4 2024,negative,childhood ruined thanks dreamworks
Mar 4 2024,negative,this movie was written by a group of writers who didnt watch the first megamind but were only told what megamind was honestly the enjoyment you get from this movie is lower than what you get from an episode of rubble  crew megamind 1 came out 14 years ago and was made for everyone this movie was made for no one
Mar 4 2024,negative,its official after years of demanding a sequel this is what we get  hollywood hates us
Mar 4 2024,negative,the animation quality is terrible compared to the first movie poor character development poor story lacks emotion
Mar 4 2024,negative,it would be better to have a 2d animation instead of 3d
Mar 4 2024,negative,they fing ruined megamind why why this sequel is fing garbage
Mar 4 2024,negative,why would they make a sequel on the first place
Mar 4 2024,negative,just no why does megamind look like that just just tell me please

Mar 4 2024,negative,i cant believe after making the first movie it took them 14 years for this garbage of a movie bad plot horrible characters and writing bad animation and just everything about it is so bad i cant believe they made the first movie that was amazing but made this movie that looks like it was made for babies and that wasnt made in 2024 dont watch this please guys
Mar 4 2024,negative,i barely watched 10 minutes of the movie got bored find something better to do
Mar 4 2024,negative,so bad i made an account just to post this the animation is more than lazy and none of the voice actors from the original movie are present just so sad especially because the first megamind was so amazing
Mar 4 2024,negative,just a garbage cash grab with horrible animations extremely predictable storyline and an unnecessary cheesy script
Mar 4 2024,negative,bro this aint megamind its bigbrain
Mar 4 2024,negative,whilst i could understand what kind of concept megamind vs the doom syndicate was trying to do unfortunately it wasnt very well crafted within many areas and ended up with a rather flat and disappointing sequel
Mar 4 2024,negative,megamind had a soul a message it wasnt just a bunch of animations made for the sake of a quick cash this is barely megamind it may use the same models but the art of animating is gone it may have a plot but the art of storytelling is gone this isnt cinema its a long ad for a tv show thats probably going to destroy the image of megamind a little more
Mar 4 2024,negative,very bad cash grab of a movie that butchers the first one
Mar 4 2024,negative,the characters didnt do things that the characters would have done in the original the movie was way too fast passed and it feels like the entire movie was written by ai
Mar 4 2024,negative,absolute garbage this movie was a downgrade in every regard in terms of story animation casting etc    this movie was obviously a business decision to transition to their upcoming and most likely mediocre tv series coming out in no way does it justify the atrocity of this movie it retconned major story elements from the first movie like how the doom syndicate was never mentioned at all until now it also removes the whole spoof of making fun of the superhero genre megamind lost all character development from the first movie and back to being a total ahole voice acting is subpar animation has so many noticeable flaws and overall looks trash it so blatantly just slaps the fans across the face    the story is just bad the characters are just bad this movie sequel is just    flat out bad do not recommend if i could give a zero star i would
Mar 4 2024,negative,act like a villain think like a hero    megamind vs the doom syndicate is a 2024 american animated superhero parody film produced by dreamworks animation television directed by eric fogel      meh it passed the time   sort of     megaminds former villain team the doom syndicate has returned our newly crowned blue hero must now keep up evil appearances until he can assemble his friends roxanne ol chum and keiko to stop his former evil teammates from launching metro city to the moon
Mar 4 2024,negative,none of the pizazz or fun of the original clearly trying to ride of the hype of the first flat and under baked
Mar 4 2024,negative,i genuinely didnt really like it first off the movie felt forced as it completely ignored the first movie and its purpose the movie felt like a trashy show at the start surprisingly they made a trashy show after it character introductions felt forced as well in basic terms the movie sucked ass
Mar 4 2024,negative,worst sequel of 2024 so far the voice acting is terrible the animation is horrible and the story is awful the jokes throughout the movie are stupid not funny they make a joke about the titanic and even the song sound of silence yeah horrible sequel do not watch this movie
Mar 4 2024,negative,i would give it a higher rating but the quality of the movie is poor and the quality comparisons of the previous movie and this one are very notable 
Mar 4 2024,negative,absolutely ruined the original film it just reused the megamind character on a very generic and poorly written script as an attempt to make more money out of previous succeses
Mar 4 2024,negative,really bad movie im sad to say   here is some things i wouldve changed  1 find a voice actor that sounded like the old one for megamind  2 better models for the characters   3 had megamind act like megamind would  4 kept minions name to minion and not change it to chum  5 i can name a lot more    i wish they put a lot more effort for this movie they couldve done so much more sense a lot of fans expected more i expected more   you better watch the first movie instead of this
Mar 4 2024,negative,an insult to the first movie
Mar 4 2024,negative,too many animation errors to count the original 2011 movie was animated better the introduction of made up characters that appear out of nowhere when megamind in the og story had only one freind now he has a history of a whole different crew and even the the villain group in the movie is cheesy and straight up laughable i just feel ai had some part in the making of this movie it just doesnt seem real small channels on youtube can put together better animations and storylines than this whole big movie studio could its the falloff of dream works
Mar 4 2024,negative,they made one of the greatest animated movies of the century to the worst movie of all time dreamworks you did good with the bad guys and puss in boots the last wish but how did you screw up megamind 2 but the theme song for megamind rules is so good the theme song had no right to go this hard
Mar 4 2024,negative,dreamworks truly fell off with this film
Mar 4 2024,negative,the fact that they had to write this whole thing then post it thinking it was good someone needs to be fired
Mar 3 2024,negative,bad horrible downright one of the worst sequels i have seen all my life
Mar 3 2024,negative,a horrible reboot of an amazing film compares not at all from its source
Mar 3 2024,negative,verry bad movie i wont see again
Mar 3 2024,negative,it feels like the team on this movie have made every single wrong decision for this movie how i had to watch this movie through my friend because i did not want to pay for this garbage there are so many animation errors where a guy is literally teleporting in the backround how did this get through moderation for the team i would rather drink sulfuric acid than to watch this brain rot garbage
Mar 3 2024,negative,a lifeless pilot sequel whatever of an underrated classic
Mar 3 2024,negative,trashy design of characters cocomelon looks better compared to that
Mar 3 2024,negative,the voice actors did good and the movie wasnt as bad as people say it is but it still has heavy animation errors and pacing problems also they dont even mention the doom syndicate in the first film lmao 210 its mid
Mar 3 2024,negative,the movie is the worst movie of the year so far theres bad animation no funny jokes the doom syndicate is from a wii game of megamind but they change the characters which makes it not like the original characters from the video game it was worse then madame web and the plot was horrible they did not get the original voice actors none of them return for their voices and the kid is annoying and why do they need a series why why why is there a series its because its all about the money thats why dreamworks made it they want the money
Mar 3 2024,positive,it wasnt that bad although the animation was bad the story was not all fleshed out the movie was pretty good overall id recommend it if you liked the first one
Mar 3 2024,negative,what the heck happened to megamind he looks like he got plastic surgery and aged terrible megamind was a good movie full of fun characters and created the memes we know today now apparently he had a villain group and a mentor even though they are not in the original movie and yeah it sucks it needs to be deleted like fairly odd parents fairly odder 010
Mar 3 2024,negative,this movie ruins all of the characters the new ones are horrid and the animation looks like a low budget youtube short this is one of the worst movies ive ever seen if i could give it a 0 i would not even fun to hate watch
Mar 3 2024,negative,the return of the king is the renowned final chapter in  peter jacksons near flawless adaptations of j r r tolkiens legendary lord of the rings fantasy novels it is quite simply a masterpiece on nearly every level and one of my personal favourite films of all time    the film boasts an emotionally powerful and moving story of how sheer perseverance love loyalty and friendship are more important qualities than mere physical strength it also brilliantly showcases how even the smallest person can accomplish great feats of heroism and courage many of the most emotional scenes in the film are after the great battles have died down and the characters share intimate bittersweet and touching moments with each other some of these moments are enough to bring tears from nearly anyones eyes    this timeless story is elevated by what can only be described as a near flawless cast the amount of acting talent on display here is astounding with greats like sir lan mckellen viggo mortensen elijah wood sean austin andy serkis karl urban orlando bloom liv tyler hugo weaving and kate blanchette all giving memorable performances in an enormous ensemble cast in particular the characters gandalf mckellen aragorn mortensen gollum serkis frodo wood and sam austin are given masterful performances that perfectly bring the characters to life    the return of the kings spectacular visuals are some of the finest in the history of blockbuster filmmaking the larger than life cinematography vividly conveys the unimaginable vastness of middle earth grand sweeping shots of mountain ranges nearly endless fields volcanoes gigantic ancient cities and other arresting vistas are shown with stunning detail the way jackson effortlessly blends cgi locales with real places in these shots is something i have not seen done nearly as well in any other movie outside the other lord of the rings films    on the subject of cgi the special effects work for this film is truly state of the art the impossibly realistic motion capture on gollums face along with the marvellously sinister monster and creature designs are both impressive to behold    this great special effects work and the audacious cinematography both work in perfect union during any of the return of the kings jaw dropping battle sequences the battles in this film are events that cannot be described with words they simply must be seen to be believed i do not speak lightly when i say that return of the king has some of the most epic monumental and blood pumping battle scenes in movie history the surprisingly tight choreography and overwhelming visual spectacle of these scenes is enough to make them endlessly enjoyable on every rewatch    these unbelievable action sequences are enhanced further by a chilling awe inspiring musical score by composer howard shore this score also permeates the films more quiet character moments too where it is serene and beautiful to listen to it works wonders to elevate these scenes as well    overall the lord of the rings the return of the king is one of the purest examples of an emotional rollercoaster you will find in american cinema it can make you cry cheer and smile like almost no other film it is a timeless iconic masterpiece that will never be forgotten by those who view it
Mar 3 2024,negative,disappointed angry saddened why even make a sequel to a beloved movie and not even care about the voice acting storytelling or the animation how is this movie worse animated than the original
Mar 3 2024,negative,i dont know who this movie is for the writing and animation is so simple i dont even think a five year old would enjoy watching this
Mar 3 2024,negative,this movie looks like a string of playstation 2 cutscenes strung together its not a sequel its atrocious 0 stars moldy tomato waste of time
Mar 3 2024,positive,it was an entertaining movie glad megamind finally got a sequel
Mar 3 2024,negative,the trailer speaks for itself the biggest problem with this movie is that it fails to be a movie  it fells like a spin off of a show more than a sequel to something fans so much honestly deserves the low rating it fells like they have zero respect to this movie its just ugly
Mar 3 2024,negative,horrible its just a cheap cash grab
Mar 3 2024,negative,probably one of the worst animated movies ive seen in a while the quality was just bad

Mar 3 2024,negative,a spit in the face to megamind
Mar 3 2024,negative,bro this movie is absolutely shameful its literally the kind of movie the first megamind was parodying the new castings are horrible all of the og cast was just thrown out the window and it really shows the doom syndicate was extremely boring and it doesnt even make sense in the story in the first megamind we were shown that the only hero and villain are megamind and metroman there was no one else the new girl toddler sidekick was just annoying and the movie is extremely forgettable the animation is also bad and i mean really bad its like a show made for television 010 megamind should have deserved a better sequel than this lazy cashgrab
Mar 3 2024,negative,this is a shell of the movie its based off of i hope peacock pays for their sins
Mar 3 2024,negative,you know there are those movies that are great sequels to stand alone films like shrek 2 this isnt one of them this was so badly written and animated that it makes the god damn son of the mask look like a masterpiece
Mar 3 2024,positive,prepare to be dazzled amused and utterly captivated by the electrifying clash between good and evil in megamind vs the doom syndicate this animated masterpiece not only surpasses its predecessor but sets a new benchmark for superhero animated films    the story picks up where megamind left off with our lovably mischievous protagonist facing off against a formidable new adversary the doom syndicate a group of villains determined to wreak havoc on metro city what follows is a rollercoaster of exhilarating action sequences clever humor and unexpected twists that will keep audiences of all ages on the edge of their seats    but its not just megamind who shines the supporting cast is equally memorable and lets not forget the menacing members of the doom syndicate whose diabolical schemes provide the perfect foil to our heroes    visually stunning and impeccably animated megamind vs the doom syndicate is a feast for the eyes from breathtaking cityscapes to pulsepounding action sequences every frame is bursting with detail and creativity the animation team deserves applause for their impeccable attention to detail and innovative visual style    but perhaps the films greatest triumph is its ability to balance heart and humor amidst the epic battles and largerthanlife showdowns there are moments of genuine emotion that tug at the heartstrings whether its megamind grappling with his past or roxanne confronting her own fears the film never loses sight of its emotional core    in conclusion megamind vs the doom syndicate is a tour de force of animated storytelling with its captivating characters jawdropping animation and irresistible charm its a film that will leave audiences cheering for more whether youre a longtime fan of the franchise or simply looking for a thrilling adventure this movie delivers in spades dont miss your chance to experience the ultimate showdown between good and evil megamind has never been better
Mar 3 2024,positive,its not as bad as everyone thinks its definitely not the sequel everyone wanted i think people wanted a proper theatrical release with will ferrell this is more of a tv special to the series personally i think the series is a little bit better it definitely made me laugh and cringe but i wasnt on the floor weeping with joy like i shouldve been if this sequel had been done properly i think it wouldve been the highest grossing film probably just as much of a turn out as the five nights at freddys movie
Mar 3 2024,negative,this movie is a totally a insult
Mar 3 2024,negative,from megamind to nevermind
Mar 3 2024,negative,this is a really big disappointment as a normal film in generalbut even more disappointing as a sequel to one of dreamworks best films i really hope that they forget about this film and in a few years make an actual good film worthy enough to be a megamind sequel and with the actual cast
Mar 3 2024,positive,my eyes were bless of this amazing sequel in my 1000 years of living i have never seen something so mesmerizing meaningful emotional such great movie
Mar 3 2024,negative,movie animation looks awful i get its a tv show but the original fans of the movie are gonna hate this show its a bad attempt to get younger fans
Mar 3 2024,negative,ive seen better written scripts on the hub
Mar 3 2024,negative,trash should not have been made waste of time and money to even create this film if you can even call it one  dont bother watching full movie if you skip till the end of it you dont miss anything  wanna see an actual film watch the original whoever likes this movie is a bot

Mar 3 2024,negative,it is sad that a company does anything for money even at the cost of the little dignity left to its company they ruined a movie that marked the childhood of many people including me now everyone will remember megamente not as the funny childhood movie but as the movie that came back 14 years later with a sequel that seems to be taken from a summer 3d animation school for children
Mar 3 2024,negative,this movie makes madam web a masterpiece
Mar 3 2024,negative,i just finished the movie and somehow it was even worse than our drawings  at least that movie had some humor to be found in it this one was just a bore all throughout its sub90 minute runtime the only reason i was able to finish was because ive made a terrible habit of watching bad movies with my girlfriend and making fun of them but we barely found anything to even make fun of
Mar 3 2024,negative,horriblei dont know why they bothered and its obvious why the initial cast didnt return to voice it

Mar 2 2024,negative,this movie is everything that is wrong with big companies owning fan loved franchises instead of the creators of the franchises peacock obviously wanted to squeeze as much money with as little risk as possible instead of the goal of making a good film such a heartbreak that a loved film from our childhood goes out with this corporate rotten husk of a film
Mar 2 2024,negative,horrible in every way
Mar 2 2024,negative,maybe its about the minds we megad along the way
Mar 2 2024,negative,010 stupid and cringe 
Mar 2 2024,negative,why would you do this the original movie is so so good and after more than a decade we get this cheap knockoff that looks sounds and feels so much worse than the first one a half baked attempt to capitalize on nostalgia this represents to a tee everything wrong with the animation industry
Mar 2 2024,negative,this movie is how you tarnish the legacy of a beloved classic by taking everything that made the original good and trashing it for starters megamind isnt alone like he was in the first movie something that was integral to his plot development then they stripped him of his character development and turned him into a narcissistic egocentric selfish and worst of all bland character megamind doesnt have his usual flair for presentation or his usual sense of humor he doesnt have midfight quips or say anything funny or interesting the whole movie is a watereddown bland and unoriginal sequel to the original yes this may be because it has a low budget but i bet dreamworks would never let this slide if they were the ones to make this movie everything in this movie is too safe as if theyre afraid of even taking any chances and lets not forget the animation quality this movie is a massive downgrade from the first megamind movie animations are stiff stale or straight up copied from character to character theres no exciting choreography as before theres no interestresting animations its just stale do not watch purchase or support these people in any way they just want your money

Mar 2 2024,negative,its sad that this great movie that was megamind had this ending as a fan who wanted a sequel i regret having asked for it  the very low budget that was put into this movie is surprising being in 2024 this movie looks worse in quality than the first one from 2010 plus the plot is one of the most meh there is taking away all the meaning of the first movie upset
Mar 2 2024,negative,if you liked this movie you liked the last airbender by m night shyamalan  i think id rather watch that tbh and that has never happened  megamind to nevermind
Mar 2 2024,negative,everything is just horrible about this movie
Mar 2 2024,negative,this is garbage not necessary they destroyed megamind with this poor quality movie we dont wanted this this movie was made just to make money no effort or passion put into this its shameful that this exists

Mar 2 2024,negative,the worst movie of 2024 gotta apologies to madam web
Mar 2 2024,negative,this movie is the worst thing i have ever seen the animation is painful to watch they couldnt even get will ferrell or any of the other original actors the writing is awful and they changed minions name to chum never watch this movie the most painful thing though is knowing this is supposed to be megamind
Mar 2 2024,negative,such a dumb movie animation was like the kung fu panda show animation which is bad dreamworks is gone lets hope kung fu panda 4 saves dreamworks from this nightmare
Mar 2 2024,positive,i love megamind vs the doom syndicate the animation isnt as bad as everyones making it seem its not as good as the original film but that doesnt make it bad some scenes were actually phenomenal visually such as the danceoff scene     and besides the animation isnt everything we got to learn more about megamind watch him learn more lessons about human behaviour being a team player and appreciating his friends     it was incredibly funny heartfelt and clever you can tell that the original creatorsscreenwriters were on board it has a megamind feel to it that is not easily replicated     i think anyone who is truly invested in megamind loves him wants to learn more about him and see where life has taken him would enjoy this film and support is vital  without it we might never get a  legitimate dreamworks theatrical movie    ps the series is even better than the movie the animation is better and it honestly just really works dont forget to check that out too
Mar 2 2024,negative,this movie is an insult to the original
Mar 2 2024,negative,this makes sequels like jaws 4 look like the godfather compared to this

Mar 2 2024,negative,the animation was terrible never do this again
Mar 2 2024,neutral,this movie could be better too much cheap animation maded and a little lazy story original doom syndicate from was deleted or something
Mar 2 2024,negative,a disgrace to the beauty that was megamind and an insult to everyones intelligence    did they fire all of the animators at dreamworks did all of their writers get replaced by ai this is the worst animated film ive ever seen in my pitiful existence and ive watched fucking doogle i would rather hurl myself off a microwave than ever watch something this insultingly terrible  again
Mar 2 2024,negative,this movie makes the emoji movie look like a cinematic masterpiece
Mar 2 2024,negative,i felt like i was overdosing on fentanyl the entire time while watching it the poor animation quality made me want to ropemaxx from my ceiling fan
Mar 2 2024,negative,this might be embarrassing but madame web was better than this 
Mar 2 2024,negative,it is complete garbage in every way the movie is not worth seeing i was hoping that the megamind sequel would have been as good as the first movie but nothing what a disappointment

Mar 2 2024,negative,this is the shitiest movie ever
Mar 2 2024,negative,waste of time watching wish i just went on a walk instead cast is also awful too dont recommend watching in the slightest
Mar 2 2024,negative,its a slap in the face to anyone who liked the original every characters personality is different from their original versions it doesnt even make sense to call it a megamind movie all the very obvious retcons that bring down not only this movie but the original in some places make it so it would have made more sense as an original ip though it would still not be worth watching so many setups were either lazily paid off or just werent at  all all the new characters are just generic and boring or in keikos case annoying dont bother watching it its not worth your time or attention i wouldnt even recommend it to parents to watch with their kids because its just so mindless
Mar 2 2024,negative,terrible writing and animation as well as the worst villains ive seen in a movie its sad to see the original movie get this as a sequel
Mar 2 2024,negative,i think dont have to explain
Mar 2 2024,negative,just watch the trailer dude its self explanatory
Mar 2 2024,negative,horrible cash grab with yanky clunky animation they made up a new characters that were not mentioned in the first movie absolutely horroble dream works what were you thinking
Mar 2 2024,negative,an absolute embarrassment to both the first movie and to dreamworks studios as a whole megamind did not deserve this at all
Mar 2 2024,negative,awful and disappointing cant believe this was allowed to be made
Mar 2 2024,positive,honestly this is such a blast to watch i cant say enough about the absolutely perfect comedic timing of the original team behind his movie but without the new voice cast the delivery couldnt have possibly been more hilarious my main complaints have to do with some of the pacing of this movie which at odd times seems very rushed but otherwise it wasnt that big of a problem     seeing a revival of the doom syndicate who were axed from the original film is like a dream come true their arc in this movie serves as such a fun tiein to the show which i will also review this movie throws so much new megamind lore into the mix that i couldnt help but lose my mind over some of it     considering the budget cut of this film compared to the original the animation is more than adequate since i mostly care about the fact that more megamind is happening lol i would say that the team behind this project did a fantastic job given the madefortv budget id say its significantly better than most that ive seen in the past    characterizations throughout are such a treat i absolutely love everyone especially the new additions to the cast the amount of talent thrown into this movie on every avenue can be felt throughout you can just tell everyone had their entire heart poured into this show displeased review bombing aside i really hope that anyone reading this gives the show and this movie an honest chance to prove its worth as an entirely fun and hilarious peek into the life of our favorite former villain 
Mar 2 2024,negative,it was big stinky poop fart breath ugly badthe animation looks like it was cooked up in 1947changing mega minds image forever with this movie sadly being canon to the og classic we all love its sad to think that this is the mega mind the kids gonna look back at and say they just dont make em like that no more this movie dethroned pacific rim 2 as the worst sequel of this century
Mar 2 2024,positive,this movie is delightful and funny if you all would stop thinking about it like megamind 2 which it isnt and never was meant to be then you would appreciate it for what it is a pilot for a direct to streaming tv show the original writers worked on this and i appreciate their dedication you can blame dreamworks executives for the terrible animation budget and i do my entire generation loves megamind dreamworks have faith in the writers enough to let them make a real theatrical sequel
Mar 2 2024,negative,waste of human resources
Mar 2 2024,negative,this was awful dreamworks had 14 years to cook up something special and what they served us was a film with annoying characters bad voice acting and animation that looks worse than the 2010 original this was a massive letdown
Mar 2 2024,negative,this movie was so bad that megamind couldnt stand out anymore
Mar 2 2024,negative,the writing and the animation are just absolutely terrible just like dragons the nine realms what the hell is going on over at dreamworks right now    we waited 14 years for a sequel and this is what we waited forand the worst part is that will ferrell and david cross arent even part of this    the voice actors are okay in this but it still feels awkward and weird hearing megamind and minion sounding different thanks for the disappointment dreamworks 14 years of this mess
Mar 2 2024,negative,wahaa my childhood is ruined
Mar 2 2024,negative,god awful in every conceivable way
Mar 2 2024,negative,im blind and deaf from terrible animation and terrible acting
Mar 2 2024,negative,sounds like an artificial intelligence wrote the script looks like a single mediocre animator made the animation with a budget of 100 feels like dreamworks just spat on my face and said yah we brought megamind back youre welcome and it definitely is embarrasing when your 14 year old animation looks 5x better than your current one this movie insults me and it insults anybody who enjoyed the original megamind apparently to dreamworks were all brainless mindrotting zombies not even a 2 year old toddler could enjoy this because tiktok is already 1000 times more engaging than this snorefest to the people saying its the worst movie of the year sorry to break it to yah youre wrong this is actually the worst movie of the decade please somebody wash out my eyeballs from the permanent trauma imprinted upon my retinas
Mar 2 2024,negative,bro i aint even 20 minutes in and the movie be looking like youre watching someone play an hd 4k shovelware wii game it aint good also they changed minions name i cant

Mar 2 2024,negative,what have they done to my boy 
Mar 2 2024,negative,this movie is an insult to the greatest movie ever made and should in no way be considered a sequel to the incredible 2010 masterpiece its named after they should be ashamed of themselves for what they did to my boy my disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined good day
Mar 2 2024,negative,joke review there was probably no reason for making any part of this film good

Mar 1 2024,negative,a mother fails to move her son out of an oncoming tank heading straight for him because he wants to get a video of it on his phone    that should tell you everything you need to know about this movies quality
Mar 1 2024,negative,after watching the the movie a total of 0 times i can say safely that it is a bad movie megamind is not funny the fish is named old chum and girl is there must say though that water is pretty cool
Mar 1 2024,negative,i wish it was never made
Mar 1 2024,negative,no this movie was just garbage
Mar 1 2024,negative,this is literally the worst movie of 2024
Mar 1 2024,negative,this is an insult to megamind fans who had waited years or even decades to watch a new sequel to it only to find out that it is pure trash    the betrayal of megaminds original backstory the unnecessary casts and the horrific animations it is shocking to see how a 10 year old movie is 10 times better as compared to this despite of technology advancement over the years    while a few said its good most of us said otherwise overall this movie is a disappointment and i highly recommend not to watch it at all
Mar 1 2024,negative,a joke of a film the antics were high with the announcement of the sequel just for the trailer to release and it be a whole new cast with no life or comedy
Mar 1 2024,negative,this is horrific i hope the creators see this and dont ruin any more loved 2000s2010s movies for a shitty sequel that was never needed

Mar 1 2024,negative,the worlds first ai generated movie they saw the memes and said the same thing sony did when they saw the morbius memes
Mar 1 2024,negative,trash all the actors got replaced with goodwill versions of them the writing is bad the animation is bad the plot makes no sense the character designs are generic they look like stock illustrations 14 years of technological advancement and we got this also on an unrelated note they called minion chum for the entire movie probably because their parent company already owns characters named minions which is kind of funny my good chum and megamind looks wrong for some reason he looks like an imperfect clone of himself its his eyes in this that get me if you want a good version of this movie go watch paint dry chum youll get much more enjoyment out of that chum chum chum chum i still cant get over that get out of my head chum
Mar 1 2024,negative,its just so boring and weird looking
Mar 1 2024,negative,this movie looks like it was made by cocomelon
Mar 1 2024,positive,so i just finished watching this movie im very tempted to write an entire essay on it but i think ill refrain until i can rewatch it take some notes and collect my thoughts so this review will be everything i have right off the bat i absolutely loved this its just all around an amazing time the plot is enjoyable all of the characters are really fun especially megamind himself and the doom syndicate and i was going a little crazy over all the genuine emotional character moments especially with megamind learning to trust the people around him for help keiko has been a very welcome surprise to me shes really entertaining not at all annoying as she easily couldve been if she werent written well i love her relation to megamind and on a certain level i relate to her too as i think a lot of kids treated as outsiders will im also really glad roxanne and minion werent left out this was something i was majorly worried about when i heard this was in production but thus far theyre extremely crucial to the plotline and i love it i hope to see minion and megamind grow even closer during the course of the show and im quite intrigued by roxanne becoming the mayor as its not something i ever wouldve expected from her    all this being said you might be wondering why im not giving it five stars obviously i enjoyed it immensely but comparatively i just cant say it was on the same level as megamind nor did i even expect it to be megamind is a damn masterpiece its not something you can easily top but this movie plus the show which ive yet to watch had a significantly lower budget and when you take into consideration that this was all made with just 500k i find it really impressive thats most of whats holding it back really its just a little undercut or janky here and there the animation is lower quality obviously though i didnt find it to be particularly an eyesore it was actually quite dynamic at times especially towards the end when minion was forced outside of his suit additionally i found some dialogue choices to be slightly off or a little too cliche and of course the occasional continuity error here and there like megamind easily remembering the very complicated door code for the launch room but not if the object he gave keiko was a grenade or a paperweight but there was nothing not a single thing that id say effectively ruined the movie or made it less enjoyable to me this was way better than i was expecting and i highly encourage everyone who thinks its terrible at a glance to give it a watchrewatch and really analyze it especially compared to the original movie i think youll find it holds up amazingly well ive been a megamind fan for about 5 years now and im friends with plenty of people who have been here for even longer some have been fans since the release way back in 2010 and were all so happy this was made so to the team that made this movie and show possible thank you so much we love it and we love you for making it
Mar 1 2024,negative,absolute slop and disrespectful to the og wack

Mar 1 2024,negative,i cant what is this tom fuckery they massacred my boy
Mar 1 2024,negative,absolute horseshit it has cheap plasticky animation errors random goofy characters horrible story telling megamind stayed in a prison all his life how could he have made a crime team no shine like the old one with an actual good story horrible jokes objects appearing out of thin air everything about this movie is a flaw even a 10yr with a basic understanding of animation with a budget of 10 dollars can do better and with the series coming out aswell it just sucks it doesnt even deserve 21 at the time of writing this do better
Mar 1 2024,negative,never in my life have i seen a movie so disrespectful to the original material the movie was dull when i went to see it people got up halfway through and left its a shame there isnt passion in animation anymore dont waste your money
Mar 1 2024,negative,a true tragedy that this movie exists would rather see morbius 010
Mar 1 2024,positive,what we have been waiting for after 14 years this movie was hilarious thoughtful and talked about a lot of nice issues through the movie without being too dark or serious for children it felt like watching all of our best fanfictions come to life the work put into this is incredible and i have never been more proud to be a megamind fan
Mar 1 2024,negative,the animation is ass  the story is ass  the characters are comletely diffrent and by that i mean also ass    i wouldnt recommend to watch this even as a joke and am just generally very disappointed
Mar 1 2024,negative,omg this movie is terrible i just cant stand it it is super cringy bro
Mar 1 2024,negative,the second i put it on the old person next door kicked it
Mar 1 2024,negative,there is no way they made this and genuinely thought it was good and that wed all like it
Mar 1 2024,negative,this is a disgrace to the original megamind
Mar 1 2024,positive,amazing job laughed so hard not sure what all the grief is about so sad when people dont give something wonderful a chance jokes for adults and kids the accompanying show is a riot
Mar 1 2024,negative,what have they done to my boy
Mar 1 2024,negative,what a disgusting movie the animation is ugly the 2010 movie is superior to this aberration i dont understand how they couldnt give us a quality movie its like dreamworks is spitting in our faces furthermore it is an insult that those of us who are waiting for a sequel
Mar 1 2024,positive,a direct follow up to the first movie that was done super super well really enjoyed it especially my goat lord nighty knight 3
Mar 1 2024,negative,just remember if u wanted this theres also people in hell who want slushees
Mar 1 2024,negative,super static movie a deplorable script that makes this movie neither canon nor a true sequel to what the first movie was if they only wanted to make a poor quality series they didnt have to deliver this movie a shame 
Mar 1 2024,positive,loved to see megamind again this movie was geared more toward kids than the first but still enjoyable for anyone only downside is that this movie deserved a bigger budget for better animation but what theyve done with the budget they had is amazing
Mar 1 2024,negative,thats just rubbish
Mar 1 2024,negative,i remeber the time back in 2017 when i first saw megamind in radlett lodge school but seven years later i founded out that this movie got released today and it feels a bit too stupid for the content leaks but without further delays lets find out  the story  megamind is assuming his career as metro citys defender with the help of his teammates roxanne ol chum and keiko of which all have to work together to battle the doom syndicates scam to launch metro city into the moon but sounded familiar from 14 years ago and it was despicable me that pioneered this formula of a movie whereas megamind who had rescued some fishes from some fish thieves to foil a fishy heist is hired by roxanne and keiko to battle his newest opponents in order to maintain herosim to metro city  the animation  the cgi animation feels a bit to divisive from the original movies animation for whom it took only 2 years for dreamworks to produce it but the elephant in the room is that its textures came from a gamecube video game from 2001 which means i dont like the way they try to make it look like a low budgeted ai movie like in disneys wish  the characters  we all knew will ferrell isnt reprising his role as megamind but i geuss that they needed keith ferguson to take his place but i knew the way they ruined the characters is that metro man and tighten dont get any screen time at all but there are new characters who werent included in the original movie such as lady doppler lord nighty knight pierre pressure behemoth mr donut christino christo and machiavillain but there character designs feel like something out of the incredibles and they way they try to kill megamind isnt what i see in a kids movie  the overall there is nothing redeemable about this movie from my own thoughts but its trailer was mocked by everyone at youtube while dreamworks was trying to promote kung fu panda 4 at the same time and i could try to catch a break but it gets a 110 for being the worst animated movie of 2024 but its not worth watching but ill give kung fu panda 4 a go for my next review
Mar 1 2024,neutral,first the movie is kind of funny but the animations sucks like when megamind uses the dehydrate gun the animation looks horrible on it and some of the character animations next the joke the joke are  bad but the joke are sometimes funny and sometimes some of the charm with the first movie is there i only laughed three times but some jokes not land next the character first is minion have a arc megamind accepting him but minion  arc needed more scenes for minion arc be a little bit better next megamind was a dumb down version of yourself sometimes the megamind for the first movie is there sometimes he not next is the face face animations  megamind face passing the movie when megamind look at the screen look like he staring into my face and the light it bad some scenes with the lighting look horrible but the new character the her not annoying to me and the cliffhanger suck because it makes you watch the tv series see what happens
Mar 1 2024,negative,the animation was horrid felt very cheap and early 2000s direct to vhs the acting was relatively mundane and uninteresting given the previous movie as reference but the biggest pain of all was just how unnecessary and weird this whole thing was to make it adds nothing to the original and only detracts from it its a subpar cash grab of a movie definitely skip it
Mar 1 2024,negative,it was pretty abysmal the direct to video a sequel was just a horrible idea and its a tarnish on the megamind name it truly should have ended up being an actual movie with the original cast and the amount of animation errors and quality drops is just laughable    this wasnt even half baked this was full on raw
Mar 1 2024,negative,oh no megamind vs the doom syndicate is another dreamworks disaster will ferrell is not voicing megamind which is unfair the animation quality looks terrible and its even worse then boss baby and even spirit untamed megamind is ruined
Mar 1 2024,negative,nothing like the original and it just seemed like a lazily made movie just for the fun of it
Mar 1 2024,negative,megamind button of doom is the real sequel in my eyes
Mar 1 2024,negative,disapoiting sequel to excellent first movie that doesnt deliver in good story or even good animation
Mar 1 2024,positive,despite will ferrell not reprising his role as the titular character this movie is absolutely perfect at all times
Mar 1 2024,negative,it tries to capture the charm and fun of the original but instead of standing on its own its something youll just put on and forget once its over
Mar 1 2024,negative,im sorry but this was trash 
Mar 1 2024,negative,i hate keith ferguson voiced megamind
Mar 1 2024,negative,no nothing saved this movie from being horrible the horrible animation the casting lazy plot and the horrible quality is just so hard to watch 1 star
Mar 1 2024,negative,awful throughout poor animation script didnt fit in with the previous movie this movie should have never existed
Mar 1 2024,negative,awful the story of the film explains how he became a hero and his old supervillain group want him to join them one more time but the doom syndicator were not in megamind 1 the animation is not good it has animation errors and not funny jokes such as they ruined fire in the hole to water in the hole  this film is so bad dont watch it
Mar 1 2024,negative,it sucks its fake its not canon im leaving  
Mar 1 2024,negative,it only gets one star because its funny at this point this movie is ass
Mar 1 2024,negative,this movie was horrendous the story the animation everything
