"Apr 4, 2024",positive,A beautiful capper to not only just this new trilogy but the entire Skywalker saga...
"Sep 26, 2023",negative," “May The 4th Be With You.” ever since those words were uttered in 1979 it was bound to the Star Wars franchise till the end of time. What I love about that pun is that it wasn’t created by the fans. It happened when Margaret Thatcher became the prime minister of the UK. Not only did that term  became a dedicated phrase to Star Wars fans around the world, but it also shows how much weight the original phrase “May The Force Be With You.” has on Star Wars zealots.  As every year passes, fans of this franchise rewatch their favorite Star Wars movies as if it’s some type of tradition. It surrounds us, penetrates us, and binds us fanatics together. This franchise means the world to so many people and has helped others get through difficult times in their lives (As some films do), and I believe that to be the power of the force working its magic in the best way it knows how. As I mentioned before, rewatching Star Wars films every year is a tradition for most people, and I plan to carry the torch as it is my duty as a fan. Here is my definitive ranking of every Star Wars movie.  I want to start by saying that I had a lot of fun with this film, but this finale that supposedly concludes a nine-film franchise has to be the worst out of the entire Skywalker saga. Much like The Last Jedi, this film provided us with some of the best visual effects and cinematography I have ever seen from any Star Wars movie or series. There are countless screenshots that I have used as my computer wallpaper, they are truly something to behold. Unfortunately, the story feels more like a collage of multiple threads that were never mentioned in the previous installments. This is especially true with Finn’s (John Boyega) story arc. Many important lines of dialogue feel like they appeared out of thin air. Finn is screaming Rey’s (Daisy Ridley) name and attempting to tell her that he is force-sensitive,. but his story thread never goes anywhere. It feels as if this should have been addressed in The Force Awakens to set up different events moving forward. Not only does this film feel rushed but the third act is extremely similar to Disney’s other box office success Avengers: Endgame. “I hate sand. It’s coarse, and rough, and irritating. And it gets everywhere”, this is one of the most quotable lines to any Star Wars fan. It almost sums up your feelings for the film in the bluntest way possible. This entry was filled with so much potential, but with a run time of 2 hours and 22 minutes, it feels as though you’re waiting for the hourglass to run out. Star Wars: Attack Of The Clones is supposed to be the story of how Anakin (Hayden Christiansen) and Padme Amidala (Natalie Portman) fell in love and launched us into the events of the Star Wars: Clone Wars series. Those are the two saving graces of this film and we finally get to see Yoda (Frank Oz) face off against Count Dooku (Christopher Lee). I cannot express how terrible and dragged out the pacing of this entry was. It is the weakest episode of the prequel trilogy.  This film is criminally underrated. I don’t think people give it enough credit as it is the feature-length film that launched the success of the tv series of the same name. Is the plot silly? Yes. Saving Jabba The Hutt’s son from imprisonment is very outlandish and hilarious. But the way it is woven into the story makes it work. This film is director Dave Filoni’s passion project. He is one of the few directors out there who truly understands Star Wars and never disappoints and he introduces my 2nd favorite character in the history of the franchise, Ahsoka Tano. As she becomes Anakin Skywalker’s padawan they must both learn how to trust each other in dire situations and build a mutual bond of trust, patience, and faith in one another. This is a film I always find myself going back to due to its comedic moments and amazing action scenes.  Out of any Star Wars movie, Solo: A Star Wars Story is the most unnecessary of them all. Now don’t get me wrong, I had a lot of fun going on a new adventure with young Han Solo played by Alden Ehrenreich. However, this story doesn’t add any necessary facts that I needed to know about the character. I don’t need to know how Han Solo and Chewbacca met, how Han got his name, or how a spry Lando Calrissian (Donald Glover) met the franchise’s most famous smuggler. I wish this film would have focused on the random adventures of Han Solo and Chewbacca instead of trying to give us a backstory to give more depth to his character. Han Solo’s first love interest Qi’ra (Emilia Clarke) was the saving grace of the film. The cast is great, there’s no doubt about it. But there’s a reason why Disney stepped away from creating so many standalone Star Wars films, and I think this film was a contributing factor.  This is perhaps the goofiest entry in the original trilogy which is something I adore, mainly thanks to the Ewoks. There is nothing more lovable than a geared-up teddy bear that’s ready to kick some empire booty. It’s never clear how much time has passed between the events of The Empire Strikes Back and Return Of The Jedi but this being the final installment of a trilogy isn’t the worst but it’s not the greatest either. For some reason, I’ve always felt like there was an element missing from the story. Perhaps there are too many moving parts or not enough. I’ve never been able to put my finger on it but the scenes between Darth Vader (James Earl Jones) and Luke (Mark Hamill) are some of the best scripts that the franchise has to offer. As this is the final chapter of a trilogy it never feels like we got a proper goodbye ending to these characters we love so dear.  I will always acknowledge the importance and impact this film had on countless fans worldwide. It is the foundation of the franchise we all love so dearly and presented the start of the hero’s journey engagingly, which made it a lighting in-the-bottle experience. Nonetheless, I have always had more issues with this movie over other entries in this franchise. A New Hope is a well-made film full of outstanding performances and practical effects, but the pacing of this story is, unfortunately, its greatest downfall. I have watched this movie countless times and the beginning of Luke’s journey has always felt like the story is dragging its feet until the 2nd act when the story finally starts to give us insight into a larger galaxy. With that being said, this film shines with its expedition outside of the sands of Tatooine. “Now this is pod-racing!” I’ll admit it. I am a big fan of the prequel trilogy. I grew up with them and have always had a soft spot for this film. This is the start of Anakin’s journey as he is thrown into a life larger than himself.  Much like Star Wars: A New Hope, a good chunk of the film takes place on Tatooine and suffers a few of the same pacing issues with moving the story along. The main difference is that The Phantom Menace focuses more on the political state of the galaxy and it isn’t as action heavy. The visual effects are outdated but, for a film made in 1999, they were pretty impressive for its time. It always seems as if this film gets an unfair hake. We were introduced to Darth Maul and the double-sided lightsaber, the best pod-racing scene in the history of the franchise, and the Duel Of Fates score composed and conducted by John Williams. What’s not to love? Director Gareth Edwards has created one of the best modern Star Wars films in recent years, and even though it fits into the events of the mainline movies, it tells a bleak tale of sacrifice, freedom, and hope. From early drafts of the script to unused footage, this film pulls multiple inspirations from  A New Hope as this story serves as more of a prologue to the events of that film. Micheal Giacchino’s score for Rogue One is mostly original with a dash of John Williams’ work blended in. The theme of this story is about characters such as Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones) and Cassian Andor (Diego Luna) shifting from incarceration to developing their own free will. Not only is this one of my favorite films in the series, but It also gives the most jaw-dropping Darth Vader scene in the franchise.  “Let the past die. Kill it if you have to. It’s the only way to become who you were meant to be.” No one hates Star Wars more than Star Wars fans. This film will stand the test of time as the most divisive story in the franchise and I will defend it until the end of time. The Last Jedi is the most ambitious Star Wars movie to ever grace theaters and our television screens. Director Rian Johnson had a vision for this franchise moving forward and the only way to escape the Jedi and Sith struggle was to let the past die. The Last Jedi is a perfect sequel to The Force Awakens, they blend so well together especially dealing with the ancestry of Rey (Daisy Ridley), giving Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) the perfect send-off, and finally giving Disney the opening to move forward with how we view the Jedi and Sith. It is by no means a perfect movie but it still works. It encompasses the ideology of what the force is and much like Rey’s origin leaves more questions than answers.  Movies in which the protagonists fail to save the day will always be my bread and butter. It shows that even the greatest heroes we admire have flaws. It makes the heroes of the story relatable and shows us a different side of the characters when things do hit a rough patch. The Empire Strikes Back proves that a sequel can improve and outperform its predecessor. From the get-go, this film goes full steam from start to finish. It is the most well-paced out of the original trilogy and it feels like the characters are constantly on the run without changing locations before they have a moment to breathe. Every time I watch this film, time seems to fly by with no effort. This is one of the best climaxes that movies can offer and receives all of the respect it deserves. I saw this film three times in theaters, and to this day, it is easily one of my favorites of the mainline stories. Disney proved that they were able to handle ushering in a new wave of fans into this franchise. I’m aware of the naysayers when it comes to the sequel trilogy. People say this story echoes A New Hope and in some ways it does. However, I believe this to be a refined and improved film over A New Hope. The pacing is incredible and the movie flies by without any fatigue. The Force Awakens has so much to offer. Rey (Daisy Ridley) is a phenomenal character. I have always adored her determination, resourcefulness, and empathy toward others. This was Daisy’s first big role in her career and she is now one of the many faces for new Star Wars fans. Finn (John Boyega) and Poe Dameron (Oscar Issac) are strong additions, along with Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) becoming one of the most complex Star Wars villains in the franchise. Finn and Rey click instantly in the scenes they share. It makes me wish that their relationship would have evolved into something more intimate. “The Dark Side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural.”  This might come as a shock to most fans out there, but this is my favorite Star Wars story of all time. There is a chain of themes that snowball into one another. Fear leads to the anger of things you cannot control. Which launches you into hating the very thing you can’t contain, and ends in suffering. If there was one word to describe this tale of a fallen hero, it’s melancholy. This is not a happy story, this is the climax of Anakin’s passage to the dark side. His mind has been twisted and warped and as he slowly transforms into the greatest villain in movie history he never stops seeing himself as the hero of his narrative. Anakin/Darth Vader has always been a layered character, and that’s what makes his transformation so interesting. His suffering and hatred stem from multiple sources. The death of his mother, the distrust in the Jedi, the fear of Padme dying in childbirth, and countless other reasons. It is always fascinating to see a character go through a powerful transformation, whether it be for better or for worse."
"Sep 10, 2023",negative," In a galaxy far, far away, life is not always easy, and I’m not just talking about epic battles between good and evil. Though the final chapter of George Lucas’s saga begins right where its prequel left off, with the Resistance and The First Order very much at war and Rey (Daisy Ridley) still trying to understand the ways of the Force, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker also introduces new elements that drive the narrative away from the direction established by Rian Johnson in The Last Jedi.  Part of what made fans have such strong opinions (whether positive or negative) on Episode VIII is that it genuinely managed to subvert expectations on what a Star Wars movie should be like. In The Last Jedi, we learned that Jedis can make mistakes, that being rebellious isn’t always the answer, and that not every Star Wars character needs to be related to a Skywalker in order to be gifted in the Force. As a matter of fact, Rey’s parents were “nobodies”, and yet the Force is still very much “strong in this one”, as Master Yoda would put it.  Johnson also enabled ordinary characters, such as Rose (Kelly Marie Tran) and Vice Admiral Holdo (Laura Dern), to play an extraordinary role in the rebellion, and used Rey’s unexplicable connection with Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) to bring further meaning to the existence of the Force. Though The Last Jedi left more than one question unanswered and plenty of room for developing certain themes that are only hinted at in the film, The Rise of Skywalker strays from Johnson’s direction and takes a different path entirely. If The Last Jedi left us wondering about a child using the Force to move a broom, The Rise of Skywalker wants us to stick to the main storyline and directs our attention back to Rey’s origins. In fact, let’s forget about the last few movies entirely: Emperor Snoke (Andy Serkis) was as much of a “nobody” as Rey is, and we now have a new villain. Or, rather, a very old one: J.J.Abrams resurrects Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid), who is back with a new, evil plan. Only, his plan is not new and not evil at all, and his Night of the Living Dead look is not threatening at all. In fact, Palpatine’s unconvincing scheming is only the first of a series of developments that are not only messy and confusing, but also full of plot holes.  With the kind of attachment fans have to the first three chapters of the Star Wars saga, a high degree of nostalgia is to be expected in its latest releases, and The Rise of Skywalker doesn’t disappoint. Seeing Chewie (Joonas Suotamo) on the Millennium Falcon will always remind us of Han Solo (Harrison Ford), and we’ll never get tired of listening to C-3PO (Anthony Daniels)’s unsolicited opinions and watching Leia (Carrie Fisher) gracefully lead the rebels. The Rise of Skywalker provides plenty of nostalgic moments, quotable lines and familiar appearances that remind us of specific moments in Star Wars history.  It also leaves enough room for John Boyega and Oscar Isaac to shine as Finn and Poe Dameron, who are, without a doubt, the real heroes of this film. There are hilarious lines, meme-worthy scenes, insightful pearls of wisdom, chess games and a few truly unexpected twists that give much needed screen time to characters we seldom get to see. Yet, the narrative is so messy that it leaves little room for any real growth. It’s hard to take The Rise of Skywalker seriously, and that is simply because some of its narrative developments don’t seem to make much sense. In a film that is developed around nostalgia and that seems to borrow props from the Marvel Cinematic Universe, dialogues and scenes (and Basilisk!) from Harry Potter, supporting characters from Pirates of the Caribbean and sentimental moments from The Lion King and Beauty and the Beast, there isn’t much room for originality. A lot happens in a short amount of time: plans are conceived, characters learn unconvenient truths about each other and their relatives (in the best Star Wars tradition) and choices are made.  Yet, the absence of context makes it hard for the audience to understand some of these developments, which are given names but never really explained. In a film where everything happens too quickly and too easily, there isn’t any conflict to face, just like there is no real momentum or build-up. Though the movie does provide a few emotional scenes towards the end, it doesn’t leave us much room to let its harshest choices really sink in. It also makes it really hard to understand its confusing ending, and that is a real shame. Star Wars: The Rise of the Skywalker is not an unenjoyable movie altogether. You’ll find yourself laughing at its most absurd moments and genuinely having fun during its battle scenes. You’ll be mesmerized by Adam Driver’s performance and you’ll find yourself rooting for Finn, Poe, Leia, Chewbacca, C-3PO and R2D2 at different times and for different reasons. You’ll enjoy watching Lando (Billy Dee Williams) in action once more, you’ll get teary at the most unexpected times and you’ll channel your inner BB-8 (Brian Herring) more than once. You’ll also be frustrated by the film’s lack of clarity, and, at the end of it all, you’ll find yourself struggling to remember its most confusing moments."
"Jul 24, 2023",neutral," Synopsis: When it's discovered that the evil Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) did not die at the hands of Darth Vader (James Earl Jones), the rebels must race against the clock to find out his whereabouts. Finn (John Boyega) and Poe (Oscar Isaac) lead the Resistance to put a stop to the First Order's plans to form a new Empire, while Rey (Daisy Ridley) anticipates her inevitable confrontation with Kylo Ren (Adam Driver). The Rise of Skywalker is a tremendous letdown. I won’t sugarcoat it. If someone told me at the beginning of the year that J.J. Abrams wouldn’t be able to offer a satisfying end to the nine-episode story, I would laugh like crazy. It disappointed me so much that I don’t even want to extend this review more than the usual. I know that a lot of people hated The Last Jedi, but for better or worse, that film exists. Rian Johnson’s decisions were made. Some people received them well, some didn’t. But all of us got to watch and experience his narrative. There’s something called artistic integrity, which J.J. Abrams and Chris Terrio completely forgot about. The lack of respect for the saga’s previous installment is baffling. The structure-less screenplay is so unbelievably convoluted that it reaches a point where evident logical issues come into play. Major plot points occur due to some genuinely hard-to-believe events, and even the characters seem to have no path whatsoever. It’s entertainment for the sake of entertainment. Of course, there are a lot of visually jaw-dropping action sequences. The cinematography (Dan Mindel) is some of the best I’ve seen in the franchise and in this year. John Williams’ score is emotionally compelling, and it definitely elevates a lot of important moments, being a big source for the chills down my body. And yes, there are a bunch of epic scenes. However, throughout the whole runtime, the frustration was always there. Major threads and character backstories were answered in The Last Jedi, but The Rise of Skywalker feels more like another sequel to The Force Awakens than to Rian Johnson’s flick. If there’s one undeniable aspect about this trilogy that this last movie proves is that there was no plan. No roadmap. No overall structure. Whether you love or hate each or every installment, this is indisputable. Disney screwed up this time. Creative freedom is essential to filmmakers, but the production team behind a franchise needs to have a well-organized structure. The simple fact that J.J. Abrams directed the first film, left, and returned to do the third one, is already weird and uncommon by itself. Besides the lack of artistic integrity, there’s this feeling of constant disappointment throughout the movie. On several occasions, The Rise of Skywalker is so close to delivering a perfect sequence. A chill-inducing moment. An incredibly emotional scene. Almost every time, it fails at the last second, at the last line of dialogue, or at the last action movement. Some moments are still captivating, and they don’t lose that much impact. Nevertheless, some are totally destroyed by the most ridiculous, cringe-worthy choices I’ve witnessed in the saga. The first act is devoid of any thought. Characters go to places to get something they need to another place so that in that place, they find something else that leads them into another place… It’s frenetic, out-of-control pacing. The desperation to set up so many different side stories in time is so prominent that it’s visible from another galaxy. From the second act on, things get a bit more clear, and in the third act, all the threads blend decently. It’s in the last 30 minutes that the resemblances to Avengers: Endgame come into play. The only difference is that it doesn’t have 1/10 of the emotional impact due to the questionable decisions I mentioned above. Only one character got his arc complete without detours or significant changes: Kylo Ren. J.J. set him up, Rian Johnson continued his journey, and J.J. closed his arc pretty well. Every other character either got their arcs complete with major changes throughout, or they didn’t come close to finish their own story. There’s one exception, though, and that’s Carrie Fischer’s Leia. It would be extremely disrespectful and unfair for someone to criticize the filmmakers about her. They inserted her reasonably well in the scenes (please, if someone complains about visual effects, just get lost), and they did the absolute best they could under the known circumstances. I might be extremely disappointed, but I do have to send the team my congrats for closing her arc in the most dignified way possible. As for everyone else… well, the cast has been outstanding from the very beginning. Adam Driver, I have no words for him. He’s so perfect as Kylo Ren that I even defend his character as a villain more layered and emotionally complex than Darth Vader. I love Daisy Ridley as Rey, and she does a phenomenal job in this last film, even when her dialogue doesn’t entirely suit her. John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, and everyone else (who I won’t mention due to possible spoilers) are all brilliant, and I have to congratulate them on making every single movie a bit better."
"Jul 20, 2023",negative," Star Wars has gone through three evolutionary stages. The first trilogy of films captured the spirit of the Saturday afternoon movie serials produced during the golden age of Hollywood. Imaginative world-building and unambiguous good versus evil storylines provided state of the art escapism for a generation still recovering from Watergate and Vietnam. The second trilogy reflected the creator’s elevated sense of self-importance, the films themselves taking on a pretentious air of somber seriousness, as if George Lucas thought his puerile space operas were on equal footing with Shakespeare. Aesthetically, their antiseptic, computer generated images reflected the technological boom of the ‘90s. With the release of Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker – the supposed final episode of the final trilogy (yeah, right!) – the franchise has successfully recaptured some of the fun of the original trilogy while pandering to the concerns of millennials, such as diversity, representation and gender equality. No matter where one falls on the previous installment, the general consensus is Rian Johnson’s script for The Last Jedi was, for the most part, unpredictable, taking delight in deliberately subverting audience expectations. Despite grossing over a billion dollars, Johnson’s upset-the-apple-cart approach did not sit well with most fans. Apparently, the lesson learned from the backlash is that a successful Star Wars sequel must play it safe with a nostalgic approach that adheres to previously established formulae. To that end, writer/director J.J. Abrams, along with three other writers, course-corrected by recycling characters and plot points from the first trilogy, just as they did with The Force Awakens. Then they compensated for their lack of vision with more frequent and extravagant action sequences, Jedi powers approaching those of a god, and a bigger technological threat, which, of course, has the exploitable Achilles’ heel. Some fans might appreciate returning to familiar territory. However, there’s a fine line between familiarity and predictability, and The Rise of Skywalker crosses that line more than any of the previous chapters. It also undoes or ignores virtually everything that occurred in The Last Jedi. Structurally, it takes a while to settle into a comfortable rhythm; the first part of the film feels rushed, as if the filmmakers are desperately trying to establish where everyone is and what they’re doing as quickly as possible. The result is a “Previously on Star Wars…” ambience, as if we’re watching an extended recap of an episode that never was. Despite these shortcomings and more, The Rise of Skywalker mostly succeeds as popcorn entertainment thanks to a talented cast, impressive set pieces, a few laughs, and the occasional inspired moment. In fact, those who are emotionally invested in Rey’s character arc might want to bring some Kleenex along. But after an exhausting nine chapters, it’s become pastiche. Sadly, even John William’s classic Star Wars theme is starting to feel tired and clichéd. Ever since he was a teen, Paul has been involved in some form of film criticism, exhibition, or production. For the better part of two decades, he moderated the film discussion group, Let’s Talk About the Movies, which used to meet weekly inside the mezzanine of the historic Del Mar theater in downtown Santa Cruz. In 2023, Paul's insightful KSQD movie reviews earned him Tomatometer-Approved Critic status on Rotten Tomatoes (https://rottentomatoes.com/critic/paul-kanieski)."
"Apr 16, 2023",positive," Wrapping up a trilogy is a hard enough task on its own, with narrative threads and character arcs needing a succinct and satisfying conclusion. But with Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, director JJ Abrams and co-writer Chris Terrio had to wrap up 42 years worth of storytelling in one film while trying to please various fans with multiple expectations. The end result is a complicated conclusion that hits high highs and low lows. In the film, a year has passed since the events of 2017s The Last Jedi, and the conflict between the Resistance and the First Order has been shaken up by a mysterious message sent by Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid), threatening the galaxy with an armada of hidden Star Destroyers. Rey (Daisy Ridley),  Finn (John Boyega) and Poe Dameron (Oscar Issac) are sent by General Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher) on a mission to find the path towards the evil Sith menace, as Supreme Leader Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) attempts to thwart their efforts. If that information seems like a lot to take in, then the first fifteen minutes of this movie is going to be quite a shock to the system. One of the biggest issues with the movie is the pacing, with the opening crawl feeling less like a subtle introduction laced with important information and more like a Wookieepedia entry. The audience doesn’t really have much of a chance to breathe during the first act but at the same time – there’s plenty of spectacle, awe and love for these characters that you can’t help being drawn in. During the marketing campaign, the core cast mentioned how much they enjoyed working as a trio in this film and it’s clear every time you see them on screen. The love and friendship between these characters is joyous and contagious, allowing the audience to really believe in this self-made family, which is an important theme in the movie. Speaking of stand-out performances, C3P0 (Anthony Daniels) absolutely shines in this movie (pun-intended) delivering a performance that is sure to both move the audience one moment and make them laugh the next. Newcomers Jannah (Naomi Ackie),  Allegiant General Pryde (Richard E. Grant) and Zorri Bliss (Keri Russell) are a welcome introduction to the franchise but don’t have much of a chance to shine. With such a massive cast to focus on and so many narrative threads and plot details that need to be addressed.  Rian Johnson’s exploration of Kylo Ren and Rey in The Last Jedi was one of the most interesting parts of the Sequel Trilogy, and JJ Abrams picks up that torch by continuing to explore that particular relationship – including his own rendition of the fantastic force ability seen throughout the eighth installment. Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver once again act their hearts out portraying these two lost yet connected souls, yearning for family. While JJ doesn’t undo Rian’s work per se, there are definitely plot points such as Rey’s background that are once again framed as a ‘mystery’, and Rose Tico’s (Kelly Marie Tran) appearance in the film is woefully short, utilizing the character in exposition scenes.  However, the film mostly benefits from the previous episodic installment. The Rise of Skywalker is visually stunning, with set-pieces such as the festival on Pasaana and the ruins of the Second Death Star being highlights of the film. It’s absolutely one of the most visually appealing entries in the franchise, providing audiences with captivating flight sequences with the Millennium Falcon and some of the best lightsaber choreography in the saga. While at first daunting, obvious reasons, the use of Carrie Fisher and Leia in the movie is beautifully done – giving the character some purpose rather than just adding her in for no reason and allowing a fitting goodbye to a character that fans have adored for 42 years. The most frustrating aspect about The Rise of Skywalker is that it tries too hard to please everybody. If anything, the lesson both fans and Lucasfilm should have learned from The Last Jedi is that sometimes you can’t please everyone – and that’s okay. Fan-service isn’t always a bad thing, in fact, there are plenty of moments in the film that are pleasantly surprising and will certainly make some long-terms fans jump up in their seats, but this film is full to the brim with it. But the issue with fans having different ideas of what they want from the film means that these crafted moments will either make you beam, groan, or both. Thankfully, The Rise of Skywalker avoids the trappings of being Return of the Jedi with a modern coat applied to it and instead delivers a satisfying ending to the saga in whole. When it comes to tying up loose ends, the film actually does a pretty good job bringing this trilogy’s story to a close and fulfilling the main arcs of each core character – and also the wider saga-long story of the Skywalkers. JJ even adds in a sequence that’s as close to putting a bow on the whole thing as we’ll ever get. However, the film is stuffed with plot and quite frankly, some things just don’t get an answer or explanation at all. Presumably, those details will be left to other writers and creators in the next few years to fill out in books, games, etc. Overall, The Rise of Skywalker is a messy film that contains too much plot for its own good but also a really entertaining movie that showcases why audiences love Star Wars. Naturally, fans of Star Wars are not going to agree with every choice made in the film – but there are moments that are guaranteed to make people jump with joy.

"Mar 29, 2023",negative," Today is May 4th. Yep, that day. 
  Star Wars
 day. May the 4th be with you, etc. A pun that, thanks to the internet, somehow transformed a regular day into a global holiday of Star Wars worship. But there's only one problem: I don't really want to worship at that altar any more.  It's embarrassing, but there was a point in the pre-pandemic days -- during my first watch of The Rise of Skywalker -- where, in a packed theater, I audibly said ""what the hell?""  I can't remember exactly which part. There were a few candidates. It could have been right at the beginning, when Rose Tico (played by Kelly Marie Tran) was yanked from The Rise of Skywalker like Poochie from The Simpsons. A move that felt designed to placate the racist trolls who'd bullied Tran off social media in 2018.  It could have been the moment they ""unkilled"" Chewbacca, rewinding perhaps the only challenging moment in a first act that felt like it was written and edited by a 5-year-old high on sherbet.  Years later, distanced from the warped bubble of Star Wars ""discourse"" -- and its place in the culture wars that consume all light and reason -- it's still difficult to explain why this choice annoyed me so much.  In hindsight Rey's reveal was the moment when Star Wars stopped existing as an object I could believe in and transformed into banal fan fiction catering to the worst type of fan. When Star Wars shrank into a story in a Reddit thread far, far away. Designed to offend the least amount of people possible, built for people to sit in movie theatres and point. ""LOOK, IT'S LANDO. LANDO'S HERE!"" Pity my poor wife, eyes glazing over, who had to endure the train journey home. Me, arms waving like a madman, trying to explain why the passable sci-fi flick she'd just watched (and immediately began forgetting, like a normal adult) was a betrayal. That it deliberately and systematically unraveled every attempt made by The Last Jedi to reinvent Star Wars and have it successfully escape the dull nostalgia pit it's now fully descended into. I stand by the assessment. The Last Jedi was a movie that demanded we ""let the past die."" It railed against casual nostalgia. Entire sections, like the casino scene on Canto Bight, were far from perfect, but The Last Jedi was bold and inventive. It never invited us to point, ""LOOK, LANDO'S HERE!"" Instead, it did a fantastic job of shredding all fan expectations. It murdered its main villain halfway through the run time; transformed Luke Skywalker from a dull do-the-right-thing hero-type into a vicious, bitter hermit tortured by his own failings.  It was a film that paid testament to the weird imagination of the original trilogy, but refused to pander to the most basic tenets of its mythology. A vocal minority hated it, but for my money it was one of the bravest blockbuster movies of the last decade. It made me care about Star Wars again. In a post-Gamergate age, intense fandom has poisoned the well. The only response: Treat franchises like Star Wars and Marvel with indifference. If they rise above, like Into The Spider-Verse or Thor: Ragnarok? Great. If they don't? Ah well, it's just a movie. Taking it seriously is a losing game.  I made the crucial mistake that renders all fandom toxic: I was invested. As a teenager I devoured the Star Wars expanded universe. The good, the bad and The Courtship of Princess Leia. I was painfully in love with Star Wars as both a series and an idea. As an adult I had a huge amount of respect for the universe and the incredible movies it helped produce but now, post-Rise of Skywalker, I reckon I need a break from Star Wars. A long break.  May the Fourth be with you. Sure. I'd rather ignore it. It's a hashtag I'll be muting into oblivion. Because in a day that's supposed to be a celebration, there's not much to celebrate. "
"Dec 1, 2022",negative," I was reading Room to Dream, David Lynch’s memoir-of-sorts, on the way to Star Wars: Episode IX—The Rise of Skywalker. For Lynch, writes his biographer/interlocuter Kristine McKenna, “The 1950s have never really gone away […] classic rock ‘n’ roll; diner waitresses wearing cute little caps; girls in bobby sox and saddle shoes, sweaters and pleated plaid skirts—these are elements of Lynch’s aesthetic vocabulary.” It then occurred to me to check whether Lynch and George Lucas are contemporaries, which they are (born 1/20/46 and 5/14/44, respectively). For Lynch, these images are eternally recurring, whereas Lucas got them out of his system exactly once, in American Graffiti (set in 1962, but an Eisenhower-era holdover if there ever was one). Lynch’s preoccupation with his formative years risks courting an “OK, boomer” response, but results in adventurous, progressive work. Lucas had a different relationship to his upbringing, in which memories of movie serials, and the way he reformulated their narrative lessons, turned out to have 40 years (and counting’s) worth of implications: this is, on some level, the revenge of the boomers, as we live in the distant, much-distorted echoes of their formative cultural intake. (As it turns out, even setting aside Lynch being offered Return of the Jedi, I’m not the first person to make a connection between these two directors.) A serial of serials, The Rise of Skywalker is a calamitously overstuffed series of exposition dumps, relentless incident and canon box-checking, like watching someone who’s on four hours of sleep and three Red Bulls try to do an immense task in as little time as possible so they can crash again—the movie is barreling through about three times as much information as it could reasonably bear. Amidst the rush to answer certain long-teased questions (who are Rey’s parents, will Kylo Ren abandon the dark side), there is an ungodly amount of connective tissue that keeps characters moving from one location to another to no particular end. There are very basic screenwriting problems, like something happening and then characters in the very next scene describing to each other what you just saw, information they have to deliver to each other to keep the plot moving. There is very little time for character detail or tossed-off lines at the margins, and Richard E. Grant appears to actively be at war with the material (which is actually pretty funny). All the characters you would expect to make one final cameo do, including Carrie Fisher, which is a major mistake: her lines are all generic unused filler, perceptibly responding to nothing onscreen, and there’s an unavoidable she’s-not-there component to her accidental performance. (It’s very funny that in this truly alternate universe, Adam Driver looks like he’s basically the same height as everybody else.) One of the weirdest side effects of this new Star Wars trilogy is the backlash narrative, promulgated by Breitbart and other unsavory players, that basically says a beloved, red-blooded American franchise for manly men has been hijacked by SJWs ramming progressive politics down viewer throats. There isn’t much to this: there’s the Gamergate-inflected argument that Daisy Ridley’s Rey is feminist propaganda (?), and also that Lucasfilm is now owned by Disney. Because Disney World now does Gay Pride, and releases content featuring queer people, it logically follows that they’ve found yet another outlet for nefarious social engineering. As patently nutsoid as this argument is (please, explain to me precisely which “progressive values” are represented by the new trilogy, as opposed to normalizing permanent warfare as a default premise for entertainment, or the anti-Vietnam War allegorical intent of the very first film), it has some kind of countermyth staying power. This reached some kind of fever pitch or other last week when Breitbart’s John Nolte got pumped as the cast and crew started trashing The Last Jedi, thereby vindicating him and all his fellow Deplorables: “But, but, but, I was told only racist, toxic, sexist, alt-right wannabe Hitlers didn’t care for Star Wars: The Last Jedi…? At least that’s what all the super-smart people with blue checkmarks on Twitter told me.” Again, this is insane, but here’s the thing: the new Star Wars has definite messaging, of the most useless #Resistance kind. Oscar Isaac gets to rally the rebellion’s troops, explaining that there’s more of “us” than there are of “them,” and that the empire succeeds by making people think they don’t have a chance. This is dangerously close to “…and that’s why the Democratic Party must rally around Joe Biden,” and it’s certainly not going to help anything get done. As for me: this is where I get off the Star Wars train. I was happy enough to wrap up some unfinished childhood business, although if they’d stopped at Force Awakens that would have done the job just as well. Lord/Miller being fired from Solo was a clear indication that no coloring outside certain margins would be accepted (Lawrence Kasdan’s vision must be respected!), so there’s very little chance further interesting work will be done in this terrain. After 40 years, everyone can go home, we’re done here."
"Aug 25, 2022",positive," What a roller-coaster adventure the last two years have been for Star Wars fans. Fair or not, Rian Johnson’s “The Last Jedi” sparked all sorts of fan backlash, enough to prompt some to even blame it for the 2018 “Solo” movie’s disappointing box office numbers. Without question much of the outrage was over-the-top which caused many of the legitimate criticisms to be lost in the noise. But equally over-the-top was the critical praise, some of which heralded it as “the best Star Wars movie ever made”. Much of that was rooted in a needless lust for subversion and rabid contempt for fandom. In reality “The Last Jedi” had problems but it wasn’t the franchise killing disaster some have painted it as. Actually, outside of about 30 minutes of wildly uneven (and arguably bad) storytelling, it’s a movie with an assortment of big thrills and exciting moments. More importantly it left the story in a promising place and gave the characters plenty to reckon with. It ultimately set the table for “Rise of Skywalker” and the return of director and co-writer J.J. Abrams. Abrams clearly listened to the criticisms which has already triggered the predictable whines of “fan service” from certain critic circles. But Star Wars has always been about continuity and connection. Even the “stand-alone” movies are inherently connected to the films that came before them. So it makes sense that Abrams would try to rein in some of Johnson’s care-free creative choices. And as a movie tasked with wrapping up an entire four decade-plus saga, you almost have to expect some level of “fan service”. Here’s the important thing, the “fan service” we get in Episode IX isn’t half-baked or intrusive. Most of it is entertaining, nostalgic, and ultimately satisfying. Cool callbacks of all kinds pop up throughout the movie, lots of it genuinely in service to the story while other bits are simply there for the fun of it. Do they go a little overboard? Perhaps. But whether or not it is a dealbreaker for you probably depends on how you’re approaching this film as a whole. “Skywalker” gets off to a shaky (and frankly concerning) start. The first twenty minutes or so sees Abrams and co-writer Chris Terrio bouncing us from one location to another while never letting us plant our feet. There is some snazzy scenery and a couple of decent action sequences, but they’re kinda lost in the film’s manic rush to get the story and the characters to where they need to be. But once the narrative pieces are put in place, the movie slows down a bit and gets into a more manageable rhythm. The movie’s most captivating storyline remains the mysterious connection between young and raw Jedi extraordinaire Rey (Daisy Ridley) and tortured dark sider Kylo Ren (Adam Driver). Rey works hard to hone her skills but is still haunted by questions of her identity. Kylo (who steals the movie) uses every ounce of rage he can muster to smother out the glimmer of light within him. Both Ridley and Driver approach most of their scenes with a steely intensity befitting of their characters and their inevitable collision course. As for another big plus, “Skywalker” finally gives the trilogy’s heroes some meaningful screentime together. Rey, Poe (Oscar Isaac), Finn (John Boyega), Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo), C-3PO (Anthony Daniels), and of course BB-8 go off on a Sinbad-like quest (look that reference up kids) to find an artifact once sought by Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill). It’s believed to contain the location of a Wayfinder that will lead them to a Sith planet where a new dark force has emerged. It turns out Kylo Ren has a Wayfinder of his own and has ventured to the sinister planet. While there he discovers a way to turn his terrorizing First Order into a bigger and truly unstoppable force. But it requires that he kill his one biggest threat – Rey. So as the rag-tag band of heroes look for a way to the Sith planet, the First Order scours the entire galaxy in pursuit of them. Despite the seriousness of their mission, there are always moments of levity especially between playful best bros Poe and Finn. But it’s C-3PO who turns out to be the biggest ham. He’s the perfect punchline for several jokes but he also has some cracking comedic lines of his own. It’s just a shame R2-D2 was left back at the Rebel base with practically nothing to do. The same could be said for Lando (Billy Dee Williams). Who wasn’t thrilled to see the good-hearted gambler returning to the franchise? But he just conveniently pops up with little explanation and then quickly fades into the background. And as you might expect, we get several new characters entering the galaxy far, far away for the first time. Among the best, Keri Russell’s Zori Bliss, a shady old acquaintance of Poe’s. It’s not a big role, but Zori has a background fans will love to explore. Richard E. Grant is a hoot playing the sour and ever-serious Allegiant General Pryde of the First Order. Grant chews up his lines in classic imperial officer fashion. We don’t quite get enough of his story, but he’s a fun and interesting presence. And Star Wars knows how to do droids. New here is D-O, affectionately called “conehead” by Poe. Again, small role but tender and quite funny. Abrams does do some patchwork to several of Rian Johnson’s more controversial choices: Rey’s parents, Supreme Leader Snoke, etc. The movie addresses them in a way that should please many of the fans while infuriating those who couldn’t care less about Star Wars continuity or lore. But let’s be serious, “The Rise of Skywalker” had no chance of pleasing everyone. It was a hopeless proposition. So, do you follow Johnson’s lead and kick more sand in the eyes of long-time fans? Or do you make a movie for the devoted fanbase and face the ire of scorned critics? Sadly, an unnecessary chasm between critics and fans is all but certain and is already blazing across social media. The film will probably be held to a ridiculously high standard (by fans AND critics) and unhelpful comparisons to the original trilogy are all but inevitable. It’s a shame because “Rise of Skywalker” is pure entertainment – fun, at times thrilling, with a steady tinge of franchise nostalgia and an emotional punch at the end. It’s far from perfect. The story is messy, there’s enough plot to fill two movies, and some of its characters need more attention. But this is still very much a Star Wars film and will evoke many of those same old feelings of kid-like joy and excitement for those who allow it. I’m glad this worked for you, but I am so bitterly disappointed. I wanted so badly to like this and it sucks when something you love so much ends on a terrible note.  Awww, sorry to hear. I’m such a die-hard SW fan and I tend to digest these movies a lot differently than most. I had a really good time with it. My biggest gripe is that it had enough material for two movies. All this fandom and whiney moaners is a bit bonkers, I’m not sure if the same thing goes on with the Marvel or DC movies, probably, but I don’t think it’s as vitriolic as the Star Wars mob. Jeez people, it’s just a godamned movie, 🙄🤣 glad you enjoyed it anyway, Sean over at Assholes had similar feelings as yourself about it, so am thinking it was mostly OK. One day, in a TV room far far away (well 12 feet at least anyway) I will watch the SW movies in order, have only seen the first three. This has turned into a really weird thing partly because of tender-footed ‘fans’ and anti-fan critics. It’s really hard to have a rational discussion about this series these days. I really enjoyed it. I don’t think it had as strong an impact as a closing chapter as it could have. I think Return of the Jedi and Revenge of the Sith both stuck the landing a bit better. Yet I found it a blast. I kinda wish some of those early reviews didn’t seem to pit it as a Last Jedi vs the world situation. It felt like the knives were out just because it tried not to be divisive like The Last Jedi.  Yep, it’s unfortunate who the division over TLJ is actually showing itself in many critic reviews. My only real gripe on this one is that it felt rushed which left some storylines feeling underserved. My son made the comment that there was enough material here for two movies. The Last Jedi by Rian Johnson is the only movie in the trilogy that somewhat works and is because is the one movie JJ Abrams did NOT write, NOT direct.  That’s interesting because The Last Jedi is easily my least favorite SW movie. It’s a film full of incredible moments but an absolute mess of a script.  You do realize THAT doesn’t help ease the discourse right? I’m a long time fan since I watched the original trilogy in theaters, during the initial release of Return Of The Jedi. Well I loved both The Force Awakens AND The Last Jedi, but I still enjoyed The Rise Of Skywalker. How do I fit in your narrative? It doesn’t sound like you do fit into my “narrative”. I too watched all of the original films at the theater. Loved them. Watched all of the prequel trilogy on the big screen. I like those films. Watched all the sequel trilogy including TLJ in theaters. Liked them too. So it sounds like I’m coming from the angle as you. So I take it what you wrote there was done tongue in cheek then? Because it seemed Rian Johnson did write TLJ for the devoted fanbase. He actually covers themes and story threads that started in the prequels, and continued in Clone Wars and Rebels. He’s rewarding fans who are deep into Star Wars lore and history, by acknowledging what those entrees contributed to the whole mythology. How is that considered kicking sand in the eyes of long time fans? Which is why I like the movie (even wrote a recent piece defending the Luke Skywalker depiction). But at the same time he also chose to be subversive in an episode titled Episode VIII and clearly did so with little thought of fan reactions. This was essentially reinforced by recent defensive comments about “pandering” to fans.  But my comments were framed in the form of two questions which (unfortunately) represents the two most vocal sides of the responses. As I’ve alluded to on my site and in the review, I don’t subscribe to either. I certainly don’t blame Abrams for going a different route. But also my problems with TLJ was more about storytelling flaws than what most ‘fans’ are still fussing about. I’m seeing this tomorrow morning and I’ve already lowered my expectations (though I tend to keep it low).  At least it’s not fucking Cats.  The image of Rebel Wilson eating CGI cockroaches already made me throw up as I’m still dealing with flu-like illnesses in coughs, runny noses, and a sore throat. Ya know part of me wants to see “Cats” just to witness its horror. But another part of me doesn’t want to give them a dime of my money. So we are watching Star Wars again. Haven’t seen it yet, but I did get the sense that at least some critics are just looking for a reason not to like it.  Kind of like the last one hurt their feelings and they are getting even. It does seem like Abrams didn’t have a chance with some critics. I had a lot of fun despite its flaws. Seeing it again tomorrow.  (SPOILERS)))))))))That whole potential love triangle was weird and then just vanished. Was he going to tell her he loved her, that Poe loved, or what? TLJ ends with that odd Finn and Rose kiss, Poe seems to have feelings for Rey but they Zorii comes along and there is clearly a spark there, and then Rey has her kiss moment with somebody totally different. The three of them all hug at the end which I think is the best scenario – they are simply the best of friends. Lots of loose ends and side roads that lead nowhere.  Some one above mentioned how Revenge of the Sith,  an Return to the Jedi both stuck the landing for their respective series and this one doesn’t quite do that,  I have to agree. Rushed and patched together it meets fan expectations for nostalgia in several places, but that often leaves the story we should be following dangling.  The last trilogy feels cobbled together,  as if they had only the most general idea of where they were heading,  and they tried to work it out as they went along. Emotional satisfaction was low for me, but as usual,  the spectacle  was solid. Maybe it will work better on subsequent viewing,  but that is not the way I think I should have to go with a Star Wars movie. That kind of speaks to one of my biggest gripes – there was enough material here for two movies. Obviously though, that doesn’t fit into the trilogy format. (SPOILERS))))))) Things like Leia teaching Rey in the ways of the force. That’s a pretty big thing that needs more attention than a brief flashback of Luke training Leia. Same with Rey’s parents. The revelation is interesting but it still needed more attention. Good review, Keith. I agree with your point, it’s messy but it’s enjoyable. I guess for me, it was not a good the end film for the franchise, but oh well. Wow. Haven’t felt Anakin’s story impacted much at all by this other than it was his grandson and a new Jedi trained by his children who ultimately ended the Sith threat. Still, a better movie than TLJ for me. Anakin’s whole reason to turn to dark side? Here Kylo and Rey can just heal the others, just like that. Anakin’s prophecy? LOL Emperor and all the shit is back. Anakin also helps this random chick and doesn’t help his own grandson. I’d say that is some impact. Saving Padme was in Anakin’s mind but it was fed to him by Palpatine who then exploited it to his advantage. But in Episode III Palpatine alluded to these very powers we see in this film and even see from Baby Yoda. And I’m not sure how Anakin could help his grandson. He’s been dead since well before Kylo was born. Man, you hear Anakin’s voice rooting for Rey. He says nothing to Ben. You have Luke literally lift a plane for her. Are you really not sure how he could help when you have force ghosts doing this? What’s the different that Palpatine told him about it? You now have two characters having that power out of nowhere for really no reason other than playing ping pong with life force. Why would we think that Anakin’s force ghost would suddenly appear when the only time we’ve ever even seen it is standing next to Yoda and Obi-Wan in Return of the Jedi? He has literally zero presence other than in voices some of which were manipulations of Palpatine. As for Rey having her power, we learn she has many powers she doesn’t realize she has. Sith lightning anyone? I don’t know, to me them having healing powers doesn’t ruin things. It just speaks to the criticism I have mentioned, that there is too much material here for just one movie. And the only reason for him not having presence is because the writers didn’t include him when they could and should. It’s the worst script for a blockbuster I saw in years. You have the Sith messing with Ben his entire life and the Jedi never intervening once when they all do for Rey in the end. It’s indefensible. Luke (trying to rebuild the Jedi) was literally training Ben when he turned to the Dark Side. He was trying to help him. The ghosts didn’t appear to Ben after he turned but that’s not unusual. They never appeared to Vader either. I suppose they could have appeared to Ben before he turned. But don’t Force ghosts only appear to those they had personal connections with? What a fantastic review, I can’t help but agree with you on how this film will most certainly not eliminate any grievances people have had since the beginning of the new era of films. Your review is honestly the most fair I’ve seen yet. Thank you so much. Appreciate you checking it out. I just finished watching it a second time and I definitely stand by my score. It’s a strong 4 stars. I even liked it better a second time because I picked up on so many more things I had missed. That’s what I’m hoping will happen for me too. I always feel that the best way to handle an opinion is by giving whatever it is a second chance.  The movie throws so much at you and it can be a little overwhelming on the first viewing. But this time I knew where the story was going so I could pay closer attention to the details. Picked up several things that gave me some clarity.  As a big fan of The Last Jedi who generally sides more with the Lucasfilm and their creative choices than with the more vocal fans… I absolutely love The Rise of Skywalker (just got back from seeing it)!  An epic, satisfying, resonating conclusion to the Skywalker Saga and the Trilogy of Trilogies. I had so much fun with it especially after a second viewing. Do yourself a favor and watch it a second time. You’ll notice so many more things you may have missed in the first viewing. Oh, I’m almost definitely going for a second viewing!  Such a lot of fun.  Loved all the easter eggs/references to almost all of the previous movies. Solid review mate. Have to say as a massive fan of TLJ I was disappointed by a lot of the storytelling aspects of this film, but I did enjoy it in the moment. My own review reflects my dismay at the seemingly offhanded way JJ and Co tried to tie up all the disparate plot points – the revelation of Rey’s parentage, while shocking, wasn’t given anywhere near enough time to bake into the audience’s brain, IMO – within the film’s lengthy timeframe. It’s also a shame at the obvious shade thrown at TLJ in such a snarky manner (the scene with Force Ghost Luke and the lighsabre, most obviously) which left me with a sour taste in the mouth. Performances were generally good considering: in my own review I write that the characters weren’t given dialogue so much as they were given exposition, the difference between the two being that dialogue allows the characters to grow, whilst exposition allows the characters to go. The latter, whilst important, robs a lot of character beats from the story and results in a thinner, less emotional film (again, IMO), and this is the crucial deficit the film has. That said, the visuals are spectacular, the sound mix astonishing (I think the subwoofers in the cinema I saw this in couldn’t handle the LFE Abrams threw at us, they were bottoming out) and the music again was among the highlights. Time will tell how the Sequel Trilogy holds up but for me Rise Of Skywalker was a disappointment compared to the relatively even-handed earlier two films. Those are completely fair criticisms. I guess I didn’t really have a problem with Luke’s scene mainly because he is in such a different place by the end of TLJ than he was when he pitched the lightsaber. I could see him saying the same thing at that point in the previous film. It’s one reason I never had a problem with how TLJ treated Luke. You’re right, there is a lot of exposition. But I also felt it had several good emotional punches. And one reason I like it better than TLJ is because it doesn’t have any pointless and befuddling sequences like the Casino planet excursion. My biggest gripe (and you touch on it) is that several details in this movie needed more time and attention. You’re 100% right about the Palpatine revelation. Also the whole idea of Leia being trained in the force by Luke. That seems like such a major bit of information yet we get a brief flashback image and a few words from Luke and that’s about it. In their defense though, I saw an interview where Abrams said they had more planned but obviously with Carrie Fisher‘s death they were much more limited than they intended to be. Great review as ever Keith. I appreciated your wider perspective of the film by trying to tie it to the perception of The Last Jedi and the almost impossible task that Abrams had.  I liked the film and would call it a good Star Wars film. This is mostly down to Rey’s arc and subsequent internal wrestle with her lineage. It feels so in keeping with the franchise and its themes. Thanks so much. I’m glad you enjoyed it too. I know some people walked away disappointed but I had a lot of fun with it. Then again, I view all of these movies as a whole. Some episodes are better than others but they all come together to form something I always have and always will love. That’s an excellent point. It’s a big story that’s split into different chapters. And with that comes weak and strong entries etc. Endings are especially tricky and I would have liked to have seen the social media reaction/general consensus for Return of the Jedi and Revenge of the Sith.  Much like some of the reviews at the time, I don’t think The Empire Strikes Back would be as enamoured if it were released during the era of social media.  Trying to digest everything that went down after seeing it , is like taking in too much pie and struggling to swallow it lol But I will say there was in my opinion much course correction going on from The Last Jedi . I was not a fan of that movie over all , although the performances were solid , Johnson made choices that I really disliked and it was clear JJ took to heart the anger of many fans . The first part was a bit muddled but once it got going , it was frenetic pace . They dealt decently with the death of Fisher limiting what could have been in this movie . I felt there where tons of fan service but I was quite happy with that . The scene that featured Han talking to Ben Solo/Kylo Ren had more impact and heart for me than it the scene in the Force Awakens. Plus it was great to see Lando back and to see Luke as a force ghost was great . Still not sold on the Emperor return and how that all went down but my I might need to see it again before I can rate it fairly . As it stands , my view still stands that this whole series of movies was unneeded but here we are . So without being too nit picky , a solid 7.5 . Definitely see it again. You’re right, there is so much to follow and process during a first viewing. You spend a lot of time just trying to keep up with plot points especially during the first act. But my second viewing was really great mainly because I knew where the story was going so I could just focus on the details, characters, etc. It opened the movie up even more to me. I get what you’re saying about Palpatine, but think of it this way. From episode one all the way to this movie this really is a saga of too powerful families, the Skywalkers and the Palpatines. All three trilogies have this in common. So I found it kind of cool that the final movie of the saga dealt with that story thread and brought it to a conclusion. Just a thought. That is true and I thought that by Rey being saved by a Skywalker and her rejecting the name of her grandfather and adopting Skywalker, it brings a piece to the force. Just my observation.But I’m going again this weekend, and I also agree, the pace may slow down a bit so I will able to see the movie in a clearer light . The pace issue made a world of difference. Being able to sit back and take in the details paints things in a new light. Hoping to see it one more time before it leaves the big screen. Great review Keith and I’m glad you enjoyed Rise of Skywalker.  I liked it fine and was entertained but as the end of a trilogy and a saga it was a little weak – looking forward to the Mandalorian when we get Disney+ here in the UK at the end of March! Oh gosh! I forget you guys are still waiting on Mandalorian! That’s just terrible. I’m sure there are things behind the scenes that I just don’t understand, but it stinks that there is such a huge gap between release dates. Yeah, it’s seemingly all down to the various contracts/licensing agreements Disney has with different outlets worldwide, which need to expire before Disney+ can go live.  Looking forward to it!"
"Aug 22, 2022",neutral," A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away, the creators of the new Star Wars Trilogy must be dedicated environmentalists, because they keep recycling the same old material over and over and over. I’m not sure if it’s my fond memories of my childhood re-watching the original Star Wars series that have me holding the JJ Abrams-helmed incarnation to a higher standard. The mastermind behind Lost clearly has his heart in the right place; you can agree, even more so, when you compare it to the great George Lucas merchandise six-year cash grabs at the turn of the century. The passion for it is there. The visual effects are more than impressive, and there are a few mild moments of rare inspiration, but that’s usually reserved from the droids (and Anthony Daniels’ gift of the gab and comic timing). Star Wars: The Rise of the Skywalker, while an improvement over the last two, can’t hold a light-saber to Rogue One, and has an emotional payoff that’s akin to Bill Murray trying to recapture the magic in several scenes with Andie McDowell in Groundhog Day. I’m starting to wonder if a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away, Abrams and Chris Terrio, the writers of the newest Star Wars Trilogy, must be dedicated environmentalists, because they keep recycling the same-old material over and over and over. Every time when the gang goes off to find a piece of the puzzle, right after they complete their task, the bad guys show up to ruin their fun. The same plotlines are recycled from previous chapters, so there is hardly any suspense that built or had. The script also, especially with the modern film trilogy, relies on cringe-worthy dialogue. Remember when we used to get gems like, “Why, you stuck-up, half-witted, scruffy-looking nerf herder!.” Now we get, in particular when it comes to transitioning scenes, a line that usually goes to something like, “Wait,“ and then repeat the exact same line like deja-vu (usually John Boyega’s Finn is saddled with this task). Even the same tropes and MacGuffin’s are on autopilot and are used as standards here. That would all be fine or at least condoned if the casting was right from the start. The original big three of Hamill, Ford, and Fisher had great chemistry, as a unit, or in a separate one on one encounter. Their conflict made things interesting. Here, their current “throuple” interactions, conflict, or buddy-time, is forced and unnatural. Oscar Isaac, God love him for everything else he acts in, is swinging and missing when it comes to being the comic, swashbuckling relief that Harrison Ford perfected 40 years earlier. Boyega’s Finn has been relegated to screaming a character’s name and staring at Rey with puppy-dog eyes. It’s a hoot to see some old characters return, but more screen time would have been appreciated for new additions like Keri Russel’s Zori Bliss. The special effects are top-notch, and there is value in telling a story simply and competently, even if repeated, as it is entertainment product that has had consistent success and many love, after all. Adam Driver, besides the natural head of black hair that looks like Darth Vadar’s helmet, is a gifted actor and makes for an interesting villain. As mentioned before, Anthony Daniels is the main source of comic relief with his sharp timing and pitch perfect delivery. Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, and this current trilogy, for that matter, belongs to Daisy Ridley. It’s an incredibly hard role to fill and pull off, emotionally and physically. It may be, and might not receive praise as, the best performance in an action-adventure series in recent memory. She is the heart and soul of this franchise and it’s the perfect fit for the decade that is finally recognizing strong, smart, confident female characters. Overall, The Force Awakens, The Last Jedi, and The Rise of the Skywalker prove, if anything, you can’t go home again. Yes, they aren’t remakes. These are new films, but they are similar and feel like a repackaged holiday gift from the Aunt who says she can’t afford much but spends her Winters in Boca Rotan. If you enjoy the series, I am glad, you got your money’s worth. Though, you should demand more for your dollar. Especially at today’s prices and the amount of money spent on technical production, this could have afforded a rewrite from a script doctor not that far, far away. Marc Miller (also known as M.N. Miller) joined Ready Steady Cut in April 2018 as a Film and TV Critic, publishing over 1,600 articles on the website. Since a young age, Marc dreamed of becoming a legitimate critic and having that famous “Rotten Tomato” approved status – in 2023, he achieved that status."

A payoff 42 years in the making, this ninth episode in the three-trilogy cycle of films that began with 1977's Star Wars (later subtitled A New Hope) is a rip-snorter of a big-budget big-screen adventure. True to the spirit of both the schlocky serials and high-art Japanese cinema that originally inspired George Lucas in his epic visionary story-telling, this film has literally something for everybody - tipping the hat to, inviting back on set or channelling the after-life spirit of practically every character and storyline from the franchise.  There's a lot of backstory to know and anyone walking in cold with this as their first film in the series will wonder what the people in the cinema around them are laughing, crying or air-punching over with such force.  In the first three films, a young man is identified as being gifted in the mystical Force and trained by a group of galactic police, the Jedi Knights, while his girlfriend makes a career transition from Queen to Senator. Her work mentor, it turns out, is secretly the head of an army of anti-Jedis called the Sith who orchestrate to wipe the Jedi from the face of the galaxy. Thwarted in his career ambitions, the young man allows himself to be head-hunted, throws on some dark soldier togs and retitles himself Darth Vader, while his girlfriend gives birth to their twin children, and dies.  In the second three films, the separated-at-birth twins Luke and Leia are grown up, know nothing about their origin story but find themselves fighting side-by-side against Darth Vader, now 2-I-C to the evil Emperor. Dad eventually sides with the kids and deals the evil Empire a gut punch.  Hero of the third trilogy of films is Rey (Daisy Ridley) whom we met in 2015's The Force Awakens as an orphaned scavenger of scrap metal whose plumb find is a robot (""droid"" in these films) that knows where long-lost Jedi Luke Skywalker has hidden himself. Rey finds herself immersed in the still-active Rebellion, headed up by Leia, now a General and mother to Ben Solo (Adam Driver) whose teenage rebellion has turned very dark. Young Ben has learned his mother and uncle's Jedi skills but has turned to the dark side, dressing up as his grandfather Vader and calling himself Kylo Ren.  Like Hamlet, Kylo/Ben holds his grandfather's skull aloft while pondering his place in the universe. Is he good or is he bad? He isn't wrong for wondering this. After all, his mother is the leader of a group of domestic terrorists and since he and Rey defeated the evil Snoke in 2017's The Last Jedi, he is Acting Secretary in the galaxy far far away's Department of Home Affairs, the ""First Order"".  Kylo/Ben feels a unique connection to Rey, whose Jedi skills under Leia's tutelage have grown to match his own, and thinks she should join him on the throne, but it turns out the Emperor (Ian McDiarmid) didn't die and has plans for the pair.  That is just one strand of dozens of plots that find a resolution in The Rise of Skywalker's screenplay as written by J.J. Abrams and Justice League scribe Chris Terrio, even if Abrams the director doesn't give you viewer too much time between plot moments to appreciate or react. Abrams and Terrio are obviously big George Lucas fans because this film not only addresses but honours practically every wish a fan might have had.  Almost every peripheral character from the series makes an appearance, gets a resolution. Every droid has their moment in the sun, with one making a tear-jerking noble sacrifice. One of the production team's greatest accomplishments is to keep Carrie Fisher's General Leia Organa front-and-centre to the action throughout, despite Fisher having died before the previous film wrapped. There's many reasons I'll be wanting to rewatch this film multiple times, and the first few repeat viewings will be to work out where these shots might have come from.  Missing from the film is any real sense of danger for the characters. Despite being the theoretical final installment, Disney shelled out billions of dollars to acquire the intellectual property from George Lucas, and it was hard to imagine they'd risk any future possible spin-off or toy income with a Tarantino Hateful Eight-style no-man-gets-out-of-here-alive finale.  Generations of families have grown up with these characters. I once got called into the office of my son's daycare principal for a dressing-down after he was caught mimicking the double-lightsaber decapitation scene from Revenge of the Sith. We both still pretend we're opening the automatic doors in shopping malls with The Force. "
"Jul 7, 2022",positive," “Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker”, la última entrega de la saga Skywalker. Era imposible no emocionarme, Star Wars es lo que es y no importa qué tiene un espacio muy especial en mí y por tanto, mis gustos. El episodio 9 mantiene su rigidez a base de pura nostalgia, entretenimiento y complacer a los fanáticos.  La película es tan complaciente que por momentos tira la lógica y la continuidad de los eventos de las películas pasadas por la borda. No puedo dejar de aceptar que aveces me encontraba pensando que lo estaba ocurriendo no hacía sentido y hasta se sentía apresurado y/o fuera de lugar (efecto “Game of Thrones"").  Pero siendo totalmente sincero, me sentí por completo en otra galaxia. Me emocioné cuando me tenía que emocionar, me entristecí cuando tuve que hacerlo, me sorprendí y hasta salté de la emoción a veces. Las peleas están espectaculares, un flashback se robó la película completa, los easter eggs y hints a sus predecesoras son interminables e invaluables.  Nunca me cansaré de decir que el Kylo Ren/Ben Solo de Adam Driver fue lo mejor que nos dejó esta trilogía, y el final es tan Disney pero a la vez tan nostálgico que me hizo saber cómo todo el que se hace llamar fanático de Star Wars puede auto-proclamarse un Skywalker. Long live una de las familias más icónicas en la historia del cine y de la cultura pop."
"Feb 22, 2022",negative," If Rian Johnson upset a segment of Star Wars fans by subverting expectations and taking the franchise in a new direction with The Last Jedi (2017), then J.J. Abrams could be faulted for not following the new course with his sequel, Star Wars: Episode IX – The Rise of Skywalker. Johnson’s divisive film introduced alternative ideas and thematic deviations into the Star Wars mythology, inventing sometimes oddball story elements (Leia using the Force to pull herself through space) that clashed with the first six episodes overseen by George Lucas—whose integrity Abrams jealously preserved in his entertaining 2015 reboot, The Force Awakens. Some of The Last Jedi‘s detractors felt that while change is welcome and needed for a franchise to endure, Johnson’s film did not follow the episodic progression implied with Star Wars’ roots in Saturday matinee serials. The Last Jedi is a well-made film, often gorgeous and thrillingly acted, but in the sequential order of things, it sticks out like a sore thumb. After Johnson’s film incited ridiculous protests and online petitions to have it stricken from the canon, the Disney overseers have attempted to course-correct with The Rise of Skywalker, a cinematic apology to fans for tampering with their hallowed grounds.  That’s where Star Wars fandom stands today. The discourse about films of this sort has degraded to such a degree that viewers now demand studios make their franchise movies in the manner they expect and feel entitled. All else is jettisoned, denied as a part of their selective reality. When the theatrical version of Justice League (2017) underwhelmed, online communities demanded that Warner Bros. release director Zack Snyder’s original cut. When The Last Jedi challenged the rules of Star Wars, fans clamored and asked that it be stricken from the record and remade. And if The Rise of Skywalker is any indication, Disney listens to the most vocal protestors and endeavors to appease them. After all, the House of Mouse desperately wants to gratify fans, if only to ensure the billion-dollar potential of each new Star Wars film. Given such pandering and the ever-discontent fanbase, Star Wars has become, for this critic, a low, exhausting state of affairs that discourages further enthusiasm about anything having to do with this franchise.  Star Wars has been wildly inconsistent from the start. Plot holes and story inconsistencies run rampant throughout the original trilogy. Later, Lucas’ abortive prequel trilogy, marred by early CGI characters that appear laughable by today’s standards, cheapened the franchise by demystifying the originals. Meanwhile, Disney’s now-complete trilogy has a manic dramatic arc, reflected by the wildly impulsive motivations of Rey (Daisy Ridley) and Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), who teeter-totter between the Dark Side and the light, often within the same episode. Whereas the first two trilogies each have an overarching story that spans their three films, Disney’s Star Wars output seems to be making it up as it goes along. Everything from the individual episodes and maligned spinoffs (Rogue One and Solo) feel like nothing more than disorganized fan fiction. It’s a studio trying, desperately, to manage its audience rather than tell a story. As a result, the characters from The Force Awakens rarely feel like the same characters from The Last Jedi or The Rise of Skywalker.  With that in mind, Abrams’ new episode, which he co-wrote alongside Chris Terrio (who wrote Justice League no less) from a story with contributions by Colin Trevorrow and Derek Connolly, tries to reset the franchise’s forward momentum to something resembling where he started with The Force Awakens. Abrams has already established himself as Hollywood’s defacto rebooter of franchises (see his Mission: Impossible III and Star Trek). And while his latest stops short of pretending The Last Jedi never happened, it uses a considerable amount of energy on shifting the overarching story away from where Johnson had pointed it. Instead, he concentrates on satiating the audience with nostalgia and correcting the perceived mistakes of the past. For instance, Abrams tidies up the plot holes that have existed since The Empire Strikes Back (1980), where Leia (Carrie Fisher) was propped up as “another” hope in place of Luke, but nothing ever happened with that. In The Rise of Skywalker, there’s a brief flashback of Luke (Mark Hamill) training his sister in the ways of the Jedi, which would explain why she has Jedi abilities later in life.  While Abrams builds upon the integrity of Johnson’s film with flashbacks that explain why Leia had the Jedi mastery to pull herself through space, he’s less generous elsewhere. On the question of Luke’s monk-like solitude and aversion to the ancient Jedi texts in Johnson’s film, Luke makes a stark admission here: “I was wrong.” Indeed, Abrams undoes many of the most potent alterations in The Last Jedi, such as moving the story away from Johnson’s rallying theme built around the average nobody. Abrams also rethinks the last film’s sudden shifts in character. Kylo Ren, who destroyed his Darth Vader-inspired helmet in Johnson’s film in an act of independence from his grandfather’s example, repairs the mask now, making him look appropriately fractured. After all, as a result of the back-and-forth between Abrams’ and Johnson’s films, cracked identities are what drive Disney’s trilogy. Ever split between his draw to the Dark Side and his parents’ hero legacy, Kylo Ren can’t decide which path to take. Neither can Rey, who was led to believe her parents were nobodies in The Last Jedi. However, Abrams changes that too, revealing a twist that not only upends Johnson’s film but better justifies her impulse to reach into the darkest corners of her identity. In this film, she once again must confront her Dark Side, personified by a hooded evil twin with a double-edged lightsaber.  When The Rise of Skywalker opens, everyone’s looking for Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid), whose presence has returned to the galaxy in the form of a Frankensteined-together cyborg. As it turns out, Palpatine has been controlling the voices in Kylo Ren’s head, using the puppeteered Snoke, clones, and astral projection (or something) to build the empire’s First Order into the new “Final Order” for his hooded, chanting Sith army. Palpatine even promises Kylo Ren the galaxy if he kills the last remaining Jedi, Rey. In another part of the galaxy, our heroes—Rey, Finn (John Boyega), Poe (Oscar Isaac), Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo), and a posse of droids—scramble to find Palpatine on the hidden planet Exegol, but to do that, they need a MacGuffin called a Sith Wayfinder. Abrams and Terrio have structured most of their film around gathering one MacGuffin that leads to another MacGuffin and so on, propelling our heroes from one planet to the next in search of a plot device. Much like the superfluousness of The Last Jedi’s casino planet interlude, there’s a subplot or two that feel unnecessary, giving the film an excuse to check fan service boxes. All the while, Rose (Kelly Marie Tran), so important in Johnson’s film to establish its themes that anyone can be a hero, has been reduced to a minor supporting role.  The extraneous plotting pushes the runtime over 140 minutes, which gives the filmmakers ample time to engage the viewer’s sense of nostalgia and bring finality to the nine-episode saga. Abrams has exhumed beloved characters and images from earlier films to accomplish this farewell-of-a-movie, which attempts to close the “Skywalker Saga” that began with The Phantom Menace (1999)—technically, A New Hope (1977). Besides the resurrected Palpatine, Luke Skywalker and Han Solo (Harrison Ford) make appearances as a ghost and a projected memory, respectively. In a different sort of resurrection, the late Carrie Fisher, who died in 2016 before The Last Jedi hit theaters, appears as a CGI character constructed of outtakes from Johnson and Abrams’ previous episodes—demonstrating that Disney no longer needs actors to create convincing performances (admittedly, the effect looks better than the young Fisher in Rogue One). Both Chewbacca and C-3PO meet their demise in The Rise of Skywalker, and each of them experiences a type of rebirth a few scenes later. Billy Dee Williams appears once more as Lando Calrissian, looking relaxed in a role he last played a quarter-century ago. The film even dredges up the Death Star. The resurrection motif becomes tiresome, if only because it spends more time reflecting on the past than advancing the story. But then, that’s just what Abrams does.  Even as major characters show up for their obligatory goodbye to the fanbase, the few innovations in the film remain uninspired, confusing, and downright silly. The Rise of Skywalker introduces the idea that Rey’s powerful grasp of the Force allows her to miraculously heal injuries, a skill she masters on the first try, despite her abilities proving unwieldy in another scene that leads to an accidental shuttle explosion. Also, running with an idea from The Last Jedi that Kylo Ren and Rey converse using Force-based telepathy, Abrams mounts psychic lightsaber duels where the boundaries of each duellist’s location begin to overlap with the other. He takes this idea even further when psychic projections become tangible objects, leading to a type of lightsaber teleportation in one scene. The bond between these two characters also has some curious implications about the sheer power they share when together, but I’m not sure I understand it, perhaps because, like most everything else in this film, it’s breezed over—including a last-minute romantic turn. At last, in the final duel between Palpatine and Rey, they fight as “All the Sith” versus “All the Jedi” in a ridiculous battle of energy beams that settles the matter once and for all (for now).  This is a deliriously paced film that barely leaves a moment for the viewer to process what’s happening. That comes later. If his other work is any indication, Abrams is a propulsive director of action driven by faces, chases, and places. His films rush from one disaster to the next, during which the viewer cannot breathe, much less absorb every plot detail. In the first scenes, the Millenium Falcon zips through an ice shaft, pursued by enemy fighters, while the characters spout expositional dialogue amid the occasional “That was a close one!” It’s difficult to say what’s happening or why, but boy, is it exciting. Editors Maryann Brandon and Stefan Grube maintain the film’s breakneck pacing, yet they hardly leave time for us to access the emotional center of these characters and their many motivational shifts. Later, Kylo Ren and Rey’s lightsaber duel on the Death Star’s half-submerged ruins, an image of grandiosity to be sure, goes on and on ad nauseam. But there’s no consequence to the scene, apart from neat-looking action. Abrams has directed The Rise of Skywalker into meme-worthy moments that have no greater consequence, but they can be easily shared on social media to facilitate cultural saturation.  Capably made but misguided in its attempts to satiate its fanbase, The Rise of Skywalker marks some kind of end to the franchise. It’s a film that tries to please everyone and, in doing so, crams so much into its harried story that it seldom feels inspired. The sheer number of reference points, callbacks, phantoms, and delusions in this film leaves too much to disentangle with any logical acceptance. But nostalgia isn’t about logic; it’s about emotions, and the feelings of preciousness about the original trilogy have sustained millions of moviegoers through more bad episodes than good in my estimation. Taking a step back and looking at this new trilogy, Disney’s Star Wars episodes have proven quite erratic, robbing the material of its serial appeal. When so much about Kylo Ren and Rey proves almost bipolar, it’s difficult to invest oneself in their fates as heroes or villains. Much like its immediate predecessor The Last Jedi, the viewer’s lizard brain leaves the theater thoroughly entertained. Maybe that’s enough to justify a bucket of popcorn and some escapist viewership, but not much more. "
"Feb 21, 2022",negative," These are dark times for the Disney Empire. The unified celebration that greeted its first two Star Wars entries (The Force Awakens and Rogue One) descended into rebellion with the release of The Last Jedi, one of the most divisive films in recent memory. Then came Solo, the first Star Wars movie to lose money.  With future plans in flux, this is the last big screen adventure for the moment, with the franchise finding success in TV with The Mandalorian. Following the departure of original director Colin Trevorrow, JJ Abrams has returned to close out the journey he started with The Force Awakens.  One criticism of his previous film was that it leaned too heavily on nostalgia. If that’s a problem for you, then The Rise of Skywalker is going to be a bumpy ride. Every possible reference and Easter Egg you can think of is jammed into this carnival of fan service. But once the sugar rush of sentiment fades, it becomes clear these baubles are a distraction from a plot with no life.  We catch up with Rey (Daisy Ridley) still fighting against both The First Order, and the dark visions of her own future. On the other side is Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), racked with guilt at the deeds of his past and unsure what to make of his connection with Rey.  But once the sugar rush of sentiment fades, it becomes clear these baubles are a distraction from a plot with no life. We catch up with Rey (Daisy Ridley) still fighting against both The First Order, and the dark visions of her own future. On the other side is Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), racked with guilt at the deeds of his past and unsure what to make of his connection with Rey.  The trouble is, we’re not too sure what to make of it either. This is a conclusion for characters who haven’t been given time to breathe, the results of varying artistic and commercial visions that feel incomplete. Without the requisite development, we get supposedly climactic confrontations that are important only because the script says they are. Most of the contentious aspects of The Last Jedi are reworked or forgotten quickly, with certain twists feeling like a direct response to fan outrage. Whether these changes are right or wrong is subjective, but they come too late in the game to be implemented naturally. In short, the ending feels empty when we’re asked to forget about the middle.  This isn’t to say it’s a disaster. The visual spectacle is awesome, from nightmarish caves to roiling oceans. It feels like a galaxy far, far away, and one you’d quite like to visit. There’s also plenty of fun moments as we accompany Finn (John Boyega), Poe (Oscar Isaac) and various others as they race between planets, interacting with cute new sidekicks vying for Baby Yoda’s crown.  There are thrilling fights, funny jokes, and, aside from the often excruciating dialogue (never really a strong point in the Star Wars universe), it’s a fine experience.  And that’s the problem: Star Wars has never been just ‘fine’. Whether you left the cinema punching the air or seething with rage, every one of these stories made you feel something.  Even the worst entries had moments that took your breath away. For all the visual effects, all the speeches, it’s hard to think of a moment in this film that anyone will be referencing in 20 years. Trying to please everyone has resulted in a film that’s apparently happy to be average. All of a sudden, Star Wars doesn’t feel special anymore.  Most cheated by all the indecision are the younger cast members, who do their best with characters who have been pulled in different directions over the course of three films. Isaac’s Poe fares best out of them all, showing some progression as he struggles to become the leader he knows he has to be.  He forms a charming partnership with Boyega’s Finn, with the friends working to build an army to launch one last offensive against The First Order. Ridley is given the most screen time, which is a good thing given the seismic shifts in character she has to perform. She navigates these sharp turns well, steering Rey towards a plausible – if unsatisfying – conclusion. Adam Driver may be the actor whose stock has most risen since the films began, but a role this slight would leave even the most talented stars stranded. Ben/Kylo’s conflicted stance means he’s lost in the shuffle. He’s not the hero of the story, but nor is he the villain. His arc has potential, but with the focus elsewhere, he often feels like a character from an entirely different film. He’s someone for Ridley to spar with, to run to and from. Aside from one waterside heart-to-heart, his journey is mainly to service his co-star. Of all the under-developed characters in this trilogy, he’s the most wasted. As for the old guard, Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams) returns for little reason other than he’s the last original character who hadn’t already reappeared. Like the film in microcosm, his appearance is fun but pointless. It’s also time to say goodbye to the late Carrie Fisher, of course, with the production working-in previously cut footage to round out her performance. It isn’t seamless, but it’s at least respectful. The Rise of Skywalker is a film designed to calm the waters, but is that what Star Wars really needed? It’s true that The Last Jedi took some narrative risks that didn’t pay off, but a follow up that plays it safe from beginning to end hardly seems preferable. What should feel like an epic conclusion to a 42-year-old story instead acts as proof that the franchise that has lost its way."
"Feb 18, 2022",positive," Forty-two years ago, we were first taken to a galaxy far, far away, and film as we know it changed forever. Star Wars not only produced a groundbreaking new way of filmmaking but created a fan base that is as divisive as it possibly could be. It’s one of the most passionate fan bases I know. While quite vocal over the past four years during the releases of The Force Awakens and 2017’s controversial, The Last Jedi, there is no denying that fans across the galaxy were ready for the conclusion of the Skywalker Saga with the release of Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker. Without question, this film is the most flawed out of the “Disney” trilogy. A film, while full of fan service tidbits and nostalgia, has a difficult time distancing itself from that crutch to establish itself fully throughout its early run time.  I believe that Star Wars: The Last Jedi is a real original look at what Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker could have been with unique storytelling.  Rather than focus solely on the Skywalker name, The Last Jedi establishes that you don’t need Skywalker blood to become a Jedi, as the prequels and former Star Wars stories showed us with characters such as Mace Windu, Qui-Gon, and of course, Obi-Wan. Many fans rejected that concept, and that coincides with Rise of Skywalker’s most significant issue – it spends the first 45 minutes of the film “cleaning up” the choices made in the previous movie rather than pushing forward the last film’s different perspective.  When the exposition in the beginning finally finishes, this is where Rise of Skywalker really picks up steam. J.J. Abrams never fails to deliver a polished, entertaining film that includes all the elements of Star Wars that have brought fans together over the past four decades. The film is a relentless thrill ride with some of the best set pieces In the entire Disney trilogy. While the lesser of the three films, Rise of Skywalker, comes the closest in matching the original trilogy in terms of humor, heart, and showcasing a team dynamic that was missing from The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi.  Now, there are questions I can answer without spoiling. Carrie Fisher is used beautifully throughout the film and, quite frankly, a more significant focal point to the central story than I originally expected. It is well known that Episode IX was set to be Leia’s story, and J.J. does a great job of incorporating and elevating Leia and Carrie’s importance to not only the franchise but for a legion of Star Wars fans. Leia will forever be my princess. Let’s discuss Emperor Palpatine. Ian McDiarmid has not lost a step. His return to the throne does not fail as he is as menacing and fear-inducing as before. However, a huge flaw was the explanation or lack thereof on how he was able to return. Was he always set to be the Big Bad of this trilogy, or was this course correction after The Last Jedi? We’ll never know, but we can enjoy his time onscreen.  Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver are the MVPs of Rise of Skywalker. Both give their all in their final performances as Rey and Ben Solo. From the moment I laid eyes on Rey in The Force Awakens, I’ve felt that she was the perfect heroine to lead this new trilogy, and she does not disappoint, and Rey’s story pleasingly comes full circle. While there are lesser fans of Ben, with criticism ranging from, “He should be working at Hot Topic with his temper tantrums,” to “He’s just always whining,” I’ve personally been a fan of his story and especially now with its conclusion in this film. My counter to those previous criticisms has always been, “He’s a Skywalker. Would you expect nothing less?” Ben’s obsession with becoming his grandfather was his motivation, and once he became Supreme Leader, as seen in this film, his attitude changes. He becomes more assertive and in control, adding more depth to his character, unlike seen before. His story was one of the best endings I’ve seen in the franchise.  As always, the supporting players add a ton to the film. Finn, while I’ve never been a fan of, feels essential to the central story here, especially in the battle against the First Order. Poe channels his inner Han Solo, and Finn and Poe’s buddy chemistry is admirable. The return of Lando was a sweet treat for fans, and while not a massive player to the film’s overall narrative, his appearance is welcomed along with Chewie and all our favorite droids. They all shine bright in this film.  In his final work in the Star Wars franchise, John Williams delivers a pleasing and impactful score. A score that with each beat calls back to every film in the franchise and molds them into one of his best works throughout the entire saga. Star Wars is and will continue to be more than just a film franchise to me. There are decades of memories, good times, and bad times that this space soap opera have been a part of, and I wouldn’t have it any other way. As the saga comes to an end, Rise of Skywalker, while flawed in some areas, has successfully ended the story of the Skywalker family in a gratifying fashion. "
"Feb 12, 2022",positive," There has never been a review that has caused more nerves while preparing to write it than this one. Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker not only concludes the new trilogy of Star Wars films, but wraps up a saga started over 40 years ago. There is no doubting that Star Wars has become a foundation in our pop culture that will live on forever. Especially after The Last Jedi though, where director Rian Johnson pushed the series into a totally different style. Star Wars also has become one of the most decisive franchises out there, with those – shall we say – differing opinions with each new installment. Already days before the official release of The Rise of Skywalker, these sides have been at war with each other without even seeing the movie. Different opinions are fine, despite what Twitter seems to make everyone think, as cinema speaks to us in different ways. There is not a single other movie that comes to mind with the scale and controversy from its fanbase than The Rise of Skywalker. It is impossible to look at this film outside of the context of which it was built. As mentioned before, 2017’s The Last Jedi pushed Star Wars into unknown territory, sticking out against every other piece of media in the franchise for better or for worse. Almost becoming a meditation on good vs. evil and the muddy area between, the movie polarized audiences. With Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) growing stronger than ever, and Rey (Daisy Ridley) pushing her training as much as she can, the conflict between Jedi and Sith finally reaches a climax in a battle for the universe. At the beginning of The Rise of Skywalker it is clear that the people behind the scenes reacted to the direction Rian Johnson had taken the franchise. Almost immediately the film retcons so much that The Last Jedi spent its entire runtime trying to build. From mysteries surrounding our main characters, to Kylo Ren being a neutral force trying to destroy both the good and bad. The Rise of Skywalker starts by destroying a good amount of what was already built in order to set it’s own story up. At first, this appears legitimately infuriating. Specifically with stripping down the character of Kylo Ren (a character I found extremely interesting in The Last Jedi) of his nuance as a villain and reducing him back down to just being a bad guy on the side of the Sith. Rian Johnson had set The Rise of Skywalker up to be different and something incredibly unique compared to the rest of the franchise. Initially, it seemed that J.J. Abrams was just trying to play it safe that perhaps did nothing new from the other films. This was also heavily felt at the beginning of the film, with the character of Rey. They set her character up as a Jedi dealing with her anger, pulling her towards the Darkside. This is a character arc we have seen multiple times in this franchise up to this point, and made the character just seem mundane at first. This is clearly where most are stopping with their opinions of the film condemning the rest as bland garbage. From this point of destruction on though what The Rise of Skywalker builds from it’s initial destruction was not only just pure enjoyment, but was deep and intriguing, pushing the story and the world in its own subtle and unique ways. It is hard to talk about the morals and messages this film is trying to explore without getting into spoilers. This is a huge film that explores themes of purpose and destiny in ways that have never really been seen before in the franchise. The battle between the Jedi and the Sith has always been one that never quite seemed to connect with me in the way that it has for others. The moral idea that one side is objectively good and one side is objectively bad never gained much traction from me. But the idea that you are born on a side and even if you are born on the wrong side you eventually find your way to the other, never quite worked for me. My favorite part of The Last Jedi was its exploration of this good vs. evil in the form of Kylo Ren. And where nothing in this film quite reaches that point of intrigue, it does continue to push this idea in a way that was thoroughly engaging. The moral takeaway from The Rise of Skywalker and it’s exploration of this is also possibly the most relevant moral a Star Wars movie has ever had. This movie has important ideas and lessons that need to be taught, and this movie accomplishes that. This is not just a fun sci-fi movie, it is smart and has something important to say. The way The Rise of Skywalker also explores the past and it’s effect on the current and future also ties this new trilogy nicely together on a thematic level. From Kylo Ren first drawing inspiration from the past, eventually wanting to kill it, to Rey still being haunted by her past, having been abandoned by her parents. This movie reaches a conclusion with this idea it’s been exploring since The Force Awakens, that feels satisfying and gives it an even bigger reason to exist. Providing something that none of the other six main movies could, a look at the consequences from the past shown in those films and how that helps and hurts characters throughout these films. This is a level of perspective series rarely gets to have following a journey through three generations. With that said though, the film absolutely is tons of fun, featuring some of the best comedy from the entire franchise. I have not laughed so hard at C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) as he nearly steals the show. Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) also really shines here, after having missed most of The Force Awakens and being brought down by easily the most painful part of The Last Jedi. Poe finally is able to take more of a lead role, showing off not just Oscar Issac’s extreme charisma, but also his emotional ability as an actor. If he was given the right plot in these films, Poe really could have been the new Han Solo. Sadly, up until this film he was not given the opportunity to become much more than a fun side character. If you have seen the other Star Wars movies and at least have enjoyed some of them, or simply grew up with them, this movie will at least also work with you on a basic level. There is something chilling about hearing the swell of music at the beginning of the films, as the logo appears, and the opening crawl starts to reveal itself. One huge complaint that keeps floating around is the fan service in The Rise of Skywalker. Many have called this lazy, but I have to disagree. Not only do these callbacks help bring this movie full circle, but there is something very effective about seeing these classic characters back on screen. Neither do these moments of fan service become so significant to the plot that it feels like it takes away from story values. The action in this film is also breathtaking. In the opening introduction to the film there is a spectacular chase scene – legitimately one of my favorites now of the Star Wars series. Every piece of action is pulsating and thrilling. Not only because of the incredible visual effects, but also the fine cinematography from Dan Mindel. Unique and impressive throughout, the handheld approach to some of these tracking shots in the action also give this movie a dynamic edge. The weight of the conflict in this film also added something to the story – particularly on an emotional level. Perhaps more than ever this is a fight for the universe. There is no option for the Jedi to lose and live to fight another day, adding a sense of desperation that put the gravitas on every decision our heroes made. On another positive, judging by certain elements the trailers teased, I was nervous about some of the twists and turns potentially in store. However, the narrative of this saga and the practicality of the film, each reveal works beyond what may or may not be false alarms. No spoilers here, there’ll be. On the flip side, the story itself seems to try and juggle a lot. The film sets up three clear stories to follow, and as it attempts to reset itself to a point from The Last Jedi – while carrying some baggage from it – The Rise of Skywalker is somewhat jumbled in places. Some plot points were fabricated to follow proceedings, like randomly finding important information in unlikely places. Although not completely meaningless, compared to the other Star Wars movies – like the Jabba the Hunt fight from Return of the Jedi for example – the fillers in this movie felt smaller and did build to service it’s narrative and moral messages. With The Rise of Skywalker‘s inclusion of General Leia (Carrie Fisher), utilizing archival footage of her, is smartly used quite sparingly. Even if the placement was a little off (you could tell she wasn’t really in the conversations), it made for a compelling respect to both the character and late actor. Somehow, despite being traditionally on the more critical side of Star Wars, judging by early social media reactions, The Rise of Skywalker is way higher on my Star Wars ranked list than most. Structurally, this movie is one of the soundest in this entire franchise. Especially once you get past the rocky start. The Rise of Skywalker might play it safer than its predecessor, The Last Jedi, but it so effective in its messages that it connects and provides a more a very satisfying conclusion. Not just to this trilogy, but the Skywalker saga overall. The Rise of Skywalker gives you chills, is an absolute blast overall, and I, personally, am already planning my next trip through the galaxy with it."
"Oct 20, 2021",positive," Well, it’s finally over. After 42 years, the Skywalker saga has (allegedly) ended with THE RISE OF SKYWALKER and I am sad, yet totally here for it. You don’t need me to tell you how culturally significant the STAR WARS franchise has been. I have been a diehard fangirl since I first saw Princess Leia’s iconic buns and blaster, Han’s handsome smirk, and Luke’s luminescent lightsaber. With such history, I can only imagine the difficulty in deciding how to say goodbye to this beloved series and its old and new characters, but director JJ Abrams (who directed my favorite STAR WARS film THE FORCE AWAKENS) nailed it.  Of course, you’re never going to make everyone happy and as you may or may not have seen, the film has become very divisive with fans. I will admit that there are a few things I wish Abrams had done differently, mainly when it came to honoring the characters of Rose and Finn. However, I genuinely find it hard to imagine calling this movie “bad” or considering it a disappointment.  So, with all of the ridiculous hostility surrounding THE RISE OF SKYWALKER, I wanted to focus on the several things I loved most about the film. Hopefully, instead of focusing on the negativity, you will buy a ticket and make your own decision. Will this be your favorite film in the franchise? Probably not. THE FORCE AWAKENS and EMPIRE STRIKES BACK exist. But embrace your inner fanboy/fangirl and have fun. How can you not? It’s STAR WARS, you scruffy-looking nerfherder!  The stakes. Because Han F-ing Solo was killed in THE FORCE AWAKENS, and Luke Skywalker, Supreme Leader Snoke, and Admiral Holdo (Laura Dern) died in THE LAST JEDI, I was constantly concerned that another big character was going to go kaput in this film, especially with it being the last in the franchise. And that’s how an action movie should be! I won’t tell you if anyone *does* die, but the fact that STAR WARS has shown it is possible really added to the suspense of each fight.  The music. Do I even need to mention this? John Williams’ score continues to not only be a main highlight for each film but also a main character itself. RISE OF SKYWALKER is no exception. How he is able to build and release tension through his score in each scene is unmatched in cinema. I love how each character has his or her own theme. Unsurprisingly, Leia’s theme really got to me… especially when we see Carrie Fisher on screen as Leia for the last time.  And don’t get me started on Keri Russell, who stars as an awesome new masked character named Zorii Bliss. Although Zorii may only show her eyes, Russell gives an incredibly expressive performance, rocks a sleek costume, and her chemistry with Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) is white-hot. I am going to need a spin-off movie or TV show ASAP.  The cute new characters. I would die for BB-8 and leave it to STAR WARS to introduce us to a couple more new characters this time around ( no unfortunately one of those is not baby Yoda). Babu Frik is too cute for me to handle, even if his particular set of skills may be detrimental to a fan favorite character. LOOK AT HIS LITTLE WELDING MASK! My heart! And this sounds a bit weird to say, but I love the friendship between the new Pixar lamp-looking droid called D-O and BB-8 almost as much as I loved hearing the droid tell Rey “no thank you” when she attempts to touch him… similar to what I want to say to all of the RISE OF SKYWALKER haters!

"Sep 8, 2021",positive," Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, the final entry in the series’ nine-film Skywalker story, is the cinematic equivalent of Anakin and Obi-Wan landing that gigantic ship at the end of Revenge of the Sith’s opening space battle. It’s not exactly clean or elegant, and the entire ship is on fire with bells and whistles going off when it lands. But it’s a thrill to watch, and it’s all smiles and relieved laughter once everyone is back on solid ground.  Despite some bumps, director J.J. Abrams & Co. bring the saga home in one piece. It’s a whimsical, aggressively engaging, positively exhausting movie that all at once might fry your brain and make you fall in love again with one of our defining cultural touchstones.  Early buzz after the film’s L.A. premiere was that some found its reported galaxy-brain plotting and nostalgic pandering wearying. Indeed, Abrams leans into all of his vices with his return to the series — trapdoor twists, dorky MacGuffin quests, imprecise dialogue — as well as his virtues, including strong characters, good casting and high-energy chase scenes. These movies are about kooky, melodramatic space adventures that lean on the wholesome values of friendship and hope — that’s exactly what The Rise of Skywalker hangs its cloak on and why it works so well. Though with the previous Star Wars saga installment, The Last Jedi, Rian Johnson made a film that loved its universe and characters, the director caught flack for challenging the series to look past its patented palace intrigue and familial melodrama into galaxies of new possibility. Abrams seems to have allowed some of that to rub off, though he certainly also comes to this armed with all the Force Awakens’ loose plot threads, Bad Robot mystery-box surprises and fan service.  Abrams is a devotee of the establishment, not a disruptor like Johnson. But he also seems to have a distinct bone to pick with the boneheads who rallied against The Last Jedi for malevolent reasons. Abrams indeed has the final word here, but he offers a loving advancement to Johnson’s noble call to expand the galaxy’s heroes to include more than just those holding a lightsaber. Abrams is more interested in the people and places we already know, but he fits in what he wants from Johnson's film more generously than you might expect. The unification is not perfect, but it feels right.  Maybe you’ll disagree. Some will likely find The Rise of Skywalker a garish nostalgia run with silly developments. After all, this is Star Wars. Post-film discussion and debate are as much a part of the films as the stories themselves. The Rise of Skywalker differs from The Last Jedi in some ways, but both glow with a love and admiration for the message of the original trilogy. All that’s left at the end is a landed ship, and a reminder of how powerful these movies can be to the ones who they matter to the most. "
"Aug 19, 2021",negative," A disjointed, rushed, and incohesive mess of fan service and B genre plotting. Kennedy should have the reins taken away from her now that this body is bagged and tagged. Lucas not finishing his Saga as a holistic storyteller was already deeply disappointing to me and this just rubs salt in the wound.  Boyega, Ridley, and Isaac are bad in this film. I genuinely like each person and at least one of their performances in another film. The action choreography is perhaps the worst I’ve seen on a project at this scale and budget. However there were certainly some positives: Keri Russell’s world and character were neat, I dug Babu Frik, that opening sequence with Driver getting all murdery, and finally engaging with some of the vast body of Sith lore. All in all, I’m disappointed and wonder what the hell specifically lead to this fan service centric trilogy that has nothing new or interesting to say. At least to me."
"Aug 12, 2021",positive," It may not have been in a galaxy far, far away but it does feel like a long time ago that the Star Wars saga began with George Lucas’s 1977 space opera: “Star Wars IV: A New Hope.” Now, the whole story comes full circle with “Star Wars IX: The Rise of Skywalker.” I’m hoping, however, that the phenomenon that is Star Wars is not coming to an end. Like “Rogue One: A Star Wars Story” showed, there are other tales to tell about the Rebellion’s fight to overcome evil in the galaxy. And this particular Star Wars fan will be on hand to see them whenever they come around. The final installment in the Star Wars saga, “The Rise of Skywalker,” is a fitting end to more than four decades of storytelling. It has everything fans love. J.J. Abrams is back behind the helm as director and co-writer after Rian Johnson’s much-debated Episode VIII, “The Last Jedi.” Filled with epic battle sequences, old friends, new friends, and old enemies, “The Rise of Skywalker” doesn’t meet the memorability of “The Empire Strikes Back,” but it does leave the audience with hope and a rather shocking answer to a burning question left over from Episodes VII and VIII, namely, what are Rey’s (Daisy Ridley) origins? Hopefully, the answer will surprise you as it did me. After the now-familiar, but, oh, so exciting, opening scroll, we find the rebels, always outnumbered and short on time, gathering resources to challenge the First Order and new Supreme Leader, Kylo Ren (Adam Driver). Poe (Oscar Isaac), Chewie (Joonas Suotamo), C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) and ex-Stormtrooper Finn (John Boyega) are out seeking information and allies to join in the fight. Back at base, Rey hones her Jedi skills under the watchful eye of General Leia Organa (the late Carrie Fisher from archival footage). But there’s still something unsettled about Rey that Ridley’s performance manages to convey to the audience so much so that we can feel her ambiguity and ache with her as she struggles to discover who she is and what her ultimate purpose will be. Her Force-enhanced connection with Kylo Ren only confuses matters more for her. His invitation to join him leads her to set aside her training, much like Luke did in “The Empire Strikes Back.” Rey seems to know that within Kylo Ren, still lives Ben Solo, son of Han (Harrison Ford) and Leia, and she wants to bring him back to the light, especially for Leia’s sake. And speaking of Leia, the way she’s woven into the story after Carrie Fisher’s death in 2016 using archival footage from “The Force Awakens” is seamless and doesn’t feel contrived like the digital inclusion of her younger self in earlier films. Kudos go to Abrams and co-writer, Chris Terrio, for making Fisher’s beloved Leia an integral part of this last Star Wars film. There have always been spiritual undertones in all the Star Wars films, and “Rise of Skywalker” is no different. While the idea of the Force being an energy that connects all living things still smacks of New Age thought, we Christians know that it’s really God who is the all-powerful force in the universe and all created reality. Very strong in this film is the reality of self-sacrifice and redemption. Strong also is the hope that comes from knowing we’re not alone, so relevant in our society today. I don’t know about you, but there have been times in my life when I felt like I was the only one experiencing some sort of suffering or uncertainty. Fear or pain often does that to us. Whatever is going on in our lives, we can convince ourselves that no one else could possibly understand what we’re going through. Loneliness and isolation follow. In her training, we hear Rey petitioning: “Be with me.” Being the last of the Jedi, it is natural that Rey would have felt alone and thought that no one could understand her suffering. So she prays, “be with me.” She pulls on the strength of the Jedi before her, especially Luke. Even in her darkest hour, she knows that she’s not alone in her struggle. Knowing that we, also, are not alone can be lifesaving. No matter how alone we may feel, God is always with us. We are still in the midst of the Christmas Season, a time when we celebrate Jesus, the second person of the Trinity, coming to us as a vulnerable child to show us how much God wants to be with us. God never leaves us alone. It’s not clear to whom Rey addresses her “be with me,” but for us, we address that prayer to God, who responds to us: “I am with you always” (Matthew 28:20). In this assurance lies our hope. Sister Hosea Rupprecht is a member of the Daughters of St. Paul, a religious community dedicated to evangelization with the media.

"Jun 26, 2021",positive,"Abrams knows when and how to play the nostalgia card without getting intoxicated with it, allowing us to say goodbye to the heroes of the original saga, but without removing the focus from the real protagonists of this story [Full review in Spanish]"
"Feb 17, 2021",positive,"  For more than 40 years, the specter of Star Wars has hung over the movie landscape like no other franchise. It has influenced countless filmmakers, showing up in big and small ways in multiple other works of art. Now, characters new and old are getting one last chance to add to the series' legacy with Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker.  Without getting into spoiler specifics, the Resistance — led by Rey (Daisy Ridley), Finn (John Boyega), Poe (Oscar Isaac), Chewbacca (Joonas Suatamo), and General Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher) — are still facing the threat of the First Order, led by Supreme Leader Kylo Ren (Adam Driver). But a new danger has emerged, one that divides the focus of the Resistance and may also usurp the power of the First Order.  The previous film, The Last Jedi, was a divisive effort because of new elements that writer/director Rian Johnson introduced to the series. J.J. Abrams, who directed and co-wrote The Force Awakens, is back for Episode XI, and he brings with him both the familiar and unfamiliar.  There are plenty of recognizable settings and characters from previous movies to trigger nostalgia, but enough is different so as to not seem simply like a retread of things that have been done before. He also introduces some heretofore unseen elements that may have some purists crying foul.  That said, a lot of retconning is done to make sure plot points that were introduced in the previous two films fall into place. Some of them feel organic to an ever-evolving plot, but there are more than a few that come off as shoehorned in, putting a round peg in a square hole just to provide some sort of answer.  Unfortunately, one of the biggest of these is the presence of Leia in the film. Abrams and his team used footage from Fisher's work on The Force Awakens to make her a part of the plot, and a series of perfunctory lines fail to do justice for either the character or the actor, who died in 2016. Because of Leia's relationships with other characters, emotions do come, but they don't feel fully earned.  The connection between Rey and Kylo Ren was the overarching part of the first two films, and that bond comes to a head in The Rise of Skywalker. Abrams and Johnson have tried to make this relationship on par with that of Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader, but it's never had that depth of feeling. Still, they do engage in some epic battles, and the way their story is wrapped up is fully satisfying.  Poe and Finn are crucial to the plot of the film, but neither feels as important as Rey. They spend most of their time ensconced with the rest of the Resistance, and their efforts are more part of the team than as individuals. They do get some fun and exciting moments, but nothing that makes them truly stand out.  Part of the reason for this is because the new characters in this trilogy have never been able to move out of the shadow of the characters from the first trilogy. The old characters are revered or reviled by the new characters for good reason, but the attention paid to them has prevented these new films from ever being able to establish their own identity. Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is a finale that is both enthralling and frustrating, feelings that could change in either direction on repeat viewings. One can only hope that, now that the Skywalker saga is finished, future Star Wars films can explore whatever direction they please without being as beholden to the legacy that came before.

"Feb 16, 2021",negative," If you were looking for the perfect film to put a capstone on the 2010’s, Star Wars Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker arguably would be it. Even with the blockbuster heavyweight of Avengers: Endgame concluding the first ten years of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, TROS—as we’ll call it for ease—was the most anticipated cinematic event of the year, given it doesn’t just serve as the third part of a trilogy but also the concluding chapter of a nine-part, four decade spanning saga within easily the biggest film franchise in movie history. This is about as epic as franchise filmmaking gets. Though Star Wars, the jewel in Disney’s all-dominating media crown, will of course continue into the 2020’s, this marks the end of the Skywalker Saga with which George Lucas changed the landscape of movie-making more than perhaps any director in the 20th century. The final conclusion to a story we thought had definitively ended twice before. Going into The Rise of Skywalker, you may experience cautious optimism. Rian Johnson delivered a defiantly auteur-driven, insular examination of the core mystical and philosophical themes within Star Wars with 2017’s trilogy middle-part The Last Jedi, going in brave new directions from 2015’s vibrant trilogy opener The Force Awakens, in which JJ Abrams revived the franchise with a verve that spoke to Lucas’ original, Saturday adventure serial vision. With Abrams back at the helm, following the departure of original director Colin Trevorrow, there was every reason to believe TROS would recapture TFA’s spirit and top off Star Wars with a fulsome flourish. You may leave The Rise of Skywalker somewhat perplexed that that didn’t happen. That, in fact, Abrams has delivered the weakest Star Wars film since, quite possibly, fetid prequel Attack of the Clones. For a myriad amount of reasons, The Rise of Skywalker feels like an argument, on screen, for why going into the next decade we need to rethink how we approach franchise filmmaking. It doesn’t just feel like a culmination of indulgent cinematic excess but a cautionary bulwark against it. When it was announced in 2012 that Disney had purchased LucasFilm and a new Star Wars trilogy was being developed, a million voices cried out not in terror but rather jubilation, even after the underwhelming prequels. The idea we would see Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, Han Solo and the classic trilogy characters again was thrilling, but it tapped into a powerful emotion that has come to define mainstream entertainment this last decade: nostalgia. Nostalgia has always been present in popular culture. You would never have had 1999’s The Phantom Menace and all of the revived Star Wars content after it if not for a yearning to return to the comfort of a universe that defined millions of childhoods in the 1970’s and 1980’s, the period directors like Abrams and writers such as Chris Terrio—drafted it to co-write TROS after Trevorrow’s firing and the junking of much of his script—were growing up. A period in which creators such as Lucas or Steven Spielberg brought escapist entertainment back to the masses as super producers who launched entire empires, from on screen to merchandising to games to… you name it. Properties like Star Wars became cottage industries, about more than just the films themselves, and they swept up children and young adults into the worlds these creatives conjured. It’s why Generation X in particular are largely defined by pop-culture references in the way Baby Boomers often aren’t. It’s also why they keenly feel the pull of nostalgia in their storytelling. In everything from cinematic franchises such as Star Trek or James Bond tapping into their iconic 1960’s roots or popular properties being reborn or sequelized—Ghostbusters, Doctor Sleep—through to classic TV shows being revived with the same legendary characters and actors—The X-Files, the upcoming Star Trek: Picard—through to contemporary masterpieces such as recently Watchmen telling vibrant new stories which revolve around legacy and the past defining us, the 2010’s has seen audiences look in the rear view mirror for comforting, reassuring fodder. Perhaps as a response to the chaotic events in politics and social change that have rippled across the globe particularly in the last half of the decade, audiences have clung to familiarity and narrative safety. Heroes have seen a powerful rebirth in our consciousness, hence why the MCU has become so prosperous or the Arrowverse on television. We have looked to what we know and we have welcomed stories which reinforce our primal, existential hope someone will be there to save us. Star Wars, from its inception, has always been a fairy tale. Lucas built what would become Episode IV: A New Hope on mythical fable tropes, transposing them to the science-fiction genre as he sought to create his own version of the Flash Gordon serials from the 1930’s. It was always a story of pure good vs pure evil, hence the constructs of the Jedi and the Sith, or the Force as an intangible construct that could be bent toward either paradigm. Lucas’ original trilogy was designed as a classic heroes journey, as defined by the groundbreaking work of cultural anthropologist Joseph Campbell, who in his book The Hero With a Thousand Faces pulled together mythic constructs from dozens of historical cultures which shared common archetypes that boiled down to this: the journey of the hero sees them travel from safety into the unknown on a quest, in which they lay their past ghosts to rest with the help of a wizened mentor, defeat the obstacle in their way, and recover a treasure they then take back to their original home. In the process, they are changed and renewed. A journey without is really the journey within. If you look at a significant amount of modern pop culture fiction, and the majority of the stories we are most invested in culturally, they often cleave to heroes journeys. This is something I’ve built my upcoming book, Myth-Building in Modern Media, around – this idea of the ‘Monomytharc’, that contemporary fictional mythologies in popular culture utilise many of these Campbellian structures to define their characters and worlds. It happens in Avengers: Endgame. You can see it in Game of Thrones, which infamously ended this year. It’s present in Star Wars from the very beginning and Luke’s entire story in the original trilogy tracks this mythological arc.  Luke ventures out from Tatooine a naive young farmhand, undertakes a quest to understand his true self with the help of a mentor (Yoda), faces the duality of his lineage pulling him between good and evil after learning Darth Vader is actually his father, and then refuses to allow Emperor Palpatine to corrupt him, enabling Vader’s own redemption as a consequence – which, too, fulfills a similar journey Anakin Skywalker takes in the prequels, only his being the inverse, turning away from good to evil. This duality, this eventual understanding of one’s true self, is key to how Star Wars is approached in every one of it’s eight episodic films. And the message is always this: good will triumph. Evil will be vanquished. The Force (for good) will be with you, always. The Rise of Skywalker is no exception. There are no surprises. There are no diversions. There is the nostalgic fulcrum of a narrative structure you, as an audience expect of this film. That’s also a key point here: expectation. We have become hardwired to expect that triumph, even when we don’t see it reflected in our own lived experience.  If this were reality, given the emergence of fascist demagogues such as Donald Trump or Jair Bolsonaro etc… or the normalisation of right-wing tropes that are encouraging intolerance and violence across the globe, Kylo Ren would undoubtedly have been the one to rise in this story. He and Palpatine would have killed Rey and simply dominated the universe with their Final Order, something they probably could have done with relative ease at multiple points in this trilogy. Yet, as audiences, we expect the Jedi and their quasi-Buddhist philosophy of quiet strength and tolerance to prosper. Much like after Avengers: Infinity War, when Thanos actually did manage to wipe out half of the universe and half of our heroes, the question for Endgame was never: will they defeat him? It was always: how will they defeat him? And how will those lost heroes return? Everyone knew they would. It was satisfying to see occur but it was a given. Thanos may boast he is inevitable but the only inevitability about Endgame was in how it ended. We wouldn’t have expected anything less. It is quite remarkable just how similar the last act of TROS is to the final act of Endgame, actually, having spent the majority of the running time pillaging from half a dozen different famous and beloved pieces of popular culture. It is at various points ‘Indiana Jones and the Rise of Skywalker’ or ‘Harry Potter and the Sith Wayfinder’. The ending, however, is particularly in step with Endgame’s expected denouement of bringing all of our heroes as close to destruction as possible, in the face of impossible, universe-shattering odds, only to have a Gandalf in The Return of the King or Littlefinger in Battle of the Bastards-style last minute turn of the tide which allows Rey and company to succeed. Endgame, without question, did it better, having thoroughly laid the groundwork for the breathtaking moment of spectacle in which the entire MCU shows up to take down Thanos. There is nothing like that in TROS. Even with your expectation that it will happen, the last act is built on an ever-collapsing house of cards in which the rules of the entire story are re-written on the spot to up the stakes again and again and again. It is, among many things in TROS, that doesn’t make a lick of sense. It’s hard for me to admit as an admittedly huge fan of JJ Abrams work for almost 20 years that this was the first time I walked out of one of his projects knowing, in my heart of hearts, that it just wasn’t very good. Star Trek Into Darkness depreciates the more you watch it but even that I emerged from initially delighted (perhaps because I’m a Trekkie as opposed to being more of a casual Wars fan). Emerging from TROS felt a little like coming out of the other side of a chaotic head rush, a confluence of elements which should have made sense but didn’t. Abrams puts together a film which, whether intentionally or not, seems willfully determined to run with abandon in the opposite direction to The Last Jedi in almost every way. The frenetic opening scenes quickly throw back in Palpatine with zero context, quickly explain Snoke, quickly establish the tropes that Abrams relies heavily on in his construction of Star Wars narratives—treasures and quest items—and foregrounds the questions that Rian Johnson intended for audiences to do away with entirely: who is Rey? Why is she special? And what does this mean for the end of the saga? This, too, was an inevitability. One of the key negative reactions from the entitled fanboy base of Star Wars following The Last Jedi was that Johnson’s suggestion that Rey was nobody—despite TFA foreshadowing the contrary—and everyone had the potential to become a Jedi, or indeed a ‘sky walker’, was just virtue signalling, liberal BS. The noisiest fan base did not want to accept that Rey would not conventionally have a destiny, and it’s clearly something Abrams believed too. Abrams and Terrio are fanboys, let’s not forget, in something of a different manner to Johnson; the latter was keen to try and transform Star Wars, to push and challenge at the tropes and perceptions constructed over the previous seven films, keen to use his knowledge of the franchise to subvert those Campbellian structures.  In doing so, Rey and Ren started to feel more like complicated humans filled with a dangerous sexual energy, Finn embraced a journey of tolerance and bonding with Rose Tico (in TROS reduced to little more than an exposition machine) to help an underclass stymied by fascist-enabling capitalist structures, and Poe pushed against conditioned swaggering masculine heroism in the face of powerful female leaders. TROS ejects all of that almost instantly. Rey is now on a conventional Campbellian journey, as is Ren in opposition. Finn ends up caught between plotlines, tethered to Rey in one moment and then elsewhere the next. Poe is simply reverted to a cocksure amalgam of Han Solo and Indiana Jones, saddled with a conventional spiky romance with Keri Russell’s sexy trader Zorri. Leia resorts to awkward platitudes (they really should have not had Carrie Fisher in this because it just looks and sounds uncanny). Even Luke, from beyond, ends up telling Rey “I was wrong”, handing back the lightsaber he threw away. All of The Last Jedi’s nuance is underwritten. This is perhaps because Abrams isn’t that kind of filmmaker. He is almost a love child of Lucas’ stringent fascination with myth and mystery and Spielberg’s imaginative wonder and emotion. Abrams tells stories from the heart whereas Johnson works a little bit more from the head. Abrams understands the heroes journey as a quest narrative, and that’s how he and Lawrence Kasdan wrote The Force Awakens – the quest there was to find Luke, who was the treasure in the cave at the end of the story Rey faced key trials to reach, learning aspects of herself in the process. If TROS has Sith artefacts then TFA had Jedi maps but the essential construct was the same. TFA borrowed heavily from A New Hope in the process but it worked fine because it was, at the same time, rebuilding and reconstructing a world and establishing characters, journeys and mysteries.  If you look at Abrams’ career, how often does he ever end a story? Mission Impossible, Star Trek, Lost, Alias – all are either yet to be ended or were concluded by other people. Endings are far far harder than beginnings. Sticking landings is tough and Abrams was tasked with not just unconventionally for him ending a story he initialised, but also course correcting from The Last Jedi—a film he would have done entirely differently—and creating a grand unified theory of the entire 42 year old Skywalker saga. Like Endgame, the culmination of Star Wars’ first true cycle, not just the end of a trilogy. As a result, Abrams enables the kind of nostalgic safety that The Last Jedi ran away from. This isn’t the same Ren who barked “Let the past die. Kill it if you have to”. This is a Kylo who encourages Rey to embrace her own past, embrace the key connection and truth about her parents—which you’ll probably be able to guess after the first few scenes—and embrace her crucial link to the entirety of the franchise to date. Rey was always important. There was always going to be an ultimate destiny. There would always be an ultimate battle. And consequently, everything is on turbo.  The Millennium Falcon hyper-jumps between systems and landscapes for the ultimate space chase. The First Order unleash the biggest fleet of star destroyers any Star Wars film could possibly deliver. We get call backs galore – characters (Lando Calrissian, Wedge Antilles), entire moments from previous films repurposed (such as the X-Wing rising out the Dagobah swamp), and Force powers that wouldn’t go amiss out of a video game. It teases the deaths of major characters and then almost instantly rolls back on them. Though Abrams is more intelligent than just pandering to fanboys who wish to see very expensive fan fiction on screen, TROS is essentially just that – a nostalgic, re-heated mash up of everything you have loved about Star Wars for four decades charged to maximum. There is however one thing it lacks, aside from much in the way of logic at key points, especially the final act, that TFA and TLJ both had: soul. The Rise of Skywalker left me empty in a similar fashion to The Iron Throne, the final episode of Game of Thrones. Both of them were enjoyable, both were highly anticipated, but both were constructed on narrative expectations of mystery and payoff that audiences had largely predetermined, and seeing them play out as expected left a hollow evaporation. I’ve thought almost nothing about Game of Thrones since that finale when I expected to be turning it over for years. Compare this to Watchmen, a masterful examination of legacy and nostalgia which points out how dangerous those elements can be to the modern day, and we’re legions apart. Similarly, The Rise of Skywalker escapes into the ether the moment it has finished. There is none of the rousing spirit of how A New Hope ended or even the cathartic victory of Return of the Jedi. It ends, in true Campbellian fashion, by returning to the beginning and marking that territory, with the last shot playing on perhaps the most iconic shot in Star Wars. That sums up TROS and, in many ways, the cinematic trend of the 2010’s. The determination to look back rather than boldly push forward. The Rise of Skywalker is, creatively, the weakest Star Wars film since Revenge of the Sith and, possibly even Attack of the Clones. At times frenetic,  bereft of storytelling logic and poorly written, it reduces this sequel trilogy to less a point of renewal and satisfaction but rather a pointlessness. If we had known this was where it was all heading, would we have thought twice as to whether it was a good idea? The billions of dollars in box office receipts would have been worth it for Disney but what does TROS truly add for us as audiences? What does it say about our world today, except that fascists are bad and we should all stand together to stop them? That was a message the original trilogy communicated, if less overtly in terms of gender and cultural equality. The Last Jedi especially suggested that Star Wars was on the cusp of a genuine rise of the masses, that the children of tomorrow born not of a quasi-mythical, mystical lineage like Ben Solo or now Rey Palpatine would all become sky walkers, could all harness the Force in order to balance the dyad of good and evil in humanity. For a while, we hoped perhaps that’s what The Rise of Skywalker meant as a title. In the end, it means exactly what you expected it to mean. And that’s both the most inevitable and disappointing way for the Star Wars saga to, for now, come to a close."

	It has taken 42 years, but the story of the Resistance that started in “Star Wars: A New Hope” comes to its conclusion in “Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker.” With an amped-up story, featuring flying Stormtroopers and much talk of destiny, confronting fear and inner turmoil, the ancient conflict between the Jedi and the Sith promises to deliver big at the box office, but will it satisfy old school fans who have waited a lifetime for the film’s final showdown? 
	The events of “Star Wars: The Last Jedi” and the passing of Carrie Fisher presented challenges that helped shape the plot of the new film, but you’ll get no spoilers here. I will say that old footage of Fisher as General Leia Organa from “The Force Awakens” appears alongside new work from Darth Vader's grandson, Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), Jedi apprentice Rey (Daisy Ridley), Stormtrooper-turned-Resistance-fighter Finn (John Boyega), Resistance pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo) and the First Order's General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson). 
	Add to that new characters like diabolical First Order Allegiant General Pryde (Richard E. Grant), Spice Runners of Kijimi leader Zorii Bliss (Keri Russell) and returning faves Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams) and Mark Hamill's Luke Skywalker (in what form I will not say) and you have a blended “Brady Bunch-style” family in space. 
	Tasked with wrapping the Skywalker saga up in a pretty bow, director J.J. Abrams has made a film that is part fan service—many familiar faces come along for the ride—and part homage to the Original Trilogy. He replaces subtext with action, rehabilitates one character’s tarnished, cranky old man reputation (NO SPOILERS HERE) and essentially delivers the movie you expect. 
	Abrams knows there are no do overs on this one. “Do or do not; there is no try,” comes to mind. It is the wrap to one of the most popular and talked about film franchises of all time. Expectations are high with the possibility of fan backlash ever present. Questions are answered—Rey’s parentage chief among them—quips are thrown, Chewbacca howls and star ships are blasted to Kingdom Come as “The Rise of Skywalker,” for better and for worse, replaces the nuanced take of Rian Johnson’s “The Last Jedi” with the more tried and true Star Wars tale of nature vs nurture and good vs evil. 
	Jam packed with action and plot, “The Rise of Skywalker” gets bogged down with exposition and tying up loose ends. Worse, it often drifts from the thing that made “Star Wars” great in the first place—the characters. They’re all present and accounted for but are often overshadowed by the whiz bang pacing and over-abundance of story. 
	Having said that, the film’s final third, the payoff to the saga, hits several emotional high points. It’s the end of the saga and, therefore (NO SPOILERS HERE JUST THE FACTS) the final appearances of several members of the original cast. Their exits are handled with sensitivity and should generate a sniffle or two from hard-core fans. 
	The core of the movie is the anguished dynamic between Rey and Kylo. The push and pull between their logical vs biological family commitments is the most compelling part of the story. It also provides for several of the film’s most visually interesting scenes, including a climatic lightsaber battle on the wreckage of the Death Star. 
	“Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker” ticks a lot of boxes for fans but—again, no spoilers—the mythic battle of good vs evil, of finding balance in the Force, that has fuelled the franchise for 40 plus years, was really only going to resolve itself in one way. As such, the metaphysical struggle is about the journey and not as much about the actual conclusion. 
	Opening in London’s West End in 1981, it ran for 21 years and 8,949 performances, while the Broadway production ran for 18 years and 7,485 performances. It has played in over 30 countries in 15 languages and has been seen by more than 73 million people worldwide. The showstopping hit song ""Memory"" has been recorded by everyone from Liberace to Barbra Streisand. It is truly a show that always lands on its feet. 
	when he asked the composer if “Cats” was a political metaphor. “Are those cats Queen Victoria, Gladstone and Disraeli?"" the Broadway legend wondered. “Hal,” the composer replied, “this is just about cats.” 
	Let’s not pussyfoot around. “Cats” will go down in history as the weirdest studio movie of 2019. With actors who appear to have been put through the full-body Snapchat cat filter, a Ziegfeld Follies-style chorus line of dancing cockroaches and felines with human hands and feet, you’ll wonder if the theatre popcorn is laced with catnip. 
	It’s an example of spectacle over substance. The songs are catchy, the cats swing and sway in a manner that would make Cirque du Soleil envious, but the story, such that it is, is still simply a collection of show tunes bound by theme but unconcerned with the niceties of plotting. In other words, instead of a story, “Cats” is essentially a cluster of songs of introduction based on a weird, plotless collection of Eliot's poems. 
	Where director Tom Hooper’s “Les Misérables” worked to downplay the musical’s theatricality, “Cats” embraces it, allowing the felines to slink about the set, part ballet, part pantomime, part cat in heart. It’s big and silly, but unfortunately the high-tech veneer of the CGI costumes and sets erases much of the charm present in the more modest stage versions. One of the movie’s highlights is one stripped of (almost) all artifice. Dame Judy stares down the camera to deliver a playful, ""The Ad-dressing of Cats,"" which has the kind of simple, absurd fun the rest of the film lacks. 
	There are other not-so-bad moments. Laurie Davidson’s ""The Magical Mr. Mistoffelees"" has a touch of, well, magic and Taylor Swift sashays convincingly through Bombalurina’s number but while the cast works hard to sell the material, the film is so unrestrained, so in search of meaning in a story that offers up religious resurrection metaphors but not much else, that I suspect audiences will make the Jellicle choice and go see “Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker” instead. 
	“Bombshell,” the new film starring Charlize Theron, Nicole Kidman and a cast of thousands, is set at a time when dinosaurs roamed the earth. The dinosaur in the room in this story is Roger Ailes (John Lithgow), the chairman and CEO of Fox News. Much of the action is set in 2016 but the attitudes on display are positively prehistoric. 
	Ailes died on May 18, 2017, aged 77, but when we first meet him, he reigns supreme. He helped elected presidents, walked the halls of power with confidence and, most importantly for the purposes of this story, created the conservative cable news juggernaut Fox News. Specializing in covering stories that, according to producer Jess Carr (Kate McKinnon), “will scare your grandmother and piss off your grandfather,” Fox became Ailes’ mouthpiece to counter “liberal” CNN. 
	Ailes altered how Americans consumed the news, making stars out of Greta Van Susteren, Bill O’Reilly, Sean Hannity and the two women at the heart of “Bombshell's” story, Gretchen Carlson (Nicole Kidman) and Megyn Kelly (Charlize Theron). Kelly is one of the network’s biggest stars, an outspoken lawyer engaged in a war of words with then candidate Donald Trump. The feud was good for ratings, so despite his pro-Trump stance, Ailes allowed it to continue. Not as good for the ratings was Carlson, a former prime-time anchor demoted to midafternoons following disagreements with her boss. 
	Eventually fired, Carlson leveled accusations of sexual misconduct against her former boss, alleging she had been fired for rebuffing Ailes' advances. When the expected support from other women inside Fox who had been auditioned by Ailes with the words, “stand up and give me a twirl,” or “lift your skirt up higher so I can see your legs,” Carlson fears her allegations will fall on deaf ears. 
	On the inside, Kelly weighs her options. Despite a “Support Roger” campaign from colleague Jeanine Pirro (Alanna Ubach), she bides her time before opening up about her own experiences. 
	The title “Bombshell” is a double entendre, referring to Ailes’ objectification of his on-air talent and to the accusations leveled against him, which sent ripples throughout the male dominated corporate world of news. 
	“Bombshell” echoes the story recently told in the mini-series “The Loudest Voice.” Both tell of a toxic workplace where one man ruled by intimidation, sexual harassment and micromanagement. “We have two, three and four doughnut days,” says Ailes’ executive assistant (Holland Taylor). “These aren’t doughnuts he eats. They’re doughnuts he throws.” His, “if you want to play with the big boys you have to lay with the big boys,” credo is dramatized in his interactions with Kayla Pospisil, a composite of several Fox employees, played by Margot Robbie. It was the days before #MeToo and the film does a good job of showing the apprehension some of the abused women feel about revealing their lurid treatment by Ailes. 
	At the film’s helm is Theron, with the aid of an incredible makeup job, disappears into the role of Megyn. She pierces the icy demeanor of Kelly’s on-air persona to reveal a heroine torn between loyalty to a man she knows has done terrible things and doing the right thing. It’s tremendous work that humanizes a character often portrayed in the real-life press as a divisive figure. 
	“Bombshell” is a torn-from-the-headlines story about the people behind the headlines that serves as a reminder of the importance of the #MeToo movement in shining a light on the kind of inappropriate behavior that placed women in peril in the workplace. Good performances, aided by makeup and prosthetics, bring the story to vivid life."
"Jan 29, 2021",neutral," “Let the past die. Kill it if you have to. It is the only way to become what you were meant to be.” In 2017, Rian Johnson’s divisive The Last Jedi - with all of its charms and faults - set its eyes on recontextualizing the Star Wars mythos. Daring to scry a future free from tradition and legacy, Jedi and Sith, Skywalkers and Palpatines, the middle entry of the new sequel trilogy boldly jettisoned the status quo. But where The Last Jedi shed the trappings of old, detonating mythologies in service of an exciting and uncertain future, The Rise of Skywalker reaches back with a nostalgic vice-grip, unable to let go of the past in the most frustrating of ways. A weightless and rushed end-cap all too eager to check boxes rather than provide any semblance of real catharsis or closure, the final installment of a saga over forty years in the making lands with a whimper and a shrug.  Of The Last Jedi’s many - and oftentimes controversial - contributions to the Star Wars narrative, none are more resonant than the parallel arcs of Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) and Rey (Daisy Ridley). Introduced in 2015’s The Force Awakens, Kylo Ren was established as a conflicted dark-sider drawn to the light, while Rey was a mysterious new heroine grappling with her place in the galaxy. With The Last Jedi, writer and director Rian Johnson deepened their stories by exploring the concept of legacy, setting up Kylo Ren and Rey as opposite sides of the same coin. It’s one of Star Wars’ most compelling threads: a corrupted Ben Solo, torn asunder and crushed under the weight of the Skywalker, Vader, and Solo mantles, comes into conflict with Rey, a Force-user untethered from the franchise’s deeply entrenched bloodlines - “a nobody.” In a fateful encounter, Kylo spits venomous truth about Rey’s parents to her face: “They were filthy junk traders. Sold you off for drinking money. They're dead in a pauper's grave in the Jakku desert. You come from nothing. You're nothing. But not to me.” Even the material surrounding The Last Jedi’s release, barely a year old, supported Johnson’s bold democratization of the Force; the book Women of the Galaxy summarizes Rey: “Just because you come from nothing doesn’t mean you’re not part of the story. You’re not no one, because anybody can save the galaxy. Anyone.” Even leading up to the release of The Rise of Skywalker, the water seemed troubled. In the onslaught of press that coincided with the film’s premiere, many of the actors and creators started taking what could only be construed as thinly-veiled potshots at the The Last Jedi. J.J. Abrams, in a widely quoted statement, took his swing: “It’s a bit of a meta approach to the story. I don’t think that people go to Star Wars to be told, ‘This doesn’t matter.’” Furthermore, John Boyega took umbrage at the fact that the cast was separated for much of the last film, while Daisy Ridley “cried” with relief when it was announced that Abrams would be returning to close out the saga. All of this, coupled with the fact that there is a small but incredibly vocal contingent of the fanbase that hates everything about The Last Jedi - from its perceived sidelining of Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), to its inclusion of a woman of color, Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran) - the onus was on Abrams to close out the sequel trilogy in the most satisfactory way.  Unfortunately, in this case, satisfactory also equates to prohibitively safe. The Rise of Skywalker sacks all of The Last Jedi’s narrative boldness and characterization in favor of crowd-pleasing fan service - walking back the most compelling aspects of Rian Johnson’s entry, the film is suffocatingly beholden to nostalgia and Star Wars history. And while it’s one thing to tell a vapid story that fruitlessly clings to tradition, it’s another issue entirely to send the following - much more troubling - message to its toxic fandom: “Your voice matters and we’re listening.” If you desperately wanted Rey’s parents to be related to a legacy character, if you wanted Rose to be marginalized into oblivion, if you wanted a clear explanation for Supreme Leader Snoke, or if you wanted a non-stop stream of MacGuffins and fetch quests loaded with sly references, then The Rise of Skywalker is the perfect remedy for your The Last Jedi woes. The first words of the film’s opening crawl sets the tone for the franchise’s most ossified entry: “The dead speak!” Following The Last Jedi in terms of chronology, but not in spirit, Rise establishes that Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) has returned from the dead, pulling the strings of the First Order from the shadows. There’s not much more to the paper-thin plot, as General Leia Organa’s (the late Carrie Fisher) ragtag resistance once again strives to defeat a sinister super-weapon. If there’s one word to distill the film to its purest essence, it would be “frenzied.” The Rise of Skywalker wears its deficit of attention on its sleeve, often opening doors without bothering to close them: There are subplots about Poe Dameron’s (Oscar Isaac) shrouded past, Finn’s (John Boyega) big secret, and even a rebel Stormtrooper movement, but the film clearly doesn’t have the narrative economy to effectively explore any of them. And for such a manic film, much of the plot feels strangely inert - most of its busy-ness is tied up in fetch quests and poorly explained MacGuffins. Abrams and screenwriter Chris Terrio (Argo, Justice League) love to wheel-spin; whether it’s rebooting C3PO’s (Anthony Daniels) memory or chasing a nonsensical Sith Wayfinder, The Rise of Skywalker chugs along with enervated purpose. There are, however, still moments left over to enjoy in the film. The entire cast gives it their all when it comes to the frantic adventure, and it’s especially fun to see Ian McDiarmid chew up the scenery as Emperor Palpatine once again, even if his resurrection is largely misguided. And Adam Driver finally gets a chance to flex some playfulness and levity along with his signature Kylo Ren dourness, even providing the few emotional moments of Rise that do land. In addition, the film is also quite pretty to look at; Dan Mindel returns after The Force Awakens as director of photography, giving its empty spectacle at least a veneer of lush beauty. Rian Johnson, in a Radio.com interview, railed against the propensity to bend over backwards and please fans. “I think approaching any creative process with [making fandoms happy] would be a mistake that would lead to probably the exact opposite result,” Johnson said. “I want to be shocked, I want to be surprised, I want to be thrown off-guard, I want to have things recontextualized, I want to be challenged as a fan when I sit down in the theater.” It’s a sentiment I largely agree with. Unfortunately, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is the exact opposite of the daring challenges offered by The Last Jedi. An empty vessel crafted specifically to be filled by the lowest-common-denominator, it’s indicative of the lack of forethought put into the new sequel trilogy in the first place. It’s supremely disappointing to see that of the endless possibilities available to be painted on the Star Wars canvas, The Rise of Skywalker chose to erase its predecessor and retreat into its own safety."
"Jan 28, 2021",positive," With the holiday season comes another ""Star Wars"" film. Except this year, fans are walking into the theater with the bitter-sweet knowledge that this one marks the end of the ""Star Wars"" saga as we know it. Number IX in the series, ""Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker"" isn't particularly novel in its treatment of plot or characters. In fact, both carry over from prior films, some with more weight than others. But this final installment does exactly what fans of the series want it to: it strikes at the ""Aw look who's back! Remember that! This feels familiar!"" cord, allowing nostalgia and some fun, fast, flirty fight sequences to close up a property over 40 years old. (Next is where I disclose a summary of the film. If you haven't seen it and don't want to know general plot points, then perhaps read no further. You know, just to be safe.) The film picks up where 2017's ""The Last Jedi"" left off: the Resistance is hanging on by its thinnest thread yet. General Leia (Carrie Fisher) oversees the troops, but gives special attention to Rey (Daisy Ridley) who spends her time training alone in the forest, perfecting Jedi-mind tricks like fighting using only her intuition and levitating above the ground as she searches for the voices of Jedis past. Meanwhile, modern day-Hamlet Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), leader of the First Order, is drawn to remote planet Exegol where he discovers Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) still alive and teasing an offer too good to be true: kill the last Jedi and be by his side while they rule over the galaxy. For those of you with poor memories or little knowledge of the ""Star Wars"" universe, Palpatine has been the overarching villain of the series since his first appearance in ""The Empire Strikes Back"". In his youth, he dissolved the governing body in favor of imperial rule, electing himself supreme leader. He was Darth Vader's boss until, as always happens, student killed master. But he's back now (somehow) in zombified form, eager to continue the reign of the Sith empire and push the dark side's propaganda onto the universe. Kylo Ren is the key for him to destroy the last Jedi, Rey. But Kylo Ren has his own agenda, and they play a game of cat and mouse, using their special connection to project their consciousness throughs space to one another. Rey, with the help of friends Poe (Oscar Isaac), Finn (John Boyega), Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo), C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) and adorable BB-8, is on an intergalactic quest to find the pathfinder that will show her the way to Exegol so she can finally learn her true identity and confront the evil Palpatine. The crew hops from planet to planet, always narrowly evading the First Order until they find what they are looking for. Rey, meanwhile, is fighting her own battle. She can feel the darkness creeping up inside her. It doesn't help that her attraction to Kylo Ren upsets her Jedi mindfulness. When Rey learns that she is <<>redacted spoiler<>>, her resolve to kill Palpatine, convert Kylo Ren back to the side his parents fought for all their lives and keep her friends safe is tested in an epic final battle with a few deaths, but plenty of gratifying moments to close out the saga. With J.J. Abrams back at the helm - we love Rian Johnson, but the new string of ""Star Wars"" films is Abrams' baby - ""The Rise of Skywalker"" doesn't attempt to do too much in its allotted runtime, something that could have made the film implode. It introduces very few new characters, and the ones it does, Poe's mask-wearing former cohort (Keri Russell) and a runaway Stormtrooper (Naomi Ackie), even feel unnecessary despite their limited screen time. There is a lot of flying and shooting; the dialogue often takes a backseat to the action. But that's what we want and need and love about a series that expands the universe it lives in with each installation. Despite all the other noise, it is Rey who is our focus. She's been the driving force of the new series (Episodes VII-IX) and she deserves this conclusion to her story which is also the resolution (for now) to the conflict of dark versus light, good versus evil. It's all a bit cliche, sure, but the duality of those themes is played out tactfully and with enough newness to make the film interesting. Avid fans will enjoy the sprinkling of Easter eggs that litter the film, the most obvious of which include Billy Dee Williams reprising his role as Lando Calrissian and the ghost of Han Solo (Harrison Ford) returning to deliver his iconic line one more time. At the end of the day, ""The Rise of Skywalker"" came, saw and entertained. It won't be flooding the Academy with Oscar nominations, but it will delight those who matter most. For now, may the Force be with you."

"Jan 27, 2021",positive," Joonas Suotamo is Chewbacca, Oscar Isaac is Poe Dameron, Daisy Ridley is Rey and John Boyega is Finn in STAR WARS:  THE RISE OF SKYWALKERLucasfilm Ltd. CLEVELAND, Ohio -- A long time ago, in what now feels like a galaxy far, far away, I distinctly remember hearing a rumor my favorite movie, “Star Wars,” was actually meant to be part of a nine-episode saga. The prospect of more “Star Wars” movies was the kind of thing that got a kid like me, who cherished the empty box he once got for Christmas that only had pictures of “Star Wars” action figures on it, up in the morning. There were doubts along the way -- first in 1983 following “Return of the Jedi” and again in 2005 after “Revenge of the Sith” -- that we’d ever see all nine of those films. But, some 42 years later, here we are. “Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker” represents the end to the beloved epic space opera George Lucas created many decades ago. Expectations are through the roof, especially after the film’s predecessor, “The Last Jedi,” left some fans saying they had a bad feeling about it. The standalone “Solo,” the most recent “Star Wars” film till now, didn’t exactly light a spark of enthusiasm either or instill confidence in Disney’s stewardship of the franchise. So, does “The Rise of Skywalker” deliver a satisfying conclusion to the saga or will your opinion of “Star Wars” turn to the dark side? “The Rise of Skywalker” feels like a big giant “f--- you” to “The Last Jedi.” That was my working headline for this post. Being charged with the final movie in the biggest pop culture phenomenon ever is a huge responsibility. Director/co-writer J.J. Abrams had a lot of questions to answer and people to please. At the top of that list of people: himself. Abrams recently took a shot at “The Last Jedi” director Rian Johnson, calling his approach to the saga as “meta” and saying that people don’t go to “Star Wars"" to be told, “This doesn’t matter.” Abrams was referring specifically to “The Force Awakens,” the 2015 reboot he directed. So, Abrams spends a considerable amount of time in “The Rise of Skywalker” un-doing pretty much everything Johnson un-did in Episode VIII. The Knights of Ren? They’re back. Rey’s nobody parents? Not nobodies anymore. Rose (Kelly Marie Tran)? Relegated, undeservedly, to the background. Some of the housekeeping is minor (Admiral Ackbar has a kid!), but some of it (Kylo Ren’s mask!) is distracting. More signficantly, Abrams’ course-correcting results in a movie that feels more like a sequel to “The Force Awakens” than it does to “The Last Jedi,” backing the story into a messy, convoluted corner. In short, if you preferred the subversiveness of “The Last Jedi” over the paint-by-numbers of “The Force Awakens,” this isn’t the film you’re looking for. THE DEAD SPEAK! Those are the first three words of the movie’s customary opening crawl. It’s no secret that Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) from the prequels and original trilogy is back because a.) the movie needed a villain after Snoke was killed in the previous film and b.) these things always come full circle. The problem: none of it really makes any sense. Not only is there no reason for Palpatine to be alive other than the film needs him to be, his return is never fully explained. Other characters inexplicably appear at just the right moment like in a shortened season of “Game of Thrones.” The galaxy has always been full of plot holes, but there are more here than in a block of blue-milk cheese. Instead of coherence we get familiarity as Abrams relies on recycled tropes from “The Force Awakens” and previous films. Rey (Daisy Ridley), Finn (John Boyega), Poe (Oscar Isaac), C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) and Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo) go in search of a map to Palpatine as Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) chases them across the galaxy with designs on turning Rey to the dark side by enticing her with secrets about her parents. It’s true. All of it.  Don’t get the wrong impression. This isn’t a negative review. The film indeed has hurdles to clear, but if you’re able to get past all of the above -- and you should -- you’ll discover “The Rise of Skywalker” is a blast, a rousing non-stop thrill ride that packs the emotional wallop you’d expect from a final chapter. No one’s ever really gone. Much of the film’s emotion comes from seeing the original trilogy characters in their final appearances on screen. Call it fan service if you want, but Billy Dee Williams is a joy in his return as Lando. In his most signifcant screentime since “Return of the Jedi,” Daniels crushes it, turning what had become an annoying character back into the Threepio that first captured our hearts. It’s a kick to see Mark Hamill finally get to play Luke as both a Force ghost and as a young Jedi Master training Leia in a flashback. Speaking of Leia, the late Carrie Fisher is radiant as the iconic princess. How Abrams pieced together a seamless performance from previously unused footage of Fisher is one of the film’s triumphs. Both the character and actress are given a touching send-off. If you’re not already crying by then, a surprise cameo by another original cast member should do the trick. Search your feelings. Make no mistake about it, this is Rey and Kylo Ren’s film. Their “Force bond,"" something Abrams convenienty kept from “The Last Jedi,"" is stronger than ever. The chemistry between the Ridley and Driver is undeniable as they navigate the peripheries of the Jedi and Sith. And you thought your relationship was complicated! The resolution of their story might not please everybody -- there were audible groans at the screening I attended -- but the journey should move, if not bowl you over like a speeding Rathtar. Rebellions are built on hope. Abrams paints inside the lines, but it’s still a wondrous canvas. “The Rise of Skywalker” is more a star chase than a full-blown star war, but the lightsaber duel on the sinking remains of the Death Star and the climactic battle on a Star Destroyer are worthy set pieces in franchise lore. Finn and Poe are an intergalactic buddy cop comedy waiting to happen. The film is full of twists, turns, surprises and reveals. Some you’ll see a parsec away, others not so much. Loose-ends are neatly tied up, mostly anyway. A nostalgic epilogue on Tattooine plants the seeds for possible future films. The Force will be with you, always. “The Rise of Skywalker” is a flawed, if not safe film. Even the title is a misdirect. Is it worth the 42-year wait? No movie could live up to that expectation. Still, there are enough reminders of why you fell in love with “Star Wars” in the first place to make you feel like a kid again. A kid who never has to wonder if those nine films will ever get made.

"Dec 17, 2020",positive," There comes a point when studios need to understand that fan service can only do so much heavy lifting with a film. It requires a convincing narrative, strong characterizations, and a commitment to taking risks to elevate a film beyond the pablum of box-checking. Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is not the film Disney should have made, it’s the film fans demanded to their own detriment. As the final film in the Skywalker Saga, The Rise of Skywalker is an overlong mess that tries to tie every single other film into the narrative without doing so convincingly. The film features countless cameos and throwbacks to the prior films that it almost feels like a documentary about the saga itself rather than a fully-formed idea of a film. As Rey (Daisy Ridley) continues her Jedi training under the tutelage of Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher), the threat of a thought-dead villain threatens the forward momentum of the rebellion while Finn (John Boyega) and Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) work to find his location. Through a series of roadblocks, all three continue trying to find the necessary course while Rey continues to insist that only she can stop the threat. Nearly every character that has dotted the landscape of the last four-plus decades of films features at some point in the film. The prequels see the least representation, but the originals are well represented with the likes of Fisher, Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill, and Billy Dee Williams all making requisite appearances. It’s a film almost entirely built off of fan service without giving them anything suitably deep or thought-provoking to latch onto. The lackluster screenplay by Chris Terrio and J.J. Abrams struggles to find something worthy to say that doesn’t devolve into pointless regurgitation of series tropes and characterizations. Further, characters with a great deal of promise like Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran) have been sidelined while new characters like Zorii Bliss (Keri Russell) were added with seemingly little need. A great deal of effort has also been made to retcon the prior outing from Rian Johnson simply because fans were unreasonably angry about it, the end result is something that feels almost half-baked. That isn’t to say that the film doesn’t work. Fans are sure to be enthralled by the movie even if some are disappointed by the direction the final film ultimately took. Those fan service moments largely excite and there are plenty of emotion-filled moments thanks to John Williams’ always-exciting score. The problem is and always will be J.J. Abrams who has never been a fan of creating his own unique vision. Every franchise he gets his hands on is stripped bare of its essence and retrofitted to his exacting mediocrity. If he’s not outright copying other, better work (Super 8, Star Trek 1 & 2, The Force Awakens), he’s creating something as unchallenging and frequently dull as The Rise of Skywalker."
"Dec 7, 2020",positive," umors of puppetmaster Emperor Palpatine’s existence persist, causing Supreme Leader Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) to venture off in search of the hidden world of the Sith, while the meager remnants of the Resistance struggle to find support. Despite the thunderous theme music and the iconic yellow text crawl, the events summed up in this opening are perhaps the least eventful – and most unnecessary – of all the “Star Wars” films to date. Clearly, it’s expected that this preamble occur, even if there’s no need. In the initial moments, a new alien species is seen, new structures are unearthed, and elements of the otherworldly Dark Side antagonists are glimpsed – even if fashioned for little more than a single scene. Back in 1977 when “Star Wars” first debuted, the Sith were the sleeker, hipper, edgier, better-dressed brethren to the Jedi; the rebellious younger brother of sorts. But here, they generate a horror movie vibe, as if inhabiting the world of a grim, modernized vision of Frankenstein’s monster. After all these years, the villains aren’t as cool as they are simply icky. Though the opening reveals some not-so-surprising revelations (spoiler-type items are introduced quickly so as not to keep audiences waiting for what they know to be inevitable – particularly from the film’s advertising, which gives away the setup), a dependable action sequence follows, again transitioning between new imagery – from an icy, Borg-like planetoid, to a stalagmitic region, and then to a green gaseous world – as if to cram as many fresh environments into the mix as possible. And it all leads to intermediary activities, including Rey (Daisy Ridley) continuing her training under the casual guidance of Leia (Carrie Fisher), Poe (Oscar Isaac) and Finn (John Boyega) using the Millennium Falcon to rendezvous with a spy, and Ren coordinating the assemblage of the Final Order (a monstrous fleet of soldiers and warships combining to finally wipe out the opposition). Plus, Rey must eventually find out why her abilities with the Force continue to grow. “Never be afraid of who you are.” Since this closing chapter to the sequel trilogy is once again helmed by J.J. Abrams, he has a rare opportunity to undo – or correct – the many things that former writer/director Rian Johnson did to the storyline. But right from the start, Abrams embraces heavy homages to the original trilogy, which border on disagreeable repetition rather than welcomed reappearances. Neatly tying together Johnson’s additives or restoring Abrams’ own concepts appear as trivial concerns. A round-table meeting with sharply-uniformed, uncertain, First Order officers ends in a typical Force-choke; a desert planet is overpopulated with alien denizens, much like the many establishments on Tatooine; the Knights of Ren, a gang of intimidating Jedi trainees sporting barbaric short-range weapons, feel all too similar to Snoke’s crimson-armored Praetorian Guards (themselves a twist on Palpatine’s Royal Guards) – or even The Children of Thanos (it’s difficult at times for certain concepts in “Star Wars” not to resemble something from the Marvel universe, or vice versa); and a Death Star-type infiltration retreads much of the Vader/Obi-Wan showdown and the Leia rescue (though the architectural comparisons are amusing, hinting at the evolution of the Imperials into the First Order). And, disappointingly, there’s still no answer as to who or what Snoke was supposed to be – obviously an idea that fizzled out when the role was deemed dispensable. As in the previous episodes, plenty of contrivances populate the premise. A convenient Sith Wayfinder is the only clue to locating an unknown planet; conveniently, Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams) returns for an extended cameo; a First Order Captain’s medallion is conveniently handed to Poe for his very next act of espionage; and Poe just happens to know a droid-hacker when a droid needs to be hacked. How convenient. There are also too many just-in-the-nick-of-time sequences to count. Nevertheless, the film also knows how to blend in with the “Star Wars” adventures that preceded it, crafting new vehicles, monsters, technology, weaponry, costumes, and visual splendor, even if all of it is used in the same kinds of chases, battles, dogfights, and rescue missions from before. Yet Rey gets to do some stunning things with the Force, proving to be more formidable than ever; C-3PO is utilized in spectacular ways for comic relief, representing a dependable return to the humor of the original trilogy; and plenty of practical effects and rubbery puppetry highlight the charm of tangible props (diminutive droidsmith Babu is one of the best examples). The stakes are higher, the allies are scarcer, and the enemies more plentiful, building to a grand climax. Of course, with the shift in writing comes the jettisoning of a few major characters, backtracking on bits of history and themes, and a romantic counterpart reshuffle. Yet the conclusion is rife with jaw-dropping sets, lightsaber duels, emotional confrontations, and sentimental throwbacks to recognizable elements not only from the original trilogy but also from “Star Wars: The Force Awakens,” bringing to an end (if only temporarily) a remarkably vast collection of cinematic legends and lore, and an acclaimed legacy of sci-fi fantasy prominence.

"Nov 27, 2020",positive," Set after the events of The Last Jedi – which saw the resistance at their weakest – we are thrown straight into the action as Rey (Daisy Ridley), Finn (John Boyega) and Poe (Oscar Isaac) look to finally defeat the First Order, led by Supreme Leader Kylo Ren (Adam Driver). Add on the returning threat of Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) and the pieces all appear in place for an epic conclusion that could leave the majority satisfied. However, what follows, while satisfying on certain levels, suffers from a tirade of problems that will leave many frustrated. To keep this review as spoiler free as possible, I won’t get into specifics,but it is safe to say that Adam Driver is the stand out performer. As Kylo Ren, he has always been a powerful presence on screen that balances both the light and the dark. In The Last Jedi his internal conflict was at a tipping point. With The Rise of Skywalker we see how far these choices have taken him and whether anything can bring him back from the darkness. Daisy Ridley has now comfortably found her stride with the character of Rey and has been able to portray an incredible depth of emotion. She is given a lot of material to work with here and she does well to help make it believable through her grounded performance. It is however sad to report that the screentime of a lot of fan favourites such as Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran) and General Hux (Domnhall Gleeson) is lacking. Moved to the background when their performances were highlights of the sequel trilogy, it was disheartening to see these characters reduced to set dressing in favour of new characters with little backstory. Outside of the main trio of heroes, we do not get a chance to see many more of the heroes to shine. Even newcomers Jannah (Naomi Ackie) and Zorii Bliss (Keri Russell) only serve to further plot and do not feel full formed as characters themselves. Jannah in particular feels underutilised, especially when you consider her characters backstory and its connection to another of the lead characters. Something hard to deny is that John Williams has done some incredible work with the score. Using elements from all his previous work, as well as fresh interpretations, the soundtrack is full of life and truly lives up to the incredibly high standards that Williams has set for himself. Without the score, The Rise of Skywalker’s biggest moments of levity would perhaps not ring quite as strong as Williams finds the perfect moment to elevate  emotions. Having scored every episode of the Skywalker Saga, it seems fitting that Williams ends on perhaps his most powerful yet. One thing that became clear in The Rise of Skywalker was how much of an impact Rian Johnson’s The Last Jedi had on how we view the Star Wars franchise. At the time, there was a lot of controversy surrounding the film, but now two years on we can see how Johnson’s interpretation and reflective look on our heroes and how we perceive them was perhaps a one of a kind moment. The Rise of Skywalker feels like a missed opportunity to continue the incredible themes and ideas started by Johnson. Plot threads that were resolved previously become reopened as though to undo previous work. Where The Last Jedi looked to be its own entity despite what fans may believe, The Rise of Skywalker looks to please fans without wanting to have a reason to do so. Some choices feel made specifically to appease the toxic side of the fandom and in the end feel calculated decisions not by a free filmmaker but someone terrified by their audience.  The Rise of Skywalker offers a lot of good material for fans of the sequel trilogy as we finally see the heroic trio fighting together and adventuring, much like Luke, Han and Leia had done previously. Those moments feel joyful and what Star Wars is about is feeling joy. While the conclusion of this film will leave some unhappy and others shocked, their is a sense that the past is being honoured, and circle that started with Anakin is brought to a poetic conclusion. The film is far from perfect but offers enough action and heart to satisfy the majority of moviegoers. A better film lives somewhere within this story,  but I am left with a sense of hope that the future of this franchise still shines bright."
"Oct 19, 2020",positive," Let's get this out of the way up top: I like Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, I really do. It's full of energy, it never lets the gas up. The performances, especially the leads, are all top shelf. Carrie Fisher, through the use of archival footage and such, is on a giant screen one last time and that is a good thing. The emotional journeys are moving and fulfilling. The twists and turns and surprises are all built on foundations of what came before. John Williams' score is toe-curlingly good.The movie is eye-candy and ear-candy of the highest order. But it is also the most pandering movie of the year. Maybe of the decade. Endgame, you can see yourself out the door, Skywalker will take your seat at the table. It creaks under the weight of all of the fan service. The heroes land on a planet looking for whatsit, there is a festival going on, someone mentions the festival occurs every 42 years. You can do the math since 1977. There are cameos and Easter eggs and callbacks being dropped every few minutes. Some of these are clunky, some of them are not. Some cause eyeballs to roll all the way back, some cause a smile or a tear. Some might call it nostalgia gone crazy, some might call it trying to play it safe. And anyone expecting more of the franchise breaking weirdness, and giddiness of Last Jedi, well, I'm sorry. This ain't that film. I don't hide my love for Last Jedi, not at all. I love every overstuffed moment, every unexpected narrative turn. and every Kurosawa influenced frame of that billion plus dollar grossing bit of oddness. To see some aspects of Last Jedi treated with what appears to be disrespect kind of hurts. So, yeah, Rise of Skywalker is fulfilling the promise of Force Awakens. It's a Star Wars movie that is trying not to upset anyone. It's not trying to reinvent the franchise, it's trying to bring it to an end. But, yes, it sticks the landing. It sure does. I'll confess - there may have been a tear or two when I heard John Williams' Finale start to play and the credits started to roll. This is it, the saga is over. This story, with all of its repeating motifs and themes, is finally over. I wonder if wee me, sitting in that theatre a lifetime ago, would understand that one day he would be writing a bunch of words about the last piece of this story that essentially come down to ""movie good"". I think wee me might be very confused by this. There was no Episode 4, no A New Hope, when wee me saw Star Wars. It was just that, Star Wars. I think I might be old. What's it about? Well, there is a tribe of cats called the Jellicles and they've come together for the annual Jellicle Ball and for some reason Dame Judi Dench is a cat but has human hands. Nice try. Writing about nothing has become a bit of a superpower in this spoiler adverse age we currently live in. I've had lots of practice, what with the Marvel movies and the other Star Wars properties and other comic book movies and look, I'm doing it right now. Nice try, indeed. At its worst moments, Rise of Skywalker feels like a film made with notes from Reddit. It's clunky and you can almost feel the expectations and desperation to please coming off of the screen. At its best, it feels like a natural conclusion to a story that has been told over decades. Remove the fan service, you will still have a heck of a genre movie here. And the cast elevates everything, from the odd plotting to the undercooked dialogue. Will it break the genre wall at the Oscars? Nope. Is Rise of Skywalker what it is intended to be? Is it a piece of crowd pleasing, popcorn entertainment where some things blow up real good? Yep. Don't over think it, it's a Star Wars movie. No-one can hear you giggle in space. is it worth seeing in a theatre? Yes, you crazy person. A million times yes. This thing looks amazing. It's big and it is beautiful. There are so many moments that I can't talk about here, but trust me, Rise of Skywalker is a feast. Now, get back to work."
"Aug 28, 2020",negative," The Skywalker Saga reaches its conclusion (for now), as J.J. Abrams once again takes the reins to make a finale that aims to please all factions of fans across the galaxy. This review is spoiler free.  Following the divisive reaction of ‘The Last Jedi’, there was a choice to be made with the final piece of this sequel trilogy; give in to the loud factions of fans who disagreed with decisions made, or develop the story from the threads of Rian Johnson’s daring mid-quel? With J.J. back, business has resumed to normal with ‘The Rise of Skywalker’, a trilogy- capper so eager to please as many corners of the fandom as it possibly can that it forgets to tell a story along the way. The Emperor has returned. Thought dead, Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) has been moving in the shadows and is finally ready to launch his strike. The only thing that stands in his way is the hope of the Jedi in the form of scavenger Rey (Daisy Ridley) who is being pursued by supreme leader Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), as she and the rest of the Resistance fight to ensure a peaceful future for the galaxy. Abrams is a director who is more than capable of mounting action and creating a peppy sense of excitement and mystery. But sadly here it feels as though he is drowning beneath the weight of the responsibility put before him. From the very off, the apparently troubled production history can be felt as the film panics in setting up its adventure with an opening act that throws all the toys on the table and quickly tries to put them in a specific place. That proves to be a direction that’s frustratingly familiar and only fitfully intriguing, as the film ends up being a furiously paced adventure across numerous planets following multiple hunts for MacGuffins with very vague purposes. From there, the adventure ends up hitting similar beats to that of the franchise as a whole, from the original trilogy right down to the prequels. While the return of Palpatine does bring with it the fun of McDiarmid’s deliciously pantomime performance, it can’t help but feel like a desperate plea to please the faithful. Along with many other choices that deliberately avoid fragments developed in ‘The Last Jedi’ in favour of a broad assumption of what it thinks the fans want, this quickly becomes a finale that is far too concerned with developing something that brings together the 40+ years of the franchise. So, while the film is well made with incredible special effects and features a suitably grand John Williams score and is dedicatedly performed by its cast of talented actors, there is the inescapable feeling of desperation powering it all. You can feel the anxiety behind the camera to deliver something that all fans can enjoy, a task which is frankly impossible and doomed to fail. As a result, this is fan service in the worst possible fashion, with characters and plot points dropped in for merely the sake of getting a cheer from the crowd rather than add to the story or to strengthen the overall reason for this sequel trilogy to exist. ‘The Rise of Skywalker’ is a concluding chapter that is so ferociously paced that it forgets to construct a story, moving frantically through action beats which don’t leave much of an impression, delivered at such a clip that it hopes you don’t have time to dwell on the thinly sketched details of what plot there is. What development there is among characters feels largely superficial, and some plot fragments are dropped as quickly as they are introduced. There is the niggling sense that another year in production might’ve allowed Abrams and his co-writer Chris Terrio the time to smooth out their ambitions. However, as it stands, this is a final chapter that feels as though it just can’t wait to get it all done with, rather than one that feels like it wants the moment to last. Very much the ‘Return of the Jedi’ to ‘The Last Jedi’’s ‘Empire Strikes Back’, in that it concludes its trilogy in an awkwardly paced fashion, TROS is devoid of much ambition other than to get to a place where it feels most fans will be contented. It lacks the confidence of ‘The Force Awakens’ and the thematic bravado of ‘The Last Jedi’. There are some joyous moments along the way that my inner Star Wars fan couldn’t help but smile at, but there are others that are simply confusing, and some that are just a bit embarrassing. A messy, and ultimately underwhelming experience, but one that feels so desperate to please that the sense you leave with is not one of anger or annoyance, but rather one of pity. And so this is how the Skywalker Saga ends, not with thunderous applause but with a heavy shrug of exhausted shoulders."

"Jul 28, 2020",negative," The Skywalker saga is brought to a close with this, the final film in the main storyline canon, tasked with bringing the curtain down in a way befitting of the moment. Except The Rise of Skywalker does not even come close. The magic that made audiences fall in love with a galaxy far, far away has been erased. In its place comes the galactic equivalent of an audit; reconciled, bland, an empty record of the originals. The result is perhaps the least inspiring entry the series has ever endured. On paper there is so much promise. Somehow, the sinister Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) has survived all these years, plotting his revenge. Rey (Daisy Ridley) has to stand against both Palpatine and Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), who knows a shocking secret about Rey’s heritage. Yet quickly you realise that bringing back Palpatine is one of the safest, least creative things Disney and J.J. Abrams could possibly have done. And that’s just the beginning. The story and its execution stinks of needless course correction following The Last Jedi. Gone are the fascinating new avenues and ideas introduced in the last film, Abrams bulldozing over everything with what he introduced in The Force Awakens. The Knights of Ren, Rey’s parents and planet-killing weaponry are just some of the things brought back, resulting in a convoluted story that throws the entire Age of Resistance trilogy off kilter. Worse still is that newer characters are cruelly pushed out, none more so than Rose (Kelly Marie Tran). Largely forgotten also is General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson), granted an inexplicable and hastily justified character arc, and even Finn (John Boyega), cursed with increasingly little to do as Rey’s power grows. Poe (Oscar Isaac), meanwhile, is lazily thrown more love interests instead of building on how he grew in The Last Jedi, Abrams confirming how disinterested he is in detailed characterisation. Some fan service is not unwelcome, but The Rise of Skywalker feels like it was based on an over-enthusiastic Reddit post. The endless stream of nods, references and direct quotes borders on laziness. It feels woefully uninspiring – even the sequences that try and spin something new barely register. This is as cold, calculated and profane as studio-produced efforts get; a paint-by-numbers kind of movie. The zip and wonder of Star Wars has been butchered. There are some moments to savour, all featuring Rey and Kylo Ren. Their lightsaber duel on the wave-battered ruins of the second Death Star is riveting, and the strange connection that has brought them together is concluded in a way that, while it still lacks great surprises, at least feels right. Ridley and Driver have settled into their roles wonderfully, carrying the script through their most dramatic encounters with enough gravitas to feel like they at least are getting the farewell they deserve. Welcome, also, is the return of Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams), another instance where there is more than surface-level gratification.  This is not how it should have ended. Star Wars made its mark with imagination, fuelled by the bravery to introduce new ideas and leave stars in the audience’s eyes. Instead, Disney have decided that a lazy slog through tested content was the way to go, and it is unforgivable. The Rise of Skywalker simply lacks the spark that has kept this franchise going for so long, replaced by a poisonous hesitation to stray too far from what the fanbase would likely demand. It leaves many questions unanswered, a feeling of dissatisfaction deep in your stomach, and a strange sense of paralysing disappointment."
"Jul 25, 2020",positive," Sitting there waiting for John Williams’ opening fanfare at the start of Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, I harbored one apprehension: That despite their assurances that this ninth film in the series would bring the entire 42-year Star Wars saga to a close, the Sith Lords at Disney would nevertheless concoct a cliff-hanger ending, teasing yet another three-part go-round with the Skywalker clan. Breathe easy: The Mouse House has admirably resisted going over to the Dark Side. Rise of Skywalker has a fully resolved fade-out, leaving no one in jeopardy and the bad guys vanquished. (Spare me the “spoiler alert” e-mails: What, you thought the Star Wars saga would end like The Hateful Eight?) Will those who still wear their hair in Princess Leia buns or who argue about whether Han Solo shot first be satisfied with the way director J.J. Abrams and his army of writers have resolved the tale? Who knows? But for the casual observer — albeit one who since 1977 has seen every Star Wars movie during its opening week — this is a pretty satisfactory wrap-up. The iconic opening text rambles on about rebels and an evil emperor, and then Chapter 9 picks up right where Chapter 8 left off: A ragtag army of rebels is holed up on some distant planet, desperately trying to figure out a way to resist a powerful galactic dictatorship that has developed a super weapon capable of destroying entire planets. Now, you may ask: Wasn’t that the exact same plot of the original Star Wars? Well yes, yes it was. But back then the chief bad guy was the Emperor Palpatine, and the rebels were led by Princess Leia. Okay, well, yeah, this time the Emperor remains (Ian McDiarmid, still playing the role after 36 years), and so does Leia (Carrie Fisher, still playing the role three years after her passing). But that’s definitely where the similarities end. Except for the hallway shootouts between our heroes and the Storm Troopers (terrible shots as ever) and the climactic dogfight in which mosquito-like space fighters wreak havoc on enemy ships the size of Manhattan (you just need to know where to aim). And of course there’s the brave young heroine in white (Daisy Ridley) who’s got multiple handsome guys hopelessly in love with her. Ah! So, here’s an element in Rise of Skywalker that was definitely not in the first Star Wars movie: A repentant villain performs the ultimate act of self-sacrifice to save the life of an innocent. Ha! That didn’t happen … until the end of The Return of the Jedi. The point here, I guess, is that repetition isn’t a glitch in the Star Wars universe — it’s a feature. Not unlike Medieval passion plays, for which audiences tolerated only the most minor variations on a theme, the Star Wars movies vary primarily in the people speaking the lines and the exact nature of the deus ex machina that will deliver our heroes from the brink of destruction this time. The chief contribution Abrams has made in producing the last three Star Wars movies has been in assembling an appealing cast (as opposed to George Lucas’ three prequels, which seemed to have held their casting calls at Madame Tussaud’s). Daisy Ridley, beautiful and bad-ass, brings Marvel-caliber energy to the role of Rey, a Jedi. Adam Driver gives the most thoughtful and sympathetic of his three turns as conflicted bad guy Kylo Ren. We still don’t get enough time with Oscar Isaac, John Boyega, and Keri Russell as hotshot fighter pilots — I wouldn’t mind following that trio in some future Star Wars spin-off (but not a sequel). And, of course, Abrams has had the advantage of recruiting Star Wars veterans whose audience goodwill is automatic. I won’t spill how many of them show up here, but it’s well known that Abrams employed previously unused footage of Fisher to cobble together a supporting role for her here. It’s the most ambitious gamble of the film, and surprisingly successful: Despite the fact that the entire script was reverse engineered to accommodate the snippets of film at hand, Princess Leia’s part in the narrative is not only substantial — it’s central to the plot. No one is deluding themselves into thinking Disney is flushing the whole Star Wars universe. But it’s clear that the whole Skywalker saga ran its course a few films ago, and now is the time to stop. For one thing, if trends continued, the next installment would have required the return of Jar-Jar Binks. Featured image: Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley in Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker.

"Jul 24, 2020",positive," After J.J. Abrams reignited the “Star Wars” franchise for a new generation in “The Force Awakens” (2015), Rian Johnson’s “The Last Jedi” (2017) didn’t quite deliver, as Luke Skywalker told Rey he had three lessons to teach her, but only revealed two. This weekend, Abrams delivers a hard course correct in “Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker,” fulfilling every promise with plenty of fan service and wrapping things up without ambiguity. If anything, the movie plays it too safe with everything tied up too neatly, but as a final chapter for these characters, it’s a solidly satisfying conclusion. After the defeat of Snoke, Rey (Daisy Ridley) joins back up with Resistance pals Finn (John Boyega), Poe (Oscar Isaac), Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo), C-3PO (Anthony Daniels), R2-D2 (Hasan Taj, Lee Towersey), BB-8 (Brian Herring, Dave Chapman), Rose (Kelly Marie Tran) and General Leia (the late Carrie Fisher). Rey still suffers visions connecting her to Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), who wants her to join the Dark Side where Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) returns to lead the Sith army’s First Order. This closing chapter smartly focuses on the mental bond between Rey and Ren, as Ridley and Driver take center stage. Ridley starts out running a training course in the woods like Clarice Starling, reminding us how she’s become an inspiring heroine for young girls growing up with Katniss Everdeen and Wonder Woman. Driver has become an even bigger star, earning Oscar buzz for his role in “Marriage Story,” but first fusing together his Darth Vader-style dark helmet for a cool new mask of molten welding. Their spiritual connection of crossover communications is the most visually compelling element by Abrams, who works with editors Maryann Brandon and Stefan Grube to intercut Rey and Ren’s shared experiences when they are in different locations. They can even affect the other’s world in tangible ways, a fascinating addition to the powers of The Force, which has always been the strength of George Lucas’ genius creation. Co-written by Abrams and Chris Terrio (“Argo”), the script offers plenty of popcorn munching delight. Babu Frik hilariously mumbles for comic relief like Baby Groot, Poe trades sassy banter with Zorri Bliss (Keri Russell) and Rey wages two killer lightsaber battles. At one point, a weapon becomes a clue-finder like something out of Indiana Jones, while John Williams reminds us he can still provide nostalgic goosebumps. On the downside, the script practically abandons the romance between Finn and Rose, which is odd considering it was such a driving force of “The Last Jedi.” In fact, Rose is barely on screen at all, while Finn starts to offer a confession but never finishes. Other characters like Lupita Nyong’o’s Maz Kanata appear briefly to show face but without much plot involvement, while Domhnall Gleeson gets a laughable line as General Hux. Amid the catchphrases, a great screenplay should most importantly keep us guessing. Here the “surprises” may be satisfying in closing the story loop without rocking the existing canon, but they are underwhelming as a viewer craving twists and turns. This is partly due to over exposure by trailers already revealing the biggest moments. It’s great to see Billy Dee Williams back as Lando Calrissian for the first time in 36 years, but it would have been much more exciting if we didn’t see it coming. The same goes for the trailers revealing the return of Emperor Palpatine. It’s a pretty lazy choice to bring back the villain from “Return of the Jedi,” feeling like we’ve seen it all before with Ewoks. It makes the 1983 victory less important now that we know Palpatine survived. The writers should have built a new foe, rather than rehash an old one. Alas, at least we get closure to Rey’s long-debated identity crisis. Don’t worry, we won’t spoil it here, but let’s just say that it is definitively answered. That’s not to say it’s very rewarding, considering all of the juicier fan conspiracies since 2015. The result is more of a shrug than a shocker, no where near Darth Vader’s iconic “I am your father” reveal from “The Empire Strikes Back” (1980), which remains the franchise’s best installment. Now, after nine official episodes, this is the curtain call for these characters as the end of the franchise’s third trilogy. Looking back, I wish they had waited three years in between chapters like the original trilogy. Even the disappointing prequel trilogy made us wait several years in between releases. Instead, they rushed out “Rogue One” (thumbs up) and “Solo” (thumbs down) as in-between offshoots that diluted the brand. Disney will now pump the box-office brakes by focusing on the Disney+ series “The Mandalorian.” This is probably the best medium for die-hard fans to continue exploring the “Star Wars” universe as old-school fans jump off the ride with fatigue. Regardless of which camp you’re in, we can all agree that the big-screen installments should go away for a while and make us miss them. Then, if a new movie ever does arrive, let’s leave Luke, Leia and Solo in the past and explore a new galaxy, far, far away.

"Jul 17, 2020",negative," The final chapter of the epic Star Wars saga, The Rise of Skywalker, finally hits theaters this week, and although there are so many questions about what becomes of the many characters we've grown to love over the past four decades, there's also something many LGBTQ+ fans of the franchise are begging to finally know: do we exist in a galaxy far, far away? Picking up a year after where 2017's The Last Jedi left off, The Rise of Skywalker starts with the Resistance (or what's left of it) still recovering from their last encounter with the First Order under the leadership of Supreme Leader Snoke. Using the most diabolical forces of the Dark Side, the infamous Emperor Palpatine has mysteriously re-emerged back to life as the leader of the Sith and is planning, once again, to completely take over the galaxy and put a permanent end to the Jedi. Without spoiling too much, the rest of the movie focuses mostly on our main hero Rey (Daisy Ridley), the last known Jedi and de facto face of the Resistance, as she tries to put an end to the Emperor's wicked plot despite attempts by Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) to lure her to the Dark Side. Though they were mostly kept apart in the two previous Star Wars films, Rey also finally gets to team up with Finn (John Boyega) and Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) on an urgent Resistance mission, and their dynamic feels a lot like the beloved friendship between Luke, Leia, and Han Solo. Of course, many Star Wars fans know that ever since they were introduced to us in 2015's The Force Awakens, viewers wanted more than just friendship between Finn and Poe. So will The Rise of Skywalker give loyal FinnPoe shippers and LGBTQ+ Star Wars fans the queer romance and representation we've been desperately wanting for the past 42 years? Yes and no. And while we did get a speck (not a crumb, a speck) of LGBTQ+ rep, it wasn't from Finn and Poe, the two characters fans have been feverishly shipping together for years. In fact, it feels like The Rise of Skywalker goes out of its way to reinforce the notion that Finn and Poe aren't a thing, despite their actors John Boyega and Oscar Isaac even admitting their two characters have chemistry and that they wished they could have explored that more on screen. In the film, Poe is given a love interest in the new character Zorii (Keri Russell), and the fling between Rose (Kelly Marie Tran) and Finn is really played up, especially during dramatic, emotional moments in the final battle with the Sith. The decision to make two unimportant background characters queer felt like such a waste, especially since more of an impact would have been made if two main characters, especially ones with as much chemistry as Finn and Poe had their queerness confirmed in canon. Despite these problems, The Rise of Skywalker didn't do anything that other films and TV shows haven't, shoehorning a small but pleasant queer moment in wherever was convenient. Is too little, too late? Oh yeah. Is it something that LGBTQ+ pop culture fans are already used to?

"Jul 14, 2020",neutral," The power of nostalgia cannot be overestimated. J.J. Abrams, who directed the first film of the Star Wars sequel trilogy (The Force Awakens, 2015) and returns to steer the franchise to its culmination with Star Wars: The Rise Of Skywalker, is all too aware of that truism, especially in the light of the hostile fan reaction provoked by Star Wars: The Last Jedi (2017), in which director Rian Johnson dared to stray from the beaten path. Star Wars: The Rise Of Skywalker drifts back into the known orbit, treads cautiously, and falls back on old sleights. As a result, parts of the film, particularly in the last hour or so, may seem like a rehash of 1983's Return of the Jedi. Fans are unlikely to complain. However, sticking largely to established norms and mindful of what the Star Wars heroes, villains and their galactic battles - all of which are larger-than-life and have been pop culture-defining phenomena over a period of 40-plus years - mean to the fans, Abrams is unwaveringly focused on carrying the fans along. In the bargain he skips paying attention to letting The Rise Of Skywalker acquire a life and logic of its own. The weight of expectations - Star Wars Episode IX is one of the most anticipated films in the annals of Hollywood - is a heavy burden for what is meant to be the swan song of much-loved franchise. Shouldn't it have been better and brighter than any of the previous eight Star Wars episodes? It is anything but. The film is energetic and entertaining on the face of it, but if you pause to consider the finer aspects of storytelling - plotting, character development, logic and suchlike - you are likely to spot gaping holes in the structure built by Abrams, who has co-written The Rise Of Skywalker with Chris Terrio. He pays homage to the George Lucas universe, throws in a few minor visual Easter eggs and mounts a few grand scenes that look great while they last. Neither a proper expansion nor a summation of what Star Wars stands for, it falls into the cracks between conception and execution. Following Rey (Daisy Ridley, who is first-rate) and her buddies, Finn (Frank Boyega) and Poe (Oscar Isaac), as they set out to stymie the evil plans of the tyrannical First Order, the film answers a few key questions, most notably one related to the Rey's parentage, kills off a few characters, and surprisingly brings back a few others. One character who makes a comeback is the principal villain, Emperor Sheev Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid), who, at the end of Return of the Jedi, had been thrown down a chute and had met his end. In The Rise Of Skywalker, his revival is presented as a fait accompli without a proper explanation nor an attempt to make it believable. Palpatine is reintroduced with the express purpose of overriding Snork's surprise death in The Last Jedi. But it is anything but convincing. Much of The Rise Of Skywalker is devoted to a strategy to negate The Last Jedi, a film that sought to pull away from the George Lucas imagination of a Galaxy Far Far Away. What this necessitates for The Rise Of Skywalker is the act of drawing upon Star Wars lore to restore the links with the franchise's past and then creating its own course towards a finale. All this makes the film so dizzyingly busy that it becomes difficult in the initial hour to grasp every plot detail. This is turn leads to contrivances designed to paper over the gaps - they barely pass muster. The craftsmanship is of the highest order, the CGI is terrific, and the performances applause-worthy, but there is something about The Rise Of Skywalker that does not let it float free and rise to heights that the franchise hasn't touched before. Its finesse is of the strictly superficial kind, which is a huge disappointment for those who believed that Star Wars would end with a bang. Rey, Finn and Poe generate a fair deal of excitement, but they cannot replicate the magic that Luke Skywalker, Han Solo and Princess Leia worked in the original Star Wars trilogy. The Rise Of Skywalker is Daisy Ridley's film, but Boyega and Isaac do not have as much to do. It is Adam Driver who steals the show as Kylo Ren, whose telepathic connection with Rey allows him to taunt her about switching allegiance to the dark side. Palpatine has picked Kylo to be his successor. The evil emperor promises Kylo an entire army and immense power in exchange for the task of eliminating the last Jedi trainee, Rey. On the other side, Rey, having lost her master Luke, is learning the Jedi ropes from General Leia (Carrie Fisher, who appears in awkwardly spliced together scenes left out of the earlier films). Eventually, Rey decides that she must track down Palpatine and leaves the Resistance base accompanied by Finn, Poe, Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo) and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) and BB. They progress towards their goal, rising level by level, as if in a video game. Only two people can stop Palpatine - Rey and Kylo - but they are on opposing sides. A lightsaber duel on a fallen Death Star and other visually striking passages abound in the film, but they are slapped together in a manner that smacks of a lack of planning, slapdash writing and generic action tics."
"Jul 14, 2020",negative," When the dust finally settled, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker inevitably brought back memories to something I wrote last year.  It was titled The Pitfalls of Nostalgia – a conversational look into our relationship with the convention and its excessive use and over-reliance of it in film and TV.  And yet somehow as I mull over my thoughts in summing up the final film in the Skywalker saga, somehow those words are more apparent than ever. J.J. Abrams has a deep fascination with mystery box adventures that you could probably write a thesis on it.  From LOST, Alias, Fringe, Mission Impossible 3 and even Star Trek Into Darkness, he operates this trademark style with an almost Spielbergian methodology.  The quest creates a sense of wonder and the inevitable whipped-up frenzy of speculation and discourse.  In J.J’s reality, the power surrounding the mystery serves as a powerful narrative, where questions can be layered upon mystery box upon mystery box with a countless amount of teasing that would prop up a Charlie Day conspiracy meme, instead of having to explain or confront its context. Perhaps the best example of his concept is Super 8 (arguably J.J’s strongest work in his filmography), a film enriched in Spielberg both in its nostalgia and that ‘larger than life’ adventurism bonded by family and friendship.  Whilst it does well to convey the emotional outreach with its fantastic young cast and sharp dialogue, it’s muddled turn off was its choice to change the nature of the alien, switching between a Cloverfield/Jaws obliteration of the residents to a sudden E.T. complex of an alien wanting to ‘phone home’.  In a film that feels like a mash-up of his favourite genres and themes, you can make a humble argument that the alien was a substitute for family grief.  But the truth is the twist works more as an executed jigsaw convention, something to reward an audience through its emotional overtures than catering for some constructed logic within its script. That’s not to say there’s a right or wrong way of storytelling. It’s clear he loves this tool, hence why he frequently deploys it. There’s a comfort and reliability, helping him to articulate the abundance of ideas in his mind. But like ‘observing the pattern’ as Fringe fans would say, often it comes across as an imitation that finds itself making questionable decisions rather than entertain something uniquely substantial. With this established safety net, it allows him a template to help sell the concept and introduce (or re-introduce) his characters to respond to its mystery. The overriding question that loomed over The Rise of Skywalker is whether he could finish something he started, always finding himself in a position where he leaves before a project’s completion.  Nostalgia may serve a purpose like playing a Spotify greatest hits collection, but depending on its execution, it can also leave one feeling – emptiness. It’s like playing a video game with all of its cheat codes turned on. Yes it is fun for a while, and yes, you get its immediate satisfaction, but somehow you’re left with the legacy feeling of nothing to engage from. In the case of watching Super 8, I wanted to go home and watch a Spielberg film rather than re-watch Super 8. The Rise of Skywalker falls into that same distinct trap. The Rise of Skywalker showcases the best and utmost worst of J.J. Abrams work; generic, stale, unfinished and lopsided.  Sure, it’s energetic and unapologetically visceral, but its breakneck speed for pacing can be summed up in Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) rapidly jumping to lightspeed to find his way out of trouble in the Millennium Falcon (knowing the famous ship can’t handle that kind of intensity). As if to cover over the flaws from J.J. Abrams and Chris Terrio’s script, through its sheer velocity, we have no sense of what planets, city or perspective in it’s ‘blink and you’ll miss it’ overture.  The sheer nature of the move is gung-ho, reckless and brazen as you would expect from the director, but also presents a discombobulating sensation that you’ve binge-watched the entirety of Game of Thrones in a day with the fast forward speed of 10x (obviously not possible, but you get the gist of the idea). It’s easy to boil this down as “if you loved The Last Jedi, you’re gonna hate this” argument and vice versa.  That argument is far too simple for something generational, subjective and far more complicated than most people will recognise.  Irrespective of whether you enjoyed Rian Johnson’s meta-commentary experiment on The Last Jedi or not, the hindsight reality is that it took risks, risks the franchise needed to ask itself about its legacy and its subsequent role in its history.  The ultimate failure from The Rise of Skywalker falls on its basic principles of storytelling, where character arcs from its opening crawl and previous films are left in the deserted wastelands of Tatooine, where dialogue is replaced by heavy doses of exposition and characters shoehorned into cameo appearances that end up feeling like a reunion party than functioning as an integral part of the plot.  There’s an adage of “no one hates Star Wars more than Star Wars fans” and yet what The Rise of Skywalker does is hand the keys over to a vocal minority by excessively pandering to their satisfaction.  It plays the game of having your cake and eating it too, trying to restore the balance as the franchise has always lived up to.  But in doing so, The Rise of Skywalker not only validates their opinions but sacrifices its own artistic voice where its merits are never earned and its dramatic beats are carelessly rushed through leaving it soulless and hollow.  The euphoria behind Star Wars should never leave you like this, and The Rise of Skywalker was fan service at its worst. I want to vehemently stress that there is nothing wrong with nostalgia and fan service. As mentioned in my article about nostalgia, I talk about how it places itself in a difficult quandary of appeasement. And yet Ryan Coogler’s Creed (for example) has utilised it better than most films would imagine.  In its myriad of options in its conversations about legacy, it offers the audience something that makes every signifying moment worthwhile – substance. In another classic example, it’s something that Netflix’s Stranger Things does so well where our emotional connection to the past is defined by our personal experiences rather than the kids themselves. They’re living in the era, oblivious of its significance and not (as most films do including The Rise of Skywalker) occasionally stop the film to acknowledge it. And as if lessons weren’t learnt from J.J.’s previous experience such as Star Trek Into Darkness, then he understands the architectural mechanisms behind nostalgia but not the reasons why that moment resonates so deeply. And judging by his brand of filmmaking (a trait which I’ve seen far too often) the nostalgia is only used as an effective means to an end, to get from point A to B and nothing more.  It’s fine as a set-up – what The Force Awakens accomplishes manages to restore faith in the aftermath of the prequel trilogy.  But as a conclusion? It deserved something far richer than proposed instead of the persistent return down memory lane that’s continually seeking validation and vindication.  Not even the brilliant John Williams and his score can escape the callbacks to the past. But heartbreakingly so, while the situation can’t be blamed solely on Abrams (returning in a near-impossible situation after the vitriolic backlash from The Last Jedi), but The Rise of Skywalker painfully confirms the lack of planning between the arcs. I’m willing to be controversial in saying Johnson had the most difficult task of the tenure, picking up the pieces from the scattergun approach left after The Force Awakens by contextualising the franchise’s bigger picture. But the unifying statement left in the aftermath by The Rise of Skywalker is the feeling of “it doesn’t matter”, undoing some of the most interesting aspects of the franchise like a damage control exercise that WB utilised after Batman v Superman (which produced Suicide Squad in its aftermath). But it’s most disappointing aspect is the genuine lack of stakes, ambition or risks with its fake-outs and sacrificial undoing which only cheapen the experience.  And as a consequence, it leaves the franchise in an undesirable place, a place defined by the safety of creature comforts, familiarity and convenience that serves only to make the universe smaller again.  Of course, change is a gamble, but judging on this effort, it’s the realisation that the franchise is happy to stick with the status quo and allow for history to repeat itself. And instead of confronting the challenges head-on, it decides to not pick up the baton and finish the marathon. That apt feeling is summed up by Rey (Daisy Ridley), a character who spent the last two films re-defining her identity, a film in which The Last Jedi conveyed lineage was not important in defining who you are, only to be told the opposite.  Some would easily say it’s a technicality, some would say it’s a complete retcon that rolls back on the intentions laid out by Rian Johnson, and some would easily say Abrams was merely fixing a ‘mess’ by giving its audience a direct sequel to The Force Awakens.  But The Rise of Skywalker spends the majority of the film re-emphasising the same point about *who* she is in the context of the franchise. The sad thing about Rey’s ultimate fate is how she already started from a position of power. By being a ‘no-one’, a new succession of force-sensitive Jedis opens the doors to new possibilities. It’s not defined by blood or some royal right or some easily convenient connection within an already convoluted legacy that happens to be problematically tied to that ‘galaxy far far away’. It’s the inspirational takeaway that anyone can be a hero, rising out of nothing in the epic struggle between good and evil. And yet the connection towards lineage with the re-assertion of a major character only asks more questions than answers. There’s an element of Spectre, the 24th Bond film in its deflating reveal, but even if this was the intention all along, to have Rey mythically connect with the previous eight films, then this parental conflict that should have been addressed right from the beginning.  It would have allowed more time with Rey to come to terms with the revelation instead of what the film does repeatedly – have her run to different planets with speed and haste. It would have been in the same pretence at how Brie Larson’s Captain Marvel, for example, was imbued with the same choice after learning her secret.  Captain Marvel is not perfect by any stretch of the imagination (which I actively discuss in my review), but at least it’s an attempt to codify her origins with a choice that bravely moves it forward.  It’s not to say these elements did not feature in The Rise of Skywalker, but its execution is clumsy and rushed, explained through tiresome lines of exposition that expect us to feel a sense of emotional shock at the revelation when its depth is shallow at best. The fact remains, pretty much every character suffers from the film’s choppy and hasty editing and execution.  The Rise of Skywalker is more concerned with getting over the next hurdle, introducing the next clue to get to this mystery rather than spend time with the characters it possesses (or introduces, and trust me there are plenty in its convoluted equation including the return of Lando (Billy Dee Williams) and Keri Russell’s Daft Punk looking Zorri).  And by doing so, it sacrifices what has been the heart and soul of these films – character and growth. Character development is fueled by reactions rather than the choices they’ve made. We get to see Finn (John Boyega) and Poe spend more time together, but even the exchanges feel disjointed and somewhat regressive with most of their bromance moments connected with ‘wouldn’t it be cool?’ moments.  But the most disheartening was Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran) who is shamefully sidelined for what I can only imagine as capitulation and cowardice to an abusive fandom rather giving her character something meaningful to do. I would have preferred The Rise of Skywalker to be the length of Avengers Endgame and The Irishman.  Call it indulgence or being spoiled after 2019 gave us a succession of 3-hour epics.  But if the length was an option to convey some of its story without the feeling of being like a meaningless blur, then it’s a luxury I would have happily endured.  It wouldn’t have solved all of its fundamental and stalemate problems, but it would have been easier to digest. And I get it, endings are HARD and writing one is EXTREMELY HARD. Not even Revenge of the Sith could accomplish it.  I’m not even going to pretend I have the perfect, iron-fisted resolution that neatly ties up a 42-year old saga.  I’m not going to pretend I have a respectable path of utilising General Leia after the tragic death of Carrie (always loved and always missed) Fisher.  And unquestionably, I’m not going to pretend I have a dignified approach to unite an already divided fandom that has been long bickering about the franchise since the release of The Empire Strikes Back.  For every generation, Star Wars has meant something different to someone.  In essence, loving Star Wars can be a religion – George Lucas (our creator in saviour) gave us this world and each of us has taken what we believe is the “best part”, consuming canonical or non-canonical books, media, video games and pretty much anything we fans can get our hands on, shaping our perspective on the franchise. Our introduction has no universal or centralised means of entry (in comparison to how we all started getting into the Marvel Cinematic Universe, for example, with Iron Man). But based on that reality, it is something that cannot be appeased, no matter how good its intentions are, and the film caves into that idea by believing it can. Throughout popular culture, even something as prestigious as Game of Thrones struggled with it earlier this year.   The X-Files during its two-season return struggled, trying to balance out the mythology of the past with the context of the present within a short span of episodes (which was not enough). Heck, (in another context) even Star Trek Discovery bowed down to familiarity of its past, fake-out deaths and introduced the worst storyline concept for season 2 – time crystals (the less said, the better).  But again, returning to the basic plots of filmmaking, as an isolated, standalone film, it’s the sheer lack of creativity and ambition that severely hurts its wasted potential.  It is as jarring as the recent addition of ‘Maclunky’ in the new versions of A New Hope on Disney+ for an already contentious scene.  And in its desperate attempt to win everyone over, you end up watching a film that’s having a constant argument with itself, settling on a marked, checklist of requirements and targets to include as if decided by a committee. I don’t necessarily believe J.J. Abrams is a bad director. The fun he manages to encapsulate is above the qualities of the prequel trilogy. Some of the best moments come as visual statements such as Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) and Rey having a force projection conversation as the camera swap between their thoughts and location.  As The Return of the Jedi in the franchise, the re-balance of the force was inevitable. It’s simplistic storytelling if somewhat predictable.  But in the immortal words of Yoda with his masterful quote of “we are what we grow beyond”, that piece of advice wasn’t adhered to.  It’s a film that’s big on spectacle but leaves nothing for audiences to take away from. Does this film derail my love of the franchise? No. For over 30 years of my life, these stories have defined me from the mythology to pure, escapist, unadulterated entertainment, regardless of whether anyone thinks “it’s just a kids movie about space wizards”.  And on the contrary, I’m still looking forward to the new trilogy, a trilogy not defined by the legacy of the past, but something that explores the universe instead of relying on bloodlines, dynasties and “keeping everything in the family”. There is no sense of enjoyment or pleasure if the same storylines are endlessly re-hashed and re-purposed when the possibilities are endless.  All it takes is a little imagination and creativity, which The Rise of Skywalker openly rejects. If you enjoyed The Rise of Skywalker for what it is, then all power to you.  Your happiness should never be defined by what others say, including myself, who is happy to be in the minority with my opinions.  But like all legacies, time will be its ultimate decider, and whether we return to The Rise of Skywalker with the same energetic verve as previous films will be a fascinating (and hopefully civil) debate for years to come.  But ultimately, it’s a film that tried too hard and ends up utilising every kitchen sink trick to make this film whole. But in my humblest opinion, it is by far the weakest out of the new trilogy, and what should have been a triumphant end to the saga, The Rise of Skywalker just ends in bitter disappointment. I actually loved both this movie and The Last Jedi, but I also love hearing alternate takes! I’m always fascinated by how these movies impact us all differently. I’m glad you enjoyed it. As mentioned, all power to you, but I thought it was let down that made way too many convenient choices and topped it up with massive doses of fan service which is not a great way to make a movie. This is not just a TROS problem, this is something that has been evident for a long time with JJ and this film IMO showed up his weakness as a director. He’s great at ideas, but the execution or concluding them just has no value. He just doesn’t know how to end it. I enjoyed Rise of Skywalker. The duel between Kylo Ren and Rey was action packed for sure. Yet, I reluctantly agree with this review. It did leave out a lot of answers us Star Wars fans so desperately need. Heck, if it wasn’t for the toxic fanboys berating Rian Johnson for supposedly “ruining” the franchise and Carrie Fisher’s passing, Disney could have made Star Wars great again. I guess some things are only great once. If there were to be a series where Rey revives the Jedi Order, that’s the least Disney owes us. Or would the “High Republic” fit that category?"
"Jul 4, 2020",negative,So much thrown at you with so little character reaction that it feels more like fanfiction.
"Jun 27, 2020",positive," A year after the devastating Battle of Crait, the Rebels have been rebuilding and trying to decide their next move. Under Leia's tutelage, Rey (Daisy Ridley) has been busy training to hone her Jedi skills. Meanwhile, Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) has been on his own quest: To find the Sith planet of Exegol. What he finds there sets him on a new, much more sinister path. Word gets back to the Rebels of Kylo's discovery, and Rey, Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), Finn (John Boyega), Chewbacca, BB-8 and C-3PO journey to find their own way to Exegol and stop what has been unleashed. It's an odyssey that will test them all, especially Rey, who will learn who she really is as a Jedi…and a person. The Rise of Skywalker does a fantastic job of wrapping up this branch of one of the most popular and influential franchises in the history of entertainment. It is exciting, action-packed, visually impressive, lightly humorous and poignantly emotional. In short: Everything you hope a Star Wars film would be. Sitting back down in the director's chair is J.J. Abrams. He has the rather daunting undertaking of pulling together all of the threads both he and Rian Johnson have laid out over two films. Not an easy task, because they, along with George Lucas through his previous involvement, have been weaving a very detailed tapestry. Yet, amazingly, Abrams completes the task with flying colors. He has developed a rather simpler script, compared to the complexities Johnson delivered in his universe-expanding entry. There's a very straight-forward goal, and everything moves toward it. As he did with The Force Awakens, Abrams borrows bits and pieces from A New Hope. Not nearly as much this go-around, but you'll recognize them when they occur. He also, as he did a few times before, plays on our nostalgia. Through clever moments and audio/visual cues, he pays off our dedicated fandom with scenes that tug at the heartstrings and fog up the eyes. Of course, as The Last Jedi proved, not everyone is going to be satisfied. You know what? That's OK. That's the danger when creating something within a universe with a highly zealous fanbase. Many different people have many different connections to this material, and they have many different ideas on how the story should go. I myself have a very deep connection to this saga. I was three-years-old in the summer of 1977, and Star Wars is the first movie I remember seeing in theaters. I have a wonderful family memory about going to the first show opening day of Empire. I can distinctly remember the feeling of tapping the action figure packages aside to see if there was one toward the back of a row that I needed. Suffice it to say, with many more memories such as these, this franchise means a great deal to me. I've mentioned before in reviews that my first question walking out of an auditorium is, ""Was I entertained?"" No matter the style or genre, the purpose of film is entertainment. Was I entertained by The Force Awakens? Yes. Was I entertained by The Last Jedi? Yes. The same holds true for The Rise of Skywalker, too. So, if someone like me, someone whose entire life has been influenced in some part by Lucas' creation, was genuinely entertained by this film and honestly satisfied by its outcome, then what else do you need?

"Jun 17, 2020",neutral,"It's like J.J. Abrams missed the day of scriptwriting school when they taught 'show, don't tell.'"
"Jun 10, 2020",negative," And so we return one final time to the Skywalker family. After Star Wars Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker, we are told, there will be no more stories told about the spawn of Darth Vader and their various friends, spawn, and acolytes. With this, I officially lose interest in the Star Wars franchise; even back in 1983, when I thought Star Wars was over, I couldn’t find any hunger for the comics or the “expanded universe” novels or any of the other things Lucasfilm devised to keep the brand a going concern until George Lucas revisited the saga sixteen years later. So the multimedia Joseph Campbell rewrite will have to chug along without me.  This last go-round neither disappointed nor thrilled me; it just exists. There’s always something going on, and that’s part of the problem: there’s never not something going on, no pause for breath, no beauty or poetry. We ain’t got time for that now. The Final Order, a bunch of bad guys led by the Big Bad Guy, the resurgent Emperor Palpatine, plans to subjugate or destroy every planet everywhere. The Good Guys leap to the rescue — identity-crisis Jedi in training Rey (Daisy Ridley), rash pilot Poe (Oscar Isaac), former stormtrooper Finn (John Boyega). Meanwhile, good-bad guy Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) wants to save Rey from Palpatine. His deal is as tangled as ever.   Some thematic relevance could be teased out of the previous entries, The Force Awakens (2015) and The Last Jedi (2017). The latter, which I consider the best of the new trilogy, dripped some poison into the ears of the faithful. Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), like Achilles, renounced the heroic code; he literally tossed his lightsaber over his shoulder in disgust. Well, we’ll have none of that now, not with non-entity J.J. Abrams (who made the first of the sequel trilogy) at the helm. Abrams’ insight seems to be that the fans want endless lightsaber duels and shoot-outs and spacecraft looping around. Some of the action has a shoot-the-works electricity, but the special effects are as hectic, busy, and essentially insecure as anything in Lucas’ prequel trilogy. Abrams strains so hard not to lose our attention that, through sheer narrative vehemence, he loses it anyway.  There are some pleasures. I felt it would be churlish to try to make out the seams in Carrie Fisher’s performance — cobbled together from unused footage — as General Leia. I was grateful for however much the moviemakers could give me of her. Billy Dee Williams, as the returning Lando Calrissian, comes through with a suave turn that helps to remind us that acting was once possible in these things. (Adam Driver just about sprains himself trying to make something real out of Kylo Ren’s nightmares of conscience, but he did better under the tutelage of Rian Johnson, a real director, on The Last Jedi.) The young trinity of new stars sprint this way and that, hopping from world to world, in search of a McGuffin called “the wayfinder” that will lead them to the lair of Palpatine. This dark emperor is as boringly eeeeeevil as ever, and his connection to one of the heroes feels underdone, as if Abrams and his writers were wincing and hoping the parallels to a similar revelation in The Empire Strikes Back wouldn’t strike us as too blatant.  We’re frequently reminded of the stakes — this needs to happen or the bad guys will be very bad and everyone will die — yet the demands of fantasy on this budgetary level guarantee there are no real stakes. People die but come back one way or another; the total outcome is never in doubt. Here and there, a bit of business tugs at the old nostalgic feelings or packs a sidewise punch: Daisy Ridley’s teardrop falling on Carrie Fisher’s (or a double’s) shoulder; a droid, cowed by past abuse, who declines a human’s touch with a prim but slightly panicked “No, thank you.” Even old Luke returns as a force ghost, reassuring Rey and us that he was wrong and it’s important for good to stand up to evil. That point is made here in the most generic of ways; it doesn’t risk resonating with the world we live in, which even Lucas’ goofball prequels at least tried to do. That much-derided “deathstick” bit in Attack of the Clones, for instance, at least tried to engage with human frailty outside the franchise, albeit in a laughable dad way. Nothing like that here."
"Apr 15, 2020",negative," It truly was a long time ago and a galaxy far, far away when ‘Star Wars’ was seen as not much more than a risky venture doomed to box office failure. But, in 1977, Fox executives thought just that. Director George Lucas, seen as someone who was rebelling against the traditional modes of Hollywood film-making, had made a homage to the cheap and cheerful ‘Flash Gordon’ serials with an overwrought space opera that would surely be laughing. The only people laughing would be Lucas and his accountants as ‘Star Wars’ caught the public imagination and the films and its two sequels became the biggest hits of the early 80s. By the time of the ‘Prequel Trilogy’ in 1999, Lucas was no longer a Hollywood rebel. He was a member of the establishment, the head of a franchise that had made a huge impact on popular culture and had spawned numerous ancillary products such as cartoon shows, books, video games and much more. The prequel trilogy would often be critically derided but were still huge money-makers and solidified ‘Star Wars’ status as one of the dominant franchises in cinema. By the time the ‘final’ sequel trilogy rolled around, circumstances had changed again. Lucas was shut out, having sold up to Disney. He often complaining that Disney were no longer taking on board any of his ideas, in the manner a divorced dad frustrated he has no say in how his child does their homework. ‘Star Wars’ was now the property of perhaps the biggest media conglomerate in the world and now, alongside Marvel, the symbol of dominance within not only Hollywood cinema but also within mainstream pop culture. ‘Star Wars Episode IX – The Rise Of Skywalker’ is ostensibly meant to represent an end to the narrative that Lucas began in 1977. Yet, whilst it is undoubtedly a farewell to the plots and characters introduced all those years ago, the film is also a reflection of the modern film industry that it has helped to create with all the excess and disregard for individual artistic expression that one has come to associate with the modern era. The end result is less a film and more a series of moments strung together to please a cabal of corporate overlords. The warning signs are apparent from the very first few seconds in the film’s opening crawl, the now de rigeur block of text that allows the film to begin ‘in media res’. ‘The Dead Live!!!’ it proclaims with such a disregard for any sort of semblance of credibility that it so resembles a Donald Trump tweet that you half-expect it to finish with an epithet of ‘sad’. Instead it and the following five minute opening of the film are a massive dump of exposition that reveals that Emperor Palpatine is alive and is back to terrorise the galaxy and is now asking Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) to find Rey (Daisy Ridley) and kill her. There’s been no narrative seeding throughout the previous two films that have prepared for this moment, no hints that his character survived, the fact of which also undermines much of the ending of ‘Return Of The Jedi’. With a hand-waving moment in which various bits about cloning and ‘dark magic’ are uttered, the ultimate reason he’s brought back is, well, ‘because’. It’s not the last time in the film where you can swear you hear the incessant interference of executives humming throughout the background. ‘He’s a recognisable character – let’s bring him back. Doesn’t matter why. Fans know who he is.’ There’s a constant need to satiate an audience with nostalgia, such as the appearance of Billy Dee Williams as original trilogy character Lando Calrissian in another move that seems to amount to a shoulder shrug of ‘why not?’ and flashy visual effects than make any attempt to create something narratively cohesive. Indeed, much of the movie can be boiled down to a series of tedious exposition moments and then sending the characters to search for a MacGuffin which seems nothing more than a reason to keep the screen time up and give the characters something to do until the inevitable climax. Indeed, one of the major points of the movie is the quest for the ‘Wayfinder’, basically a magic compass that will allow them to find the Emperor. After much flitting around the galaxy and through the ruins of the Death Star, in another moment that screams ‘…look, nostalgic moment! Now stop thinking anything critical…’, it’s destroyed. Luckily, Rey finds another one in about five minutes rendering the previous hour pretty much pointless. The film’s lazy trading on nostalgia bleeds into the constant threat of killing of some of the known characters. It never does, it would be a much more interesting film if it did, and just gives an air of cheap emotion. Chewbacca is seemingly blown up, and brought back within two minutes. C-3P0 is given a moment of sacrifice which is immediately played for laughs and then reversed a little while later. Princess Leia’s demise is handled as well as it could be considering Carrie Fisher’s sad death in 2016. But even the scenes in which she appears, filmed some years previously, are awkwardly edited and her final moments are more shaped by the tragedy of real life than any attempt to make it work on a narrative level. The film so desperately wants to be a conclusion and to have some sort of closure. But we know that there’ll be a world of spin-offs and stories to be continued in cinema, on TV and in a litany of other media. So the film ends up in a sort of limbo land where there is no sense of consequence or meaning. Everything has to happen so the rest of the ‘Star Wars’ universe can continue to happen as well. You can bet a moment in which the protagonists meet a group of Stormtrooper deserters, which again is thrown away in a few lines, is being developed as a future film/TV show/video game/comic as we speak. There is no time to explore or reflect. Let’s just move on. With any form of narrative consequence effectively neutered, the characters are given nowhere to really go. While Kylo Ren (actor Adam Driver) and Rey (actress Daisy Ridley’ are given something of a character arc, mainly thanks to the first two films in the trilogy, their performances are still rather one note. Ridley is stoic to the point of being dislikeable while Driver’s conflicted villain still drifts towards the realm of ‘idiot manbaby’ though his ability as an actor just about stops it from tipping over the edge. Everyone else is given little to work with. Oscar Isaac’s Poe Dameron just jumps around being roguish, John Boyega’s Finn is given little to do apart from look troubled while Rose Tico (actress Kelly Marie Tran), one of the more interesting characters from the previous instalment, is given around one minute’s worth of screen time. The irony is that on a technical level, JJ Abrams has a steady hand when it comes to catering for the needs of a blockbuster and when it comes to all the requisite whizzes and bangs, the film delivers on a visceral level. From the fleet of world-killing star destroyers to the final battle, which includes space horses, on one level a homage to the elements of the western including in the original film and, on another, almost a satirical bone thrown to the constant need to ‘one up’ previous instalments, it all delivers. But everything that hangs around is so threadbare, so unsatisfying that it feels hollow. Laurence Boyce is a film journalist who likes Bond, Batman and Doctor Who (just to prove the things he enjoys things that don't just start with a 'B'). He is also a film programmer for various film festivals in the UK and abroad. It’s too bad you can’t enjoy a great movie because of your need to have everything be logical. I believe in the importance of everything being logical in the real world such as politics (logical and truth being the opposite of Trump). But in a movie I just want to suspend belief and just enjoy the fantasy. I loved seeing all the dead come beach to life. And yes, I often similed and thought “what the fuc”, but it was so much fun that logic be damned. I not a Star Wars fanatic and I loved some of the previous Star Wars movies and was disappointed but still enjoyed others. But I was wowed but Rise of Skywalker and thought it was the best movie I’ve see in a long time. I hope your bad review won’t keep anyone who enjoys fantasy SI FI from watching this movie. I had low expectations and put off watching Rise for a while and was surprised at what a great way to end a great story. Absolutely loved it.

"Feb 24, 2020",negative," Whether you’re standing in the theater lobby or curled up in bed, deciding what to watch next is often the most difficult part of any pop-culture junkie’s day. And with dozens of films in theaters on any given weekend, plus virtually endless layers of streaming purgatory to sort through in search of your next binge-watch, there’s more out there—and tougher decisions to make—than ever. Fortune’s here to help you navigate the week’s latest offerings, boiling all the entertainment out there down into three distinct recommendations: should you see it, stream it, or skip it? Find out below. What you have to understand about Cats is that it’s certifiably insane, from its Jellicle whiskers to the tip of its Jellice tail. I’m referring here to the beloved Andrew Lloyd Webber stage musical, one of Broadway’s longest-running, as much as Tom Hooper’s gleefully demented movie adaptation. From day one, Cats has been one of the strangest megahits in any storytelling medium; it’s necessary to know this, and accept this, before reading any further.  Describing the plot of Cats makes you feel like you’re on bath salts (though not as much as does seeing it play out on screen), but the broad strokes are essentially this. Over the course of one night in an unnamed, eerily empty neighborhood, a group of cats take turns introducing one another—with names like Rum Tum Tugger and Mr. Mistoffeelees—as they debate which one of them will get to die, ascending to another plane of existence known as the Heaviside Layer, where they’ll be reborn into a new life. As a story, it’s pure fever dream, the kind of thing even Roald Dahl’s editor wouldn’t have let him get away with; but the strange non-plot of Cats functions, in a theatrical setting, as an ideal delivery system for visual splendor and powerhouse vocals. Hooper’s tackled musicals before, notably in 2012’s Les Miserables, where he spent 158 minutes on extreme close-ups of France’s most impoverished, and he fully throws himself into the task of translating Cats, a much more experimental piece of work, to the screen. There’s a newly created audience surrogate, Victoria (newcomer Francesca Hayward), who’s tossed via burlap sack into the neighborhood of the Jellicles, a tribe of cats on the eve of making their “Jellicle choice.” Across the sung-through story, she meets a mewling menagerie of contenders for said choice, including bumbling Jennyanydots (Rebel Wilson), stately Gus the Theatre Cat (Ian McKellen), and portly Bustopher Jones (James Corden), plus the aforementioned Mistoffeelees (a gawky Laurie Davidson), and Rum Tum Tugger (Jason Derulo, who sings and simpers gamely but seems to be missing a little something). Presiding over all is Old Deuteronomy (Judi Dench and, no, I don’t know who named these cats), who’ll enjoy the festivities then select the lucky (?) feline in question.  The real draw of Cats involves seeing the all-star cast, which also includes pop sovereign Taylor Swift and vocal legend Jennifer Hudson (who gets to belt out “Memory,” the production’s lone showstopper), made over with the help of CG effects, called “digital fur technology” (though it’s basically just expensive deepfakery), into cat-human hybrids. The effect is deeply upsetting; though the actors are covered in fur and sporting twitchy tails, their proportions are still human, so the actors appear discomfitingly sensual while dancing and serenading one another. They have cat ears, but also human teeth; whiskers, but also fingernails. Some wear jumpsuits, while others go for a more paw-naturel look; the movie directs attention to the strange sense of faux-nudity that results by having Idris Elba’s villainous Macavity wear a hat and fur coat (which begs questions we shouldn’t dare to ask) but later make a surprise scene entrance after disrobing, to which the other cats react with a fairly hypocritical degree of horror.  In watching this digital fur extravaganza at work, entranced by the sheer scale of its visual chaos, I found myself wondering what else Hooper and his team could have done. The tactic most employed by Disney, the imperial overlord Universal’s bravely going up against with this freaky little musical (note this week’s skip it), has been to pursue photorealism in its animated productions. Earlier this year, it turned The Lion King into an uncanny-valley catastrophe, sapping the story of all emotional and dramatic resonance in the process. People simply did not want to hear human voices coming out of the mouths of Planet Earth lions, which is very understandable. Hooper’s techniques with Cats, through which his furry creations sing and dance maniacally into their versions of heaven or hell, bring the whole affair closer to Gaspar Noe’s Climax by way of The Aristocats. While Cats is by no means going to be a guaranteed hit with the little ones, who may be terrified by it or confused by its sexuality, it’s an absolutely unhinged piece of blockbuster filmmaking, worth beholding in all its tawdry, queer, bombastic glory.  It’s the kind of risk studios just don’t take any more, perhaps much more of one than executives ever intended it to be. The film cost some $100 million to pull off, and the amount of uncertainty Cats brings with it into the multiplex—did those oh-my-god-they-actually-did-it trailers turn people off, or the opposite?—makes it the most exciting box-office curiosity left in the calendar year. Will it break records or bomb? The experience of watching Cats—howls of stunned laughter from many, with a few Swifties cheering her grand entrance and the majority of us struggling to even once pick our jaws up off the floor—is one of the most strange and mind-melting you’re likely to have in a theater when it comes to studio content of this size and scope. I’d recommend going for much for the same reason the play’s stuck around so long—whether it’s a masterpiece or one of the worst things you’ve ever seen, it’s resolutely its own thing, a deranged freak-fantasia worth falling into for a couple of hours, if just to say you did. That is to say, it’s Cats. Netflix’s latest original-series gamble is aiming for Game of Thrones-level complexity in its sketching of a dark-fantasy realm where mythical creatures lie in wait but monarchal power struggles loom just as large.  And based on its first season, The Witcher (adapted from the beloved book series by Polish writer Andrzej Sapkowski) is well on its way. Comprising eight episodes, a smaller number which clearly allowed showrunner Lauren Schmidt Hissrich to focus on thoughtfully tracing an ambitious array of story arcs, the series hangs around the impossibly broad shoulders of Geralt of Rivia (Henry Cavill, great at veining these strong-and-silent types with a gallows humor).  Further detailing the epic, sweeping nature of The Witcher‘s story would be to deprive audiences of unexpected, rather graceful reveals that the scripts tease out in due time. What there is to say about The Witcher is that it represents one of Netflix’s most fully formed forays into genre territory yet. The fights, especially in a cinematic and sprawling pilot, are of a kinetic and impressively top-shelf variety, Cavill’s Geralt moving like a man possessed as he rends flesh from bone and engages in some surprisingly balletic bouts of swordplay. And the production design is similarly well-executed, quickly establishing the Continent as a grungy, bloody landscape for these characters to navigate. But it’s the strength of the storytelling that bodes most well for The Witcher as a new destination for those done licking their wounds after that fateful final run in Westeros.  “If this mission fails, it was all for nothing,” characters tell one another throughout Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker. That’s popcorn-prose concentrate, the kind of dramatic hyperbole that Star Wars has been coasting on since the very beginning. And while it’s traditionally been a fake-out—there’s always another mission, another battle to be won, even after ones that end with your hero encased in carbonite—such sentiment has never felt as profoundly hollowed out as it does by the end of Rise of Skywalker, a graceless franchise finale about nothing more than missions succeeding that itself feels like a staggering failure of vision, conceptually as well as on basic storytelling fronts. Director J.J. Abrams’ anxiety in making Rise of Skywalker surely fell along those same all-or-nothing lines. By his own admission, he’s bad at endings, and there was tremendous pressure riding on Abrams to bring home the story of the Skywalker clan, a nine-movie saga that’s never loomed larger in the pop cultural imagination. The Rise of Skywalker may well be the last Star Wars movie to feature the heroes Abrams helped forge in his nostalgic The Force Awakens—Rey (Daisy Ridley), Finn (John Boyega), and Poe (Oscar Isaac)—and it’s almost certain to be the final outing for original cast members the series is now starting to outlive. Carrie Fisher died after shooting her scenes for The Last Jedi, and this entry (once intended to be Leia’s movie in the sense that The Force Awakens was Han’s and The Last Jedi was Luke’s) is to be her last screen credit. This just makes the magnitude of Abrams’s failure all the more devastating. One last adventure? Hardly. In a pivotal entry for the franchise, he chooses not to tell a story, instead drowning the developments this trilogy’s second film put forward in a soupy mess of fan service and stilted, unoriginal plotting. When The Last Jedi hit theaters two years ago, it offered a thematic depth hitherto unseen in Star Wars movies; in the hands of writer-director Rian Johnson, it tangled head-on with questions of hero worship and inheritance that have always been intrinsic to the galaxy far, far away. But the answers it provided—that one must relinquish the past to chart a future, that our heroes will disappoint us, that the Force is not the lineage of a select but a spiritual energy belonging to all of us—were bold and unexpected. In this, it was a shocking follow-up to The Force Awakens, Abrams’ play-the-hits remake of A New Hope, and ruffled feathers with a small but loud contingent of fans, who disliked the film’s treatment of Luke and focus on supporting characters (the most hated of whom, perhaps not coincidentally given the way these Internet mobs tend to go, were women and minorities).  This is worth mentioning because The Rise of Skywalker feels, more than a film, like a feature-length capitulation to those who disliked what The Last Jedi did with the Star Wars mythos (which was, at the end of the day, to make a real movie with it). Where The Last Jedi zagged, Rise of Skywalker zigs, choppily, back inside the pre-existing template to which Disney and Lucasfilm clearly now believes these movies must adhere. It is in fact comical how frantically it rushes to undo Johnson’s progression of these characters, crowding them unnaturally into the same space to combat criticisms everyone spent too much time apart in the last film and entirely sidelining Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran, the series’ first Asian-American lead who was brutally harassed online after The Last Jedi) with so little explanation it feels just as racist and sexist as the chatroom vitriol she was subjected to. The Rise of Skywalker also works overtime to retcon The Last Jedi‘s biggest twists. One deformed bad guy with Force powers is down for the count? Let’s introduce another. The question of Rey’s parentage got answered, unexpectedly, with the revelation her family name didn’t have to matter so much? Well, let’s revisit that actually. That’s truly the order of business in The Rise of Skywalker. It’s a movie slavishly devoted to hitting beats from previous films without basic narrative sense, to the point where it feels less like a natural ending to this franchise and more like bad fanfiction. The only way the characters progress is through ill-advised romantic pairings. One interminable (and ultimately pointless) lightsaber battle takes place amid in the wreckage of a destroyed Death Star. The finale involves outgunned resistance fighters making one last stand to blow up a massive bad-guy space base. Beloved characters are imperiled constantly, but there are no real stakes when even the already-dead ones are back for sizable roles. Familiar desert planets pop up, along with Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams), for maximum fan pandering. There’s a real difference between a director and an artist, and nothing demonstrates this better than the massive step down The Rise of Skywalker takes both thematically and visually after The Last Jedi. There’s little by way of distinctive or striking visuals; the entire film is hued a murky blue, with an ill-advised focus on strobe lighting. Furthermore, it’s a Star Wars movie with absolutely nothing under its surface, which is a damning trait for a movie in this franchise. Abrams is a great producer, but his weaknesses as a filmmaker have never been this exposed. In attempting to give a noxious portion of the Star Wars fanbase what they asked for, his finale feels like a cheap and derivative product, the ultimate end-result of Disney’s written-by-committee modus operandi, so craven about resurrecting Star Wars that it comes off like grave-robbing. This is Star Wars broken under the weight of its own importance, eating its own tail for lack of any original voices to better nourish it. It’s nothing short of a tragedy. —Why these high-profile book adaptations bombed at the box office in 2019—’Tis the season for holiday movies—and Hallmark and Lifetime aren’t afraid of Netflix—Whistleblower cinema is back in a big way—How some artists are building their careers through Spotify playlists—As 2019 draws to a close, does the movie star still have a pulse?Follow Fortune on Flipboard to stay up-to-date on the latest news and analysis. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

          interview. Every Playboy Playmate. Since 1953.
 In a deliciously escapist photo essay, famed journalist Bill Zehme guides PLAYBOY readers on an exclusive tour of the Playboy Mansion. Among his discoveries: pajama parties, peacocks (yes, the Mansion was home to a private zoo) and many a Playmate. Part home, part office and part year-round party venue, the fabled landmark comes to life for readers through behind-the-scenes photos, private scrapbooks and anecdotes from Mansion regulars. In 1966, Playboy’s December 1964 Playmate and 1965 Playmate of the Year, aptly nicknamed G.I. Jo, delivered a lifetime subscription of PLAYBOY magazine to the front lines in South Vietnam. Thanks to special government clearance, Collins delivered the magazine, and a much needed morale boost, to the officers of Company B, who had specifically requested her attendance in a letter to the PLAYBOY Editors. In January of 1969 PLAYBOY published a piece that would come to stand the test of time: Martin Luther King, Jr.’s essay A Testament of Hope, the civil rights leader’s final published statement prior to his murder in the spring of 1968. The urgent missive has since become one of the world’s most powerful writings on nonviolence, policy, Black nationalism and humanity itself. In 1981, on the heels of her appearance in the pages of PLAYBOY to celebrate her role as a Bond girl in For Your Eyes Only, fashion model Caroline “Tula” Cossey was outed as a transgender woman by the tabloids. Nearly a decade later, Tula returned to PLAYBOY to share her story–on her terms–and to pose for another pictorial, marking the first solo pictorial for an openly transgender woman in PLAYBOY. In the early 1970s, PLAYBOY asked surrealist genius Salvador Dalí to conceptualize his erotic fantasies, then dispatched staff photographer Pompeo Posar to the small Spanish village of Cadaqués to help the artist realize them. Featuring an unexpected medley of oversized eggs, ancient architecture, and a bevy of nude models, the outrageous mise-en-scène is perhaps one of the strangest, yet most delightful, pictorials in Playboy history.  From grope suits to spanking etiquette, our sex-positive advice column has been satisfying curious readers on matters of the heart, the body and the bedroom for generations.

"Feb 1, 2020",positive,"This film is a satisfying conclusion. And so, faithful film fans, enjoy this last installment of the Star Wars films as we have known them."
"Jan 20, 2020",negative," So I’m a little late with this review, it’s been really hard to find the time, but with copious amounts of notes from the night I watched it combined with a couple of weeks to let everything settle means this will probably be a bit more calm and gathered than my immediately post-cinema review of Episode VIII from two years ago. Episode IX was, well, exactly what I feared: more JJ Abrams sticking far too rigidly to the original trilogy. It wasn’t without good moments, but it wasn’t a great follow up to the interesting ground work done beforehand… let’s take a closer look! The core trio of Rey (Daisy Ridley), Finn (John Boyega) and Poe (Oscar Isaac) are now a fully-fledged friend group, and all play off of each other well. An exchange where Poe is outed as a former Spice Runner, only for him to point out that he’s talking to a former Storm  Trooper and an ex-scavenger made me laugh, and generally they have great chemistry, which is good because they’re joined at the hip for most of the film. C3P0 (Anthony Daniels) is also with them for a lot of this, and for the first time since Empire, is actually really funny, with everyone generally ignoring him and treating him like crap. Sounds harsh, but it works! Then C3P0 has his memory wiped in order for everyone to access information to the Emperor’s whereabouts and that also leads to a lot of funny lines. He gets his memory restored later in the film, which is a bit of a cop out, but fine. Nothing major. The other standout is once again Adam Driver’s Supreme Leader Kylo Ren / Ben Solo. Ignoring that all his character development of becoming his own man and freeing himself of the past being abandoned by having him immediately serve under the Emperor and reforge his Darth Vader-like helmet, he has some great scenes. In particular the big fight with Rey, where he is wounded but healed by the young Jedi after he was distracted by hearing his mother’s voice, leading to a hallucination conversation with his father, revealing that he never quite got over killing him. Kylo Ren finally discards his dark self and becomes Ben Solo, and at the end even has some light-hearted moments as he takes out his former allies and helps Rey. While I didn’t like the idea of bringing him back, and it certainly seems like it was solely because Mr. Abrams didn’t know how to finish a Star Wars story without a dark overlord character, Ian McDiarmid was undeniably still great fun as the over-the-top scenery-chewing Emperor. The utter over-evilness of some of his scenes did put a smile on my face, even if in the back of my mind I was wondering if they’d ever actually bother to explain how he came back to life (they didn’t…) Other characters, like Poe’s old friend in a cool helmet Zorii Bliss (Keri Russell) and the returning Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams) fill out a really fun cast. As for moments? Well, there are some good teases here and there. On Tatooine-like-planet #400, Rey and Kylo both try and pull an escaping ship, which ends up with Rey exhibiting Force Lightning, which was a good moment, and the aforementioned final fight between Rey and Ren on the ruins of the Death Star II was also good. During the final fight between Rey and Kylo against the Emperor there is a moment where all hope seems lost before Lando arrives with a large armada of rebel vessels, which was a very cool moment and well scored to make it feel like a real triumphant moment. So close to release there were no good shots of the Emperor, so this’ll have to do. He’s sitting in the chair to the left, honest! The rebels are assaulting a group of weapons that can destroy planets, but need to wait for a ground team to destroy a radar before they can destroy them. During this time our lead protagonist is facing off with the Emperor, but is losing and is being told to join the Dark Side as the only way to save her allies in the space battle. Soon the ground team is successful and the rebels begin taking down the weapons as the Emperor is eventually killed thanks to the help of our protagonist’s former enemy, who although he ends up dead, is redeemed for his evil deeds in death. The weapons destroyed and the Emperor defeated, loads of planets around the galaxy celebrate. Replace “weapons” with “weapon” and “her allies” with “his allies” and that’s a description of the end to Return of the Jedi. I mean bringing back the Emperor and undoing Kylo’s character development was one thing, but JJ really couldn’t come up with something even slightly new for an ending? Speaking of undoing development, it’s revealed that Rey is actually, somehow, Emperor Palpatine’s granddaughter, and Kylo’s revelation of Rey being a nobody from Episode VIII was still true because “her parent’s pretended to be nobodies to protect her”. So the refreshing “you don’t have to come from one of the previous families to be special” message was erased and replaced with “things tied to the original trilogy are cool.” Great. At the last moments of the film Rey adopts the surname Skywalker, so even that name isn’t gone, the “end of the Skywalker saga” could well still result in Skywalkers in future films (even if they won’t be related by blood to Luke, Anakin et al.) Speaking of Chewbacca, the final scene included him receiving a medal like the one he infamously didn’t receive at the end of the first movie, and while that got a chuckle out of me, it also immediately pulled me out of the film. Why would Leia wait until she was dead to give it to him? She wouldn’t, and in fact in the expanded media she didn’t. It was written to pop long-time fans without a single thought as to whether it would make sense or not, which is the wrong way to do “fanwank”… much like most of this film. Lastly, The Emperor reveals a massive armada of Star Destroyers, all manned with people loyal to him and the ways of the Sith, multiplying the First Order by thousands-fold, and still JJ Abrams had to add in that the new fleet are armed with planet-destroying super-weapons. Come on! The massive new fleet of ships and hundreds and thousands of new troops was threat enough, there was no need to add in a scene where one of these new Star Destroyers wipe out a planet. I went to a BJ’s right afterwards. The meal was disappointingly mediocre, just like the movie. That said, I did like the scene where Harrison Ford cameos. It was a genuine surprise, and quite moving."
"Jan 19, 2020",negative," For this week’s main podcast review, I am joined by Sara Clements, Daniel Howat and guest Ryan McQuade (“InSession Film” & “Awards Circuit“) to discuss the final entry in the much-beloved, cherished and fiercely debated Skywalker Saga: “Star Wars: The Rise Of Skywalker.” We talk about our expectations heading into the movie, how it concludes the entire saga, the technical achievements, the fan outrage it has already caused, what we believe worked and what we believe didn’t. We discuss it all in this spoiler-free podcast review with a spoiler section starting at around 56 minutes where we go even deeper into the film’s much talked about storytelling decisions. There’s a lot to talk about so feel free to take a listen! Thank you so much for listening.

"Jan 16, 2020",negative," In the ninth installment of the Star Wars saga, The Rise of Skywalker, Rey, the most recent hero, and Kylo Ren, who is both Rey’s nemesis and soul mate, transfer lightsabers in a crucial battle. Many small moments throughout the film have paved the way, materially and spiritually, for this sleight of hand, and when it happens it is both obvious and breathtaking. It is an exhilarating vision of what could have been in an alternate universe. For a moment, we see that this moment of alliance is not the result of bloodlines and superior genetics, or of there being born heroes and born villains, but the product of subtle, free human choices. For a moment, the film appears to see beyond the tired tropes and family dramas it has so relentlessly pursued. The moment doesn’t last. The Rise of Skywalker picks up where The Last Jedi left off: Kylo Ren, son of Leia and Han Solo, nephew of Luke Skywalker, and grandson of Anakin Skywalker/Darth Vader, has killed his way to the position of Supreme Leader of the imperial First Order. Rey, who shares a mysterious bond with Kylo that allows them to communicate across time and space, is trying to complete her Jedi training and race Kylo to the hidden planet of the Sith. As in all Star Wars movies, a small band of poorly resourced resistance fighters tries to defeat the imperial power against crushing odds and threats of impossible weapons. As Rey and her comrades zip across the galaxy, they meet new allies and many, many old characters, who show up for final goodbyes. They outwit foes, attempt daring rescues, and face near-certain destruction with witty dialogue and sincere camaraderie. They are a compelling band of friends with whom to face the end of the world. But the real focus of the movie is the relationship between Rey and Kylo. This article is available to Christian Century magazine subscribers only.

"Jan 13, 2020",positive," So here we are, 42 years and nine films into the official Star Wars “Skywalker Saga” that began in May of 1977 with the release of George Lucas’s original Star Wars (or Star Wars: Episode IV—A New Hope, if you want to be thorough). At the time, Lucas was so unsure of his film’s chances for success that he went to Hawaii on opening weekend so he wouldn’t have to be around if and when it bombed (it was during that Hawaiian trip, that Lucas and Steven Spielberg, who was there escaping his own woes during the post-production of Close Encounters of the Third Kind, cooked up the idea for Indiana Jones, but that’s another story …). How wrong he turned out to be. You would have to go back to Thomas Edison declaring that motion pictures, which he helped innovate, would be a passing fancy that lasted 10 years at best to find a more misguided movie predication. As we all know now, the original trilogy, which included Stars Wars, The Empire Strikes Back (1980), and Return of the Jedi (1983), turned into a cultural juggernaut that forever changed the movie industry (and its ancillary markets); in a sense, we are still watching movies in the house that Star Wars built. Lucas returned to the franchise he created in the late 1990s and early 2000s with a trilogy of prequels (1999’s The Phantom Menace, 2002’s Attack of the Clones, and 2005’s Revenge of the Sith) that charted the path of He-Who-Would-Become-Darth-Vader; it was a stew of mixed results, although hindsight has shown that Lucas’s consistency of vision across those three films was both admirable and challenging. That consistency is precisely what the third trilogy of Star Wars films, which began with J.J. Abrams’s Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015) and was followed by Rian Johnson’s Star Wars: The Last Jedi (2017), lacks. The Force Awakens kicked things off in grand style by introducing an entirely new cast of characters—Daisy Ridley’s Rey, a resolute orphan with a Jedi future; John Boyega’s Finn, a rebellious Storm Trooper who joins the Resistance against the fascistic First Order; Oscar Isaac’s Poe Dameron, an ace Resistance pilot and owner of BB-8, a rolly-polly new droid; and Adam Driver’s Kylo Ren, a conflicted Sith lord who yearns to be the next Darth Vader—while also bringing back familiar faces three decades older, notably Harrison Ford’s Han Solo and Carrie Fisher’s Leia Organa, who we learned gave birth of Kylo Ren. Much of the new Star Wars world was successfully established, although some critics (and fans) griped that it looked and felt a bit too much like the old world.  No matter—narratives were launched, characters created, and long-term mysteries established, particularly the tantalizing question of Rey’s lineage. Those questions were deepened—and in some ways conflicted—in Johnson’s The Last Jedi, which divided fans right down the middle. Johnson’s take on the material, particularly the return of Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), wasn’t to everyone’s liking (although I remain mystified as to why some decried it as the worst film in the series), so there has been great expectation that Abrams, in returning to the directing chair, would essentially “right” that film’s “wrongs.” The very fact that this would need to be done speaks to the lack of planning that went into this trilogy, which now viewed as a whole has a kind of awkward, slip-shod feel; the individual parts are all good in their own ways, but the series comes together only under obvious pressure and stress. Almost anything can be forced to fit together, but don’t look too closely at the seams. With The Rise of Skywalker, Abrams and co-writer Chris Terrio (working from a story concocted by Derek Connolly and Colin Trevorrow, the latter of whom was originally slated to direct) have delivered something that certainly passes for a fitting conclusion. There has been some griping about “fan service,” suggesting that Abrams is just kowtowing to Star Wars fans, which is basically the opposite of what Johnson did two years ago in taking the series in his own, idiosyncratic direction. That kind of criticism strikes me as absurd, since Abrams’s intentions are largely irrelevant and what matters is whether The Rise of Skywalker works both on its own as a film and as the capstone of the third trilogy in the Star Wars saga. On both counts, I would argue that it does. Imperfectly, sure, but it works. The first half hour is definitely the roughest, as we lurch from plot point to plot point in such rushed fashion that it’s hard to digest much of anything, much less enjoy it. The film opens with a massive “reveal,” showing us in the first 10 minutes that the mastermind behind all the evil doings from the previous two films has been none other than Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid), who was also the evil mastermind behind all the evils doings in both of the previous trilogies (his villainous bona fides were secured in both creating the Galactic Empire and turning Anakin Skywalker into Darth Vader). When we last saw the Emperor at the end of Return of the Jedi (when Ronald Reagan was President, mind you), Vader had hurled him into a void in the middle of the new Death Star where he apparently exploded. That, alas, was not enough to take him out, and it appears that he has continued to exist, albeit in weak, skeletal form, biding his time until he can re-energize himself and take command of the First Order—with Kylo Ren’s assistance, of course. The reveal of the Emperor is supposed to be a big kick, but it doesn’t really work because no groundwork had been laid in the previous films. Abrams and company just drop him into the proceedings—Bam!—as a desperate ploy to fill in the necessary narrative gaps. Thankfully, the film is more interested in following the continued plight of Rey, who is well on her way to becoming a very powerful Jedi, and her conflicted relationship with Kylo Ren, with whom she has already done battle multiple times and with whom she now has a strong mental connection. Leia Organa’s role in the film was intended to be much larger before the untimely passing of Carrie Fisher, but she still has a notable presence that largely hides the fact that it is cobbled together from pre-existing footage from the first two films and digital effects. We get a few new characters, including a mysterious masked bounty hunter named Zorii Bliss (Keri Russell) who has an intriguing history with Poe Dameron, as well as the return of some familiar faces, most notably Billy Dee Williams’s wry scoundrel Lando Calrissian, who once again commandeers the Millennium Falcon.  Like the first two films in the new trilogy, The Rise of Skywalker is fundamentally a nostalgia machine, drawing heavily on the iconography and narrative beats of the original trilogy but with just enough of twists that it feels relatively new. Abrams cannily stages one of the film’s climactic moments in the twisted remains of the Throne Room from Return of the Jedi’s second Death Star, which further underscores how Rey is the new Luke and Kylo Ren is the new Vader and the Emperor is … well … still the Emperor. Abrams doesn’t have Rian Johnson’s belligerent daring, and this film lacks some of the clever visual grandeur that The Last Jedi had in spades. Abrams is certainly going for broke, giving us a lightsaber duel on a precipice thrashed by massive waves, a tense desert showdown, and a horrorshow of Star Destroyers lined up in the sky and lit with bursts of lightning. These moments work in and of themselves, and Abrams manages to stitch them together with enough spit and determination that you feel like you’ve witnessed a real conclusion, even if we all know that this particular juggernaut is likely nowhere near its end.

"Jan 12, 2020",negative,"This is a submissive, sloppy apology for a terrific movie. This is a series apologizing for itself when it didn't need to. Which just feels embarrassing."
"Jan 11, 2020",positive,"The best Star Wars episode since The Empire Strikes Back. With as much nostalgia as new story content, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker rose to the occasion full force. (Pun intended) - ignore the haters."
"Jan 10, 2020",negative,"After delivering such a brilliant cinematic masterpiece, Rian Johnson's excellent story telling was ignored, negated and just plain disrespected by JJ."
"Jan 10, 2020",neutral," There’s a moment in the middle of Star Wars: The Rise Of Skywalker when Rey is approached by a new droid. It takes a step back as she reaches her hand out, bringing her to the conclusion that it had been harmed before. “It’s all right,” she says. “You’re safe now.” She hits a button to essentially reboot it. It’s a moment that has no bearing on the story, except that it reflects entirely how J.J. Abrams views the Star Wars fandom, a collection of people who were hurt by The Last Jedi but are now in safe hands that understand them. This is how The Rise Of Skywalker feels. Safe. When The Force Awakens came out in 2015, that word was thrown around a lot. It had several familiar concepts: a planet-killing weapon, a nobody hero from a desert planet, a bad guy with a black helmet who speaks through an intercom. But even with the familiar, there was still a sense of innovation. You had a storm trooper with a conscience and a villain with a strong inner conflict. More than that, The Force Awakens felt like a movie about something. A new generation trying to figure out their place in a world that was so profoundly belonging to the old one.  Star Wars: The Rise Of Skywalker has none of that. It’s so often a retread of the old and familiar that it forgets to do anything of its own. In fact, it even reverts some of the brilliant subversions of The Last Jedi. It does so in a way that feels punitive, almost as if to change is an offensive notion for the biggest movie franchise in history. It even has problems on a basic level. The first half of the movie is so incredibly rushed that the characters are essentially racing to get from one point to the other. It works best when things slow down, but then it’s bogged down by set-up for the next scene.  It’s not so much that you can’t enjoy the movie. It’s still Star Wars. There are spaceships, lightsabers, villains, and heroes. It’s just that having seen how good Star Wars could be, it’s a shame that the finale to this saga is such a whimper. It feels like a knife that’s been used for too long, and now it’s just dull."
"Jan 9, 2020",neutral,"It's hard to believe, at the culmination of 42 years and nine movies, that the last three would be essentially improvisational exercises by all directors concerned."
"Jan 9, 2020",negative," Kudos to J.J. Abrams for doing something extraordinary to Star Wars with his Rise of Skywalker: he has made me not care about it for the first time in my life. Look: I am the clichéd GenX Star Wars fan who was eight years old in the summer of 1977 when the first movie hit us all with the force of a supernova. I lined up as a teenager — the queue wrapped around the cinema; just a one-screener back in those pre-multiplex days — to find out what Return of the Jedi would bring us. I was there when the first Phantom Menace trailer debut broke the baby World Wide Web. I spent the summer of 1999 rewatching Episode I many many times and having endless (and still not resolved) philosophical discussions with other fans about just what, precisely, constituted the “phantom menace” and whether Qui-Gon was stupid and incompetent or wise but thwarted and what “bringing balance to the Force” would mean. I was so very primed, in 2015, for the third trilogy to bring the 40-year-long story of my geek existence to a conclusion. This myth has defined my entire pop-culture life, in so many ways: it has contributed to the patois of Generation X (“Use the Force”; “I dunno, I have a bad feeling about this”); it has shaped how we all think about movies now. Star Wars — the first movie but also the ongoing sprawling saga, with its videogames and cartoon TV series and all of it — has been the Ultimate Story in the same way that, say, Gone with the Wind or Casablanca, or Lawrence of Arabia or The Sound of Music, have been for earlier generations, except even more all-encompassing. The Star Wars machine has become The Movies. Star Wars is almost religion… almost literally. What I’m saying is: I love Star Wars and I very much own that love. I have lived that love. The saga is in my geek blood. And yet I watched The Rise of Skywalker and — throughout it and after it — could muster no reaction beyond a huge heaving sigh of I No Longer Have Any Fucks To Give Here. I don’t even want to argue about any of it anymore. I’m exhausted by all of it, and not in a good way. I am exhausted by the toxic fan reaction and by the ultimate pointlessness of it all. (I am not saying that arguing over fiction is pointless. I am saying that arguing over this particular story has been deliberately rendered pointless by those who have been telling it.) I’m kind of relieved that it’s over, actually, because it has stopped being fun. Worse, it has stopped being interesting. 
[It c]harts a path to a future that refuses to get mired in nostalgia. Yet all the ‘Star Wars’ notes are here, remixed into a glorious new arrangement.
 
[u]pend[ed] expectations, demythologize[d] the mythos, and [took] an iconic series in a bold new direction with a story full of humor, courage, and dazzling imagery.
 It seemed to me that this was the right approach for the first two movies of a new trilogy, a wrapup trilogy, to take: acknowledge the past and play with the tropes, but then move in a much-needed new direction. Finish this particular story but open up this universe and make room for it to expand into fresh vistas. I mean, that’s how you keep it going, right? That’s what you need to continue raking in big ol’ corporate profit, no? It’s a big fucking galaxy out there, isn’t it? Let’s explore it! But with The Rise of Skywalker, Abrams — director as well as one of four credited screenwriters — sucks it all back in upon itself. Nothing that happens here and none of the answers to the mysteries the previous films in this new trilogy posed are the least bit surprising or enlightening. The biggest narrative crimes of The Rise of Skywalker are the same ones as Solo: A Star Wars Story: everyone in the galaxy actually knows everyone we’ve met before. This big crazy wide universe is, in fact, really insular and really fucking small and incredibly familiar. Say what you will about George Lucas’s prequel trilogy — it certainly has its problems, to say the very least — but at least it showed us a vibrant, diverse galactic civilization. And yet Rise of Skywalker might as well be a soap opera set in a small village, for all the scope it has. It’s genuinely shocking how cramped this movie ends up feeling. Who is Rey (Daisy Ridley: Peter Rabbit, Murder on the Orient Express)? Whence comes her Force powers? From there? Really? *groan* Forget whatever space battles this movie wants to mount; forget everything else Rise of Skywalker could have been about: Abrams (Star Trek Into Darkness, Super 8) makes this movie about that question, and the answer is tedious as well as aimless. For all the endless callbacks to beats from the original Star Wars trilogy — just when you think Abrams is done referring to the old movies, he throws in an even more shameless reference — Rise barely seems interested in the spirit of the overall tale. In 1977, Star Wars was rebellious and antiestablishment in every way it could be, from its provenance as a scrappy little indie in a Hollywood that didn’t know what to make of it — it was damn near cinematic outsider art — to its protagonist, the lonely farmboy who dreamed of adventure and of a life anywhere but where he was. Last Jedi was imbued with that spirit: in its audacious suggestion that the Jedi were greatly in need of, at a minimum, a Reformation, or that maybe the faith’s time had come to die; in its celebration of the little people who win wars with their necessary slogging gruntwork and its rejection of showy one-man heroics. Last Jedi was anti status quo, was all about blowing up the metaphoric Death Star that is this movie machine. Its target — perhaps unwittingly, though I suspect not — was as much a hidebound fandom as the increasingly hidebound franchise it worshipped. And then J.J. Abrams comes back, here in Rise, with, “LOL, hell no!” and delivers multiple fuck-you reversals to what Rian Johnson did in his film. Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac: X-Men: Apocalypse, Mojave) is back to being celebrated as a cheerfully reckless hothead. Ex-Stormtrooper Finn (John Boyega: Pacific Rim: Uprising, Detroit) and maintenance engineer Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran) are completely sidelined, their brand of quiet power and everyday courage not required here, and certainly not deemed of any worth. (Rise brings in another token nonwhite nonmale in order to pretend it is Diverse, but mysterious low-tech warrior Jannah [Naomi Ackie: Lady Macbeth, Doctor Who] ends up with almost nothing to do, too.) It’s one thing — a depressing thing — to see that, obviously, there was never any unifying vision for this trilogy; no one mapped out even a sketch of a overarching plot for the three movies, and the grand story it tells is damn near incoherent because no one seems to have had any idea what it was going to be about. Way worse, though, is how, with The Rise of Skywalker — the film struggles to justify that title — Star Wars became the Empire, solidifying ideas about lineage and nobility (broadly defined) and destiny and heritage that, more than ever in today’s world, need to fucking die, when slavish adherence to dynasties and heritage are doing so much damage. Somehow I’m always shocked when anything considered science fiction or fantasy shows itself to be so lacking in imagination, and when its fans reward it for its narrowmindedness. I’m also never not disappointed. It’s clear now that whatever flight of fancy Star Wars once took me on, it is no longer interested in having me along on the journey. This saddens me, but there are plenty of other stories out there that will engage me as I need. In addition to what you pointed out, every single character (save Rey and Kylo) is a plot device. The whole story was slapped together while they were scripting, and it shows. It’s such a waste of Daisy Ridley’s talents (she deserved a strong finish for the franchise that gave her a career), as well as putting Oscar fucking Isaac in a leading role and not giving him much to do. I thought the ending was beautifully done, but everything else was a mess leading up to it. If Disney decides not to make more Star Wars films — I’d be just fine with that. George Lucas got crazier as the movies he made progressed into the new episodes, but everything he did was because he believed in it. Disney’s interest is in seeing how high they can build the pile of SW money.  The first clue was Disney trying to turn out a film every year; those three-year gaps between the Lucas films made you hungry for the next installment. Now, not so much…. Rian Johnson believed in the story he told, which makes it all the more angering how its edges were sanded off in this one.  Makes me wish I’d gone to see Knives Out instead. It’s funny, I agree with almost all of your specific points, but still enjoyed the hell out of this one. MaryAnn and I are the same age.  Maybe the magic and not being able to imagine NOT loving Star Wars are still working for me.  And maybe a little of it is the headcanon I invented for this movie that takes the little bit of Dark Side necromancy we see and just runs with it.  Still ending up at the same place, but with some much cooler bits in between. I was going to post much the same as what you said. I enjoyed The Rise of Skywalker — I saw it twice — but I agreed with almost all of the points MaryAnn made (which is the sign of a good critic — they provide insight even when you disagree). I’ve been a comics fan as long as I’ve been a Star Wars fan.  Back in the ’80s, DC did this thing called the “DC Challenge.” It was a 12-issue round robin story with randomly determined creative teams for each issue.  Each issue had to end with a cliffhanger that the next team had to deal with.  For instance, I remember one that left Aquaman stranded in the middle of the Sahara desert and minutes away from dying due to lack of water. The writer had to have something in mind for an escape from the cliffhanger, but the next writer didn’t know what it was, and might go off in a completely different direction. The whole thing was fun, if a little disjointed and unavoidably gimmicky.  But this was a minor comic book limited series.  Sure, DC hoped it would sell, but if it didn’t, it was just this fun little experiment that wouldn’t ruin the company or anything. How can you possibly arrive at the notion that a “DC Challenge” approach is in any way wise or appropriate for a multi-billion dollar franchise? I know, it’s utterly ridiculous.  JJ loves his little mystery boxes and allegedly had answers in mind all along but didn’t tell anyone.  That’s a terrible way to manage a franchise, and just like the mystery of “who is Cumberbatch playing in Star Trek,” the resolution is the most obvious and underwhelming thing imaginable. It’s so, so, so sloppy. If you’re going to kill off Chewbacca 45 minutes in, maybe make the audience think he’s dead for a good hour before he comes back in the third act. If you’re going to have Lando call a bunch of ships for a big, sweeping moment of support (that specific moment is done beautifully), maybe show him calling the ships. If you’re going to have Finn insist that he’s going to tell Rey something, HAVE HIM TELL HER THE THING. If you want Adam Driver to have a character arc, maybe give him actual lines and things to say- there’s only so much looks (and unwarranted kissing) can justify in the third act. As much as I disliked this movie (and I was never going to like Reylo or Rey Skywalker, Rey Palpatine could have been okay but was treated lazily, like everything else), I would have enjoyed seeing the three-hour cut that was rumored. Agreed with all of this.  I was so angry at the reveal of who Rey really is.  I loved all the weird directions TLJ took and I hate that JJ undid all of it.  I particularly agree with the idea of the Jedi needing a Reformation.  It’s one of the few things I defend in the prequels- I think the Jedi were deliberately presented as bloated and corrupt, and the three trilogies could have presented a cycle of fall and rebirth.  I was guessing Rey would found a successor to the Jedi called the Skywalkers, justifying the film’s title.  Also, I wanted more of Broom Boy and other nobodies to show up and play a role, but no go. There was one scene I really liked, and that was when they met the underground worm thing.  It felt very Doctor Who, with our hero seeing a great beast but being affectionate towards it and helping to heal its pain. C-3PO is not allowed to translate Sith language but he can if they reset his memory.  This is contrived and doesn’t make much sense, but from a story perspective it makes sense.  He’s one of only two characters who’s been with us for every movie, so his offering to essentially die for his friends was pretty touching.  But then later R2 restores his memory from a back-up file?  So what was the point of that?  It’s like JJ wasn’t satisfied with undoing TLJ, he had to retcon things that happened in the same movie? Is that right?  I know it had a gap in it, but I wasn’t sure how far back it went.  But if you’re right, then yeah, that says it all. I might be looking for slightly more than is really there in the text, but confirming it would require seeing it again, and that aint happening in a hurry. J.J. needs to stay away from venerated sci franchises. He’s done more damage to Star Wars and Star Trek, that I don’t know if those two franchises will ever recover. He has the lead touch. I really don’t think it’s as bad as all that.  I absolutely loved the new Treks (and as far as I remember, MaryAnn did too.  The first new SW film by JJ was great, the second SW made not by JJ was great.  This one wasn’t great, but one out of five isn’t a bad record. Yup, I’ve enjoyed the new *Trek*s, and I have the same relationship to *Trek* as I do to *Wars*: grew up with it, shaped my geekiness, etc. My issue with new installments in either franchise hasn’t been lack of Trekiness or Warsiness, but more basic storytelling issues. His early career in the 90’s is mostly schmaltzy and sentimental, although I remember Regarding Henry being a minor hit when I was a kid.  Joy Ride, Felicity, and Alias in the early 2000’s were his peak, then of course he made a truckload of money with Lost, which I know many people love.  After that, I don’t know what happened, maybe he was given too much creative control a la Lucas, maybe he ran out of ideas, but everything went south in a hurry. Good Science Fiction is about ideas and exploration, and he’s become incapable of building a world substantial enough to reward wandering through.  As your comment and this review state, he and Disney have sucked all the wonder out of entire universes and left once rich, juicy ideas shriveled and crumbling in the mud. I don’t want him to fail or succeed, I just want him to get better.  Now Cameron, for some reason, partially jealousy, I kinda want to see him fail spectacularly.  His failures have the potential to be overblown, campy fun, J.J.’s failures (and successes) are forgettable, shiny mush, like a bowl of cold oatmeal with candy sprinkles. Personally, I always thought the cinematic SW universe was in trouble long before Abrams came along and that blaming the failure of the SW series on Abrams is like pretending The Phantom Menace would have been a sci-fi classic if not for Jar-Jar Binks.  I’m glad my niece and nephew find something to like in the new movies but apart from that, I have not much to say about the matter apart from noting that I wish for MaryAnn’s sake that the last two movies were a lot better. Hollywood does not reward this, though. Or, at least, it thinks it doesn’t reward this until some dude (ALWAYS a dude, and a white dude, at that) bucks a trend that “inexplicably” makes a splash (see: 1977 George Lucas) has a hit that no one expected. And then said white dude is hailed as a visionary or whateverthefuck and… oh god I am so exhausted by it all. I didn’t like the last jedi, found it a bore to watch i must admit and didn’t like any of the male or female characters in it(luke, poe, rose and holdo especially). Not seen Rise of Skywalker yet, but i’m guessing as i mostly enjoyed force awakens, i’ll probably enjoy rise of skywalker more than you did.
Last jedi left such a sour taste in my mouth though, i skipped rise of skywalker because of it. You’re probably right that disliking TLJ makes you more likely to like this one.  I disagree with you strongly, but it’s nice to see someone express that opinion respectfully, without falling into sexism. Write  a better one… Let’s all see it.
Considering the hurdles faced in this finale,  two principles being the incredibly short schedule and the loss of a key actor even before production began, it simply could have been worse, but wasn’t and I’m grateful for that. I thought the Rey+Kylo scenes were watchable, and they had palpable chemistry.  Ren is largely culpable in the murder of millions sentient beings though, which undercuts some of the dramatic moments near the end quite a bit.  You have to admit Finn and Poe have arcs that go nowhere in this film, and the trilogy as a whole. You’re right though, making a movie is not an easy undertaking, and there were certainly many challenges involved in this particular installment and many different interest groups to appease. I’m happy you went in with low expectations and were pleasantly surprised – no need to challenge those who felt let down.  If someone eats a piece of pie you like and says, “meh, not so good,” it would be a little silly to angrily retort, “I’d like to see you open up your own restaurant and bake a better one!  It could have tasted way worse!”  You liked it, they didn’t.  MA has a personal connection to the series too, which makes her disappointment that much more heartbreaking. Which is to say: Fuck that guy that you are replying to, and fuck Hollywood. I KNOW movies, and I know what makes good movies, and what doesn’t, even if I have never made a small fortune in the process. You don’t have to agree with her review but if the main points of your counter-argument are “write a better one” and “it could have been worse,” you might want to consider writing a better review yourself. Not gonna lie, The Rise of Skywalker is to Return of the Jedi as The Force Awakens is to A New Hope, except RotJ wasn’t that great to begin with, so TRoS is commensurately worse. I was going to write that well, it could have been worse, but after considering for a long while, I realized I couldn’t think of any way it *could* have been worse. It passed the final episode of a trilogy of trilogies over to J.J. (“I’m not good with endings”) Abrams, instead of Rian Johnson, who was originally going to make episode nine until the whining fanbaby men writing ignorant screeds on the Internetz got Disney scared and they replaced him. It threw out and un-did all the wonderful stuff Rian Johnson had done in THE LAST JEDI, and gave us stupid fan service to placate the worst element of the fans.
It wasted a bunch of good actors, most notably Kelly Marie Tran, who I thought the best thing in THE LAST JEDI. It did such silly things as making the hidden fleet of star destroyers each have its own Death Star cannon, making you wonder why in hell they’d bothered building Death Stars to hold those cannons in the first place. (It goes without saying that any time you find yourself considering logical points in a STAR WARS movie, you’re kinda fucked.) 1)  In the middle of the film, Kylo makes a pit stop at 69 Aftward, the 24 hour night club on his ship.  As he orders a cold one, he spots a mysterious female Twi’lek across the room and offers her a twirl on the dance floor when Hux cuts in with a smirk saying, “These tentacles are taken, why don’t you Ren back to your room Kyloser.”  They breakdance to the death, but it ends in a draw.  They lock eyes panting in exhaustion, go to Ren’s room and make out awkwardly, but it’s Disney so the penetration is implied offscreen. 2)  Near the end of the climactic battle, an army of Ewoks led by a fully shaved Wicket hang glide out of a wormhole and drop water balloons filled with purple egg nog on the heads on the storm troopers guarding the shield gen… er radio tower.  A force ghost of Anakin appears, the Jake Lloyd verson, and exclaims, “Now that was Pod Racing!”  The ghost then breaks out in a lively Jedi space shanty to celebrate their victory, and the remaining Storm Troopers, driven mad by the beauty of the song, take off their armour and put it on again upside down so that it looks like they’re all walking on their hands and waving their feet in the air.  Everyone tries not to look at Wicket’s smoothly, shaved body and fails.  “Are you an angel?  You’re Endorable!” exclaims Jake Lloyd Anakin.  The Force Ghost and Wicket embrace, then make out awkwardly while everyone around them slowly pretends to suddenly have somewhere to go.  It’s Disney, so you only see Wicket’s sideboob for a couple seconds, and his nipples are blurred out. 3)  After the credit roll, the camera pans up from the spot in the sand to a robotic foot, as it continues upwards, we see that the robotic legs are attached to the torsos of Darth Maul, Jar Jar Binks, and a badly burned Jyn Erso.  “At last meesa reveal ourselves to the Jedi, meesa have hope, revenge issa built on hope!”  the creature exclaims ominiously.  Rey and the the charred torso of Erso make out awkwardly while the Maul and Binks torsos play rock paper scissors to decide who gets Luke’s saber.  Baby Yoda and Baby Groot drive up in a gold plated sandcrawler wearing blinged out Geordi La Forge visors and begin rapping about blasters and slave girls, Jabba features, but his verse is subpar.   It’s Disney, so they play the clean radio edit. It’s bizarre that Disney would want to play it safe with this franchise, given that it was guaranteed to make money no matter what.  Why not swing for the fences? 
It did such silly things as making the hidden fleet of star destroyers each have its own Death Star cannon, making you wonder why in hell they’d bothered building Death Stars to hold those cannons in the first place.
 That doesn’t bother me at all.  After forty years, the technology has no doubt advanced, so I’m willing to accept that they just now managed to miniaturize the cannons enough to fit on a Star Destroyer.  It’s actually nice to see a sci-fi universe where technology isn’t frozen in whatever people thought “futuristic” meant in 1950’s pulp magazines. I’m grateful this new trilogy happened just for The Last Jedi. I love that movie so goddamn much. It ignited a passion I’d never previously felt for this series. I happily isolate it as a glorious one-off. Not being a Star Wars fan, the shocking awfulness of this movie can be shrugged off as another piece of Hollywood horseshit. It might as well be called “Star Wars Episode IX: Fuck Rian Johnson”. It really feels like this movie was made to placate fans who hated Last Jedi.  As soon as it was announced JJ was going to direct this, I adjusted expectations accordingly, down to zero. I just detest everything Abrams does. He has no artistic soul as a filmmaker. All of his shots are empty, existing only on the surface. Potentially engrossing moments happen but the second they’re over they disappear. I’ll go further: his movies are all sociopathic. There’s no emotion. There’s the appearance of emotion, but there’s nothing true behind it. All potentially engrossing moments happen quickly then pass without lingering or seeping in to the subconscious to be truly savoured. Every moment is like that. An astonishing image appears onscreen but it never actually becomes astonishing. It’s always taken away by inherent falseness, an embedded emptiness suffusing the entire film. And also by the lightspeed editing that ensures nothing stays on screen long enough to matter. Nothing feels earned or honest, nothing is real. There can be no time to be sincere as that would disrupt the momentum of emptiness. A genuinely moving cinematic experience becomes ‘real’ in the mind of the satisfied viewer. You can feel it. You know when it’s reached you on some deeper level. Nothing here came close to that. This is pod people film-making. The ultimate example of JJ Abrams’ deeply unpleasant cinematic sociopathy is still the destruction of the Republic by Starkiller Base in The Force Awakens. Five densely populated planets are destroyed in what is far and away the most monumental, devastating, cataclysmic, unimaginable mass-killing in the history of the universe, and literally five seconds later the movie forgets all about it. Hey fuck it. That’s over with. Next! I get that on one level this is all broad pulp sci-fi nonsense, but it still shocks me how that film made that into such a banal moment. Meanwhile, Paige Tico’s sacrifice in the opening of Last Jedi still makes me gasp and shiver with an intense emotional response. With less than two minutes of screentime and no dialogue, she’s a living breathing person who matters. I can’t say that about anything in Rise of Skywalker. Finally saw this film, and while my immediate experience was “enjoyment” thanks to my utter lack of expectations (funnily enough a general movie-going philosophy I adopted after going into The Phantom Menace with high hopes), you absolutely nail the lasting impact of the film:  Nothing. Like you say, every scene, every visual, every moment, every emotion, every idea, breezes by in a moment and vanishes, never to be concerned again.  There’s some things that happen which should have major ramifications but don’t because the movie doesn’t care.  Including, once again, destroying a planet.  Which isn’t a spoiler because it doesn’t matter at all; like I don’t think the protagonists even know it happened?  At least — and holy turds is this damning with faint praise — someone was like “Whoa!  The Republic was destroyed, that’s bad!” That’s a good point – in Force Awakens there’s at least some reaction to the planets blowing up. But in Rise, it just happens randomly, because it’s the sort of thing that’s supposed to happen in a Star Wars movie. It’s only there for the audiences’ benefit, not the characters, which ends up not benefiting the audience, because shallow fan service in place of a real dramatic story isn’t a foundation for anything meaningful. It’s clear now that whatever flight of fancy Star Wars once took me on, it is no longer interested in having me along on the journey. I’m with Stacy Livitsanis: I’m glad the new trilogy gave space for TLJ to exist as a fantastic one-off. It stands on its own both as a film and as much-needed commentary on both the franchise and its fans; and the film’s themes will continue to resonate, whether future storytellers fulfill or squander its promise. But I’ve pretty much given up hoping for a cohesive, satisfying narrative for the Star Wars universe as a whole, and will just have to enjoy whatever nuggets of gold emerge from the inevitable sea of mediocre or atrocious crap. Sturgeon’s Law and all that. I believe we actually ARE living through a time of quality Star Wars storytelling… it’s just that it’s all happening in The Mandalorian. Oh well. REALLY TRIVIAL SPOILERS AHEAD

This movie shows a number of women working for the First Order. These women have hardly any lines. My theory is that the First Order went on a huge recruiting drive, trying to add more women to the team, but they couldn’t find any women who were willing to sign up. So they came up with a plan. The First Order’s spies knew that the Resistance had made tremendous advances in artificial intelligence, and had developed extremely lifelike androids to fight on their behalf. So they conducted a raid on a Resistance base and stole as many female androids as they could find. They reprogrammed all of the androids to join the First Order. There was only one problem. The androids’ original programming didn’t allow them to speak the Sith language. No matter how much time the First Order technicians spent trying to solve the problem, they could never get the female androids to speak more than a sentence or two. So the women spend most of their time saying nothing at all. The other possibility, I suppose, is that J.J. Abrams and his team made very little effort to put interesting female characters onscreen, but it’s 2020, so surely he’s aware of the need for better representation in the movies. Luke’s ghost also keeps appearing to Rey, who continues to train to be a Jedi while also being overwhelmed with self-doubt. It seems that Kylo Ren telling her that she’s descended from dead nobodies has really messed-up her mind and sapped her confidence. But Rey’s stand-alone nature is also part of her strength. During a conversation with Leia, the general says: “You’re not like my father or my brother. You’re new. Whatever happens, remember the Force chose you Rey. Your story isn’t written by anyone else.” The beginning of the film very much picks up from The Last Jedi in that the First Order has cut off all communication between planets in order to suppress a rebellion inspired by Luke Skywalker’s stand off at the Battle of Crait. So the spark of the rebellion did work in this version of the movie. … Oh and Rose? Apparently front and center through the whole movie, which is a damn shame given that she’s completely sidelined in Rise of Skywalker … At the very end of the movie, Finn and Rose lead a group of Force Sensitive youth to a remote planet where Rey is waiting to train the next generation of Jedi. And yes, “Broom Boy” is one of them. [Rey tries] unsuccessfully to bring Kylo Ren back to the light, but he’s too far gone and in the end he is “extinguished.” This is honestly what many felt the crux of Episode IX should have been: the battle for Kylo Ren’s soul. Instead, Abrams and Co. decided to muddle everything up with this Palpatine nonsense, which is just unnecessary added external conflict that detracts from the emotional thrust of this trilogy. And it’s worse because it is more than fan-fic in the sense that it had a real chance of becoming a movie in a way that none of the “It might have made a better movie” fan-fics have.  Like, the studio literally paid someone to write it so that it could become the actual script of the actual movie, they just decided “nah”. So, doesn’t change anything about the merits of the final film just like a fan-fic, but frustratingly closer to a reality we could have inhabited. Kinda like the original script for that terrible Russel Crowe Robin Hood movie that was gonna make the Sheriff the protagonist.  Like they had gold in their hands and flushed it down the toilet.  That’s much worse than the idea of the sympathetic Sheriff simply existing. A important caveat to the relationships between Trevorrow’s and Abrams’s Ep IX scripts: Trevorrow was fired from the production 3 months before The Last Jedi premiered. Oh sure, there’s no guarantee that what looks promising on paper actually winds up being good onscreen. All I’m saying is that Trevorrow seemed to understand and go along with the story direction that Johnson was suggesting. He was “yes-and”-ing Johnson, as opposed to Abrams who just said “Nah, we’re gonna go back to my idea.” It means that the decision not to go with his script was not made in response to the reactions to The Last Jedi. It was deemed unsuable all on its own. However disappointing Abrams and Terrio’s script is, Trevorrow’s film would almost certainly been at least as disappointing in its own, unique ways. Which makes this whole “leaked script” business into a ridiculous exercise. One that, because this is still the early 21st century, is already morphing into a bunch #ReleaseTheTrevorrowCut nonsense.
.
And that’s assuming we take the authenticity of this script at face value, which, really? Consider, this is a production company that went to such lengths to keep the existence of a major character, in a highly anticipated and heavily promoted new show, under such wraps that Etsy sellers made more money selling merch of this character last year than did two of the most merchandising savvy companies in the world. But somehow a rejected script by the guy they fired leaked out? Pull the other one. I never said that it was. I *will* say that TROS feels like Abrams’ very personal response to TLJ taking the story in a direction he seems not to have wanted. But whether or not the Trevorrow script is real, it’s a story that feels more satisfying and makes more sense as a continuation and culmination of the themes and story elements that have come before. Trying to offer something positive, I just listened to an episode of a Star Wars podcast called Scavenger’s Hoard celebrating Rose Tico and what she stands for. Partway through the episode the hosts read several moving comments from people talking about how much Rose still inspires them, regardless of the insulting way Rise of Skywalker treated her. The embrace of hope and love and the rejection of cynicism and hate gave me a solid lift out of the numb state I was in after seeing Rise.  I glanced at your red dot and quick take before going to see the movie anyway, hoping it would be one of those cases where I disagreed with you, or where I kind of agreed but liked the movie anyway. 1)  Adam Driver and Daisey Ridley — but especially Adam — freaking carry this dead-cow of a movie.  The closest anything came to ‘working’ was their story and that’s 100% because of their acting chops adding depth that everything else on screen lacked.  No offense to any other actor; John Boyega did what he could with “Reeeeeeeey!” 2) Boy the last line of the movie ticked me off.  When she’s asked for the second time “Rey who?” and she pauses to think, then smiles, I was actually starting to feel a swell of emotion for what I felt had to be coming next:  “Just Rey.”  Same answer as before, but this time said not with insecurity and shame but confidence and acceptance, because it’s her found-family that matters and they aren’t signified by a family name.  But nooooope! I think you could find justification for the title without that, and no other changes to the movie.  At this point all the Skywalker line we know of are dead and the evil ones redeemed — ‘rise’ could mean to ascending to Jedi Heaven.  But whatever.  The main thing I hate about the line is how it reinforces the theme that your lineage is actually super-duper important and if yours sucks/is egregiously evil the best you can do is adopt a better one. Yup. The more I read about it, the more I really, really prefer the Trevorrow version that could have been: where Rey gets over her obsession with lineage and decides that “just Rey” is more than enough. “Our masters were wrong,” Rey said. “I will not deny my anger. I will not reject my love. I am the darkness and I am the light.” “You’re nothing. You’re no one,” Kylo responds. Rey then ignites her lightsaber and says “No one is no one” before running at him, and the battle continues. The line, according to Burnett, is a callback to earlier in the film when Rey is discussing her lineage with Poe and he explains that everyone is who they want to be. No one is no one. I can just imagine the line “No one is no one” resonating in the culture in a way that nothing in TROS really has. It would have been a rallying cry for anyone protesting all sorts of injustice, for anyone who felt marginalized, for insecure teens and unmoored adults… for everyone, no “Chosen One” status needed. It would have been brilliant. And a damn shame it was never allowed to happen."
"Jan 8, 2020",positive,Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is a good tentpole movie for the holiday season and a fun Star Wars movie that ends on a high.
"Jan 8, 2020",negative," It’s a statement we’ve heard countless times before, but there’s no denying that Star Wars means so much to so many people. For generations, fans have eagerly awaited new instalments with passion and dedication, finding meaning in a simple story about space battles and mythical wizards created in the 70’s by George Lucas. Like many others, I grew up with the theatrical releases of the prequels and was introduced to the original trilogy by my parents at an early age. The announcement of a sequel trilogy came at a perfect time in my young adult life that had me excited and hopeful for the future.A Fandom DividedIt’s impossible to discuss Star Wars in 2019 without first acknowledging the fandom behind it. People have always had their own opinions about Star Wars, what it should be, what it represents, and ultimately these conversations have turned from constructive and passionate to downright toxic over recent years.After Rian Johnson’s The Last Jedi, the fanbase was quite literally divided, and it appeared as though there was no nuance in opinion; you either thought it was the best Star Wars movie ever made, or you wholeheartedly believe Johnson ruined Star Wars (an opinion that was once used against the prequel trilogy).Quite frankly, the response to the film was embarrassing. Rian Johnson was constantly bombarded with personal attacks and threats of violence on Twitter, fans were petitioning to have Episode 8 remade, and during this time I was almost afraid to admit my status as a Star Wars fan. Whether or not you liked the film (personally, it is in my top 3) Johnson’s vision oozed with creativity, passion, and a determination to create a project within the framework of a domineering company with the hope of bringing something fresh to the saga.source: Walt Disney Studios Motion PicturesUnfortunately, the same cannot be said for the ninth and final instalment directed by J.J. Abrams, which ultimately serves as a poignant example of the ways artistic integrity and individual creativity are of little importance when compared to pleasing the masses. Even more so, it shows the lack of planning that Lucasfilm and Disney engaged in prior to the release of Episode 7, a deficit that has resulted in three films that feel disjointed and almost unrelated to one another.A Lack of VisionWhen we open on The Rise of Skywalker, Kylo Ren has taken the place of Snoke as Supreme Leader after a failed attempt at recruiting Rey in Episode 8, and the galaxy is now threatened (again) by the late Emperor Palpatine, who has featured in the marketing and promotional material of the film. Right away, it’s clear that you’re expected to be on board, and if you’re not, it’s going to be a rough ride. Without going into spoilers, the reason for his return is mostly unanswered, swept under the rug with vague explanations and messy storytelling, which is the biggest problem with the film: its storytelling.Filled with MacGuffins, side quests, and plot conveniences that aren’t always explained, the film suffers due to its rushed and overstuffed approach to writing and a perceived need to throw as much at the audience as possible. While it is satisfying to see Rey (Daisy Ridley), Poe (Oscar Isaac) and Finn (John Boyega) take centre stage in many of these adventures, their path is a result of lazy writing that is immediately jarring and just doesn’t feel like Star Wars at times.source: Walt Disney Studios Motion PicturesAnother reason for this is the editing, which cuts so rapidly between plots, characters, and scenes that there doesn’t ever feel like there’s time for investment. This is also the case with the action sequences and set pieces, which occasionally reach the point of absurdity and are missing a sense of tension and uncertainty. Just when John Williams’ timeless score is building to a perfect crescendo and the emotionality of a scene starts to resonate, Abrams cuts away.At many points, The Rise of Skywalker appears to directly contradict what was set up in Episode 8, even going so far as to make petty jabs at some of the choices Rian Johnson made through the interactions between characters. Themes and relationships established are retroactively altered to suit Abrams’ vision, reveals feel predictable and utterly nonsensical at times, and the challenging ideas and fresh perspective instead become pandering and cheesy.Filled with ungodly amounts of fan-service and incessant nods to things of the past, it is abundantly clear Abrams is attempting to please the fraction of the fandom that is content to inundate themselves with nostalgia hit after nostalgia hit in the hope of experiencing the child-like wonder they once did. To be honest, it’s concerning.Not a Total DisappointmentAll this isn’t to say that the film is without positives, or that the experience of sitting in a packed theatre for a Star Wars film one last time won’t bring any joy. Despite its problems, it’s frequently entertaining (as long as you don’t question things too much) and, occasionally, moving. As has been the case with the first two films, the highlight of the film are Kylo and Rey and the dynamic which was so beautifully explored in Episode 8.Though this time around the majority of their scenes together are centred around plot points that feel simultaneously contrived and vague, their chemistry is consistently electric and emotional through some outstanding, vulnerable acting from Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver. Any time they’re on screen together the energy is palpable and real. Adam Driver continues to prove his status as one of the best actors working today, delivering lines that should feel bland in a way that adds depth and resonance, as well as altering his posture and expressions on multiple occasions in a way that is immediately endearing and serves his arc perfectly.source: Walt Disney Studios Motion PicturesIn fact, the acting, chemistry, and comedy ultimately save this film from being completely disappointing. The main trio (Rey, Finn, and Poe) have developed into characters with a believable friendship, with quality banter and back and forth quips that (mostly) land a huge part of their on-screen dynamic. Though it’s disheartening to see that certain characters have been sidelined for this film for seemingly no reason at all, there are some interesting character additions that aren’t altogether wasteful though do feel shoehorned in at times.The Rise of Skywalker: ConclusionUltimately, this is a disappointing film on many fronts, mostly due to some seriously flawed storytelling that should not have been given the green light. It’s hard to describe how I felt leaving the theatre without going into the specifics of spoilers, but the way this nine-film epic wrapped up left me feeling almost hopeless but more than anything, confused.I adore these characters, and it’s a shame the execution of this one wasn’t treated with more care. It’s hard to predict how this particular instalment will age once the initial shock wears off, but if anything this is a reminder to support independent filmmakers and those willing to challenge the status quo.May the force be with you.Does content like this matter to you?Become a Member and support film journalism.

Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for the ninth and final instalment directed by J.J. Abrams, which ultimately serves as a poignant example of the ways artistic integrity and individual creativity are of little importance when compared to pleasing the masses. Even more so, it shows the lack of planning that Lucasfilm and Disney engaged in prior to the release of Episode 7, a deficit that has resulted in three films that feel disjointed and almost unrelated to one another. When we open on The Rise of Skywalker, Kylo Ren has taken the place of Snoke as Supreme Leader after a failed attempt at recruiting Rey in Episode 8, and the galaxy is now threatened (again) by the late Emperor Palpatine, who has featured in the marketing and promotional material of the film. Right away, it’s clear that you’re expected to be on board, and if you’re not, it’s going to be a rough ride. Without going into spoilers, the reason for his return is mostly unanswered, swept under the rug with vague explanations and messy storytelling, which is the biggest problem with the film: its storytelling.Filled with MacGuffins, side quests, and plot conveniences that aren’t always explained, the film suffers due to its rushed and overstuffed approach to writing and a perceived need to throw as much at the audience as possible. While it is satisfying to see Rey (Daisy Ridley), Poe (Oscar Isaac) and Finn (John Boyega) take centre stage in many of these adventures, their path is a result of lazy writing that is immediately jarring and just doesn’t feel like Star Wars at times.source: Walt Disney Studios Motion PicturesAnother reason for this is the editing, which cuts so rapidly between plots, characters, and scenes that there doesn’t ever feel like there’s time for investment. This is also the case with the action sequences and set pieces, which occasionally reach the point of absurdity and are missing a sense of tension and uncertainty. Just when John Williams’ timeless score is building to a perfect crescendo and the emotionality of a scene starts to resonate, Abrams cuts away.At many points, The Rise of Skywalker appears to directly contradict what was set up in Episode 8, even going so far as to make petty jabs at some of the choices Rian Johnson made through the interactions between characters. Themes and relationships established are retroactively altered to suit Abrams’ vision, reveals feel predictable and utterly nonsensical at times, and the challenging ideas and fresh perspective instead become pandering and cheesy.Filled with ungodly amounts of fan-service and incessant nods to things of the past, it is abundantly clear Abrams is attempting to please the fraction of the fandom that is content to inundate themselves with nostalgia hit after nostalgia hit in the hope of experiencing the child-like wonder they once did. To be honest, it’s concerning.Not a Total DisappointmentAll this isn’t to say that the film is without positives, or that the experience of sitting in a packed theatre for a Star Wars film one last time won’t bring any joy. Despite its problems, it’s frequently entertaining (as long as you don’t question things too much) and, occasionally, moving. As has been the case with the first two films, the highlight of the film are Kylo and Rey and the dynamic which was so beautifully explored in Episode 8.Though this time around the majority of their scenes together are centred around plot points that feel simultaneously contrived and vague, their chemistry is consistently electric and emotional through some outstanding, vulnerable acting from Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver. Any time they’re on screen together the energy is palpable and real. Adam Driver continues to prove his status as one of the best actors working today, delivering lines that should feel bland in a way that adds depth and resonance, as well as altering his posture and expressions on multiple occasions in a way that is immediately endearing and serves his arc perfectly.source: Walt Disney Studios Motion PicturesIn fact, the acting, chemistry, and comedy ultimately save this film from being completely disappointing. The main trio (Rey, Finn, and Poe) have developed into characters with a believable friendship, with quality banter and back and forth quips that (mostly) land a huge part of their on-screen dynamic.

"Jan 8, 2020",positive," Star Wars is my first movie memory. As a 5-year-old boy, I huddled with my mom in a London movie palace in December 1977, transfixed by the images flickering on the huge screen. But then came the Sand People, who, along with the movie’s overwhelming auditory experience, scared me enough that we had to leave early. Despite that frightening introduction to the franchise, I soon became a devotee. And though I’ve lost much of my original enthusiasm over the years – mostly thanks to the poor quality of The Phantom Menace and the endless parade of non-canon content – I was genuinely curious about the impending conclusion to the saga. Would it take the story in a direction that would satisfy both super fans and casual admirers? And more importantly, would it simply be a good film? While the jury is still out on that first question, the answer to the second is a resounding yes, at least in the mind of this casual fan, who, surprisingly, found himself tearing up once or twice. The effects are superb and the performances endearing, especially the four main actors from the three sequels (Daisy Ridley as Rey, Adam Driver as Kylo Ren, John Boyega as Finn and Oscar Isaac as Poe). Yes, the film is derivative, repetitive, overstuffed, frenetic and sometimes just plain ridiculous, but it’s also irresistible. Powerful entertainment on an enormous scale, it’s the most emotionally resonant Star Wars movie since Return of the Jedi in 1983. Directed by J.J. Abrams, from a script by Chris Terrio (Argo, Batman v Superman) and Abrams, The Rise of Skywalker needs no advance plot discussion. One should go in fresh and uninformed, so I recommend avoiding trailers and blogs that might reveal twists. Strangely, though, a major twist – which negates one of the central plot points of the original trilogy – is revealed essentially before the movie begins, by the famous scrolling text. I won’t divulge that here, suffice to say it is a rather jarring rewrite of Star Wars history and one that I was initially uncomfortable with, until I found myself on the same narrative wavelength as Abrams and allowed the spectacle to wash over me. And that’s what I suggest you do too. Take off your critic’s hat, set aside your fanboy phobias and stop projecting your own desires onto the franchise. Just enjoy the nostalgia. And there’s plenty of it, almost as if Abrams wanted to wipe away some of the less Star Warsy choices made by writer-director Rian Johnson in The Last Jedi. But I don’t embrace this “battle of the writers” theory. On the contrary, I contend that the narrative pivots have served a purpose, despite the new film’s lack of originality. But there I go again, overthinking. Let go, we must. And if we do, we might discover the film’s surprising message of moral duality and ambiguity. Good and evil live in all of us in equal measure, Abrams seems to be saying. Palpatine and Skywalker are two sides of the same Republic Datary. “Confronting fear is the destiny of the Jedi,” Luke reminds us. Well, we’ve learned a lot about destiny over the last 42 years: the destinies of the characters, the destiny of cinematic entertainment and our own personal paths. It’s been a memorable journey: fun, emotional, exhilarating, frequently disappointing, but ultimately satisfying. The Force has come full circle."
"Jan 6, 2020",negative," In the last weeks of 2019 the big studios generously served up two Christmas turkeys. Judging by the reviews I wasn’t the only person yawning through Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, or wondering how Tom Hooper’s weirdly sexualised Cats ever secured a G rating. Both films are self-conscious ‘blockbusters’ intended to appeal to a popular audience. Both are surprisingly incoherent. The Star Wars movie tries too slavishly to supply fans with everything they might want from a series finale – Oh please let it be over! – at the expense of plot and continuity. The makers of Cats rely so completely on costumes and CGI to distinguish the film from the stage version they seem to have forgotten the most basic principles of story-telling. The Star Wars franchise is a juggernaut that guarantees the new film will make hundreds of millions of dollars in profits regardless of the luke-warm reactions. Cats is a more tricky proposition as it seems to be struggling, even though the international success of The Lion King (AUD$777.8 million and counting) suggests there is a huge audience for movies based on hit musicals. Cats debuted in 1981 and would run for 21 years in the West End and 18 years on Broadway, making it one of the popular stage shows of all time. This is a slightly depressing statistic because the music is so bloody awful. The musical might be defined as a degraded, diluted form of opera, interbred with the instant hooks and cheap sentiment of pop. Nevertheless, the best musicals, such as West Side Story or Cabaret, are tremendously seductive. Stephen Sondheim is arguably the best of the musicalists, but if Andrew Lloyd Webber had stopped after Jesus Christ Superstar (1970), we might look back on him as a brilliant talent. Instead he has rolled on and on, churning out treacly, formulaic tunes that keep the cash registers ringing. Cats has one memorable song, aptly called Memory, a piece of C-grade Puccini meets Celine Dion. It’s hummable but utterly maudlin. The plot, borrowed along with the lyrics, from T.S.Eliot’s Old Possum’s Book of Practical Cats (1939), is deceptively simple: a bunch of cats called the Jellicles get together for a big annual shindig. The highlight will be when one lucky cat gets to ascend to the “Heaviside Layer”, and start a new life. I say “deceptively” because it’s never made clear why the cats are “Jellicles”. Is it a name or some kind of category? Does it have any special meaning? Neither is it obvious why any cat would want to trade in its nine lives and “ascend” to the next world. Despite the relentless singing and dancing the entire party feels like the sacrificial rite of a primitive tribe. This impression is exacerbated by the way Hooper has clad his all-star cast (with the merciful exception of Judi Dench and Ian McKellen) in skin-hugging, lightly furred costumes that make them look virtually naked. Few porno films could boast so much squirming, fondling and leg-spreading. If you’ve ever dreamt of Rebel Wilson clad in a body suit, waving her extremities in the air, this is the movie for you. Or perhaps you’d prefer Idris Elba in skin-tight, buttock-grabbing leotards? After an hour of Cats I began to suspect the popcorn they fed us had been laced with a psychotropic drug. The only problem was that I wasn’t actually enjoying myself. When it comes to Star Wars there are legions of devoted fans who treat each installment as a religious experience, but even the die-hards must have been a little disappointed by J.J.Abrams’s not-so-grand finale. For viewers that haven’t followed the series with such close attention – and I confess to having seen no more than five out of nine installments of the “saga”, not counting the spin-offs  – there are no concessions. If you didn’t see the previous film, The Last Jedi (2018), you may find yourself struggling to remember who all these people are, and what they do. Abrams is so focused on addressing the rusted-on fans that he leaves the rest of us lost in space. This narrative complacency means The Rise of Skywalker fails as a stand-alone film, which cannot be the case for any successful sequel. For the viewer striving to figure out what’s going on, the action is remarkably uninvolving. All those fights with laser sabers, the inter-galactic space ship chases, and so on, feel like a pointless mishmash. When we pause for a little character development the dialogue is so pedestrian one begins to look forward to the next empty action sequence. As usual, the Wookiee gets all the best lines: “uugggh, errmmh”. The costumes, the funny-looking aliens, the claptrap about The Force and the Sith… it all feels so tired. And looks so plastic. It’s not just Carrie Fisher that returns from the dead via digital wizardry. Just about everyone who was ever retired from the saga gets to be briefly resurrected – which is presumably the way Abrams conveys ‘The Sense of an Ending’, to use a phrase made famous by literary critic, Frank Kermode. None of this will disturb the real Star Wars fanatics. The franchise has become a decadent, First World subculture that allows people to enjoy a little harmless fantasy at the price of switching off one’s brain and abandoning any sense of what makes a great movie. If an entire planet is destroyed by a ray beam (again), this is just a piece of fun. Très amusant! Martin Scorsese recently copped flak from the pop culture groupies for claiming that superhero movies and franchise films weren’t cinema. Of course these movies are cinema but they are a form of cinema in which any hint of artistry has been dissolved in a formula as corrosive as hydrochloric acid. Success at the box office has become a reliable indicator not of quality, but of industrial-grade cynicism. What’s most disturbing is the blind willingness of paying customers to keep frequenting and supporting these movies. Many of the fans will confess their disappointment in The Rise of Skywalker and Cats, but one suspects they’ll be back next weekend, shelling out for something just as bad."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive," In a way, Star Wars has ended again. But it’s never really going to end. The “finality” of Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is a joke; this film wasn’t even the last Star Wars adventure many fans saw in 2019, since The Mandalorian’s season finale trailed the movie’s release by a week. But Skywalker does wrap up the trilogy of new movies that were first announced when Disney bought Lucasfilm back in 2012. No further numbered “episode” movies that add onto George Lucas’ original nine-film arc are expected to materialize in the foreseeable future. This puts Star Wars in the unusual position of having drawn to a close three separate times, with three separate trilogies. Plenty of franchises have promised an ending, then continued anyway. But even at its most cynical, Star Wars isn’t exactly Friday the 13th in the 1980s, advertising a final installment, then releasing another sequel a year later. Though Star Wars has had multiple TV and movie spin-offs, with more on the way, the core of the series is those three trilogies, each separated by a decade or more, all of which were intended to tie up loose ends in their respective third installments: 1983’s Return of the Jedi, 2005’s Revenge of the Sith, and now The Rise of Skywalker. Few film sagas get this many cracks at designing a satisfying ending. There’s been a lot of debate, though, over exactly how detailed those designs have been. A lot of criticisms over The Rise of Skywalker focus on the new trilogy’s planning, or lack thereof. Co-writer and director J.J. Abrams kicked off the run with The Force Awakens, then ceded the middle installment, The Last Jedi, to writer-director Rian Johnson. With Skywalker, Abrams returns to the trilogy, and visibly scrambles to assemble payoffs, fan service, and callbacks to the Lucas-era films, all while offhandedly retconning Last Jedi. Truthfully, though, a lack of forethought has always been a hallmark of Star Wars trilogies. Some of the first three movies’ biggest plot points were famously not part of George Lucas’ original set of ideas. Return of the Jedi in particular feels like spirited vamping. It introduces inconsequential but fun new characters (the Ewoks; the denizens of Jabba the Hutt’s palace of sleaze), and eventually falls back on the opening film’s plot, assembling another fleet of spaceships for another attack on an even bigger Death Star — only this time, with the three main heroes occupied elsewhere. Years later, even with Lucas exercising even more control, the prequel trilogy picks up some story threads, but lets others drop. Sometimes, those dropped threads are productive: Revenge of the Sith has a singularity of purpose that the other two films in the prequel trilogy lack. Sometimes, they aren’t. (Did Lucas ever actually work out who clone-army-commissioner Sifo Dyas was, exactly?) The best-case scenario for the lack of an overarching plan is spectacular middle chapters like the original trilogy’s The Empire Strikes Back and the sequel trilogy’s The Last Jedi. Rian Johnson clearly took his inspiration from old Star Wars movies, and from what he’d been handed with The Force Awakens. But somehow, he crafted a story that feels fresher and more personal, and he boldly avoids ending on an obvious cliffhanger, in imitation of Empire. It’s no accident that at the moment, Empire and Last Jedi are the most critically beloved Star Wars movies after A New Hope. Neither of those middle films had to attend to the messy business of wrapping up and paying off a trilogy. Rise of Skywalker has to sort through that kind of messy business on an unprecedented level, since it’s also wrapping up a 40-year saga. Every Star Wars sequel or prequel has carried baggage from what came before, via mirrors, callbacks, and improbable familial connections. As the series has continued, the baggage has accumulated, giving Abrams the unenviable task of wrapping up his own movie, the full sequel trilogy, and the two previously ended trilogies all at once. But sometimes, that feels like a self-imposed sentence more than an audience mandate, as if the filmmakers are taking cues from the pseudo-finality of Avengers: Endgame. Abrams clearly aspires to both the speedy, crowd-pleasing adventure of Return of the Jedi (what Pauline Kael dismissed as a “fun machine” back in 1983) and to the sense of saga-defining inevitability that gives Revenge of the Sith its darker, more operatic momentum. Since Revenge of the Sith was already the Empire Strikes Back of the prequel trilogy, and Abrams also wants to continue with the characters he helped create in Force Awakens, this means Rise of Skywalker is essentially trying to function as all Star Wars sequels at once. Well, maybe not Attack of the Clones. (Although: that is the other Star Wars film with pivotally awkward romantic chemistry.) But yes, The Last Jedi is in there too. For all of the moments in Skywalker that can be read as walkbacks of Johnson’s work, there are plenty of times where Abrams attempts to honor that movie in the home stretch, however clumsily. The Force-fueled Skype sessions between Rey (Daisy Ridley) and Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) remain integral to the story, and so does their uneasy emotional connection with the original-trilogy characters they each parallel — Leia in Rey’s case, Darth Vader in Kylo’s. And their connection to each other is also significantly emphasized and deepened in Last Jedi, to the point where Skywalker has to see it through and find an emotional ending to their arc. While Skywalker retcons Rey’s supposed lack of a fancy lineage, Abrams does try to retain some humbler origins by revealing that Finn (John Boyega) is Force-sensitive. He was a Stormtrooper in the past, but could possibly become a Jedi in the future. Whether he does or doesn’t, his building Force abilities make a strong argument that individuals’ choices matter more than their history. They also pay off Johnson’s Last Jedi idea that Force users can come from anywhere. So it’s not that Abrams seems determined to finish the saga without input from Last Jedi. He apparently just felt obligated to sequelize and tie up far more than just his immediate cinematic predecessor. Skywalker shares that problem with the other Star Wars finales, in different ways. Return of the Jedi plays off the first trilogy’s greatest hits, dealing with the fallout from Empire’s dramatic I-am-your-father revelation as it happily recreates the zip of the first film. Like Empire, it’s better-regarded now than it was upon release, benefitting from the way so many latter-day fans experienced the original trilogy as a single work, easier to watch and love as a cohesive whole than when doled out over the course of years. Revenge of the Sith reversed that trajectory, critically speaking. It got pretty great reviews in 2005, as it broadened the scope of the prequels to tie further into the original trilogy. But in the years since, it’s been recategorized as just another clunky Star Wars prequel, fodder for windbaggy video analysis on YouTube and the occasional fan defense. (This reputation sells all three prequels short; it’s especially unfair to Sith’s downbeat grandeur.) Rise of Skywalker refers to both of the previous trilogy wrap-ups, though the greatest hits of Return of the Jedi fittingly receive more attention from Hollywood’s most successful cover-band filmmaker. Abrams mirrors Return’s entire climax, with the hero facing off against Palpatine’s super-powered fascism, while her friends stage a dramatic siege on the bad guys’ mega-weapon. Sith gets quoted in part to hand-wave away a plot point also connected to Return of the Jedi: a repeated line from Sith about how “the dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities that some consider to be unnatural” is meant to explain how Palpatine continues to quasi-live even after he was chucked down the shaft of an exploding space station at the end of Episode VI. Skywalker mirrors Revenge of the Sith in another, subtler way. Sith opens with a large-scale rescue sequence, where Jedi partners Obi-wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker rescue Chancellor Palpatine (oops!) from the openly villainous General Grievous. Though much of the film heads inexorably toward tragedy, this passage is both a wonderfully sustained bit of swashbuckling action-adventure, and an oddly touching glimpse at the brotherly closeness between Obi-wan and Anakin. Rise of Skywalker echoes that breakneck-yet-bittersweet quality, sending Rey, Finn, and Poe on their only real on-screen adventure as a trio, racing through a fast-paced, banter-heavy first hour. Both Sith and Skywalker take fond last looks at their droid heroes. R2-D2 proves his mettle again in the opening section of Sith, a treat for longtime fans. C-3PO gets his biggest role since the original trilogy in Abrams’ new movie. C-3PO’s story in Episode IX has a meta dimension, reviving his fussy-nuisance shtick from the original trilogy (minus some of the bile) before requiring a reset of his memory in order to access a crucial bit of McGuffin-hunting information. Halfway through the movie, the cyclical adventures of the new Star Wars generation becomes all new to Threepio, who regards his friends with freshly rebooted eyes and renewed skepticism over their recklessness. At the same time, his pre-erasure willingness to sacrifice his memories for the greater good carries an unexpected poignancy, even if Abrams isn’t willing to commit to the idea. (It’s a lighter version of the new trilogy’s favorite overused trick: the fake-out pretend death. It also misses the opportunity to restore C-3PO’s wiped memory of the prequels!) Here and at several other key moments — the reclaimed Solo-ish gestures of a reformed Kylo Ren, say — Abrams and co-writer Chris Terrio realize an inspired hybridization of Return of the Jedi’s chummy sense of fun and Sith’s heavier sense of series history. They acknowledge the formulaic pleasures of this space-serial adventure, as well as their characters’ willingness and desire to break free of old patterns. At its best, this lends Rise of Skywalker a prismatic effect. At its worst, the new movie searches for its own homegrown sense of inevitability, and comes up short. The solution to Rey’s Palpatine dilemma — how she can defeat this massive evil without becoming what she most fears and loathes — amounts to a massive hedge, a Jedi-inflected version of the old action-movie cliché of a hero killing in semi-passive self-defense. Though Return to Jedi retreated into the safety of hug-ready Ewoks, the cuddliest versions of Han and Leia, and another Death Star run, it also featured Luke Skywalker throwing down his lightsaber and rejecting hatred in the face of withered Sith evil. Rey rejects Palpatine by lending her lightsaber to Kylo for a few minutes, then re-acquiring it so she can use two lightsabers to push away Palpatine’s Force lightning. That ending converts emotional turmoil into physical mechanics. It’s no surprise that Rey defeats Palpatine, nor does it need to be. Not much that happens in Return of the Jedi or Revenge of the Sith is especially surprising — Empire and Last Jedi have to take the burden of creative surprises. But the Skywalker filmmakers seem to arrive at their own conclusion by process of elimination, where anything too far afield from previous movies has been crossed off a brainstormed list. To some degree, Skywalker seems self-aware about this. Abrams and Terrio know they’re evoking memories of earlier films and competing with them at the same time. Yet the retreads of Return of the Jedi and the self-referential “rhyming” of Revenge of the Sith both extend their reach further into the world outside of fantasy and fandom. Luke’s decisions in Return of the Jedi have some philosophical depth, and Sith is explicitly about a society complicit in its own descent into a fascist state. The newest finale gins up some resonance about the vigilance required to keep fascism from rising again, but it’s mostly secondhand, almost incidental.  Rise of Skywalker’s reverence for the past may be necessary in a way Abrams and company probably didn’t intend. They’re out to placate the fans, but instead, they may be helping to banish this saga, in this form, from movies. More than either previous series wrap-up, this finale has been made with a strong awareness that more big-screen Star Wars will eventually follow. To its credit, the film still feels conclusive. Revenge of the Sith ends with a lot of good guys dead, but the key characters from the original trilogy — Obi-wan, Yoda, Vader — had to survive. Return of the Jedi similarly ends with a lot of good guys surviving. But the sequel trilogy methodically kills off Han, Luke, and Leia in spite of their respective curtain calls, and manages not to feel too grim about it. Fusing the fun-machine exhaustion and mythic grandeur of the other trilogy-cappers turns Rise of Skywalker into a messy exorcism. It’s by turns delightful, muddled, cathartic, and frustrating, sometimes within the same scene. And what could be more post-1977 Star Wars than that? The series’ final shot, true to Skywalker’s everything-to-everyone nature, mashes up the final shot of Revenge of the Sith (itself an homage to the famous two-moon horizon of the first Star Wars) and a strong image from The Force Awakens, with a dash of the Force-ghost finale from Return of the Jedi. Blurring the iconography of Rey and BB-8 into that of their predecessors is simultaneously heartening and a little sad, like a blip from C-3PO’s erased, restored, imperfect memory. With three trilogies, a renewable fan base, and money to be made, Star Wars is always beginning again, and always ending again. In its imperfect way, Rise of Skywalker captures those endless endings perfectly. With the saga over, maybe the next chapter can find a way to end better."
"Jan 6, 2020",negative,"The movie is so determined to be all things to all people that it overstuffs itself, becoming more of a Star Wars fan collage than a movie on its own terms."
"Jan 6, 2020",neutral," Starring: Carrie Fisher, Mark Hamill, Adam Driver, Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, Anthony Daniels, Naomi Ackie, Domhnall Gleeson, Richard E. Grant, Lupita Nyong'o, Keri Russell, Joonas Suotamo, Kelly Marie Tran, Ian McDiarmid, and Billy Dee Williams. The Skywalker Saga comes to an end, nearly 42 years after it began, with the ninth and final episode in the main Star Wars series. The Rise of Skywalker banks on franchise nostalgia for a finale designed to please fans while playing it safe and suffering, perhaps, as a consequence. The film begins with the revelation that Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) somehow survived the events of Return of the Jedi (1983) – presumably by jumping through a convenient loophole – and has now assembled a fleet of Star Destroyers to decimate the Resistance and establish a Final Order.  Rey (Daisy Ridley) – who has been training under the watchful eye of General Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher) – joins defected storm trooper Finn (John Boyega) and Commander Poe (Oscar Isaac) as well as Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo), BB-8, and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels), to find and stop Palpatine while continuing her tussle with Kylo Ren (Adam Driver). But everything ends up feeling rushed, even though the movie has a nearly two and a half hour running time to handle all its storylines. There are parts that could have been written and presented more deftly, and unnecessary arcs – like C-3PO’s Sith text issues, for instance – that could have been exorcised altogether without losing anything from the story. Also, for a film with this much action and destruction, The Rise of Skywalker is oddly vacant and short on excitement and poignancy. The climactic battle isn’t as edge-of-the-seat exciting as it should be, while the rest of the proceeds lack impact, possibly because they lack permanence; several times the film presents a touching or powerful moment, and then, a few minutes later, promptly undoes that development. J. J. Abrams mostly chooses to bask in throwback nostalgia and brings back familiar faces without managing to do anything particularly interesting along the way. His competent but risk-averse approach keeps the film from going in an inventive direction. There are moments that feel contrived, and the script’s sharpness is often lacking, as is character development for intriguing players like Finn who aren’t used to their full potential. Carrie Fisher’s parts – put together using unseen footage fragments – leave you wishing we could have seen the movie that would’ve been made if she had still been alive. The choice of primary antagonist also has a significant impact on the rest of the series, and not necessarily in a positive way. That said, there is fun to be had in Episode IX, and there are many elements of this action-packed finale that fans will enjoy. But the sequel trilogy, on the whole, feels a bit mismanaged.  The Rise of Skywalker ultimately leaves you with the feeling that things might have been more consistent and powerful if the three films were better planned, helmed by one filmmaker, and managed to strike a finer balance between creativity and fan service. Andrew Lloyd Webber’s long-running stage musical Cats makes its way to the big screen in the form of a bizarrely poor film, the pure awfulness of which simply boggles the mind. The musical basically shows anthropomorphic cats – or what are supposed to be cats but rather look like creepy pointy-eared humanoid extra-terrestrials – auditioning to be picked for the chance to … die and be reincarnated, I guess?  The plot – or what passes for a plot here – finds the Jellicle cats tribe introducing themselves via song and dance in the annual Jellicle Ball, hoping that their leader Old Deuteronomy (Judi Dench) will choose them as the one who gets to go to Heaviside Layer and be granted a new life, while the villainous Macavity (Idris Elba) plans to kidnap the other contestants so that he can win by default. What should be a delightfully quirky romp quickly turns into a nightmarish fever dream instead. The CGI descends to the depths of the uncanny valley.  The (almost non-existent) story is as incoherent as it is bonkers. The songs are unmemorable, the dance sequences badly shot. Cats may work on stage (although based on this cinematic atrocity, it’s hard to tell why the musical has been so popular), but onscreen, the whole project feels like a giant misuse of T. S. Eliot’s whimsical poetry.  The cast seems to comprise of actors who can’t sing and singers who can’t act. Stars are crammed into the film for no real reason (other than marketing?), including a glorified cameo by Taylor Swift (in a brief appearance as Bombalurina), who makes zero impact with a performance that would have gone unnoticed were it not for her fame. Rebel Wilson (who plays the lazy Jennyanydots) gets what is possibly the most poorly conceived sequence of the film. Judi Dench’s monologue at the end is bewildering. Meanwhile the overwrought Jennifer Hudson (who plays the ostracised Grizabella) seems to be in an entirely different movie altogether. Tom Hopper (who previously did an uneven job with Les Miserables) has basically delivered a case study in how not to make a movie. The fact that this CGI-drenched live-action version was made altogether is baffling in itself, seeing how the material is clearly better suited for an Aristocats-style animated adaptation. And the fact that they managed to mess up literally every aspect of the project is almost intriguing."
"Jan 6, 2020",positive,"J.J. Abrams had the arduous task to tie up loose ends not just for The Rise of Skywalker's two predecessors, but the entire Saga."
"Jan 3, 2020",negative," I run at warp speed up the escalator and across the lobby, open the door to the auditorium, and there's Luke, Han, Leia and Chewbacca, trapped in the trash compactor. It's the summer of 1977. In one of my first movie-going memories, my parents take my brother and me to Plaza Las Américas in Hato Rey, Puerto Rico, for a matinee showing of ""Star Wars."" Not ""A New Hope."" Not ""Episode IV."" Just plain ""Star Wars."" Walking into a movie at the halfway point was a common practice that, thankfully, has gone the way of Jabba the Hut, and so three years later, my brother and I made sure we saw ""The Empire Strikes Back"" from beginning to (traumatic) cliffhanger. I was upset at how much my beloved Rebels suffered, and even more upset I'd have to wait three more years to see how it all turned out. Of course, I came around on ""Empire,"" and even Mom came around on the Skywalker saga when we took her to see ""Return of the Jedi"" at the second-run Roosevelt, also in Hato Rey. Despite the modest nature of the bargain-priced theater, I still felt that tingle in my stomach, restless with anticipation as to what George L. was going to show me that day. In my case, for the second time. I felt some of that frisson of the unexpected two years ago when I saw ""The Last Jedi"" (aka Episode VIII), an unfairly maligned chapter (also a tad overpraised in some circles) that showed ""Looper"" director Rian Johnson taking risks that are all too rare in a franchise of this magnitude. So before delving into the many, many ways ""Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker,"" the ninth and (ostensibly) final entry in this four-decades-in-the-making sci-fi epic, goes astonishingly wrong, let's begin with what it gets right. At heart, Lucas took aspects from John Ford's ""The Searchers,"" Akira Kurosawa's ""The Hidden Fortress"" and the matinee serials he grew up on as points of departure for him and his screenwriting collaborators to tell a generations-spanning tale of a dysfunctional family that bears a resemblance to our own, despite being separated across vast chasms of space and time. It wasn't just the newness of the technology or the expertly staged action that kept drawing audiences to the theaters again and again. It's how Lucas and his team made us see ourselves in these characters, particularly when he turned the one who was initially portrayed as pure evil into a remorseful father. Despite that he was an extreme case of damaged goods, Dad discovered he still felt something for his children. Could that possibly be love? Director J.J. Abrams, returning to the director's chair after making ""The Force Awakens"" (aka Episode VII) understands this cornball sentiment is not something to shy away from but embrace wholeheartedly. But what's missing this time is a creative spark, the kind of overarching vision that weaved together the two prior trilogies, even Lucas' much-maligned prequels. Without that backbone mapping out how the events will unfold, it lays bare that the team behind ""Skywalker"" is making things up as they go along.  As a result, viewers invariably end up thinking more about the behind-the-scenes turmoil that has plagued the franchise since Disney bought Lucasfilm back in 2012 than whatever is happening onscreen. ""The Rise of Skywalker"" picks up some time after the events of ""The Last Jedi,"" which ended with the Resistance in tatters and the First Order, aka the fascistic regime born out of the embers of the Galactic Empire, hot on their tails and finalizing plans to snuff out those pesky Rebels once and for all. A shrewd director would incorporate aspects from both ""Force Awakens"" and ""The Last Jedi,"" striking a balance between the familiar comforts of the former and the bold departures of the latter. But Abrams, working from a screenplay credited to him and ""Argo"" scribe Chris Terrio, shows little to no interest in further developing the intriguing, politically minded strands Johnson cultivated in his imperfect but engrossing entry. A Jedi can come from anywhere, and the future of this galaxy rests on the oppressed masses ready to rise up against the soul-crushing overlords, ""Last Jedi"" posited with an eye on ensuring the series continued to evolve. In ""Rise of Skywalker,"" Abrams and Terrio react to these concepts with a collective ""that's nice, but no, thanks,"" reverting instead to the wall-to-wall fan service that hampered ""Force Awakens."" Abrams' heart is clearly in the right place, but he's supplanted the curiosity Johnson brought to the table with franchise fatigue.  Familiar faces and new characters once again fight for screen time, some amounting to little more than window dressing, as the central heroic trio of spunky Rey (Daisy Ridley), steadfast and loyal Finn (John Boyega), and raffish and brash Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) cross paths and square off against the brooding, tortured Kylo Ren (the ubiquitous Adam Driver), all while going on yet another scavenger hunt that is even more generic and forgettable than in previous installments. The big selling point here, already spoiled in trailers and TV spots, in addition to Carrie Fisher's final onscreen moments as General Leia, is the return of Emperor Palpatine, apparently reanimated from the ashes of previous script drafts. Once again played by Ian McDiarmid, the character has the potential to wrap its tendrils around this tired and stale cash cow to at least give it a sinister jolt, but Abrams and Terrio give him nothing to do but assume stock villain duties, leading to scenarios that feel like déja  vu all over again. (Richard E. Grant fares better at twirling his mustache as the ruthless General Pryde.) The real Frankenstein monster attempting to pull the strings turns out to be ""The Rise of Skywalker"" itself. The more it grafts aspects from its eight predecessors onto its frenetic, slapped-together narrative, the more impersonal it becomes. There are a couple of interesting ideas tossed around, like a heretofore unseen way of using warp speed, but they are abandoned as soon as they're introduced. You feel your goodwill eroding like the sands of Tatooine, well before a conclusion that feels at once preordained and undercooked. Even the chemistry between the younger actors feels halfhearted, their stabs at humor feeble. Most dispiriting of all, their quest for personal fulfillment is barely explored. Dameron's proclivities and Finn's separate (unrequited?) yearnings, in particular, are hinted at in timid, wholly unsatisfying ways before Abrams attempts to tie everything up in a bow without answering any vital questions. But as much as you may want ""The Rise of Skywalker"" to grow a pair and take ""Star Wars"" into the future, it remains irreparably stuck in the past. The resistance has been squashed by Disney's evil empire, it pains me to report, and no one is more crushed than my inner sci-fi/fantasy geek that this once influential, precedent-setting series has gotten lost in the firmament. THEATER: The actor nominated for a Tony Award for his portrayal as Mrs. Doubtfire in the Broadway musical comes to Fort Lauderdale in the national tour. Michelle F. Solomon has the review."
"Jan 3, 2020",negative,"Neither Abrams nor Johnson, who have more than proven their skills as filmmakers on other occasions, are guilty of a trilogy's failure that, of course, originated without a true narrative purpose. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Jan 3, 2020",negative," The ninth and final outing in this 42-year-long Star Wars saga is a step up from The Last Jedi two years ago but still a disappointment – but, then again, how could it not be?  With The Force Awakens writer, director and producer J.J. Abrams replacing The Last Jedi’s Rian Johnson (a public whipping-boy for that one, although it wasn’t that bad), this reunites the new characters, drags in some old familiar faces, ties up loose ends and builds, at length, to what should be one of the grandest finales in all American cinema. But it isn’t really. Even more dispiriting than the movie itself, however,
are the rabid legions of Star Wars fans out there – amongst the most
toxic in the world today – who’ll be screaming apoplectically about this until
the next, essentially unrelated movie comes along in a few years time. Don’t
you wish they’d all grow the Hell up? Without mentioning any spoilers, we open with Supreme
Leader of the First Order Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) travelling to discover the
origins of a mysterious voice he keeps on hearing. Ren, like Voldemort, Freddy
Kruger and Godzilla, simply won’t die, and Driver has trouble making him as
commanding as he really should be; he comes on less like a Shakespearean
villain and more a sullen teenager. Which Ren kind of is, actually. Finn (John Boyega), Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) and
Chewbacca (now played by Joonas Suotamo) are off in the Millennium Falcon,
while Rey (Daisy Ridley) is Jedi-ing around as General Leia (Carrie Fisher)
contributes sagely advice. The late, great Fisher has been gone for three years
now and the role has been somewhat macabrely constructed here by way of unused
footage, soundbites and stand-ins, and therefore Leia feels disconnected from
the action. Abrams, as if feeling that her unreality must be acknowledged, even
has her say, “Nothing’s impossible.” Finn, Poe and Rey unite and set up a basic love
triangle, which will disappoint some LGBT audiences who hoped the guys might
have more of a bi-curious bromance, and a basic, call-back-heavy plot kicks in
as they venture forth alongside C-3PO (Anthony Daniels once again) to take on
Ren and his Dark-Side-ish types, which now include a sneering Richard E. Grant,
no less, as Allegiant General Pryde. And it all feels just a little
underwhelming, but John Williams’ done-to-death score swells to hopefully
convince you that you are indeed having an awesome experience, and Ridley, in
particular, acts her heart out. But, 42 years after the first Star Wars (or Episode
IV, or whatever), this can’t help but feel like a bit of a fizzer,
partially because of the fact that, back in 1977, no one had ever seen a movie
like Star Wars – and now we see them all the damn time, week in, week
out. And yes, they’re often better."
"Jan 3, 2020",neutral," ""The surviving Resistance faces the First Order once more as Rey, Finn and Poe Dameron's journey continues. With the power and knowledge of generations behind them, the final battle commences."" It’s all come down to this. Forty-two years of storytelling. A trilogy of trilogies. The end of the Skywalker Saga. JJ Abrams returned to the franchise following Colin Trevorrow's exit in a move that some considered to be safe – however, Abrams promised a newer, bold approach this time around. But, the big question is, did the movie deliver? The Rise of Skywalker certainly takes risks and ventures into some surprising places, but it all felt...rushed and slightly underwhelming. Maybe it was the huge expectations or probably the frantic pace and messy script that Abrams and Chris Terrio concocted but the movie never felt fully at ease with itself. Major plot points and characters were introduced without real explanation and, at times, contradicted themselves and established lore whilst other characters were sidelined almost entirely – the need to tie nine movies together and the existing elements from the sequel trilogy seemed almost too big of an ask at times. That said, The Rise of Skywalker is an awful lot of fun if you simply sit back and enjoy the spectacle – the spirit that made Star Wars so great is present here. The action scenes are excellent (there are plenty of lightsaber battles to enjoy), the VFX are a joy to look at and, funnily enough, that breakneck pace aids the narrative at times (especially early on, the opening fifteen-minute salvo is superb). Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley put in great performances in their final run-outs as Kylo Ren and Rey and the entire cast back them up with fine displays (the digitally-added Carrie Fisher just about feels right too). The good outweighs the bad, but the movies biggest flaw is in its returning villain (as heard in the trailers), it’s a huge addition that when all is said and done, complicates the previous movies and adds a video game-like quality to the conclusion of the movie. As a saga concluding effort, The Rise of Skywalker isn’t the roaring, perfect send-off we’d hoped for but it’s still a fun, sometimes exhilarating, adventure and helps to remind us why Star Wars will live on."

"Jan 2, 2020",negative," Las altas expectativas generadas por el último capítulo de esta saga, que inició hace 42 años, se vieron derrumbadas después de los 143 minutos que dura la aventura intergaláctica de Star Wars. Episodio IX:El ascenso de Skywalker, ya que aunque el director J.J. Abrams y el guionista Chris Terrio apelaron a la nostalgia, al traer de nueva cuenta a personajes como el Emperador Palpatine, Han Solo, Luke Skywalker o Lando Calrissian, el filme jamás terminó de arrancar. Aunque resulta ser la cinta más corta de esta tercera trilogía, ubicada en la era de la Resistencia, lo realizado por Abrams se siente largo, cansado y por momentos sin concretar algo que pueda erizar la piel. Las batallas entre Rey y Kylo Ren, quienes podrían ser considerados los personajes que definirían el rumbo del capítulo, son de lo más simples y no provocan emoción. Si a esto se le suman algunos problemas de continuidad y lógica, como cuando Rey atraviesa un embravecido mar y llega seca a su destino, sin una gota de agua que le escurra, el resultado es poco alentador. Los fans de hueso colorado han defendido el episodio IX bajo el argumento de esa nostalgia perdida y por algunas sorpresas sobre los orígenes de Rey o cameos como el del compositor John Williams. Sin embargo, si se ve con mirada fría, este último capítulo es de lo peor de toda la saga. Una lástima para cerrar una historia que inició en una lejana galaxia ubicada en 1977."

"Dec 31, 2019",positive," After four years, the latest Star Wars trilogy is finally coming to an end. While the death of major characters were expected, some were still shocking and others were difficult to accept. However, the real-life passing of original franchise star Carrie Fisher hit everyone hard as it meant she would never see the end of the series to which she was such an important contributor. Yet, General Leia Organa would still play a major role in the final chapter as the latest Skywalker saga comes to an end in Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker. Having regrouped after the devastating attack on their fleet, the Resistance is relying on information from an Imperial spy to determine their next move. However, obtaining the intelligence requires Chewie (Joonas Suotamo), Finn (John Boyega) and Poe (Oscar Isaac) to fly dangerous missions throughout the galaxy, barely evading the First Order’s army. In the meantime, Rey (Daisy Ridley) is continuing her Jedi training with Leia (Fisher), though she’s often distracted by the mysteries of her past and Kylo Ren’s (Adam Driver) intrusions. Kylo is on his own dark quest to become the universe’s ultimate ruler by eliminating any threats to his leadership, which includes convincing Rey to sit next to him on the Supreme Leader’s throne.  With Disney announcing Star Wars will be taking a theatrical break, this film has the added duty of definitively wrapping up the Skywalker saga for the foreseeable future. Consequently, it needs to give audiences closure, and give each of the characters viewers have come to know and love over the past few years a fitting send-off. While everyone may not be happy about some of the trajectories, it all makes sense and fulfills its mandate of allowing audiences to leave the theatre without unanswered questions. The film opens by catching up with each of the main characters, including two major action sequences as they try to complete some aspect of their mission. From a hyper-speed chase through the galaxy to a brutal ground battle that leaves the forest floor littered with casualties, the movie gets viewers’ hearts racing early on. With the final push by the First Order at hand, there are many more confrontations in this picture as everyone is on high alert and Resistance movement of any kind triggers a cavalry. Several new personalities are also introduced throughout the picture, including a tiny, adorable alien mechanic named Babu Frik and a new, talking droid friend for BB-8 called D-O. While romance has been a low priority when compared to winning the war, there’s certainly some sparks flying between certain characters, especially in this episode as friendships are deepened, relationships are rekindled and flirtations are realized — though they’ve never really gone in for traditional fairy tale endings. New characters, however, continue to expand the universe, viewers’ understanding of it and the key personalities as they grow with each encounter. While the plotlines aren’t really surprising, they’re not entirely predictable either. Some time before a major reveal, they begin dropping hints of what’s to come, which is a great way to engage discerning audiences while still delivering jaw-dropping reveals. There’s never going to be a way to make everyone happy — particularly when it comes to some character arcs and the marginalization of others — but this film does a pretty good job of giving the people what they want.

"Dec 31, 2019",positive,They kind of went back to the feel of the original Star Wars. Even the heavy undertones still felt fun.
"Dec 31, 2019",neutral," BY DAN TABOR FILM CRITIC At the end of The Last Jedi, we witnessed Luke Skywalker sacrifice his life so the remnants of the Resistance could escape aboard the Millennium Falcon. This was after Kylo Ren promoted himself to supreme leader by killing the mysterious Snoke, and offering Rey a place at his side ruling the galaxy. Rian Johnson’s The Last Jedi made some bold choices compared to JJ Abrams’ fan service-y The Force Awakens. This created a rift between those fans that wanted a new drug and fans that wanted another hit off the Star Wars nostalgia bong. After director Colin Trevorrow (Jurassic World) was fired deep into pre-production on The Rise Of Skywalker, J.J. Abrams stepped into the breach to conclude the Skywalker trilogy he started. The Rise of Skywalker finds Kylo Ren teaming up with Emperor Palpatine, who we find out has been hiding out on a secret Sith planet, orchestrating his will through his puppet Snoke this whole time. He offers Ren the means to conquer the galaxy — an armada of planet destroying starships he calls The Final Order – but only if he kills Rey. So, begins a planet hopping cat and mouse McGuffin chase as Rey hopes to find an ancient Sith artifact that will lead her and the Resistance to Palpatine, with Kylo and the Knights of Ren hot on her trail. The Resistance only has a narrow window to launch their final all-or-nothing attack as The Final Order readies to leave the secret Sith world and destroy any planet that doesn’t fall into line. Skywalker is a dense watch, as Abrams attempts to mix info dumps, exposition and narrative to varying degrees of success and only makes sense if you’ve seen all the previous Star Wars films. The cast are all known quantities at this point with Driver being the clear standout this time around. Even with all of the changes, his is still the most consistent story arc throughout all three films as Ben Solo continues to be conflicted over which path to take. Carrie Fisher who had passed away before the end of production on The Last Jedi also posthumously returns in a leading role culled from unused footage from Jedi to help explain a major plot hole. It’s a noble gesture honestly, but it feels like fan service rather than a genuine path for Princess Leia Organa. The crux of this dense narrative is a string of reveals that work at the cost of coherence and continuity with everything that has come before. I hesitate to call it lazy writing, because I understand it was creative problem solving, an attempted solution to an unsolvable problem. J.J. Abrams wanted everyone to leave the theater happy.  But by doing so he lost the momentum, and cohesion that Johnson had handed off to him. He turned in a film that while generally okay at best, it feels like filmmaking by committee and focus group, rather than as singular vision driven by story. While I thoroughly enjoyed the further exploration of Rey and Kylo’s relationship, which is the emotional core of the film, I felt like Abrams kept getting distracted by spectacle, the need for big final reveals and lore rather than the humanity that drives these films."

"Dec 30, 2019",positive," So here we are… forty two years after the first ever Star Wars film opened in 1977, the final chapter of the Skywalker saga is released. There was a huge anticipation for Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, naturally, given its place in the franchise history as the final conclusion. In preparation for this, my hubby and I saw Return of The Jedi the night before (and we actually saw Empire Strikes Back in October as part of MN Orchestra LIVE in concert series). When I finished watching the movie, I turned to my hubby and whispered, they might as well call this franchise SPOILER ALERT (highlight to read) ‘evil space grandpas’ If you’ve seen this movie, I think you know why. Just like what I did on The Force Awakens, this post is not a review per se, more of my random thoughts about the film and the franchise as a whole, so proceed with caution if you haven’t seen the movie yet. Unsurprisingly, I have a lot of the same quibbles with this one as the 2015 movie that JJ Abrams also directed… mainly the excessive amount of nostalgia, as some critics have rightly called ‘fan pandering,’ and lack of suspense throughout. Yes there are some fun moments, but the big moments are pretty much predictable. The key phrase ‘no one’s ever really gone’ uttered by Luke Skywalker at the end of The Last Jedi came up again in this movie. Beloved Carrie Fisher returns as General Leia Organa (via the use of repurposed unreleased footage), but she’s not the only one. In fact, the entire movie is basically a road trip of sort to find a supposedly dead Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) who now resides on the planet Exegol. Apparently he’s so NOT dead after all, in fact he’s been a puppet master to Snoke, Supreme Leader of The First Order. But before Rey, Poe and Fin could get to Exegol, they had to find a device called Sith Wayfinder. I feel like that plot is basically a way to reunite Rey & co. with yet another returning character Lando Calrissian. The crew looked practically giddy to be meeting Billy Dee Williams in that scene, and vice versa, that it took me out of the movie a bit. That’s what nostalgia does… while I enjoy seeing certain actors back in a certain franchise, it distracts me from the actual story that unfolds before me. Speaking of the story… there’s a lot of ‘more of the same’ in The Rise of the Skywalker. Interesting that there were some rumbles on the interweb that JJ Abrams was subtly dissing Rian Johnson‘s The Last Jedi, saying that it was “a story that I think needed a pendulum swing in one direction in order to swing in the other.” Now, whether Abrams was throwing shade at Johnson or not, the fact of the matter is, the two filmmakers didn’t seem to see eye to eye. As a more casual fan of Star Wars, I actually like the fact that Rian had the guts to do something different and subverting the franchise. Unfortunately I’m in the minority and because many die-hard fans hated what Rian did, so naturally he’s not invited back to helm this one. The biggest ‘twist’ of this movie is in regards to Rey’s (Daisy Ridley) identity. “People keep telling me they know me. No one does,” She quipped in frustration. But her reluctant ‘nemesis’ Kylo Ren claims he does, then he just said it blatantly who her parents really are. It’s supposed to be a gasp-inducing moment, but for some reason it was just ‘meh’… in fact, Rey’s similar lineage situation that bears such resemblance to Luke’s and Kylo’s feels like convenient (read: lazy) writing to me. The part I like most about Rey when she’s first introduced in The Force Awakens is that she’s just a scavenger with no Jedi blood in her, and that her parents are just ordinary people. In The Last Jedi, Kylo himself told her ‘You come from nothing. You’re nothing’ which undeniably made him even more furious that she could wield as much power as he does. Then the ending that film (the scene with the young boy) also hinted that there are other ‘ordinary’ people with no prominent lineage who could use the Force. I love that message that people are more than who they’re born to be and where they come from, that we do have the power to become more than what’s been imagined for us. So by making Rey as a Palpatine obviously undermined the storyline that’s been set before and render many other plot points meaningless. I don’t know in what other cinematic franchise is that ever a good thing?? I have to say that the nostalgic moments have different degrees of impact. I said I enjoyed seeing Leia and Lando, and the final arc of General Leia Organa is a memorable moment. But the now decrepit Palpatine is mostly eye-roll inducing (especially since the scene of Vader throwing him down the space abyss is still fresh in my mind). Not only would it seem impossible that he survived that fall, but just when did he have time to have a son who later becomes Rey’s dad?? On top of that, he’s also mighty enough to build an entire armada and hides ALL of them from every single creature until the opportune time dictated by the script to reveal it. I barely have time to ponder on that as there’s a ton of stuff going on in this movie… the crew frenetically jumped from place to place in search of that Wayfinder thing-y, which eventually leads to the main battle between Rey and Kylo. No doubt the lightsaber duel of two crucial characters, on top of the remains of the second Death Star no less, looks epic. With the waves and torrential rain, it’s an atmospheric scene to be sure.  It’s got some wow moments, but overall the scene just didn’t have as big an emotional impact as I thought it would. SPOILER ALERT (proceed with caution as I’ll mention key plot details below)
Since Force Awakens, I’ve grown to appreciate Adam Driver more and more (you could even say he’s my current cinematic crush), but I gotta say Kylo’s got the short end of the stick here in terms of his character. Yes he’s a Darth wannabe from the start, longing to be a powerful Sith leader like his grandpa, but this final movie just renders him into nothing more than a conflicted man-child. It pains me to see Driver, who’s so excellent in Marriage Story which I saw just two months prior, barely given much to do here than looking mostly dazed and discombobulated. Now, given how powerful Rey’s become, the outcome of the duel and what she did afterwards didn’t really surprise me. In a key moment in the movie, suddenly Han Solo turned up again… Was it a dream? A hallucination? Was Kylo delirious? Does it matter?? In another nostalgic scene, Harrison Ford revisited his most famous ad-lib in Empire Strikes Back as his prodigal son struggled to find the words to say … that part made me smile, but I find this dramatic scene more schmaltzy than genuinely moving. Still, Driver at least still has a compelling arc and a dignified resolution… gone is Kylo Ren’s toxic power-hungry machismo, in the end he’s Ben Solo after all, and he’s got an honorary ‘death’ as a Jedi. But where is Rose Tico?? The spunky mechanic with a big heart had a big role in The Last Jedi… Kelly Marie Tran was a great addition to the Resistance crew. But here she’s hugely sidelined for most of the movie while Fin is off doing his heroic duty with a new compatriot, Jannah, a Resistance sympathizer. Now, Naomi Ackie is fine in the role, but I can’t help missing Rose in the journey with the Resistance fighters. Now, after teasing us for four years whether Rey will finally turn to the dark side… well, the final answer is something so utterly predictable. Once again our heroine, just like the original hero of the saga, is facing a family member [yawn]. Rey matters because she’s part of an important, all-powerful family. It’s treading familiar [and familial] grounds the fact that bloodline and lineage is the key to achieving real power, that is the ability to use the Force. Perhaps the fact that we’ve seen all before, the action-packed battle of ‘all of the Sith’ VS ‘all of the Jedi’ barely holds a candle of the original battle between Luke vs Vader/Palpatine. It’s what follows that would likely be the talking points about Rise of Skywalker… yep, it’s all about Reylo. Not satisfied with just an epic battle of good vs evil, we’ve got to have some controversial romance thrown in. I wonder how the convo goes in the Writers Room… ‘hey wouldn’t it be surreal to have Vader’s grandson making out w/ Palpatine’s granddaughter?’ I supposed Kylo’s longing look every time he sees and ‘feels’ Rey from a distance (boy that came out SO creepy) has suggested he has feelings for her from the start. And who could forget that shirtless scene during a Force-bond in The Last Jedi that bothered Rey so much she asked him to put something on? But yet, I still wasn’t prepared for the kiss… it feels like it came out of nowhere. I mean all the mutual pull between the light and dark side that haunts both these poor souls is SO massive… it took so much out of them with huge stakes on both sides that you would think romance is the last thing on their minds. Naturally plenty of fans have always wanted to ship the two of them, as Reylo has been the subject of a plethora of fan-fiction, which makes the kiss feels obligatory. There’s been a lot of shared motifs in Star Wars and Shakespeare–we’ve seen the Romeo and Juliet plot between Anakin and Padmé before, so I guess their grandson is bound to share similar fate. All in all, The Rise of Skywalker is an enjoyable but also frustrating film. I was caught up in the rousing nostalgic moments and even felt emotionally moved by some of them, but as soon as the movie’s over, I was left with an overwhelming sense of meh. It’s not a bad movie per se… I mean the actors did a good job in their roles, production design & special effects are top notch, John Williams‘ music is obviously still iconic, even Abrams’ direction is enjoyable… but at the end of the day, Chris Terrio and Abrams’ script is serviceable at best. It proves that no film, no matter how beloved the franchise it, can simply ride on nostalgia alone. At the end of the day, as a film fan, we crave innovative storytelling that sparks one’s imagination… I don’t think JJ Abrams gave us that with this one. Honestly, after nine films, I’d be hard pressed to know just what the Force is supposed to be about since the franchise’s overall narrative is so discordant and inconsistent. Perhaps it’s a good thing this is the final installment of the cinematic Skywalker saga, but of course, with Disney+, no franchise is ever really gone. Especially one as lucrative as this one. Good read Ruth. I definitely liked it more than you it seems mainly because I felt several of the things that bothered you were actually good directions for the story. Take Rey coming from no one particularly special. That’s certainly a good message, but I much prefer the dramatic tension that comes with the revelation that she is a Palpatine.  Hi Keith! Interesting that you actually like the fact that she’s a Palpatine. You thought the revelation was dramatic? It felt like it was mentioned too casually by Kylo, which is odd too as he had said previously ‘she had come from nothing.’ I wonder when he actually learned about her actual identity.  I liked the Palpatine mainly because it goes well with the rest of the series. If you think about the Palpatine and Skywalker family tension is a throughline that starts in Episode 1 and runs to the end. As for Kylo, Palpatine reveals that he has been every voice in Kylo’s head. What Kylo believed about Rey’s parents was exactly what Palpatine wanted him to believe. I think he learned her real identity at the beginning when he and Palpatine made the pact. Out of the three films of this new trilogy, this one is my favorite but that doesn’t say much since I have issues with all of them. The problem with this new trilogy is that Disney wanted to get the new films out as fast as possible and by doing so, the films has no true identity or goal. They hired a bunch of writers to write each film and when The Last Jedi backfired on them, they hired JJ back to “fix” the issues with some of the fanboys and girls had with the last film. Of course this film now also divided the fans, some who loved The Last Jedi felt they were betrayed by what Johnson came up with and the people who hated that film didn’t care for the fans service that JJ did for this film. The original trilogy had one goal and that was to show that Luke is the a Jedi and he’s the “chosen” one and for the most part all three films delivered. As terrible as the prequels were, those films also has one goal and that was to show people how Anakin becoming Darth Vader. George Lucas was in charge of the story in all of those 6 films and Disney should have done the same with this new trilogy. Hire that one writer/producer to be in charge of the story with one goal to tell but instead they had tons of writers who all came up with their own version of the story. As I’ve said many times, when there’s too many cooks in the kitchen the food won’t taste good. Lol! Interesting that we each have a favorite of the new trilogy… mine is definitely The Last Jedi. I just love what Rian Johnson did and the new characters had an emotional arc. But even Abrams and Johnson realize they simply cannot please everyone.  I actually didn’t hate the prequels, there are scenes I appreciate though overall the writing is pretty bad. But yes, the prequels had a clear goal of introducing Vader, and man the last 15 minutes when we first saw Anakin became Vader was extremely memorable to me and quite emotional too. Of course the ‘too many cooks spoil the broth’ problem has always plagues many blockbuster franchises. That’s why it’s amazing what Kevin Feige did with the Marvel movies in tying them all so well together. I agree the nostalgia was excessive and at the expense of new ideas. A big problem is Disney didn’t map out the trilogy from that start. Star Wars writer said in Vanity Fair article Rise of Skywalker does not undo The Last Jedi, and in an EW piece the writer explains why Kelly Marie Tran had a reduced role. But they definitely messed up the progression from E8 to E9 for the viewer watching back-to-back, Kelly Marie Tran and the young boy at the end you mention are not relevant in E9. Hi ya Chris! I know that the filmmakers/writers were on the defensive in regards to many people’s complaints, but at the end of the day I don’t think they could really ‘defend’ a not-so-great movie that has little imagination. I mean I thought the ending that explains the title is perhaps the only ‘new idea’ they came up with. The more I think about Rey as a Palpatine the more I dislike the movie and it sort of lessen my appreciation for the character that had been built up pretty strongly in The Force Awakens. Hi Claratsi! I like TLJ the most as well, but interesting that you didn’t care for the characters in the new trilogy. It’s true isn’t it, compared to the trio of Luke, Leia and Han, these new characters just can’t hold a candle to them. As for the proper bad guy, poor Kylo is definitely a pathetic substitute. Even Ren, Snoke and Palpatine put together still can’t compare to how amazingly-memorable Vader was. Everything about him is just so iconic. I love your comment about Palpatine being ‘parachuted in,’ sooo true!! His entire scenes basically made me roll my eyes! All a desperate attempt to rescue a very average trilogy. Agreed re: Kylo but I did find myself strangely enjoying his arc more towards the end; a better hero than a villain 🤷‍♂️ shame he’d already killed his dad though the idiot! I think on reflection that was the moment at the beginning of this trilogy were I may have checked out! I doubt it was ever gonna recover in my eyes after that! But yeh, Snoke – what was the point!?  While I did enjoy the film, I do agree that the film did lack any real suspense and stakes.  TLJ had some flaws but at least was a step in the right direction as far as taking risks and wanting to explore many things.  What J.J. did was cater to the worst group of people who mainly have sand in their vaginas as they could never be satisfied.  Honestly, fuck those fans.  If they’re not happy, fuck ’em. Well in a way I’m glad that with the release of Rise of Skywalker, I think more people began to appreciate The Last Jedi. What Rian did was extraordinary and I liked his approach in subverting the franchise while still gave us what we love about Star Wars. Film is in my blood.

"Dec 30, 2019",positive," Como era de esperar, el estreno de ‘Star Wars: el ascenso de Skywalker’ (Rise of Skywalker, 2019) ha vuelto a crear un polvorín entre los fans y los no fans de la saga, pero especialmente entre los amantes de la anterior entrega y los que no le tienen mucho aprecio, dejando que la crítica haya sido no solo menos benevolente sino especialmente destructiva e insidiosa. Algo que contrasta, claro, con la reacción de los fans.  Y es que los fans, ese ente que cada uno que da su opinión convierte en su hydra particular, son los que están recibiendo, en realidad, la mayor parte de los palos, porque según muchos análisis son el elemento tóxico que ha convertido el Episodio IX en la película más discutida, odiada y peligrosa para la paz mundial del año. En realidad, lo que se puede observar, es la misma pataleta vehemente de siempre, ahora por parte de los que consideran la Star Wars de Rian Johnson una pieza magistral (sic). Antes de entrar en analizar por qué ‘El ascenso de Skywalker’ es una gran película de aventuras espaciales, independientemente de lo que haga bien con respecto a la anterior o no, es conveniente hacer un cierto balance de por dónde van los tiros de las críticas al film de Abrams. Muchos apreciaron el valiente intento de Rian Johnson de expandir la saga y convertirla en un espectáculo más polivalente, con humor y unas supuestas rupturas con mandamientos de la saga que están más en la cabeza de algunos que en ninguna tabla de la ley. En el texto de arriba analizaba esto con profundidad, pero la idea principal es que muchos de sus avances tan solo eran exposiciones, no nada definitivo, y muchas de ellas han creado caminos en la cabeza diferentes a lo que realmente se muestra en pantalla. Por ello, las mayores críticas a ‘El ascenso de Skywalker’ se centran en como “dinamita” todo lo que supuestamente dinamitó el VIII, pero siendo llevado a extremos en los que se reinterpretan o malinterpretan aspectos de ambas películas.  Abrams tenía varias ideas plantadas para la trilogía que la segunda no desarrolló. No significa que las decisiones tomadas en el segundo capítulo quisieran romper nada. Podían posicionarse, pero son nada definitivo. Por ejemplo, Ren queda como el líder supremo en la anterior, pero no significa que no estuviera planteado que había un mal mayor detrás. No es ninguna afrenta que aparezca Palpatine, y además no es el superior de Kylo Ren, sino una nueva némesis para él. Ren pretende seguir su misión, engañándole, pero los planes reales son unirse con Rey y derrocarle, no pasa a ser un súbdito, sino un enemigo activo que juega a dos bandas, dándole una mayor dimensión al personaje. Lo mismo pasa con Rey. El hecho de que Ren diga que sus padres no son nadie en el Episodio VIII no era definitivo. Por mucho que signifique que ella no es nadie, Ren lo dice casi como una revelación para el público, y eso, dentro del contexto del film hasta rechina. ¿Qué pasa por qué sus padres no sean nadie?  Se critica que no se haya dado ninguna pista, pero, entonces ¿Cómo iba a ser una sorpresa? Por otra parte, si Luke no quiere entrenarla no es porque “no sea nadie” precisamente. Él ve su potencial, él ve que ella tiene una tendencia al lado oscuro muy fuerte y una fuerza como ninguno de sus padawan. Lo que le hace temer que le pase de nuevo lo que a Kylo Ren. El hecho de que sea heredera de un Palpatine no sale de la nada. Cuando se ve a sí misma lo hace en un oscuro e inquietante laberinto de espejo. Hay apuntes claros en el Episodio VIII. La crítica a esta línea se hace absurda cuando, además, el misterio de su origen es la propia fuerza del personaje de Rey. Su conflicto, no iba a quedar resuelto en el segundo episodio, que es un nudo. Las implicaciones de que Rey fuera sensible a la fuerza era que cualquiera puede tenerla. El niño cogiendo la escoba dejaba esa vía abierta y ampliaba las posibilidades de Disney, por cierto, de hacer más películas sin los Skywalker.  Por lo que, ese cuestionamiento de Johnson, que no es tanto un “acto valiente” como un “movimiento comercial a largo plazo”, no queda anulado. La revelación de Rey no elimina esa idea de que cualquiera puede tener la fuerza. De hecho, Abrams tiene muy en cuenta la lección de la anterior y la aplica a un personaje cuyo conflicto había, literalmente, muerto con la caída de Phasma. Finn, un niño huérfano secuestrado para ser un soldado imperial se encuentra con otros como él mientras se da cuenta de que tuvo ese presentimiento gracias a… la fuerza.  Esta idea conecta con la idea de “los niños con escoba” del final de la de Johnson y al final son ellos el apoyo revolucionario que se dejaba entrever y, de hecho, se expande con el sometimiento de la primera orden en el planeta Kijimi y se refuerza con el personaje de Zorii Bliss. Además, esta idea inspirada por la muerte de Luke Skywalker es la que lleva a los rebeldes a hacer aliados por toda la galaxia en su escena final, por lo que no, el acto de Luke no fue en vano. En otros comentarios se critica que se recupere el aspecto honorable de la orden Jedi, tras dejar quemar el árbol y, de nuevo supuestamente, los libros sagrados. Es gracioso porque el propio Johnson deja la idea de que eso no es tan significativo ya que hay un plano al final del Episodio VIII, en el Halcón Milenario, en el que se muestra claramente un cajón en el que Rey ha cogido los volúmenes para completar su entrenamiento y seguir estudiando. Vamos, que el Episodio IX tan solo continúa la idea del entrenamiento que insinuaba la anterior. La idea de que Luke estuvo buscando a Dark Sidious también está en los libros que Johnson dejó como gancho, por lo que no se acaba de entender demasiado bien por qué se habla de que esto sale de la nada. Pero lo más extraño es que lo que decía Luke en el Episodio VIII sobre acabar con los Jedi se toma de forma literal, como si fuera el mantra de la película y no  consecuencia del tormentoso conflicto del personaje. Cuando Luke aparece como fantasma de la fuerza para agarrar el sable hay una respuesta poética a su desprecio de este en el anterior. Obviamente, cuando Luke se redime en el final de la de Johnson cambia su parecer. Cuando Luke decía que “los jedi tienen que morir” habla su parte amargada, con miedo —como bien indica ahora que se ha liberado— su parte que desprecia su sable láser. Pero esto cambia con su aparición final. En su holograma, empuña el sable láser azul (o se proyecta con él) que acompañó a su padre, y molesta a Ren por ser el de su abuelo, por lo que la imagen habla por sí sola.  Por ello, no tiene sentido que ahora siga despreciando la fuerza, los sables y el ser un Jedi después de superar su miedo y romper el muro a la fuerza que ha construido. Cuando ahora reconoce que es un arma noble, se lo dice a Rey con sorna paternal, usando el sentido del humor que define su personaje y haciendo énfasis en la desilusión especular de Rey en ese momento. La crítica a lo que hace no es una corrección de nada, sino que indica que muchos ni siquiera han entendido bien su doloroso y bello arco de caída y redención en el octavo capítulo. El síndrome de “ensayo y error” de Jar Jar Binks fue un caso muy sonado en el 99. En aquel momento nadie se quejó de que el terrible bicho desapareciera en la trilogía de Lucas, pero no se ha aceptado tan bien que Rose tenga tan poco protagonismo en esta entrega por la respuesta tan nociva contra la actriz que tuvo su inclusión en la segunda parte. El hecho de que Kelly Marie Tran tuviera que abandonar twitter es tan lamentable como los insultos racistas a Leslie Jones por ‘Cazafantasmas’ (2016). Pero si nos ceñimos al ámbito cinematográfico, la drástica reducción de tiempo en el tercer acto es lógica por la necesidad de centrar el capítulo en Rey-Ren y cerrar los arcos de Poe y Finn. Rose tiene relevancia en el segundo episodio porque es un personaje-vehículo para cambiar a Finn, cuyo plan es desertar. Rose no estaba escrita para tener otro desarrollo más que el de ser, nada menos, que segunda de mando de la rebelión junto a Leia. Que el capítulo se centre en Rey, Poe y Finn y los junte por primera vez es orgánico y lógico. Otro elemento cuestionado es el desfile de caras conocidas, apariciones y reminiscencias de otras películas de la saga. El agotador debate de cada entrega, que aquí está bastante justificado por cerrar una historia de nueve películas y atar muchos cabos al mismo tiempo de servir de despedida para muchos. Pero es que esas apariciones tienen sentido. El recuerdo de Han Solo surge en un momento determinante, es tremendamente significativo para el segundo personaje de la trilogía y tiene una coda natural para una muerte que creó terremotos de tinta. Resulta cínico que sea a esta entrega, la única de las tres que no se ajusta al esquema de ningún episodio de la trilogía original —‘El despertar de la fuerza’ se ajustaba al Episodio IV y ‘Los últimos Jedi’ quería ser desesperadamente ‘El imperio contraataca’— y vuela más libre, a la que se le acuse de regodearse en la nostalgia. Además, sin ir más lejos, la misma aparición “sorpresa” de esta se hacía en la anterior con Yoda, para después plantear un ataque con At-At a la base rebelde en un planeta en el que se cambia la nieve por sal.  Y no solo eso, ‘El despertar de la fuerza’ era la película de Han Solo, y ‘Los últimos Jedi’ de Luke, mientras que la muerte de Carrie Fisher ha impedido que esta sea completamente de Leia, por lo que el peso se ha apoyado plenamente en los materiales verdaderamente originales de esta nueva trilogía, Rey y Kylo Ren. Es su película y solo suya, sin embargo Abrams es generoso con el legado de la saga y trata de hacer algunas reverencias finales, pero en cantidad de minutos cualquiera de las anteriores tiene más elementos del pasado.  Otra de las “revoluciones” del Episodio VIII fue la inclusión de variaciones del uso de la fuerza que cabrearon muchísimo a los fans que decían que Luke no podía enviar su “holograma” a distancia, o que los encuentros de Rey y Kylo por su vinculación de la fuerza no eran posibles. Mientras Abrams es tachado de cobarde en medios de renombre, sus personajes no solo tienen encuentros con la fuerza sino que son capaces de teletransportar objetos en esas conexiones.  Algo que Johnson apuntaba con unas gotas de lluvia, aquí se convierte en un punto de trama definitivo al final, en una recreación fantástica del momento ‘Jungla de Cristal’ (Die Hard, 1988) de Bruce Willis, escondiendo un arma en su espalda en el enfrentamiento final. Pero no solo eso, sino que además, se atreve con nuevos poderes como la sanación haciendo una “transfusión” de fuerza e incluso la nigromancia propiamente dicha. Esto coincide con los poderes de Baby Yoda que aparecen el último episodio de ‘The Mandalorian’, estrenado dos días antes de la película, y que, curiosamente, nadie critica por su uso de la fuerza fuera del canon. En efecto, Abrams se muestra entusiasmado por los juguetes que le ha cedido Johnson y si no los utiliza de la misma manera —ojo a la influencia de Leia en su hijo Ben— los lleva más allá. Si esto es ir remando en contra del anterior, si es tratar de anular sus avances, queda en la cancha del espectador.  Confundir “fan service” con “hacer una buena película de Star Wars” desafía el cómo funcionan ciertas normas de la creación artística, desde el diseño gráfico al arte. Las limitaciones son una herramienta. Si Rothko hace cuadros con tres colores, hacer un cuadro con una paleta de 10 colores no va a hacer un mejor cuadro de Rothko, de hecho, es un signo de que quizá el artista que se apoya en todos los elementos a sus disposición, suple una falta de capacidad de crear de forma armónica con elementos sencillos. “Simple is hard” que dice Scorsese. ‘El Ascenso de Skywalker’ entiende que la subversión de las expectativas no es sinónimo de buena narrativa, y por supuesto que en ese sentido enmienda el trabajo de Johnson. Tiene una finalidad de llegar al final como un tercer acto. El problema es que ‘Los últimos Jedi’ jugaba a la sorpresa y la ruptura por razones que no tienen que ver con participar en una historia que va más allá del microcosmos de esa misma obra. Las subtramas de la anterior, con la búsqueda del código o la traición, no tenían un propósito global y, en retrospectiva, en una visión general, y ahora se muestran como un relleno. Se le ha achacado también que no es más que una gymkana de un sitio a otro, una persecución constante en el que en las prisas de los personajes se reflejan las prisas de la producción, pero no se aclara en estos comentarios que, precisamente toda 'El ascenso de Skywalker' es una misión contrareloj. A diferencia de otras entregas de la saga en las que el deadline aparece en el tercer acto, aquí surge desde un primer momento. Solo quedan 16 horas para que la orden final, un brillante juego con la solución final del tercer Reich, se desate. Por ello, el guion de Abrams y Terrio puede estar sobrecargado, puede tener problemas de atropellamiento y saturación de información, pero todas las sorpresas, incluso la no muerte de Chewbacca, tienen un propósito en la historia, todo se mueve en la misma dirección y acompaña a las ideas de ‘El despertar de la fuerza’. Cada misión de cada personaje acaba en un mismo vórtice que contribuye en algo al espectacular clímax del film. Incluso en cada escena de acción hay cierto propósito que se mueve con los sentimientos de los protagonistas. El trabajo de mímica de Ridley y Driver hace que sus peleas con sable sean algo más que una coreografía artística en una sala roja estéticamente bonita. Hay un propósito casi en cada golpe de espada, y la intensidad de sus ataques va acorde a la interpretación de movimientos, lenguaje corporal y gestos. Puede que no dirija tan bien, pero Abrams es un narrador visual puro y trabaja con la funcionalidad y la integración y el resultado es clasicista y dinámico.  ‘El ascenso de Skywalker’ sorprende por su honestidad, al querer ir de frente con sus elementos de folletín y de aventuras clásicas a lo H. Rider Haggard, película de Indiana Jones (hasta en el atuendo de Poe Dameron) con veloces diálogos a lo Howard Hawks y síntesis de todo lo que ha hecho la saga memorable. Un ritmo afiladísimo y escenas de acción visualmente apabullantes, estéticamente atemporales, que se ajustan al de los grandes finales de sagas al estilo de ‘El señor de los anillos’ o la propia ‘Vengadores: Endgame’ (Avengers: Endgame, 2019). La diferencia con el final de Marvel es su trabajo hacia la fisicidad con una limitación de efectos digitales en personajes que la vuelve a acercar a lo terrenal, evitando estampidas animales de CGI. También incluye incursiones en naves de la primera orden, y trama de espionaje con la revelación del traidor, un elemento que aparece desde el principio y sorprende, pero afirmar que está sacado de la nada es no haber prestado atención al último plano de Domhnall Gleeson en ‘Los últimos Jedi’ y cómo le trata Ren, en general, durante todo el metraje de esta. El final se mueve irremediablemente a ‘El retorno del Jedi’ pero se desarrolla de forma diferente, con ese planeta fantasma con arquitectura salida de un relato de Lovecraft, y pura atmósfera de horror cósmico. El romance gótico con ecos a Emily Brönte y el final trágico con una estampa como la piedad es un cierre perfecto para los dos personajes principales. Pero la clave está en cómo conecta toda la saga y le da un nuevo sentido a todas las películas con respuestas sobre los Sith en su escena final de misa negra satánica espacial. La última confrontación del Emperador y Rey enfrenta a todos los caballeros Jedi y los Sith encarnados en ellos, de alguna forma se reúnen muchas generaciones en los últimos representantes vivos, asistiendo a una batalla minimalista para cerrar, gracias a una chatarrera sin apellido, una saga que empezó hace 42 años. Las generaciones de seguidores de ‘La guerra de las galaxias’, sus hijos e incluso nietos, confluyen también en ese momento. La resolución de la batalla naval de la rebelión, se salva en el último minuto, al estilo de Dunkerque. Todo gracias a la gente de a pie unida para ayudar, como se recalca en una línea de guion que hace un saludo a los fans, tan criticados y etiquetados, con una parte de lado oscuro, pero con una buena parte de ellos cuyo único pecado ha sido amar las películas y las historias salidas de la factoría Lucas. Ahora todo se ha convertido en una propia guerra entre fans, no fans, críticos y público, opinadores y directores de cine, tuiteros, youtubers de final explicado y gente a la que no le va ni viene pero sale de la cueva una vez al año para decir que le ha parecido una mierda. Lo de siempre.  ‘El ascenso de Skywalker’ encontrará su público con el paso del tiempo, se seguirá hablando de ella y toda una generación tendrá nostalgia de Rey, Kylo Ren y su beso variación de ‘Duelo al Sol’ (Duel in the Sun, 1946). Se harán maratones especiales en el cine para rememorarla, mientras pocos recordarán las guerras clon que se sucedieron cada navidad de 2015 a 2019, cada vez que se estrenaba una de ellas. Destinada a la concordia, el Episodio IX ha creado más sangre, lo que hace preguntarnos si realmente nos merecemos más películas de ‘Star Wars’."
"Dec 30, 2019",negative," When George Lucas debuted his film “Star Wars” in 1977, no one could have predicted just how much of a sensation it would ultimately become – spawning three trilogy compilations that cover an equal number of generations, stand-alone spinoffs such as “Rogue One” and “Solo” (each tagged as a “Star Wars” story), animated television series and an accountant’s dream of merchandise-generated income. Now with “Star Wars: Episode IX, The Rise of Skywalker,” that original story line, beginning with Anakin Skywalker, proceeding with Luke Skywalker and culminating with a third and final Skywalker – not to mention the various characters surrounding this trio so strong with The Force – has seemingly come to an end. It was left to J.J. Abrams, the aging wunderkind behind the “Star Trek” reboot, to produce the final three films – referred to as the “sequel trilogy,” following the “original trilogy” and then the “prequel trilogy.” In addition to executive-producing Rian Johnson’s 2017 “Star Wars: Episode VIII, The Last Jedi,” Abrams co-wrote and directed both 2015’s “Star Wars: Episode VII, The Force Awakens” and now “The Rise of Skywalker.” Much has been written about how Johnson’s movie departed, at least a bit, from the franchise’s standard tropes – and how much furor that caused among die-hard fans. Few are likely to make similar complaints about what Abrams offers as the finale. Without divulging any spoilers, it’s enough to say that “Episode IX” continues the quest embarked upon by Rey (again played by Daisy Ridley). As part of the so-called Resistance, she – along with friends Finn (John Boyega), Po (Oscar Isaacs) and a number of others – spends the film’s two-and-a-half-hour running time searching for the source of the new tyranny threatening the galaxy. At the same time, she keeps trying (mostly in vain) to avoid her arch foe, Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), with whom she has a powerful connection that neither fully understands – but, also, that neither has the power to ignore. If you’ve seen the previous films, you can predict how things end. Maybe you won’t be able to foresee all the specifics. But it’s safe to say that “The Rise of Skywalker” doesn’t offer any real surprises – other than the deaths of some familiar characters and the resurrection of notable others. What’s more noteworthy is how Abrams has updated Lucas’ storyline to abide by 2019 mores. How women can now fill the role of hero, how characters of races traditionally seen as tertiary can now step into the spotlight and even how the very term gender – and the notion of sexual orientation itself – can be seen as naturally fluid. There is value to this, of course. The problem is that it all feels a bit too calculated, as if Abrams were merely ticking off boxes instead of portraying a “Star Wars” world in which such attitudes are intrinsic.  Give directly to The Spokesman-Review's Northwest Passages community forums series -- which helps to offset the costs of several reporter and editor positions at the newspaper -- by using the easy options below.

"Dec 30, 2019",positive,The film may feel so carefully sculpted that it lacks a sense of spontaneity or earthy honesty. But its final scenes are beautifully played.
"Dec 30, 2019",negative," What is Star Wars about, really? It’s a good question, one we’ve pondered for 42 years. Star Wars is so broad, so dense, and at times so frustratingly transparent, that you can graft just about any sort of meaning onto it. And yet, its mass appeal is often distilled to one word: Star Wars is about hope. But what does it mean to have hope? Everyone will offer a different answer. Hope can mean defiance in the face of adversity. It can mean happily ever afters. It can mean togetherness, family, friendship–those little things worth fighting for, even knowing they’re temporary. At its best, Star Wars captures that, freezing tiny moments of hope in amber. Luke, Leia, and Han hugging after the destruction of the Death Star. Anakin Skywalker clutching the face of his pregnant wife, Padmé. Finn and Poe escaping the tyrannical First Order. Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker,  the final film in this epic saga, is meant to tie a bow on the franchise, which began with A New Hope. Reasonably, one would expect those messages to come through more elegantly and emotionally than ever before. But the result is instead a sad case of confused identity. It’s a film that thinks it’s doing what it needs to, while ultimately delivering a series of rushed, soulless, and ill-defined points of logic. It’s “hopeful” if your idea of hope is tragic and cyclical to the point of feeling regurgitated. There are moments of optimism immediately staked through in heart in favor of “the next big set piece.” It’s a cruel and unsatisfying ending to a forty-year legacy, and one that feels openly critical of itself and everything it stands for, but shrugs its way to the finish line instead. The Disney era of Lucasfilm was fit more for profit than integrity from the get-go, and the need to rush out a new episodic film loaded with the original’s stars felt as bankable as it was inevitable. Suffice it to say, the Star Wars sequel trilogy attracted critics, but the first two films shuffled through a variety of production woes to successful, appealing conclusions. J.J. Abrams’ The Force Awakens paired a new cast of characters with our legacy trio–Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), Han Solo (Harrison Ford), and Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher)–creating a spark of whimsical magic that overshadowed its derivative setbacks. Rian Johnson delivered a wild animal of a sequel with The Last Jedi , a surprising and frankly revolutionary studio blockbuster that turned the series’ larger story on its head. It was as divisive as it was fertile with big, new, promising ideas. The film ended with the Force decentralized from a few exclusive bloodlines and democratized, reigniting hope in the galaxy. Unfortunately, The Rise of Skywalker picks up on none of those loose threads. The film begins with a flippant dismissal of many if not all of The Last Jedi‘s themes. The opening crawl explains that Emperor Palpatine has inexplicably returned (and I do mean inexplicably–we never learn how), and has been orchestrating the First Order experiment from the beginning. Somehow, he groomed Ben Solo into Kylo Ren from afar, and now locks his sights on Rey from Jakku, our unruly, orphaned Force user and Kylo’s counterpart. From the outset, Abrams shrinks the Star Wars universe back down to a more immediately interconnected, even insular size. Palpatine is back because, uh, sure, why not? The story plays out as antagonistically as that. Abrams, returning as co-writer/director to replace Colin Trevorrow, demonstrates a bewildering sense of his audience’s wants and needs. Does he think we don’t care about the mysterious resurrection of the saga’s most selfish and mystifying villain? Is he purposely leaving gaps in the story for canon material to fill in? Did he think a single thing out beyond “looks cool, feels OK, boom, bang?” Who knows. But the movie opens with the reintroduction of Palpatine, them immediately launches us into the Millennium Falcon, where Finn (John Boyega) and Poe (Oscar Isaac) quickly discover that there’s a mole in the First Order. We’re then teleported to a new Resistance base where Leia trains Rey (Daisy Ridley) in the ways of the Force. Before we’re oriented in this location, we’re shuffled into another adventure jam-packed with MacGuffins, whirlygigs, and ultimately dead ends. The adventure is poorly defined and confusing, but Abrams doesn’t expect us to be smart. He’s content to race through every would-be meaningful moment at the quickest possible pace, exploiting that whiplash effect to distract us from the story’s garbled plotting. We know that our heroes are on a race to find Palpatine, and are looking for something called a “wayfinder” that will lead them to his location. There are only two wayfinders, and Kylo Ren finds the other one in an opening scene. Abrams creates a sense of urgency, but we don’t really know why, and no one seems convincingly terrified that the universe is on the brink of absolute annihilation. At least the original trilogy only featured one Death Star at a time, and developed centralized locations that defined personal stakes and brewed emotion. This film has a whole army of planet-destroying ships, locations with no names or personalities, and characters previously emphasized who are here utterly left to the wind. And that’s the real failure of The Rise of Skywalker. It mishandles literally every character,  except, arguably, C-3PO. Rey gets tacked onto a legacy story that erodes the entire thematic heart of not just The Last Jedi, but even Abrams’ own The Force Awakens. By some disgusting leap of imagination, she’s Palpatine’s granddaughter. Rey’s parents weren’t actually alcoholics who sold her for drinking money (a bit never reconciled), but good people who loved her enough to protect her from Gramps, and apparently, themselves. Finn (John Boyega) is suddenly and inexplicably Force sensitive, which is a nice little treat and possible nod to the end of The Last Jedi, but is only really employed to detect when Rey’s in peril. Outside of one nice moment with Jannah (Naomi Ackie), a fellow defected stormtrooper he meets on the road, his arc from indentured villain to Rebel hero goes largely unaddressed. Worse, even his relationship with Poe feels weirdly underdeveloped. Poe (Oscar Isaac), meanwhile, is very much “present,” but that’s really all he is. He became something of a de facto leader at the end of The Last Jedi, but Abrams fails to hint at any sense of real authority or growth here. He bickers with Rey and continues to act like a self-important flyboy, echoing a roguish Han Solo-esque fearlessness, but where his presence is maximized, his importance really isn’t. His story and Leia’s should be more interconnected after she taught him a valuable lesson last time around, but  the loss of Carrie Fisher unfortunately obstructs his development as a character. Using a mishmash of unused footage from The Force Awakens, they try to conjure her spirit elsewhere, but it doesn’t totally work. That said, the movie at least attempts to do right by her legacy. Further, Leia’s death in the film helps create two of its best moments. She uses a last ounce of strength to send Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) a memory of his father, Han, who reappears with some paternal advice. It should be a silly moment, but tonally it absolutely works, sold completely by the fine work of Ford and Driver. As father and son reconnect, Kylo Ren finally transforms back into Ben Solo–he tosses his jagged lightsaber into the abyss and goes off to save Rey, who he loves. This whole sequence is preceded by a lightsaber duel where Kylo is left mortally wounded; Rey heals him, and confesses her feelings for the man he could be. Love–and hope–seem temporarily destined to win. And they do… sort of? The third act is where The Rise of Skywalker totally loses sight of everything it’s trying to be. Rey is drawn into Palpatine’s lair, and  there’s a lot of business about Sith and Jedi that doesn’t really make sense. Above them, the war between the “Final Order” (Palpatine’s new name for the galactic baddies) and the Resistance rages, a total lazy mirror to the end of Return of the Jedi. Palpatine wants to funnel his strength into Rey via some ancient ritual, but Ben shows up. Ben and Rey fight together against Palpatine, Rey summons the spirit of all of the Jedi who ever lived, and she beats her grandpa with his own superpower (in a very Harry Potter-esque showdown) before dying. Ben uses the last of his life power to resurrect her–a nice mirror of their Death Star scene earlier in the film–and they kiss. But he then dies, leaving Rey once again as the galaxy’s only real Force of hope. She temporarily reunites with the Resistance–who defeated the Final Order with the help of Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams), appearing in the movie just long enough to serve as a deus ex machina–before jetting off to Tatooine. And finally, Rey takes on the last name Skywalker and sees Luke and Leia’s Force ghosts. The end. Unbelievably, a lot more happens than that. Abrams introduces Zorii Bliss (Keri Russell), a fun, masked ex-fling of Poe’s who’s super cool but completely inconsequential to the plot. Kelly Marie Tran’s Rose Tico effectively takes a Resistance desk job, which feels particularly insulting after everything she accomplished in The Last Jedi. There are more “Force Skype” scenes between Rey and Kylo, and Rey confronts her own inner darkness, manifested in “Dark Rey,” while Abrams introduces a cute new droid named D-O, and throws a lot of other random things at the wall that never stick (like a visit with the ghost of Luke Skywalker during a temporary detour to Ahch-To). It’s as messy as it is ambitious, and Abrams and co-writer Chris Terrio’s deserve some credit for spinning such a clotted web that you’re frequently distracted from all of the holes in it. But then there’s the whole hope thing. And there’s really no cohesive sense of it here. As a series-ender, this story should resonate more than it does. The Last Jedi contends with the past more, and better, than Skywalker does; it wrestled with the sins of the Jedi and Sith, and kicked open a bigger door for generations to come. Skywalker says nothing about where they, or we, go from here. It ends with Rey abandoned and alone, except for her Force ghost friends, on another desert planet. The  one person in the galaxy who ever understood her dies. And he evidently doesn’t redeem himself successfully enough to become a Force ghost. Is death really the only avenue to peace and purpose? Effectively, Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, and Leia Organa all died to save Ben, who then died to save Rey. What is her next step? The movie doesn’t say, or seem to know. It’s a domino effect, with nothing but tragedy at the end of every spill. That idea could work if the moments in between felt rewarding, or the losses served larger narrative or thematic ideas. But in this story, meant to be a conclusion to a single film, a trilogy and a nine-film saga, they don’t. Rey, Finn, and Poe share only a superficial sense of camaraderie. Their future adventures will lead to moments of happiness and enlightenment along the way. But why does Abrams ignore or de-emphasize those feelings? In The Rise of Skywalker, hope is little more than a ghost. And after more than 40 years, it’s one that Star Wars is still chasing, with no real end in sight."
