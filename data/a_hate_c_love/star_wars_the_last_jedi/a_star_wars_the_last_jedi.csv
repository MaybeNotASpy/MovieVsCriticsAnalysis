Apr 10 2024,negative,sucks i love star wars how could disney do this george lucas gave them tons of ideas about the sequel trilogy and they just threw it away worst of the sequel trilogy ruined luke skywalker and destroyed the sequel trilogy just dont watch this watch the last jedi pitch meeting instead it will tell you the plot and is funny
Apr 6 2024,negative,a sequel to a movie that wasnt needed in the first place undoes all the character development of the original trilogy and of the force awakens a confusing plot that serves to do nothing but expedite reys lacklustre character from that of scavenger to saviour worst of all it makes luke skywalker look like an absolutely piece of shit for no reason whatsoever
Apr 4 2024,negative,this movie took everything you loved about starwars your childhood heroes and warped it into unrecognizable nightmare fuel i never watched a movie where it felt soo detached from everything i loved its like they never even bothered to learn about the characters or story they were writing about took the names made it whatever they wanted to and pushed it out on us as star wars we had an opportunity to tell an awesome story about a stormtrooper rising up to the level of hero and instead we decided to take luke skywalker and make him a fool his optimism that made his character gone a character that never gave up on anyone even his evil father suddenly gave up on everything this was soo far from the skywalker saga it was a joke and i dont think i ever will forgive disney for ruining my heroes like that
Apr 4 2024,negative,this film butchered the entire set up of the force awakens
Mar 30 2024,negative,while not nearly as bad as rise of skywalker it still was pretty bad 410
Mar 27 2024,positive,hated force awakens loved this one
Mar 25 2024,negative,absolutely awful terrible plot threw away finns potential as a great character and ruined luke skywalker i would honestly rather run barefoot across broken glass then watch this movie again
Mar 24 2024,negative,after the disappointment of the previous film in the franchise i had low expectations for the last jedi and it failed to meet them    the characterisation is poor the plot is illogical and the film fails to capture the mystique of the force that lucas built up in the first six films    most of the film felt like the director was grandstanding rather than telling the story resulting in a product that felt more like an undergraduate videography project on a hollywood budget than a star wars film so bad is the attention to the story and its details that climactic moments in the film were simply nonsensical logical absurdities delivered with an artistic triumphant flourish that left me thinking wut rather than wow jarring as they were in the disconnect between plausibility and depiction    not only did the films writers fail to capture the magic and mystique of lucas creations the force and the jedi but the production failed to capture the artistic style of the originals as well instead of the franchises signature expansive standoff epic videography employed in the first six films the audience is subjected to a weird assault of flashy motioncamera shots that seemed designed to impress rather than immerse choreography for fight scenes was likewise awful with scant attention given to the quality    overall a film that was memorable for its disappointing awfulness and not much else
Mar 15 2024,negative,the movie was good but missed some action compared to the other movies
Mar 14 2024,positive,star wars episode viii the last jedi is a bold and exhilarating addition to the iconic franchise director rian johnson took some risks and pushed boundaries with longtime fans which created a divisive conversation regarding episode viii personally i felt that the last jedi expertly balanced nods to the original star wars trilogy while expanding upon the force awakens some character interactions or plot choices such as poe and rey only meeting at the very end of this second sequel could have been approached differently stylistically it feels exactly like the star wars we all know and love some characterization elements with luke feel off though i can forgive rian johnson given the overall positive experience that the film offers
Mar 13 2024,negative,it is ponderous pointless and uninspiring worst of all it treated a beloved character like garbage and gave him a disappointing ending i blame this movie for driving the trilogy off a cliff rise of skywalker sealed its fate
Mar 9 2024,negative,weak unbelievable characters nonsensical plot and character development
Mar 5 2024,negative,the only thing about this movie that was ok was the visuals the rest was just not good at all i dont recommend it
Mar 4 2024,negative,this is one of the worst star wars movie ever first of all rey is a horrible character and just ruined and killed the franchise and what the hell are those fights why is it so slow its like their swinging baseball bats in air and they ruined luke as a character disney just killed the star wars franchise
Mar 4 2024,negative,what a waste of nearly 40 years to see luke skywalker againonly to be let down  the gambling planet ships running out of fuel leia floating in space the whole movie is mixed up and garbled  all the jedi stuff is no big deal now anyone can be a jedi this movie diluted 40 years of canon  disney should sell the property back to lucas or only let jon favreau approve whatever is coming out
Feb 29 2024,negative,does not even feel like a star wars film the big bad guy snoke was an awful unmenacing mess of cgi ray continues to be a flat boring character with no arch the treatment of luke is appalling it is like the writersdirectors and people in charge dont care about how they got here and step forget the shoulders they are standing on i cant imagine that if this trilogy was the first in the universe star wars would cease to be the international ip that it is
Feb 21 2024,positive,extremely overhated i think it does a good job with its action sequences
Feb 21 2024,positive,i enjoyed the heck out of this movie unexpected and delivered on so much emotion i honestly believe that with time it will stand as one of the best as there will be a new audience who arent so married to preconceived notions of older beloved characters
Feb 21 2024,negative,dumb plot terrible character development and left trilogy with nowhere to go could not have portrayed luke any worse and rey is a mary sue its like they tried to make it bad special effects are good
Feb 19 2024,positive,the very best of the sequels it wasnt afraid to take risks and not follow them he typical star wars pattern and the risks paid off this movie was action packed and gave us more character development with rey and the others fantastic wonderful exciting and best of all fun
Feb 7 2024,negative,the most painful disappointment it was frustrating watching the characters constantly make totally irrational decisions the pacing was snail slow with a b plot that goes no where all the characters that had chemistry in the force awakens were split up the action wasnt even good enough to make this a good date flick the only compliment i have is to the cgi its subversive without being clever or deep
Jan 26 2024,positive,poor movie but nice star wars that adds more to the world building and respects the lore
Jan 24 2024,positive,spoiler  lots of folks are disappointed with the depiction of luke skywalker because his flaws are a departure from the luke we see in the original trilogy  its a fair concern and perhaps rian johnson could have given us a little more of the peppier luke but overall luke skywalker is portrayed as a complex and multidimensional character and his greatness in the movie lies in his evolution and the challenges he faces mark hamills performance adds depth to luke as a character who has grappled with failure and personal demons his internal conflict dealing with the guilt of his perceived failure in training kylo ren adds a layer of realism to the iconic hero the film also showcases lukes growth and ultimate redemption highlighting his willingness to learn from mistakes and confront his own flaws additionally his selfsacrifice demonstrates the enduring heroism that defines luke contributing to his greatness and solidifying his legacy in the star wars saga
Jan 18 2024,neutral,while i think ix and ii are worse moviesyes i still stand firm in by 2002 feelings tlj still does some baffling things  folks who really like the film brush off rjs decision to redact viis story threads  not like that was a great film but it did offer some possibilities for the rest of the trilogy  knights of ren hux poe and finn  i think switching gears hard in the middle of a trilogy doesnt always work and it didnt work for me here    i actually didnt mind lukes nihilism per se but his reasons for it and his actions through the film dont jive with me  sure not wanting to restart the jedi order during peacetime might make sense but with the ridiculous first order  not like the jedi order was known for corruption or anything  or not training a few folks was gonna stop any other force sensitive folks in abusing it  i didnt mind snoke dying but the way it was done without seeing anything from him left a hole that would have helped if rey contemplated becoming a sith  not just to be evil but decide that the jedis usual gandhism wasnt gonna work in their current situation and maybe the sith philosophy had some things that could work for her to help the galaxy  i didnt mind reys parents being nobodies but that then begged the question couldnt anyone else out there also have strong force powers that might add some complexity to this story    the holdo maneuver was cool but that then begged the question why wasnt this used for more in the star wars universe previously  ive heard all sorts of justifications for it and trust me none of them worked on me  i liked almost nothing about the finnrose sidequest and i feel like the potential to have seen finn maybe go after more storm trooper defections instead was lost  phasma was wasted  hux was wasted  poe was wasted  the praetorian guards were wasted a bit imo    i felt like rj wasted the few thing jj was actually good at and continued what he was bad at  the entire concept of the first order was terrible and i would have loved to have seen it as the fo being severely outnumbered in this film and being creative in getting around that fact instead of them just automatically being the empire vs a handful of rebels    i dont hate this film or anyone involved in it with a passion  but for me while tfa was a meh maybe this film started digging the grave that ended with ros putting a nail in the coffin  i was so pumped for star wars after a 6510 tfa and an 810 rogue one  but now in 2024 with only a decent first season of mandalorian and andor not including the animated series in my recent memory i dont have much hope or excitement for at least the next few years with this ip when we should have had a golden age era like marvel 2008  2019
Jan 14 2024,negative,it was okay as a generic action movie but had no right calling itself star wars i cant imagine why the critics have given it such a high rating probably due to pressure fearing for their careers disney is a behemoth that could sink any critic quick  the fight choreography is amateurish at best the worst part is that they take 30 solid minutes away from the plot for a pointless side quest that should have been deleted   laura derns character exists solely to complicate the plot with her poor leadership skills but for some reason is portrayed as heroic they never really justify that portrayal her costume is ridiculous shes supposed to be an admiral but dresses like a preschool teacher at an art fair
Jan 12 2024,negative,trash breaks the preestablished lore set by the previous movies which ruins immersion  also the story is just bad
Jan 12 2024,positive,star wars episode viii the last jedi is awesome this movie still killed it with kylo ren  rey princess leia also killed it the new characters are really really really good really luke skywalker in this movie was fine but also got a really good character ark overall star wars the last jedi is i think kind of a really good star wars movie it had a good plotline this movie had a lot of sacrifices good scenes and finally good shots its another win for me
Jan 11 2024,negative,to say this film is a disgrace is an understatement  it is an abhorrent atrocity essentially heresy to the star wars universe
Jan 10 2024,negative,the worst movie ever made completely directionless it really feels like the directors objective was to subvert fans expectations by changing characters and derailing previous plot threads at no point was the movie engaging there was zero character development and the way characters behaved and interacted was like the story was writing by a 7 year old a real shame as this was one of the best franchises in movie history which was utterly desiccated by the equal trilogy in general and this movie in particular
Dec 21 2023,negative,this is the worst star wars movie in the franchise so far it felt like a knockoff of the empire strikes back with the mysterious jedi master on an isolated planet and the whole crait sequence felt like a carbon copy of the hoth battle the disservice done to both luke and leia in this movie is unforgivable disney reduced luke to a sniveling whiny old jedi and you know its bad when mark hamill doesnt even approve    the only saving grace for this movie are the visuals
Dec 21 2023,negative,a horrific movie  it has killed star wars  what was the point of this mess  let it die
Dec 19 2023,negative,terrible movie doesnt follow the previous whatsoever because of the director change this movie is basically a filler because nothing happens in between 7 and 9 hate the sequels and i hate what this franchise has become
Dec 19 2023,negative,another bad movie from the new trilogy seriously no way people actually think this is good bad writing no answered questions why kill snoke he had potential plus kylo rena knights whered they go cmon they shouldve made rey join the dark side and have luke face both while snoke is the main key villain like cmon only thing good about this movie was the jump to hyperspace into the ships and even that shouldnt be a thing but it is
Dec 18 2023,negative,so on one hand this film is not a beat for beat retread of episode 4 i actually appreciate that hence it gets half a star higher than the force awakens from me what i do not appreciate is film that pretends it actually has anything interesting or important to say to the audience about wealth inequality considering its made by a multibillion dollar corporation itself with actors directors and producers who i guarantee have far more wealth than i yet have the audacity to letchure me about wealth inequality
Dec 16 2023,negative,there are glimpses of a fine story here and there but the last jedi cant escape the underlying problem that is the lack of respect for the source material rian johnson and co are more concerned with their personal journey than telling a story within the star wars tradition rey gets some redemption as a protagonist but still doesnt struggle for her achievements
Dec 16 2023,positive,an underrated gem in the skywalker saga mark hamills role is a refreshing take on the character of luke skywalker who finally returns to the star wars films daisy ridley is once again fantastic as rey and is given a brilliant arc with adam driver
Nov 28 2023,negative,its something to put on in the background because its just so boring the only good thing is snoke whos in it for five seconds
Nov 28 2023,positive,episode viii the last jedi ended 2017 on an explosive note to say the least while this looked likely to become that years biggest hit it also quickly looked set to be the most divisive star wars movie in a while    picking up straight after the force awakens we meet rey daisy ridley as she finally hands an exiled luke skywalker mark hamill his old lightsaber seeking training as the resistance continues to fight for survival against the first order the main group of characters introduced in the last movie is divided with each one off on their own quest before they meet again at the end ridiculously good pilot poe dameron oscar isaac whose philosophy tends to lean more towards blowing stuff up finds himself having to consider alternative ways of fighting the enemy while finn john boyega and newcomer rose kelly marie tran attempt to track down a master code breaker    meanwhile kylo ren adam driver discovers a connection with rey through the force as they both appear to struggle with their destiny whereas the force awakens was a lighthearted introduction to a new generation in the star wars universe with the usual good vs evil themes the last jedi genuinely attempts to push ahead while focusing on the infinitely more complex grey areas inbetween    this is a darker film that explores deeper more abstract themes and its easy to see why some fans of the franchise might find that jarring when you consider the tone of the previous film in that series the last jedi is closer to rogue one in that its much more earnest and fearless in its approach and theres an urgency to it on the surface this new film is a bit of a downer as heroes you took for granted show their flaws and reveal their humanity but even though the conclusion is bittersweet it leaves you with that optimistic feeling you expect from star wars    we see a new side to luke skywalker in this movie and whether you like it or not it certainly makes an impact this is luke at his most defeatist and closed off so seeing the eagertolearn rey attempt to thaw some guidance out of him is both fascinating and frustrating mark hamill gives probably his finest performance as luke skywalker and makes the most of the role that made him a star the late carrie fisher is finally given a more significant part as leia organa and its a joy to see her play a fuller role once again    our new heroes also have their fair share of conflicts to revolve rey looks for meaning in her past while getting closer to kylo ren finn struggles to live up to the heroic image his new sidekick rose has of him and poe learns a few lessons of his own theres real character growth here and yet it remains unclear what everything is building up to so the third film in this new trilogy will have a lot of work to do thats for sure its not all serious grim and deep however as the muchfeared porgs are introduced along with countless other minor bizarre alien creatures and while they serve no purpose they are about as harmless as it gets    the comedy in this film feels infinitely more organic and cheesyintherightway than in force awakens where the jokes felt a little too forced this is also a beautifullooking movie with thrilling space battles stunning locations and iconic moments youll likely never forget expect this one to stick with you for a while as a lot of nifty surprises pop up    if the force awakens was enjoyable if a tad bare the last jedi is packed with just about everything you want from a star wars film and more the lore is respectfully challenged and for the first time in a long time we feel like this universe is finally looking forward not back    a newest hope
Nov 26 2023,positive,not as bad as rise of skywalker not as good as force awakens its a mid movie really average i did liked lukes nihalism its more realistic hes actually mature
Nov 23 2023,negative,oh really 91  even return of the jedi  which is a classic has 83  phasma dies the way  most pathetic possible  finn and rose is a cheap copy of han and leia  and not to mention luke  he is disappointing   and rey   hes not even a jedi and    is more competent than luke himself  a jedi master  the story works by itself  its true  but as part of star wars  its bullshit
Nov 22 2023,negative,i didnt care for the character  or the actor of kylo ren how they allowed him to basically kill both his parents  get away with it i sure hope hes dead forever the last two in the series were the worst for me
Nov 22 2023,negative,not the best star wars movie to be honest
Nov 21 2023,negative,one of the worst star wars movies including solo and episode ix  excess of creativity lack of continuity from episode vii waste of characters development disrispect for the star wars canon and original characters unnecesary subplots and new characters mediocre fight scenes  a bad movie that does not deserve the box office and good critics it received at the moment
Nov 14 2023,neutral,incredibly cool and yet incredibly pointless derns holdo and her secrecyforthesakeofstory will cement her as one of the worst stars wars characters ever written or acted a galaxyful of potential wasted into a story that was as nonsensical as it was unnecessary apart from a few moments of thrilling nostalgia and lightsabers last jedi is ultimately forgettable frustrating and underwhelming 4510
Nov 12 2023,positive,lets get the most shocking hyperbolic bit out of the way first i liked the last jedi a lot and not since the empire strikes back have i enjoyed watching a star wars movie as much where the force awakens softly rejuvenated the series the last jedi proves that even though disney maintains a worrisome level of control theres still hope for new and unique creative interpretations of the source material and while there are already thousands of reviews and articles out there as a diehard star wars fan i would be remiss not to put down a few brief thoughts of my own regarding the film itself and the masses surrounding it    obviously star wars has and still is an ever expanding universe spanning across every medium imaginable including of course video games and while ive played many star wars games it goes without saying that the best star wars game ever made is knights of the old republic but funnily enough its in its critically divisive sequel the sith lords where i find the most comparisons between the way i felt after finishing it for the tenth time yep i played and finished it 10 times and the way i initially felt walking out of the theater after seeing the last jedi excited introspective and more aware than ever of the value in having your preconceived notions of what to expect from a series you love challenged    perhaps one of the most debated aspects of the tlj is one of the main reasons why i loved it and kotor 2 so much it purposefully pushed back against fan expectations our assumption of whats supposed to happen or could happen based on nothing but endless fan theories versus what actually happens can easily split a fans loyalty to a series star trek being a great if not obvious example of another franchise that has and continues to divide fans when i booted up the sith lords for the first time i started it with the presumption that itd be a continuation of what the first game established in terms of both quality and storytelling and instead of being open to a wholly new experience i was already making a decision on how i would feel before the game had even made it past the opening credits this puts the creators at a disadvantage and limiting the possible scenarios that could exist in either medium    aesthetically both entries come off as star wars the sith lords and tlj are not boisterous escapades as one thought it would be the paths that these characters design bypass preestablished conventions paving a new trajectory for future entries both the sith lords and tlj have a pessimistically complex wise old sage the hype for being a jedi is nil the death of a dark lord doesnt end the war and the choices made do have consequences they supersede than being binary choices in the past blowing up a giant death ball and killing the head sith has been the resolution to the conflict if its any indicator the last jedi promotes that the light overcoming the dark approach has finally hopefully reached a middle ground    just over thirteen years ago the sith lords reminded fans that the star wars universe is endless with an infinite number of stories to be told and in 2017 the last jedi echoed that sentiment and then some with just a few hours at his disposable rian johnson took a chance by acknowledging where the series had been and respectfully quickly shedding the weight of all that came before tlj much like lukes definitive statement about the jedi ending and kylo rens thoughts on letting the past die i do believe its time to move forward and as such i have never been more excited for the future of star wars      additional thoughts     the last jedi is thankfully a clear indicator that star wars is going to be more than what the past has set in motion the decision to kill off snoke and in turn making ren all the more complex is one of the greatest swerves in star wars history while it was never that black and white the spectrum that good and evil lived on wasnt nearly as gray as it shouldve been and with tlj were finally shown that drifting to the dark side or the light side in rens case is much more complicated than it originally seemed instead of having a dark or light in the case of rey master tlj is allowing them to come into their own paving the way for perhaps a newly iteration of the jedi and sith     i 100 understand where hamill is coming from regarding his thoughts on how the character of luke skywalker is portrayed but lukethecurmudgeon made sense in the context he is presented in weighed down by guilt and loss from losing ben to losing the jedi temple hed built from the ground up altogether luke is broken and as such his sadness and resentment toward the jedi is believably symptomatic of what hes been through     i loved the shift in tone especially considering how unrestrained it felt in comparison to tfa but the attempts by rian to inject humor into the movie whether it was the bit between hux and poe at the beginning or other moments throughout didnt work for me as much
Nov 11 2023,positive,although this movie isnt great in its whole it still can feel like star wars and gives good moments but yeah it could be handled better
Nov 9 2023,negative,i hope an ewok bits off your shizzle
Nov 5 2023,negative,honestly i didnt really like this movie it was boring they tried to make it into a spy thriller but it didnt really work out for them disappointing movie
Nov 3 2023,negative,cabaldriven drivel dead set on destroying all that is good in the world including star wars disney sucks episode h8  worst movie of all time
Oct 31 2023,negative,the last jedi has exactly the same criticisms as the first instalment in the sequels needlessly anticlimatic and deals hamills character no justice not recommended even for hardcore star wars fans
Oct 30 2023,positive,it had a weird end but the rest of the movie was amazing it was a honoring end of the saga
Oct 28 2023,positive,one of my favorite star wars films understands the myth and also updates it to reflect modern life and challenges
Oct 25 2023,negative,this is a perfect example of why rotten tomatoes is great because it gives a critics score and a user score when the critics love it and the audiences hate it its likely a movie like this it subverted expectations which critics love but audiences hate when its done in a way that makes no sense for the charactersstory so many of the worst scenes in star wars are in this movie luke tossing the light saber away and drinking green milk like a hobo rose saves finn by ramming his ship a good chance of killing them both anyway but dooms the whole resistance she didnt know luke would save them honestly i think rian johnson is so overrated every movie ive watched critics rave about but theyre melodramatic and i rarely get suspension of disbelief
Oct 23 2023,negative,didnt really enjoy it tbh most of it doesnt make any sense at least the fight on the velvet cake planet was enjoyable and luke vs kylo ren was good
Oct 20 2023,negative,bloated runtime a stupidly awful decision to waste half the movie on nothing happening and a boring bland unimaginative plot and cast star wars fans look away newcomers look elsewhere
Oct 20 2023,negative,starts with a space battle but ends with a very underwhelming battle very few conflicts no turning points very bland i honestly do not remember much in the movie i wish i should have given up those droids to the empire
Oct 20 2023,negative,the last jedi is sequel and so obviously it needed to pick up where the force awakens left off the need for continuity from one film to the next is not pedantry by star wars obsessives it is basic competency requirement up there with making sure the camera is in focus and keeping the microphones out of shot even the most casual viewers expects continuity the force awakens ends with a cliffhanger after all literally and figuratively but the last jedi systematically dismisses each story thread and question one by one and does so with so much spite it seems designed to antagonise its audience whatever the motive was for doing this it serves to derail the film    the remainder is made up of action scenes with no internal logic luke get his hair dyed on his way to save his friends laughably bad choreography in the throne room fight scene inconsistent application of gravity in space in scenes minutes apart to name just three of many examples populated by poorly written and annoying characters luke dies for no discernible reason he says he didnt want to be found despite leaving a map to his location haldo decides to string along poe rather than just tell him her plan at the expense of many lives    at one point it looks like luke is going to be told that his best friend is dead this would give mark hamil and daisy ridley an opportunity to do some powerful acting bond as characters and provide an emotional centre for the film but unbelievably after luke says wheres han the scene ends    on that note the writer clearly doesnt like the original trilogy characters lukes character is a complete betrayal of his younger self and then inexplicably dies leia spends much of the film in a coma and even chewbacca has less screen time than jar jar binks does in revenge of the sith    the attempts at humour are tonedeaf and slip into bathos a word i learned when trying to verbalise my toecurling reaction to humour in the last jedi jokes undermine scenes that the audience is clearly supposed to take seriously eg the deaths of hundreds of good guys and undermine characters that are supposed to be scary the attempt to ape humour used in marvel films fails miserably    star wars has had its problems before  for example with plot holes and stilted dialogue in the 90s trilogy but it always felt like star wars always made with love if not competence the same cannot be said about the last jedi it is baffling how a studio with so much money and goodwill can release such a mess of a film but not as baffling as the positive reviews it has received from critics    to be fair the visuals especially the space battles are great but thats cold comfort when you see luke skywater squirting green milk from a rubber alien nipple yes really    it is obvious both from the lack of continuity and the ad hoc appointment of writerdirectors that no story arc was sketched out in advance for this trilogy this is so negligent i almost cant believe it no good story has ever been made up as it went along handing off the chapters to different and competing authors thats not storytelling its the party game consequences    im going to finish with a quote    a poorly constructed derivative scifi stinker with a weak script and poor action sequences    thats rotten tomatoes critical consensus of babylon ad i propose it is repurposed for the last jedi rip star wars
Oct 19 2023,negative,pulling from an old review that i never posted here  the visuals and fx are solid and the acting performance from most characters is okay  in particular i really like daisy ridley as an actress and how she gets into a character emotionally but i just feel like she keeps getting stuck with poor scripts and bad directors  i left the theater feeling entirely empty     as a contrast  tfa was underwhelming but this was like having my soul sucked out of my body by a dementor  i dont know whether to blame the scriptwriters rian johnson whose body of work i generally find onenote and surface level or the mouse    so i guess if i was to summarize it in a sentence i wanted to like it there were some redeeming parts but mostly its just hollywood drivel with extremely poorlyformed ideas and weak philosophical implications that either go nowhere say nothing new or are outright monstrousridiculous    as for the people sending threats or hurling insults at the cast eg kelly marie tran you are the absolute worst of humanity
Oct 18 2023,negative,this movie was even worse than the force awakens rain johnson manages to destroy all the character details luke had  he was the one who stands for hope who did everything to safe his father despite him trying to kill luke now luke is a looser who lives on an old island and tries to destroy the jedi order this is so fundamentally wrong because luke the hopefullest und nicest charakter in the whole franchise and even mark hammil cant stop to complain about the disturbing script and the complete destruction from one of the if not the greatest character in star wars thank you rian johnson we will always love you for shitting on the movies we grew up with definitely all love to you 
Oct 17 2023,negative,this movie assassinated lukes character its boring the themes of failure are frustrating and they should have killed off finn
Oct 15 2023,negative,whoever said it was a good idea for rian johnson to direct episode 8 should be in jail this is the worst movie in the star wars saga but by far a lot of plot holes and throwing away the development of the characters he did both jj abrahams and especially george lucas that hermit is not luke skywalker    but i still give it 1 star because there was only one person who did a great job john williams
Oct 15 2023,positive,so understimated one of the best movies in the star wars franchise something could have been different in some choices like snoke and leila
Oct 15 2023,neutral,that is one hell of a movie first half was just weird the second halfend of the movie was definitly better
Oct 15 2023,negative,absolutely horrendous the worst part was the beginning too when luke just threw away his lightsaber we had all of force awakens built up at the end just to ruin it with this new movie also saying that reys family was nothing was absolutely pointless jj abrams definitely fixed all of these mistakes in rise of skywalker
Oct 13 2023,positive,a triumph for rian johnson it is visually audacious and filled with wonderful idiosyncrasies as well as visual references to anime and late period kurosawa but the great thing here is how johnson smartly ignores much of the mystery box structure of the force awakens even finding a convincing way to resolve that films impossible cliffhanger in favor of more oddball and spiritual themes
Oct 13 2023,negative,easily the worst of all the franchise the absolute lackluster end to the hero of the original trilogy that luke ever considered ghosting leias son is suspect writing at best then we have the casino scene that tells us what that there is corruption in the star wars universe no kidding there is evil and greed in star wars wow the lack of respect towards the fans being smart enough to realize that shady dealings are going on in the background none of it is news nor important enough to make a 45 min segment in the movie the boring chase segment should have been edited down to 10 minutes at most in my personal opinion one      should just skip this movie and go straight to rise of skywalker
Oct 11 2023,negative,i dont think you could make a worse movie hilarious when you look at how much money was spent and the garbage that was fed to us worst in the franchise
Oct 11 2023,negative,this is the worst star wars movie ever worst star wars media yes i said it woolies grunting at each other for an hour and a half is more appealing to me want to watch disney murder all the original characters arcs or have half the movie wasted on some pointless lesson about capitalism how about terrible choreographed fighting if none of that works a slow nonsense plot the only thing this movie has if effects if you want to rate a movie off how it looks stick to finger painting
Oct 7 2023,positive,im honestly blown away how horrible people think this movie is i decided to watch the entirety of the starwars movie franchise for the first time ever my fiance both finished this movie and we both loved it its not perfect by any means but it is a good movie snoke was never the true monster of the final series this movie is a battle between rey and kylo the adventures of finn rose and bb8 were fun to watch the lightspeed crash looked amazing the final seige by the first order against the rebels was well done and left us ready to watch ix
Oct 7 2023,positive,best movie in the whole star wars saga
Oct 6 2023,positive,i was so blown away by this movie that i am going to be in the 5 parade i know that it triggered a lot of people and i might just be one of those guys  but it truly felt like a star wars movie and i am a fan of the trilogy and the prequels but not a huge fan anyway i just want to show it the love it deserves as everyone has to admit  any least it was a decent story
Oct 5 2023,negative,you really need to put a lot of effort to make such a terrible movie and destroy the character development of one of the most iconic heroes like kudos to everyone you couldnt have done a worse movie
Oct 2 2023,negative,messy direction and again very unoriginal i found my self almost bored as the story was predictable  unoriginal and did nothing to build the world of star wars
Oct 2 2023,negative,i think it was terrible  the story was terrible and really really boring  also killing off two characters that where intresting snoke and cptnphasma was a terrible move and frankly a very stupid one
Oct 1 2023,positive,the visuals and scenes are absolutely amazing however compared to its predecessors this movie does not match up in terms of plot and characters you can tell what johnson was trying to do but it did not end up working out or making the cut for other star wars fans
Oct 1 2023,negative,an insult to fans of the franchise   all style no substance    it broke the physics of the universe for the sake of pretty shot   yes things that dont make sense do subvert expectations but that doesnt necessarily mean they are any good   overly preachy and full of characters making bad choices
Sep 29 2023,negative,im not a studio boss so i know my opinion doesnt matter much having said that i would suggest a couple of things    1 if you plan to have multiple directorswriters you should require that they cooperate with one another so that the stories make sense  2 dont blame fans if they dont like your work
Sep 28 2023,negative,from a performance and visuals standpoint top notch    from a story and continuity stand point i felt cheated some great moments but no follow through didnt feel like star wars
Sep 28 2023,negative,the visuals are amazing but it ignores everything that made the original characters special and the plot is not that interesting
Sep 26 2023,positive,top tier star wars love the scene with yoda and luke
Sep 26 2023,negative,completely lazy writing not true to star wars at all how kathleen smellidy is still at the helm of star wars baffles me
Sep 26 2023,negative,this movie pretty much single handedly ruined a multigenerational franchise its hard for me to imagine how anyone thought that this movie would be a good direction  if you havent seen it do not
Sep 25 2023,negative,horrible why would they restart the movie
Sep 24 2023,negative,years later still the worst stat wars film ever made including whip whip stir i thought giving it time would soften the blow but it somehow feels worse than it did during its original release nonsense plot cringeworthy acting uninspiring cinematography 100 honest i cannot find a single positive in the film worth a solid star there are few movies that meet the criteria of being cast out of canon but this one is absolutely worthy of total erasure
Sep 23 2023,negative,the worst out of the sequel trilogy
Sep 22 2023,positive,id like to watch this movie again 
Sep 22 2023,positive,i recently rewatched the last jedi and thoroughly enjoyed it in spite of some noticeable flaws but that is nothing new to star wars see return of the jedi while suffering from some pacing issues this entry in the sequel trilogy might be the best of the flock while the fanboy in me might take issue with some minor canonical details overall the last jedi eclipses both the force awakens and the last skywalker if light on substance the movie is heavy on spectacle which has always been 75 of the appeal of star wars the movie caters both to nostalgia while at the same time forging a path to a new finale the last jedi sets up kylo ren as the primary villain of the sequel series having given over to literally indiscriminate rage but unfortunately the third movie reintroduced the emperor as the sagas big bad forcing adam drivers character to take a back seat to a hamhanded villain brought into the fold from the unknown regions the movie features a number of excellent memorable sequences including an unexpected twist a thrilling lightsaber battle and a noteworthy callback to the venerable battle of hoth from the empire strikes back after a number of rewatches one cannot help but consider that the hostility of a minor yet particularly vocal fraction of the series fanbase contributed to the movies bad reputation overall the last jedi at the very least measures up to par with the force awakens and absolutely dwarfs the series third installment in terms of quality
Sep 22 2023,negative,its essentially three subplots wrapped up in an illfitting trenchcoat     one of said plots  the casino scene  is often criticized as unnecessary when ironically its the only one that really matters giving context to this new conflict it just doesnt make sense in the frame story that is one long drawnout chase     plot 2 centers on reys quest to become a jedi without giving away too much this involves a weird trippy scene that tries to parallel lukes vadervision in the swamp back in the original movies but its like rian johnson didnt himself have the answers to tease theres also a big reveal that entirely goes against lukes character from the original trilogy its whatever     plot 3 is an anvilistic lesson about leadership and trusting the old guard which is ironic considering the plan is objectively bad not communicated and somehow involves people unnecessarily sacrificing themselves theres a coup that is over and forgotten about in 15 minutes     as a final note the new main character introduced in the last jedi  rose  had a lot of potential but johnson then treats her like the manic pixie dreamgirl trope having her lead finn around before trying to make them an item less than 24 hours after her sister just died in battle
Sep 21 2023,negative,horrid please stop the crying
Sep 21 2023,negative,just go watch the rise of skywalker
Sep 21 2023,negative,easily the worst film in the entire franchise apart from the widelyasserted fact that rey is the quintessential mary sue all other characters are completely hollow as well    somehow the entire 789 series brought out the worst acting from most of of the cast and this film is no different huxs character seems more like a bad guy from an inspector gadgetlike cartoon than the star wars universe lets also not forget the biggest waste of a benicio del toro cameo     the entire sidequest to planet opulence can be skipped unless you can handle intense amounts of cringe     the whole film is probably better watched on youtube where hopefully someone has just cut together all the cgi moments some of which are indeed great the rest is just a big middle finger to people with brain cells
Sep 20 2023,negative,the last jedi should be erased from history as an heretical text and a corrupted vision of its creator despite the astonishing effects the movie got nothing to offer but a total disrespect to george lucas legacy and the saga he spent decades building
Sep 19 2023,positive,unlike episode 7 this installment takes the trilogy in a very different direction with the heroes goal becoming not to win but to survive the stunning visuals and impactful moments also make this star wars film work much better than others
Sep 18 2023,positive,its been 6 years and i still absolutely adore this film rian johnson takes the franchise in an incredible direction that subverts many of the expected tropes from big budget blockbusters luke is an extremely well written character who feels like a real person rather than a onedimensional messiah that many fans wanted him to be i will always love this film no matter what anyone says
Sep 17 2023,positive,this movie is amazing mary poppins carrie fisher was absolutely retarded though lukes design was great really shows what can happen mentally to people who follow monastic like traditions very consistant with how george portrayed obi wan and more significantly yoda in the originals as long as you can ignore all the dumb characters that were specifically written to fullfil gender idiology and womens empowerment this movie hits hard some really awesome scenes and great acting i can get past all that political nonsense and see the amazing idea behind this movie this movie was a perfect lead in to make darth ren a truly damaged chaotic and viscous leader of a new galactic evil unfortunately 9 ruined everything this movie set up in a lot of ways i wish disney would rewrite episode nine and really dive in to the growth of kylo as the new ultimate bad guy to be honest i wouldnt even care if they fixed it with some corney episode nine was just a stupid dream in some random storm troopers mind lol just delete nine from the archives and start over from scratch anyway enough of the rant this movie is two thumbs up for sure best one since phantom menace
Sep 16 2023,positive,rian johnson may have made the film too much regarding his personal life especially when george lucas is credited the film would have been much better as a standalone
Sep 15 2023,negative,easily the worst star wars movie ever made spends the entire time destroying the character and world building of previous movies without having any sort of message or meaning no story no ideas no reason to care
Sep 14 2023,negative,one of the worst movies ive ever watched absolutely atrocious and painful rey is the worst character in the entire star wars franchise
Sep 13 2023,positive,easily my favorite of this trilogy this was bravely made and so interesting in that everyone fails on both sides leaving such fertile ground for a great part 3 unfortunately the part 3 we got was far less brave and a actively worked to undo the great leadin it received
Sep 13 2023,negative,so bad i couldnt be bothered to watch the rise of skywalker i absolutely gave up on star wars after this and consider force awakens and tlj as weird fan fiction in an alternate noncanon universe wouldnt be bothered to write a review but 42 is too high one positive it does have some cool looking environments and scenes
Sep 13 2023,negative,movie could not have been worse
Sep 12 2023,positive,onestly i dont understand why this movie is not liked  the story is entertaining and the characters are cool  some scenes are maybe a little longer and to not much impactfull but they created suspense and add interesting moments anyway
Sep 11 2023,negative,worst film ever made in history i dont believe they could have made it worse even if they tried im honestly surprised the director hasnt been killed by some zealot yet
Sep 10 2023,negative,absolute atrocious movie it went against everything that was established in the sw universe if i could travel back in time i would prevent myself from watching this in the cinema
Sep 9 2023,negative,this movie was so disappointing disney has more money than they know what to do with and access to the very best in the business and they still screwed this up among a long list of failures were the addition of the rose character and the visit to the casino island
Sep 9 2023,negative,the worst star wars film ever the way the wasted luke skywalker by him just throwing his saber into the water is disgraceful to george lucass franchise the end fighting scene made absolutely no sense and how they killed off luke was dumb
Sep 8 2023,negative,luke threw down his lightsaber in the face of the emperor despite knowing his father had killed billions on alderaan as well as helped eradicate the jed all because he sensed some good in him    but somehow ryan johnson thought it would be keeping with his character to have luke attempt to kill his own nephew in his sleep who had not even rolled anyone for their lunch money yet  what an absolute disgrace of storytelling
Sep 7 2023,negative,overated franchise overated sequel
Sep 7 2023,negative,imagine making a star wars film that made you say phanton menace wasnt that bad terrible film even 7  9 had some redeeming qualities between the boring space chase the entire casino portion and wasting phasma which was one of the best new sub villains it felt like a disjointed nightmare easily the worst star wars movie
Sep 7 2023,positive,im really happy to see a star wars movie doing something new 7 was good but really just a reskin of episode 4 its sad so many fans are against the idea of a star wars movie trying something new so were just going to get the same movies and characters over and over
Sep 6 2023,negative,disney should be ashamed of this mess 
Sep 2 2023,negative,rian johnston had no clue what he was doing if the critics liked this movie they were paid off even as a stand alone movie it was terrible as part of the larger star wars universe it is even worse
Sep 1 2023,negative,some good action but they wasted every single one of their characters including luke skywalker rian johnsons attempt to subvert expectations has failed misrably and makes for a dumb boring annoying movie that took the franchise in the wrong direction
Aug 31 2023,positive,wooooohoooo what a crazy ride star wars the last jedi turns up the heat by giving us a wild crazy and action packed thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seats the action is superb the emotion is real and the story is truly amazing what really makes this movie special is the incredible tribute of the late great carrie fisher who will always be remembered as the one and only princess leia
Aug 31 2023,negative,way to revive a iconic franchise  do the new characters even have a personality or a story arc  just feels like a bad copy and paste job
Aug 31 2023,negative,poor character writing stupid decisions taken to advance the story stupid situation there is no escape ten minutes later oh wait maybe there is an escape now that we think about it  really the worst star wars i saw character seems like theyve been written by a 4 year old
Aug 31 2023,negative,it was doomed from the start since the big bad in the universe was just a retread of the ot and i think most of us expected most wisdom and leadership from luke the most optimistic hero in the galaxy barely cracked a smile before he dropped dead
Aug 30 2023,negative,the issue johnson had was he didnt understand the franchise while a talented director he lost sight on what these films really are and tried his own thing a risk that ultimately failed
Aug 30 2023,positive,what a sensitive topic i find myself in the middle of the debate where i think johnson handled some characters well such as the dynamic between our hero and villain but did a disservice to other characters i think my main issue lies with the story some plot points dont quite add up and the movie is poorly paced at times however despite some annoying characters and shaky plots lines i can still get an enjoyable watch out of the film thanks to a central arc that in my opinion works really well and adds some freshness to the film namely the aforementioned relationship between the hero and villain in the end i would have enjoyed this film more if johnson had leaned more into this fresh new take instead of kind of pulling it all back for fear of backlash when it comes to insulting the star wars legacy i think the island plotline tends to go a little too far but it was also clear to me johnson was communicating our desolate hermit was not making the right choices and his redemption at the end works for me as a fulfillment to his character even if i would have wanted a little more ultimately i blame disney for not steering their trilogy in a more cohesive direction
Aug 29 2023,negative,absolute dog crap if you liked this go screw yourself
Aug 25 2023,negative,hands down the worst star wars movie ever made
Aug 24 2023,positive,it has lots of ideas and suceeds more than it fails or fumbles the music is really good and is the best part though i wish it had more of a identity at certain points and isnt as catchy as the previous entires the acting is solid overall really the main issues that hold this back is some questionable character arcs at points that make characters more interesting and devleoped than others luke kylo  the supreme leader are the best things in this and are really goodrey is solid but is kind of lost in the shuffle of everything rose and finn are just ok everything else is decent fundamentally speaking but with lots of unique issues the special effects are well done except it can get a bit oversaturated with cgi at certain points especially during crait and on the stupid animals which was out of place the two main issues are the bloatedness of the runtime and ideas along with rosefinn first off the wholle story with rosefinn getting the codemaster at the end of the day was pointless and couldve been cut the only thing gained is the romance between them which feels pointless and they have no chemistry rose heself isnt that interesting a character and is just ok overall she is easily the biggest letdown in this in terms of new ideas or concepts explored if i believed and liked her more it wouldve made her stopping finn at the end more riveting but i just felt nothing and was confused because they had no chemistry or clues pointing ot a romance undertone rey shouldve been shown more sruggling and devloping in her training she never does that and feels like she is full power right off the bat and is honestly boring during the training sessions the kylorey connection is reallly interesting and makes up for it though than she isnt even in most of the second half until the very end at crait add in a few other ideas like leia using the force and you get ideas that are interesting but never connect in a nice way and give way to a bloated runtime that really starts to creak under the wieght around the start of the second half and drags a bit i didnt really have any problem with what they did with luke and thought it was interesting and respectable this jumps constantly in the middle with like 6 different story arcs and tries wrapping up a lot of stuff the supreme leader needed more focus and devlopment and wasnt given any except to explain plot expose most of the time overall it has interesting ideas and succeeds at exploring those ideas more than failing but needed more focus anyone who is a die hard fan of the franchise or big fan of the director or actors in this should check this out this isnt a terrible film at all in the slightest but it has serious and marginal issues abound
Aug 23 2023,negative,disgraceful to star wars rian johnson is the worst director of all time
Aug 23 2023,negative,rian johnson has shown he can create a compelling story with looper unfortunately he was not up for the task for the last jedi in the end very little happens in this movie when in the grand scheme of things really limits story concepts for the final movie
Aug 23 2023,positive,really awesome surprisingly subversive and actually a worthy addition in the lore quality action cinematography and score
Aug 22 2023,positive,there has been some controversy over the decision rian johnson made for luke skywalker and the path he chose for him to go down but i really like it i wasnt happy about how long luke wasted on the island and how much green milk he had to drink but i was intrigued by his reasons for doing what he did and found myself constantly engaged by every scene with him included and not just because hes mark hammill
Aug 22 2023,negative,as a star wars fan this turd sandwich is hard to eat no matter how much mustard you put on it  not bad on the action front but rj really just did not understand the franchise and the people that approved the script were clearly not qualified to do so
Aug 19 2023,negative,one of the worst movies ive ever seen in my life
Aug 19 2023,negative,an example of bad writing and looks over substance
Aug 19 2023,positive,the last jedi is unpredictable and emotionally grounded which i appreciate its not amazing but its not bad
Aug 18 2023,negative,rian johnson is a talented director but he wasnt the right choice for star wars bad movie
Aug 18 2023,negative,yeah no thanks the sequel trilogy is already struggling
Aug 13 2023,positive,the movie decunstructs the tropos that its own saga built over the decades exploring new territories while staying tru to its roots
Aug 10 2023,negative,this was what took away any potential the sequels had did rian johnson ever watch a star wars movie before this research any of the lore we know he is a great director but he singlehandedly destroyed a beloved franchise and for what   he made luke a rotten shell of the hero we all grew up with and before anyone says well yoda and obi wan did the same thing  no them running  hiding from the empire in order to protect themselves and the future of the order is far different than luke trying to murder his nephew and then leaving everyone behind to pick up the pieces of the mess that he left even mark hamill knew luke would never do that but alas rj wanted to do what he wanted to do and so we got jake skywalker   admiral ackbar was given not even a second thought after all the good he did for the rebellion   rey turns into a selfish overpowered brat that stays consistent for the rest of the series   half the movie focused on a casino which added nothing to the plot just flashy scenery nothing else  he killed off the 2 big bads how are you going to kill off the villains in the middle of a series  the only good thing this movie did was make rey a nobody which was then syked in the next movie i guess the scenery imagery is beautiful too thats it     hands down one of the worst movies ever nevermind the worst star wars movies
Aug 9 2023,negative,i will never forget the moment my best friend and i in theaters laughed at the ending for the totally incredible dissapointment it represented to us we definitely comproved at that point after seeing a messy crappy 2 and a half hour adventure that george lucas had sold his soul to disney
Aug 8 2023,negative,a disgrace of a film this was one of the reasons star wars isnt in my top 3 favourite franchises anymore 0110
Aug 7 2023,negative,who in the hell decided it was okay to do this to star wars and luke skywalker    i thought i had gone nuts nuts when i first saw this film  i thought for sure something was wrong with me because i couldnt imagine anyone would make this garbage on purpose so i must be losing my mind right    right    nope    this movie was simply garbage    shame on you disney for destroying us gen xers dreams of luke skywalker coming back    we waited over 30 years for his return and this is the crap you gave us for all of our patience and loyalty over the decades    shame on you disney    shame on you
Aug 4 2023,negative,wow the professional critics gave this film a 90 its obvious theyre bought off where do i even begin  this movie had so many holes failed plot twists and pointless subplots that its a complete train wreck  isaac  driver were the only two actors who brought their agame the rest were absolutely terrible even mark hamil thought this movie was terrible daisy was decent in the force awakens but she took a major step backwards in this film ive seen better fight scenes  choreography in senior citizen civil war reenactments and better  acting in middle school  reproductions this movie perfectly illustrates just how terrible disney is and how they absolutely ruin everything they touch pixar indiana jones pirates of the caribbean etc etc etc whomever gave this movie more than 2 stars should never review anything ever again a blind def  dumb person could easily figure out this movie is pure garbage special effects were topnotch thats all this is a movie thats so bad that its doomed the final installment of this trilogy theres no coming back to all the starwars fans out there sorry sorry youre a star wars fan anything promising that came from  the force awakens was completely trashed by this pile of dog crap the writers and director clearly knew nothing about starwars cant wait for the next steamer disney craps out garbage garbage garbage
Aug 4 2023,negative,this has nothing to do with star wars it takes every thing good about force awakens and destroys it no one has a charachter ark the lore and rules is rewritten from the other movies to fit this shitty movie the best this movie can be described as is fan fiction as it is set in a other galaxy far far far away from star wars
Jul 30 2023,positive,i am a huge star wars fan but this one left me a bit confused i did not think lukes character was portrayed very well from a narrative perspective not sure if disney execs are to blame the writers or the director the acting was fine as were the special effects if i wasnt a fan i would rate it lower
Jul 27 2023,negative,in star wars the last jedi directed by rian johnson i found a film that presented a mixed bag of cinematic elements leaving me with both positive and negative impressions    on the positive side the cinematography was truly impressive the visuals were breathtaking and the combination of cgi and practical effects created a grand and immersive experience that kept me engaged throughout the film    adam drivers portrayal of kylo ren was a standout performance for me his portrayal of the conflicted character added depth and complexity continuing kylo rens journey as one of the most compelling figures in the star wars saga    the film score by john williams was another highlight it beautifully complemented the storytelling evoking nostalgia and enhancing the emotional impact of the scenes specifically for the battle of crait sequence    however i felt that the last jedi fell short in certain aspects it disregarded nearly all of the setup established in the force awakens leaving me very disappointed as i had expected more continuity and development from certain storylines and character arcs that i loved from episode vii    the constant attempt to subvert expectations was a mixed bag for me while it brought some refreshing surprises at times it felt very forced and heavily disrupted the narratives flow    the lengthy casino planet scene was excessive for my taste and find it frustrating that the scene couldnt have been edited out even if johnson wanted to given that this story element needs to exist in order for the film is to make any sense it dragged on for too long and felt very disconnected from the main plot which massively affected the films pacing    moreover there were moments of excessive comedy that never landed and didnt fit well with the overall tone of the star wars universe previous to the disney era    the treatment of luke skywalkers character left me disappointed while it offered a fresh take on the iconic character it also departed from the core values and essence the character was know for     one major drawback was the lack of a cohesive vision for the new trilogy from lucasfilm the lack of a consistent overarching narrative made the trilogy feel disjointed and raised questions about its direction    the last jedi concluded without leaving me eager for the next chapter instead i felt unsure about the trilogys overall trajectory and it didnt leave me with a strong desire to watch the final installment    25
Jul 26 2023,negative,lots of ideas but ultimately unfulfilling waste of so much potential more interested in thumbing its nose at fans and expectations than actually doing something interesting with its promise
Jul 25 2023,positive,honestly i dont exactly hate this movie its ok and i can see why people dont like it but it could have been worse the rose stuff and parts of the luke skywalker portrayal were bad though
Jul 24 2023,negative,i kept waiting for the interesting part it wasnt until 2hrs in that i realized there wasnt going to be one
Jul 23 2023,positive,the last jedi takes bold risks with questionable character choices and a shaky second act creating a polarizing instalment that challenges the franchises conventions though some fans might find the departure from the traditional formula refreshing while others might be left divided
Jul 22 2023,positive,the best star wars since empire and a blockbuster movie that does something that is sadly rare surprise its audience and doesnt give it exactly what it wants  at least not immediately spoiler its logical that luke has is bitter and jaded and its beautiful that he finishes his arch with reaffirmed belief in the jedi
Jul 21 2023,negative,its not great especially when compared to the other star wars films most people will find this boring theres just so many confusing  questionable and childish moments
Jul 21 2023,negative,i wish i could rate 0 starsand the award for the worst sequel ever jj abrahams
Jul 20 2023,negative,on its own legs the last jedi is quite a good movie well directed several excellent acting performances an engaging and mostly interesting story and possibly deserving 335 unfortunately this movie cannot be considered on its own legs it is a part of a franchise and a deeply loved legacy it has managed not only to disrespect the lore characters and narrative of that legacy but also fails to fit within that legacy as a cohesive story that contributes to that narrative simply put this movie should not exist within the cinematic universe and does a disservice to all by doing so
Jul 20 2023,negative,the amount of talent needed to create a movie that has never failed to disappoint and anger me my opinions rot every watch
Jul 19 2023,positive,and if i say the best start wars movie then what
Jul 18 2023,negative,one of the worst movies i have ever watched
Jul 18 2023,negative,it is absolutely terrible and devastates the formerly great character of luke skywalker do not watch this absolute bs 
Jul 17 2023,negative,the only decent thing about this movie were the porgs they completely killed the luke skywalker character
Jul 17 2023,negative,the predicability and writing role they ddug themselves into is clear lack of respect and cohesion to the story they are trying to tell is tragic failing to complete a saga in a strong way with a laacluster villain tainting the image of the emperor not in a power scale but as a narrative tool this along with the bold decision by writers but coward decision in the end with reys name is a direspect to any capable viewer and giving the first collective negative and disappointment awe ive ever heard in my life a movie fan bad experience a fans of the series even worse
Jul 16 2023,positive,this was definitely one of the worst star wars movies second only to rogue one mark hamillgreat carrie fishergreat daisy ridleygreat john boyegagreat   oscar isaacgreat adam drivergreat  the only reason this film was mixed to negative was the storylinescript im sorry this is star wars i expect better
Jul 16 2023,positive,fresh and consistent sequel a truly cinematic film which continues the characters as i had imagined i knew in advance that we no longer live in the nineties in which the heroes of yesteryear would certainly have had a larger and more positive role but for the time of filming this is the best of the three sequel films great and serious star wars entertainment
Jul 16 2023,positive,this movie has some great parts and bad parts the directing is great the actors were excellent and its nice to see some fresh new ideas on the other hand the casino plot is not really that interesting rose tico is annoying and some scenes are too naiveover the top like flying leia hordos suicide attack everyone firing at projection luke i also dont like the naive humor it works for some movies but this is  a sequel movie so it must not be too different from the previous one
Jul 15 2023,negative,this movie killed the star wars franchise there is nothing left
Jul 14 2023,negative,i think that this starwars was made to intentionally subvert and belittle the main characters like luke on top of that the plot didnt make any sense it made me appreciate the prequels more even though they had terrible dialog
Jul 13 2023,negative,this was when disney destroyed any hope that they would make good star wars movies
Jul 11 2023,negative,nosense plot and charachters surely not a star wars movie
Jul 11 2023,negative,watching these two directors constantly flip each other the bird with this trilogy is sad and disappointing writing is abysmal whats to say about this film that hasnt already been said though its a disgrace  such a shame the force awakens wasnt great but it had potential and this film destroyed everything it set up and left nothing for the next film
Jul 10 2023,negative,i for one think this movie was stunning  brave a true example of hollywoods intrinsic skill of telling a strong moral  ultimately uplifting story  youve done it again kk good job
Jul 9 2023,negative,it is by far the worst star wars movie terrible humor rian johnson did not understand the characters from episode vii and many more things are absolute bullshit
Jul 8 2023,negative,flashy special effects incoherent drivel of story that has no payoff especially after the next iteration
Jul 8 2023,negative,when this came out at the cinema i was genuinely excited to see it the critics were raving that this was the best star wars film ever then i saw it the forced humour the awful story line and the dawning realisation that disney have no idea what they were doing this is star wars made by some one who has never heard off let alone seen a star wars film the ignorance of the lore that has been created is unbelievable a truly awful film
Jul 7 2023,positive,the best star wars movie now because of how different and more emotional it is
Jul 7 2023,positive,the black sheep of the sequels but id say its the best
Jul 6 2023,neutral,the effects are amazing dont get me wrong but they did lukes character very dirty and it was disappointing if your watching all 9 movies in order this isnt something to look forward to but its not anything to regret its as mid as it gets
Jul 5 2023,negative,definitely rotten the movie has some nice photography but thats all  no coherence with the rest of star wars at all no coherence with physics no respect for previous material and episodes problematic characters the problem with the movie is 100 with the writers and producers of this who allowed this to happen
Jul 4 2023,positive,you wait years to see your heros return only to discover that the film makers no longer respect them the only way they can handel a legacy characters seems to be make them broken and depressed weve never seen them like that before   now if this was good writing it could work but instead its not its one director turning up to do his own thing that although is interesting destroys the very story they spent millions trying to tell us   if you bring in more writers and voices then you have to make sure they are at least on the same page   this film feels like a whole different galaxy a whole different franchise   a star wars art house film could work but not as the middle part of a rushed trilogy that feels more about making money then telling a story to rival that of the the genius mind of gorge lucas
Jul 2 2023,positive,a modern masterpiece and one if the best star wars entries
Jul 1 2023,negative,for the longest time i blamed rian for what a hack job can of crap this movie is but then i saw some of his other films and realized he is probably close to genius with creating a story from the ground up hes not the guy you hire to continue an established story  hes the guy you hire to create something new with that understanding it is truly the colossal ineptitude of kathy kennedy that doomed the sequel trilogy from the start abrahams did what he could to salvage the wreckage but there was nothing he could really do
Jul 1 2023,negative,definitely the worst movie in the saga from turning luke into a grumpy old man to having rose tico nearly kill finn to save him from death this movie just makes no sense and goes against everything star wars stands for
Jun 30 2023,positive,my third favorite star wars film arguably the best since 1980 how they really managed to capture that same vibe as dagobah in empire strikes back i cant say enough good things about it
Jun 30 2023,negative,i admire what rian johnson attempted by trying to make a star wars movie that was unlike any other star wars movie it just didnt have the pay off at the end to justify any of it though he succeeded at making kylo a much more menacing big bad it really didnt do much else with the other characters sorry finn you really were wasted   having luke die in the most unsatisfying way will forever aggravate me this was the moment to have a the best lightsaber duel of all time  not have luke force project or whatever because he was to scared to leave his island sure the movies visually stunning but who really gives a sht
Jun 30 2023,positive,best of the sequels and on par with empire   ignore the hate
Jun 29 2023,negative,the movie removes the spirit of star wars and in so doing all its highlights it is a parody with meaning to be
Jun 28 2023,negative,this movie was something honestly the only scene i liked was poes defiance and the rest was just filler they also made luke the worst version of himself in this movie they undo everything great that george did in the original trilogy and like 23 of it takes place on a ship which was lame
Jun 21 2023,positive,after the promising return with the force awakens this is a slight letdown its comes across as a movie of scenes some great ones some weird ones as the story is quite fragmented
Jun 20 2023,negative,sucks this is possibly the worst of the star wars franchise especially compared to the one after this and the two trilogies before this
Jun 19 2023,positive,originally posted in december 2017    out of all the star wars films that are made this one is directed by rian johnson people absolutely adore it for its everything the acting the effects and the writing like in the force awakens and they cant wait for another film to come out which is called episode ix so after star wars the force awakens people absolutely loved everything about it much like the original trilogy they love all the memorable stuff in these they love the music like i do its so memorable mark hamill as luke skywalker carrie fisher as princess leia and harrison ford as han solo the side characters are alot of fun too but with those in the original trilogy ill get to that later in the original star wars reviews in the meantime now for this star wars episode viii  the last jedi or star wars the last jedi whatever you wanna call it is continued previously after star wars the force awakens now im sure alot of you might be thinking ive been watching star wars the last jedi with my friends now this is not the first time ive been to the cinema with my friends no no no no no the first time ive been to the cinema with my friends is where weve been watching guardians of the galaxy vol 2 yeah bet you didnt you did you the film resembles around four new characters from episode vii  the force awakens adam driver as kylo ren daisy ridley as rey john boyega as finn and oscar issac as poe dameron geez they have new actors and actresses put into this which is why theyre from the force awakens and i think the film has new characters in this by laura dern and benicio de toro yeah maybe thats all i can about the last jedi and also before i end it i just gotta say the visuals in the end battle are gorgeous whoever did the red crystals makes the visuals of the crystals and the floor made of red crystals really makes it so beautiful and fantastic to look at so yeah star wars the last jedi is a fantastic film and i sure gotta get around to watching the other star wars films even though i did notice before leaving the cinema is a tribute to carrie fisher who died last year of a heart attack after my favourite singer george michael on christmas day so that is star wars the last jedi and people and i cant wait for the last and final film of the star wars films in 2019 stay tuned may the force be with you
Jun 17 2023,negative,half a star is more than it deserves this film tries to deco struct star wars and it succeeds to rian johnson it is more important to subvert expectations than to deliver a star wars movies luke one of the characters who had made the franchise become big is treated as an old loser leia is now supergirl but doesnt have anything to say the male main characters are a joke and the female characters can do everything because women are strong rey is now literally stronger than every other trained jedi master before her why is it so hard to right a strong female character the movie had a break and i was angry at it and about to think leave it and yes the plot has more holes than a piece of cheese  and where the original trilogy had build up a resistance to fight the empire at the end of the second movie we now have a handfull of people who all fit in the milennieum falcon so the last film has to do everything start and end character arches start and a villain everything spoiler it does and it does it like punch to your stomach its really bad  the visuals are good though
Jun 16 2023,negative,it will always be trash
Jun 16 2023,negative,worst star wars film of all time  the rise of skywalker is a masterpiece compared to this
Jun 16 2023,negative,let me describe the bulk of this movies plot okay so its a car chase a low speed car chase there are twenty cop cars and one criminal car the cops have drones and short range guns the cops can teleport up at any time and shoot these guns the cops have sent out the drones previously and the drones killed the criminal driver now the passenger is trying to steer the car and took out the criminals drones  the cops are the first order and the criminals are the resistance now what happens the first order doesnt send out tie fighters or lightspeed ahead to shoot their short range cannons they just sit there slowly chasing the resistance  this is 2 of the problems with this movie
Jun 14 2023,positive,easily the best and my favorite star wars movie this movie heavily suffered in reviews from gamergate era politics as well as from redditors and people who dont touch grass the biggest complaint i see about this movie is how they ruined lukes character which is wild to me its the best part of the movie they actually managed to make luke skywalker interesting luke skywalker a character who was basically a boy scout mixed with jesus was finally given some conflict and proven to be full of him self thinking he had achieved jedi master status only to fall to his own hubris not to mention him dying the same way as his master obiwan brilliant theres a reason rian johnson is known for making the best episode of breaking bad rey has also trained on screen for longer than luke which baffles me when people call her a mary sue ultimately an amazing movie a pristine star wars film a movie that makes you question the nature of the jedi themselves
Jun 12 2023,negative,not just the worst star wars movie ever made but the worst movie ive ever seen  there is subverting expectation and there is mutilation of legacy  rian johnson did the latter  this undeserving trespasser within this lore cant do anything a director should  cant write cant set a pace cant identify garbage and most importantly cant handle the truth  of course what should one expect from someone who as a child blew up his star wars figures with firecrackers while imagining filming battles  if there was ever a case for having bad filmmaking   made into a crime its this movie  rian johnsons ego isnt as important as the legend although its certainly bigger  barbed wire electrical fencing should be placed between him and any future star wars projects  one star is actually a generous rating
Jun 12 2023,negative,how to fk up a franchises lore in one film this sht sucked
Jun 5 2023,negative,an absolute disaster of an epic scale
Jun 2 2023,positive,i am a life long star wars fan and tlj is incredible from the story to the visuals i love everything about this movie
Jun 2 2023,positive,if you asked me in 2017 id have given the movie a twostar review tops but its been six years and ive gotten over it you should watch it and make up your own mind there are some really good bits there are some controversial bits there are some boring bits canto bightplotline looking at you at least it all looks amazing and its star wars yknow enjoy the ride
May 30 2023,positive,my least favorite star wars film but still i love a good star wars movie
May 28 2023,negative,thats not luke this is a spit on the face of the fans what are you doing disney
May 27 2023,negative,not just bad star wars but a bad movie no consistency no sensible decisions everything about this travesty of a movie is disastrously bad
May 27 2023,negative,the entire movie felt like an attack on the force awakens johnson took every idea set up by jj and crumpled it up and smiled at the audience rian thinks that subverting expectations is all you need to make a good movie instead it results in a meaningless movie about the most boring chase scene that is drawn out for the entire movie
May 25 2023,negative,this is the movie that killed the star wars franchise i honestly hate that i have to give it even a half star and i wished i could get my money back it was such a slap in the face of the fan base that made star wars the most valuable franchise at the time not true now cant even give the toys away lets ruin the most beloved characters of the franchise all in one movie and make the hero of the franchise an absolute loser how is that working out for you now kk and disney star wars
May 24 2023,negative,this movie has no respect for the source material the movie it is following or the trilogy it is the middle of even as a random scifi movie it is a mess with no appeal  no interesting plot to pull you forward and a bevy of inconsistencies add the star wars back into it and its an unmitigated disaster
May 24 2023,negative,it was just one long slow police chase but in space with space ships  instead of in cars on land
May 23 2023,negative,visually this is an amazing movie    story unfortunately was weak portraying luke as a failed jedi mentor didnt resonate with me the scene where he tried killing ben in his sleep wasnt like the luke we all know from the originals if hed been possessed or something then maybe it wouldve made sense then the whole force projection seemed way too crazy    by far the worst star wars movie and in turn affected the rise of skywalker
May 22 2023,negative,plot faults galore a oj simpson style 3 hour space chase breaks established world building if your a fan of the first 6 i dont know how you could like this pos this is the first ever movie that left me feeling such disbelief when i left that i had to see it again after the 2nd viewing i was actually angry
May 21 2023,negative,wanna know how to enrage an entire fanbase tear down their favourite characters and retcon the lore to fit a new narrative that cares nothing for good writing and everything about milking a franchise for all its worth
May 21 2023,negative,wow this was bad by far the worst movie in star wars
May 20 2023,negative,i was just forced to rewatch tlj and felt the need to create an account on rotten tomatoes to express how rotten this movie really is  the movie lacks a compelling storyline the plot is driven by the forced incompetence of the bad guys plot holes bad setups movie mistakes and the disregard to the source material pull the viewer out of the emersion and insult fans of the franchise and movie enthusiast alike  the movie actively sabotaged any attempts of making the sequels somewhat coherent and enjoyable for the sake of averting the viewers expectations  i could name a thousand reasons why this movie is bad dont watch it if you have any standards when it comes to storytelling and movies in general
May 20 2023,negative,star wars was my favorite franchise this movie changed that for good i dont watch these movies anymore thanks to tlj
May 20 2023,negative,i just dont know how to say how bad this movie is   the comedy doesnt work the action doesnt work its contribution to the lore doesnt work   nothing works in the movie it is just bad there is nothing worse than seeing one of my most beloved character in film turn into a useless hopeless painfully upset emotional wreck i grade this movie an f minus
May 19 2023,negative,this is the best looking star wars film in the way it is shot and acted across the board however the story has paper thin characters and plot holes the size of the death star i could buy the grumpy luke skywalker after all it has been years however i just dont buy into the why he has changed it destroys the character we all know and love and the ending left me empty inside possibly one of the worst in the series
May 16 2023,positive,fantastic movie and one of my favorite of the series
May 15 2023,negative,i love star wars but this was a straight up disaster even as an 11 year old i thought this movie sucked when it came out luke skywalkers character was ruined it was basically hours and hours of ships crashing into each other and kylo ren is just a wimp overall if i had to wipe one star wars movie out of existence it would be this one
May 15 2023,negative,ok this is just a copy of the first film of the past trilogy but removing the main character and putting a mary sue instead obi wan told luke to not figth even not get close to darth vader or he got to die badly he also sacrifice himself when vader got close to luke after 15 films with experiences and training luke finally figth vader and lose bad also losing a hand at the end of the trilogy luke just can figth without lose 1 vs 1 ok why because the opponent has 30 more years of training and experience and also has the same force   here she never never saw a jedi saber found one she took it and in that specfic moment figth and win 1 vs 1 with her counterpart common he trained for 20 years and just lose like that why he also tried after that he just should give up
May 13 2023,positive,all over the place as a film
May 13 2023,negative,poorly written half baked and devoid of any soul
May 12 2023,positive,this movie is easily in the running for greatest star wars movie of all time or at least in the argument for top three this movie is absolutely incredible the movie is quite frankly one of the most cinematically and visually beautiful movies in the skywalker saga and the music that goes along with it is also fantastic story wise its a beautiful story luke skywalkers story seemingly follows the story of king arthur and follows george lucass own plans and ideas for what would happen to luke following on from the original trilogy    theres fantastic new characters such as holdo and rose and theres a lot of deep and beautiful messages in the story a beautiful movie i strongly recommend it
May 12 2023,negative,everything has been said and written   i wouldnt blame so much the actors or writers i blame kathleen and rian they have absolutely no understanding of what sw is thats why they had such a massive problem creating a decent story   anyone who still thinks that this was a good movie or a good trilogy should listen to what mark hamill george and marcia lucas john boyega or kelly tran said about it  a rushed out product to meet investors pocket sorry
May 12 2023,negative,the last jedi is notouriously badi am here to confirm that
May 12 2023,negative,an absolute insult to star wars fans its almost as if rian johnson purposely rejected nods to the fan base in an attempt to selfishly derail the entire franchise this movie single handedly ruined the entire new trilogy  filled with plot holes inconsistent with cannon killed off interesting characters in uninteresting ways and gave disproportional screen time to horrendously unlikable characters  not to mention this film took a hot steaming dump on my childhood hero luke skywalker
May 12 2023,negative,this movie looked like a tribute of the episode v but with a really bad story this is the worst sequel of star wars its like the creators just wrote anything they thought really sad to see the fall of star wars you can really see the absence of george lucas
May 10 2023,negative,this was by far the worst star wars film ive seen  i saw it in theaters in 2017 and hated it decided to give it a try again and confirmed my original thoughts  disney just does not understand star wars at all
May 9 2023,negative,this is the movie that ruined star wars for me  this is perhaps one of the most egregious examples of how hollywood and disney in particular is pushing an identity politics agenda at the expense of story audiences are smarter than the executives give us credit for visual effects do not make up for bad storytelling and preachy politics the force awakens was a decent movie but it is really disappointing that the last jedi did not build on that momentum i say take advantage of the writers strike and fire all the writers we could use some fresh ideas after the recent rash of terribly written movies
May 9 2023,negative,how can you be so bereft of ideas in this genre and this universe and be both logicless and lacking a sense of the bigger picture
May 9 2023,negative,ive always loved star wars but i couldnt help but feel empty after watching
May 9 2023,negative,the rain wreck they is disneys star wars continue let bring back a key character and just screw up his entire character terrible
May 8 2023,negative,so bad from start to finish if you think for more than one second breaks the lore so many times and there are 10000000s of hours on youtube explaning why it is so bad so im not going to but over bad and terable addition to the franchise
May 7 2023,negative,what a joke didnt think ep 7 could get worse but here we are
May 7 2023,negative,i sort of liked it coming out of the theater but after years of living in denial i can now admit this is sadly the worst thing to ever happen to star wars its astonishing that disney has yet to fully clear house over there yet it appears they have long been under the shadow of sith rule and this movie was sadly their order 66 to the franchise
May 5 2023,negative,the 3rd worst star wars movie ever made
May 5 2023,positive,this movie is a masterpiece that sits atop the star wars universe as both meta commentary and a passing of the torch of the force and rebellion to the next generation lukes story arc in this film is more developed than in all the other films combined and is a beautiful conclusion to his story
May 5 2023,negative,this movie really doesnt understand what is being a jedi it doesnt treat with respect their legacy characters and provide a sense of entitlement to the new characters   there is no sense of hero journey but only perfection of the new characters they are developing
May 5 2023,positive,kind of disappointed they made luke a bum and the asian girl was annoying yoda and leia scene was good rip princess leia
May 4 2023,positive,the greatest 02 hours and 32 minutes ever
May 4 2023,negative,a middling filler arc between force awakens and rise of skywalker think slow speed chase in space and youve got the plot some nice cinematography but it is all style and no real substance
May 4 2023,negative,this did not feel like a star wars movie also nothing from the previous movies paid off in this movie at all the portrayal of luke skywalker was such a let down had this been another movie not connected to star wars maybe it would have been ok a big maybe but since it is connected to a larger picture and a larger narrative it is not ok
May 4 2023,negative,star wars the last jedi is kinda the fall of this trilogy in my opinion i know that a lot of people give praise to this movie and call it the best star wars movie yet but i honestly cant see why although i did like the unexpected twist i didnt like the way they handled lukes character i wish at the end battle of the movie instead of luke using a force projection he was actually there himself if this happened the movie would be showing us that luke truly does care about everything that is going on and actually have a true battle at the end of the movie i think luke just being killed off without fighting is just very underwhelming overall for me the film is a complete character assassination the film might have stunning visuals but sadly thats the only good part of the film
May 4 2023,negative,not good so many cannon breaking stuff should not be considered cannon
May 3 2023,positive,probably the most epic and refreshing star wars movie ive ever seen i love all the star wars movies but this one this one was a truly special experience
May 3 2023,positive,film is great overall but i can see how it triggers the fan base
May 2 2023,negative,rians subversive filmmaking doesnt work with a franchise like star wars
May 2 2023,negative,the movie ruined star wars for me the subverting of expectations left me with wanting nothing more to do with star wars luke was a complete joke and waste this is from someone who really enjoyed the force awakens after watching the last jedi i reflected on my force awakens experience and realized i liked the force awakens a lot less than originally it really soured my impression of the force awakens
May 2 2023,negative,this movie inflicted catastrophic damage to the star wars franchise due to flagrant political messaging and its wanton deconstruction of the characters who made the star wars movies so beloved by so many people clearly the last jedi wasnt made for me message received
May 1 2023,negative,this film really wants to challenge its viewers by adverting expectations is it clever sometimes is it what anyone really wanted no at a point when many star wars fans were eagerly awaiting the return of luke skywalker what we got was a broken character who failed at everything he attempted to achieve earlier rey is still interesting but  everything is handed to her on a silver platter poe and finns side stories are both equally uninspired with poes story created strictly to comment on the then current metoo movement a mansplainer forced to trust the purple haired lady no matter what information she provides or doesnt star wars lore aside the interaction between daisy ridley and mark hamill is very compelling and if you can get past the idea this is supposed to be luke skywalker its not a bad story again in the context of the universe this doesnt work and theres no question why the fans in large have rejected this entry
May 1 2023,negative,unlike other negative reviewers i was not a star wars fan when i saw this film in fact i had never seen a star wars film before seeing this movie i went with my nerd friends who talk about sw all the time so i tagged along with them to see what all the fuss was about in the first couple minutes of the movie i see why they liked it loud bright and intense action scenes pleased my sensory organs once the action scenes ended the enjoyment stopped there the story was not presented very well and i thought it was absolute nonsense i mean the elder tried to kill his nephew because of a bad dream then space superman happened i was completely bored by the time the cool action scene happened and even then it did seem kinda goofy then the man died because he was tired other wise perfectly healthy i left confused as to why people enjoyed it it put me off of the franchise for 3 years until the pandemic hit and i had lots of time so i watched the prior movies and they are masterpieces compared to this i really dont understand how something so cool with lots of potential was executed so poorly
Apr 30 2023,negative,it was a good movie but not a star wars movie it didnt complement the old characters and it didnt feel like star wars
Apr 30 2023,negative,worst star wars movie   the movie doesnt make sense at all if youre a star wars fan  if you just want to watch a brainless movie this one should do just fine
Apr 29 2023,negative,it felt like a 2 part episode of the clone wars the pacing was horrible  the plot was thin and full of holes
Apr 29 2023,negative,one of the worst star wars movies ever
Apr 28 2023,negative,so many plot holes disrespectful to george lucas the disney writing team is a disgrace
Apr 27 2023,negative,everything that makes a star wars movie is not in there fight choreographies are off by a lot mostly centered on the character or rey but fail miserably to develop it and they waisted the very little potential they has created in the previous one very disappointed 055 is way too much of a generous rating
Apr 26 2023,negative,this was not a star wars film worst film associated with the franchise
Apr 26 2023,negative,one of the worst movies ever made story made 0 sense and the plot holes are so big all of the death stars could fit
Apr 25 2023,negative,is disney attempting to destroy kill and bury the original trilogy
Apr 25 2023,negative,this is by far the worst star wars movie ever combining all films shows and games this is by far the worst product of them all the plot is boring and yet so ridiculous luke being a coward and also the technical reason why kylo fell to the dark side is absolute bs finn is reduced to comic relief rey is a mary sue and snoke is wasted to the core as overreactive as it is to say this is where disney star wars started to show it was going to be full of a decent amount of ups but a worryingly amount of downs rian johnson really screwed up and the fact he finds it amusing to troll fans who didnt like the film excluding toxic fans who took their hate too far shows how much of an egotistical ignorant pos he is thankfully star wars has been doing okay since this pile of rubbish also to the shills of this movie and the trilogy its apart of great happy you like it but spending your time trolling other fans makes no more toxic than other sw fans nothing is above criticism especially this garbage 010
Apr 25 2023,negative,it had some moments but the constant character assassination of luke skywalker and the gross misuse of phasma and finn has still left a sour taste in my mouth after all these years the whole canto bight ark was a slog to get through but this is not what the extended universe fans wanted we wanted lukes jedi order not whatever this was  it disrespected long time fan of star wars who buy those books and get attach to those characters and only to be served with whatever this was
Apr 25 2023,positive,as a huge star wars fan since i was a little kid i cannot overstate how great this movie is and what a wonderful breath of fresh air it was for the franchise this movie had fantastic action excellent acting and it set up for so many opportunities that were later squandered by jj abrams
Apr 24 2023,positive,the best star wars movie from the sequels
Apr 24 2023,negative,thanks for ruining one of the greatest things from my childhood
Apr 24 2023,negative,incredibly impressively terrible writing one of the worst movies ive ever seen it didnt ruin star wars because its not star wars
Apr 23 2023,negative,rían johnson should hang his head in shame absolutely appalling
Apr 21 2023,positive,not as bad as the idiotic fans act like it is its a well made film that takes chances
Apr 20 2023,positive,this is what the summer blockbuster is made of
Apr 20 2023,negative,the worst star wars movie ever made the force awakens was a guilty pleasure nostalgia trip and this picture felt more like a marvel movie made in the star wars universe halfway through the movie some people started leaving and i cant blame them it was very hard to watch its sad to see what a little florida mousedisney can do to a beloved franchise like star wars unfortunately adams drivers performance somehow got worse which made his character look like a vegan darth vader  daisys ridleys character became somewhat corny and it was hard to watch some scenes with rey john boyega again was the most likeable character and i enjoyed both his and kelly marie trans performance but unfortunately this isnt enough to save this train wreck of a movie
Apr 20 2023,positive,this is rian johnsons masterpiece his love for star wars really shines in this piece of film as he drew most of his inspiration from both lucas and kirosawa as well as his acknowledgement of deep star wars lore     star wars never felt so fresh nostalgic and exciting the stakes were high and the performances are sublime carrie fishers last movie is truly her best work as an actress and as the iconic princess leia mark hamill and adam driver exceptionally deliver the best performances of the franchise    johnson was bold and not afraid to take risks to take the characters and the audience to places they had never been to in this franchise this is something that truly shows how rian was willing to make a true film instead of a corporate product filled with fan service to please the masses    the last jedi is by all means the best star wars picture ever made it may not be the most iconic historically relevant or fan loved movie in the franchise but objectively star wars has never been this great on film and probably will never be
Apr 20 2023,negative,worst movie of the sequel trilogy which is saying a lot this movie ensured that the sequels would be awful
Apr 19 2023,negative,this has to be the worst excuse for a movie with the name star wars in it there is little rian johnson could have done to destroy this franchise more the plot goes absolutely nowhere and the side quests the characters need to accomplishdont make a difference whether they succeed or failed dont waste your time watching this movie read a synopsis about it online and skip over
Apr 19 2023,negative,this film suffered from a lack of oversight it comes across that there was no real plan following on from the force awakens  the character development is not good from flippantly killing off characters with no real impact or payoff tallie lintra killed off in the hanger bay holdos sacrifice should have been ackbar snokes unceremonious offing  as an actor from the clone wars series stated last jedi  to me felt like a movie made by a guy who hadnt quite done his homework
Apr 18 2023,negative,very poorly written watching it is more a sequence of pokes rather than one fatal lightsaber swing to the neck the introduction of new concepts space fuel just adds to an already absurd sloppy production poor
Apr 18 2023,positive,one of the greatest star wars movies of all time probably the best of the sequel trilogy rian johnson is a genius
Apr 17 2023,negative,the entire sequel trilogy and this movie in particular is to star wars what mount vesuvius was to pompeii
Apr 17 2023,neutral,this last trilogy is a complete disaster nothing makes sense and the main new characters are not attractive at all it is worse to destroy luke skywalker character  i hope disney forget forever this disastrous trilogy that never should be made
Apr 17 2023,neutral,i give this movie 255 stars for its ambition its spectacle and its humor it is a film that tries to subvert expectations and challenge conventions while also delivering some stunning visuals thrilling action sequences and witty dialogue the film also features some great performances from its cast especially mark hamill as luke skywalker carrie fisher as leia organa and adam driver as kylo ren the film also pays tribute to the legacy of star wars with some emotional moments and nostalgic references    however i also think that some aspects of the film are disappointing such as the plot the characters and the tone the film sometimes feels disjointed and inconsistent especially in its pacing and structure the film also struggles to develop some of its characters and make them compelling and relatable the film also lacks some of the magic and wonder that made star wars so captivating the film also alienates some fans with its controversial choices and changes that undermine or contradict the previous films the film also fails to answer some of the questions and mysteries that were set up by the force awakens nevertheless star wars the last jedi is a bold and divisive film that offers a different perspective on the star wars universe
Apr 16 2023,negative,its more disney now than star wars this movie had no regard for the magic of the original series or the characters and plot set up in force awakens the writing is lazy and the explanation of the events is contrived at best future creators of star wars content would do well to avoid any references to this train wreck of a movie
Apr 15 2023,negative,i appreciate all the actors for playing their parts and no disrespect to them as an avid sw fan this movie isnt getting accurately reviewed and deserves a lower score the original didnt make these movies or intended to make them nor did the originals apprentice all three are well funded fan films with subverted expectation dilemmas in story development we arent asking for much make jedi train to be good dont disrespect established and well written characters dont edit fight scenes by digitally deleting weapons from praetorian guards hands wtf is this animal titty milk scene
Apr 14 2023,positive,it was a good standalone movie thats it
Apr 14 2023,negative,im sorry but this has to be one of the worst movies ive ever seen from the introduction to irrelevant characters to main characters acting not in character  to the strange plot and story terrible
Apr 13 2023,positive,it is better than its predecessor seeing luke shot down was a nice addition to the movie i dont like the ending very much but without a doubt this is the best film in the trilogy
Apr 13 2023,negative,what started off with promise in the new trilogy is quickly dashed in the second edition a story that doesnt really go anywhere new characters that arent particularly likeable as well as the main cast breaking from their character traits you can tell rian johnson is not a fan of the star wars franchise as he completely disregards what was left before him and carry on the lore as a stand alone film without the star wars name it probably would have done better but sadly i left the film massively disappointed the most polarising film in the franchise for sure the critics loved it but i felt it was a slap in the face to the fans
Apr 12 2023,positive,so over hated took the star wars formula and shook it up instead of being a repeat of an older movie if only they made a sequel to this instead of making rise of skywalker
Apr 12 2023,negative,was eagerly anticipating the release of this movie due to the infinite possibilities of what they could do instead it ignored everything that was being set up in episode vii and filled with self defeating plot points zero desire to see the conclusion to this now pointless movie
Apr 12 2023,negative,very poor follow up to the force awakens not sure what they were thinking with this one
Apr 12 2023,negative,worse than episode 7 they unfortunately killed what could have been an amazing saga
Apr 12 2023,negative,rian johnson has proven before and since this movie that he can write and direct very well but my god this just wasnt it
Apr 12 2023,negative,sad sad sad the critics had to have been watching a different movie than i did
Apr 12 2023,negative,this whole trilogy disappointed beyond words this had to be a joke just had to be
Apr 12 2023,negative,rian johnson should never work with star wars again absolute trash movie
Apr 12 2023,negative,i have literally not paid a cent to disney ever since this movie came out if i could give it less than half a star i would they did luke dirty they did finn dirty they ruined the setup from the force awakens and have done real damage to the fandom rian johnson should be banned from ever touching starwars again
Apr 11 2023,negative,this movie was just awful bad writing a huge amount of plot holes no coherence at all a complete mess
Apr 11 2023,positive,it makes me belly laugh when star wars fans hate this movie and then defend a pile of steaming garbage like attack of the clones this was an excellent film all on its own without any other star wars movie which is exactly like episodes for an episodes four and five were i dunno maybe a lot of lifelong fans were offended by the idea of a disillusioned luke as though he shouldve been the same exact kid he was 30 years ago with no growth failure or regret he played a huge part in turning his best friend and his sisters son into a sith worshiper at least from his point of you and that is a pretty big cause to go into hiding and reexamine your religion  which by the waythe jedi order had the force all wrong from the getgo  i love the message of this movie the power of the force belongs to all inhabitants of the galaxy not just dudes with lightsabers  im very likely wrong and there shouldve been a great sequence in this movie that takes place inside of a droid factory with c3po doing kooky gymnastics or a floppy eared gungan piloting a battle tank that  definitely wouldve made it better
Apr 11 2023,negative,i am a big fan of sw but unfortunately the force is not in this movie  almost boring with the bad guy kylo behaving like a teenage with some deep inner crisis and look nothing like a scary respectable villain he should have never took out his mask which make him even more laughableas for rey she was born super woman with no need of a special training like the others do fantastic rightother side actors are just forgettabledisney what have you done to star wars i am losing all the good force and hope on this
Apr 11 2023,negative,they shouldve looked to the books for the path to take and failed
Apr 11 2023,negative,how can anyone say this was a good movie is beyond me so many plot holes noncoherent storytelling destroying pretty much everything that came before theres a lot to be said about this film and nothing is good mark hamill himself made it very clear   good job disney
Apr 11 2023,positive,this movie is mixed some people think its the best movie ever some people think its the worst movie ever i think it was cool from start to finish but dont mind when people disagree
Apr 10 2023,negative,so bad characters had no continuity with previous movies script was awful and they absolutely assassinated lukes character i used to love star wars but thats before disney got a hold of it
Apr 10 2023,negative,this movie took all of the momentum of episode 7 and threw it in the trash the movie spends hours on meaningless side stories that dont pay off at all it introduces some truly cringe inducing characters that nobody likes the amount of plot holes and lore breaks this movie introduces are truly awful you can tell it was directed by people that dont care for star wars at all rather than attempting to develop characters and honor the original films they desecrate the legacy of the original trilogy and undo decades of plot for no discernable reason ryan johnson and kathleen kennedy owe every single one of us an apology and a refund
Apr 10 2023,positive,best of the 3 sequels without a doubt
Apr 9 2023,positive,while it may not be quite as satisfying as fans would like starwars the last jedi is a different more character based film that impresses with its visuals and interesting story    rating 65
Apr 9 2023,negative,ridiculous plot where the bad guys actually care more about the welfare of their troops than the supposed good guys rian johnson masterpiece of nonsense that does nothing to either develop the star wars story nor make a watchable film
Apr 9 2023,positive,for me its one of the best star wars movies ever i love every piece of it i went to the cinema three times and cried of joy every time mark hamill is 110 and i will never understand how someone cant like this thank you ryan johnson 3
Apr 8 2023,negative,the story is horrible i do not understand why you would make luke a hermit mark hamill hates what has become of his character rey is such a horrible character has no training and somehow in the previous movie defeats kylo ren in lightsaber duel kylo ren is a crybaby finn follows rey around during the trilogy like a lost puppy the whole movie they just run away they tried to remake the original trilogy but it is just horrible i do not even consider the sequel trilogy canon if i could give it zero stars i would
Apr 8 2023,positive,6 years later and the babies are still on here complaining meanwhile im just getting around to my first review of the film after loving it in theaters dont forget people those who dont like something are more likely to review than those who enjoyed it all the loud mouths thinking they are the majority are incorrect hope the internet makes you feel better about yourself though lol
Apr 8 2023,negative,princess leia is not mary poppins the force does not let you facetime there is no gravity in space luke would never do this chrome dome enough said 
Apr 8 2023,negative,a nonsense nobody who understands star wars saga could make such a fake one
Apr 8 2023,negative,rotten tomatoes deleted my original account so having to redo some older reviews this movie is absolutely terrible i could go on  complete disrespect for source material plot holes the size of death stars etc  but why bother nuff said already
Apr 8 2023,negative,it was difficult to even fathom a star wars film worse than episode i the phantom menace but this achieved the unthinkable easily from huge inconsistencies impossible scenarios plot holes a ridiculous script some of the lines were horrible and completely unbelievable it was a mess there were some good moments but these couldnt salvage how terrible it was
Apr 7 2023,negative,if you see this as a big budget fan fiction written by writers with mediocre knowledge about the original plot and characters the movie was good cool effects and the actors were really good but the story sucks they destroyed all that we knew and spoiler alert they killed of the only new charakter that had some kind of potential thats all to say
Apr 7 2023,negative,visually the film was impressive the colors angles costume designs and other visual elements were nicely done no issue with the aesthetics of the director and production but the core of star wars  its characters  were done badly decades of canonical story lore and fan expectation were ignored ridiculed or just thrown away there was no love of the characters and no respect to the audience shown this was the beginning of the end of star wars as a franchise and sadly what has been done cant be undone or can it disney should just slap the label legends on all three sequel films to do so would give sufficient closure for fans that these films are no part of the canonical film series and with mark hammill still alive theres time to do a few more brilliant star wars films with his much beloved character luke skywalker
Apr 7 2023,negative,what a disaster  a master class in devaluing one of the greatest ips in cinema history  so many plot holes the terrible usage of luke and leia and new randomunlikeable characters with no character arcs  plot holes you could drive a death star through  you have 40 years of material and characters handed to you and the writers come up with a 20 minute fetch quest for no apparent reason no real relation to the main plot that could have been handled with a few lines of dialogue  just to name a few
Apr 6 2023,negative,a transgressive iconoclast with zero interest in continuity is a bad plan for the 2nd installment in a trilogy much less a universe written by someone else entirely decades ago
Apr 6 2023,negative,one of the worst movies i have ever seen in my life it fails on every level this movie made me realize that movie critics today are paid for bias reviews especially when it comes to disney
Apr 3 2023,positive,as pompous as ever  big cgi  epic music  shallow characters  along with the plot mostly recycled from the earlier movies  disappointing as most star wars is
Apr 3 2023,positive,the last jedi is ace fuck you
Apr 3 2023,negative,luke skywalker is given yet another redemption arc as a supporting character in this film which undermines the redemption arc that luke already had fulfilled in the return of the jedi as the lead protagonist there are so many different ways the character could have gone and its strange that johnson couldnt map out a direction for the character that hadnt already been charted with so many writing options out there its a shame that disney let this happen
Apr 2 2023,positive,the most overhated star wars film out there easily the best of the sequel trilogy
Apr 1 2023,negative,disappointing should have kept luke skywalker an inspiring character like he was in the originals just feels like disney are incapable of reigning in their need to script big spontaneous sporadic events into a story that becomes disjointed  leiah being blown out into space and then floating herself back into the ship just an example of how disney butchers moments in their story telling i mean has leiah even demonstrated force training at this point then does something outrageously impossible its unnesseccarily annoying  another example having finn rammed out of soloing the walkers in the base assault its just ridiculous story telling   disneys need to script their story around politically correct statements is tiresome and boring    to be honest im tired of even writing about this dissppointing direction and disaster in star wars history
Mar 30 2023,negative,boring film sequel trilogy is just rubbish
Mar 30 2023,negative,nothing like the original star wars movies    watch if you like an out of character luke skywalker major character death boring characters and a plot that reassembles spaghetti mixed with mashed potatoes
Mar 28 2023,negative,if this any other movie it is good but because its star wars it neglected so many principles theres even a god speed in the dialogue the arrogance of the writings irritating long term fans with no respect nor a stronger foundation for the upcoming sw universe this movie was an insult
Mar 27 2023,positive,literally the most forgettable star wars movie i have ever seen if you ask anything that happened in this movie i wouldnt be able to tell you other than luke dies weird skinny guy dies everything is sad what a disappointing entry to one of the greatest franchises of all time please disney stop making these we can all see youre running out of ideas
Mar 23 2023,positive,although all the sequels are really bad from lazy rehash of old and death ideas plain stupid or just painfully boring i found this one the only that showed something different and therefore it becomes instantly relevant visually it has great ideas and its also unexpected and surprising as a elseworlds star wars story this one is quite good
Mar 23 2023,negative,was a poor move no heros in the story the sets were terrible
Mar 21 2023,negative,the worst star wars movie ever made half of the plot is just a boring waste of time that accomplishes nothing the other half is based on circus tricks written to feel clever brave and unconventional whereas the force awakens seems to be written by someone who did not understand star wars this movie seems to be written by someone who has a visceral hatred for star wars and who feels the urge to slaughter mythical characters beloved by all just to feel stronger than a legend he despise
Mar 19 2023,negative,i loved star wars for most of my life i could recite all three movies of the top of my head this is not star wars
Mar 19 2023,negative,worst movie i have seen in a long time  unfitting humor nonsense physics nonsense story    the hole movie feels like made by a movie maker student with no experience    half star only because of the visuals and music
Mar 17 2023,negative,milking it for every penny lol crazy people are still buying star wars related content smh
Mar 13 2023,negative,this movie is probably the most wasted oportunity of all time in the world of cinema disrespected lore holdo maneuver makes you question why in ep 4 and 6 they had to attack the death star the way they did if you could just slam an hyperspaceing ship into it lightsabers easily used by non force sensitive and without trainingalso not lethal disrespected characters luke changing from the most optimistic guy who saw good in darth vader and turned him back to light side to a character thats pessimistic and egotistical and disrespected logic holdo withholding vital information on tha plan just to surprise the audience also a long boring and useless sidequest that deviates from the mail plot and forced comedy the premises of the movie itself makes no sensea car chase with space ships until fuel runs outin a world of faster than light speed
Mar 11 2023,negative,star wars the last jedi is not just the worst star wars movie but it maybe one of the worst movies of all time where do i even begin  they completely ruined the character of luke skywalker you think if you think that the prequels are bad i must spit on that opinion if youre telling me that luke skywalker is going to murdure his own nefiou because of a bad dream you are just wrong dont even get me started on kantobite ok despite what i said what did you think of it
Mar 11 2023,negative,worst of the franchise didnt link in to the og trilogy at all tried to change too many elements whilst making these annoying onthenose statements like let the past die     youre doing a sequel which connects to the most beloved trilogy in history its not a time to mess around with a winning formula
Mar 11 2023,negative,easily the worst movie in the entire star wars franchise
Mar 10 2023,negative,terrible it such a shame what they did to our beloved original trilogy characters ruined star wars unless they delete this film from star wars canon star wars will never be the same
Mar 9 2023,negative,apparently studios disapproved the previous episode so they chose to destroy it with plot holes implausibilities incoherences and cheap plot twist but forgot to rebuild it at the end nothing as changed the good guys still good and the vilains still vilains so whats the point yet the pictures are beautiful
Mar 8 2023,negative,this is the worst movie ever made that seems like a huge overstatement but this is why it takes a very special kind of terrible to have such a great setup in the force awakens and to systematically sabotage everything good about the story its a miracle that rise of skywalker was able to salvage a decent movie out of this mess
Mar 7 2023,negative,you really have to turn off your brain to enjoy you can cut thirty mins out of the film on an otherwise pointless subplot the casino luxury planet which distracted from the chase the chase also was really drawn out and boring poor military tactics employed on both the first order and resistance not a massive rey fan she can do pretty first try with little to no training doesnt really have a heros journey or even much development as a character
Mar 6 2023,positive,directed by rian johnson the last jedi is the eighth installment in the star wars franchise and follows the events of the force awakens the film stars daisy ridley adam driver mark hamill john boyega and oscar isaac among others    lets start with the positives the cinematography in the last jedi is stunning the film is filled with beautiful sweeping shots of the galaxy which help to immerse the viewer in the star wars universe the special effects are also topnotch and the action sequences are wellchoreographed and exciting    the acting in the last jedi is strong across the board with standout performances from daisy ridley as rey adam driver as kylo ren and mark hamill as luke skywalker ridley brings a vulnerability and strength to her role as rey and drivers portrayal of kylo ren is nuanced and complex hamills return as luke skywalker is a highlight of the film and he brings a gravitas to the role that is both moving and inspiring    the direction by rian johnson is also strong particularly in his handling of the films themes the last jedi explores ideas of legacy failure and the nature of heroism and johnson does an excellent job of weaving these themes into the story    however there are also some negatives to note one of the biggest criticisms of the last jedi has been its treatment of established characters from the star wars franchise some fans have taken issue with the way luke skywalker is portrayed in the film arguing that his characterization is inconsistent with his previous appearances in the series additionally the films humor can sometimes feel out of place and some of the subplots feel unnecessary or underdeveloped    overall star wars episode viii  the last jedi is a visually stunning and thematically rich addition to the star wars franchise while it may not satisfy every fan its strong performances and bold storytelling make it a mustsee for anyone invested in the ongoing saga of the galaxy far far away
Feb 27 2023,negative,putting aside the ewok spinoffs tlj is the worst of all which was due to the sudden narrative derailment of the trilogy caused by rian johnsons takeover as the writer and director tlj is the rotten apple in his otherwise pristine body of work jj abrams should have stayed on for the whole trilogy and ros was his attempt at coursecorrection but didnt save the trilogy ros is quite similar to my predictions i made after watching tfa but my version is still superior and dont get me started on my predictions for the 2nd one     in the end esb still reigns supreme as the best star wars film ultimately the best liveaction star wars content is the mandalorian followed closely by obiwan kenobi
Feb 26 2023,positive,if youre a casual viewer of the star wars saga this movie will surprised you in a good way but if youre a hardcore conservative star wars fan youd like to this movie to be move out of the cannon of the franchise
Feb 23 2023,negative,the female lead is strong from the beginning of the trilogy to the end which may be why abrams didnt feel the need to develop the characters the story is forgettable and the small drops of nostalgia dont make up for the overall bad product
Feb 18 2023,negative,isnt this the one where spaceships run out of fuel and people spent an hour saving spacehorses from spacevegas and some new girl let everyone die just so she could kiss the main character yeah no thanks
Feb 18 2023,positive,star wars the last jedi is a new take on star wars that many fans may not like but i do enjoy this film this film is probably the most visually stunning out of the franchise and the tension by the end of this film is incredible leaving you on the edge of your seat the character development of luke in this film is excellent with the whole story of him being isolated because he thinks he created kylo ren and the first order and it irritates me how a lot of star wars fans hate that he didnt just pick up a lightsaber a destroy the first order kylo ren stepping away from darth vaders footsteps by killing snoke left the door open for many possibilities but the rise of skywalker did ruin this there are some stuff i dont like about this film like the entire canto bight sequence of the film and the rose and finn dynamic but in the end this film is proof that most star wars fans wont accept anything else but classic old star wars
Feb 17 2023,negative,the force awakened gave me such hope for the sequels and think movie squashed those hopes a jumbled mess that figure out the direction it wanted to head rian is a fantastic director but this was not one of his finer works this movie has many flaws but i will say none of them were the fault of actor kelly marie tran she did the best she could with the tools she had this movie was a mess from start to finish
Feb 17 2023,positive,i like it better than episodes 7 and 9 i love the porgs by the way
Feb 17 2023,positive,luke and leia reuniting was so beautiful the film was overall so wonderful some cringey parts but if you are able to get past those it is an excellent film
Feb 16 2023,positive,a nice little movie that you should watch with 2 hours of spare time
Feb 15 2023,positive,a movie that was made with profound courage
Feb 14 2023,positive,i have really mixed opinions on this movie
Feb 14 2023,positive,i rank this movie third in my trilogies star wars list a new hope is tied for first with empire and this comes next   fyi 4 the force awakens  5 return of the jedi  6 revenge of the sith  7 rise of skywalker  8 phantom menace  9 attack of the clones  last jedi has a long clunky sequence involving huge racing cats but otherwise delights me it feels like real star wars with a fresh feel its the most rewatchable of the 9 skywalker films after the first two note if you can find the jarjarfree fan edit of the prequel trilogy youll get my real 3they turn the prequels into one baller film
Feb 12 2023,positive,not sure why people were so unhappy with this trilogy i absolutely loved them
Feb 9 2023,negative,as i stated in previous reviews at these movies are just over the top slammed together the star wars universe was a separate universe that was not controlled by the mouse but ever since disney has taken over they took this franchise and they rubbed it into the magical world of leave it alone this film is just a bland adaptation of the star wars franchise recreate it to make something wonderful for disney and it was just a colossal disaster
Feb 5 2023,negative,i thought i reviewed this back in 2017 but apparently it didnt go up  for some unknown reason it was controversial to criticise this movie  in almost every measure of a movie it was objectively poor  lacked any depth  cheap jokes and vacant of a story  every scene looked halfbaked  a randomly irrelevant plot leading nowhere and oddly out of place from everything that came before it
Feb 4 2023,neutral,the movie that was supposed to show how the greatest jedi in history became who he was turned out to be a full out assault on his character
Feb 4 2023,positive,probably my favourite star wars movie i just really like luke
Feb 3 2023,negative,i still want my money back this many years later misdirection bad plot bad acting just bad holdo was the worst character ever how about doing us a fan service 
Feb 2 2023,negative,i could write a five paragraph essay about how bad it was but instead ill just say this irredeemable in every sense of the word
Feb 2 2023,negative,bro they really put space vegas in here the casinos on that planet i cringed the whole time why not just bomb those new at at
Feb 2 2023,negative,poor pacing dull and sometimes annoying characters cheap humor at the expense of potentially really powerful moments laughable choreography and created several plot holes also the pink hair lady sucks i forgot her name already  and they killed akbar borderline offscreen just a bad movie
Feb 1 2023,negative,the worst star wars movie to date it made me quit the entire franchise felt like luke skywalker wasnt the same character we knew from the previous movies
Feb 1 2023,negative,great looking horrible story and plot derailed an entire trilogy forcing jj to delete so much from it in ep9 the start of the end of star wars
Jan 30 2023,positive,revisiting this movie on the big screen 5 years later it plays so well better than first blush this will be considered the second best sw eventually
Jan 29 2023,negative,what else can be said this was not a star wars movie for fans this was rian johnson serving his ego by trying to make something different and unique for himself there was nothing redeeming or memorable and if disney wants to make things right theyll have to redo this episode as well as ix ix sucked but i think abrams did the best he could with what he had viii made the franchise irreparable
Jan 29 2023,negative,very very very mediocre i dont hate the character rose but i can see why should be annoying this is probably one of the best cinematography because it looks beautiful but it just doesnt feel earned nothing feels earned snoke is a throwaway villain and a total waste of andy serkis at least hes in andor the throne room fight scene is pretty good though 410
Jan 28 2023,positive,loved loved loved this movie beautifully shot scenes and characters that we actually cared about oh and it had the fun and whimsy of the original trilogy best movie of the sequel trilogy hands down
Jan 22 2023,positive,this movie is so incredible and thoughtful and is really a work of art in the way it takes the star wars story forward best star wars since empire strikes back
Jan 21 2023,negative,crushing disappointment to have the original trilogies three heroes end up this way  its disgusting and sickening to know that this is how luke skywalker han solo and princess leia went out beyond shattered to know we will never have the chance to have this redone with the passing of fisher and the reluctance of ford to do anything else this trilogy not my star wars was doomed from the start and resembles dr frankensteins reanimated corpse in movie form if george lucas were my son id disown him for sellin to disney
Jan 21 2023,positive,the best of the sequel films one of my favourite star wars films
Jan 20 2023,neutral,a lot of bad stuff but there is some amazing stuff sprinkled in this movie its not the worst star wars movie but it is the most frustrating because you see how amazing it could have been especially since you see genuine talent there behind the scenes
Jan 19 2023,negative,director change new director tossed out the script like luke skywalker tossed out his lightsaber    the plot doesnt make sense and rian johnson said himself that he planned to make it with intent on it being rubbish as rubbish is talked more about than good films so congratulation rian you succeeded in making a rubbish film and it indeed did get talked about as you wanted
Jan 19 2023,negative,undermines episode 7 luke skywalker acted very outofcharacter in this movie snoke is killed and we dont find out who he was rose saving finn from the big cannon was cringeworthy the final action sequence was very underwhelming the way poe is treated by admiral holdo who takes leias place on the spaceship was bad the ending with that kid was weird because its as if they were setting up episode 9 but that kid wasnt in episode 9 furthermore the entire casino and codebreaker scene felt like it was just there as a filler there wasnt any part of this movie that i really liked
Jan 19 2023,negative,just awful  rian j should never make another movie ever
Jan 18 2023,negative,yes i know there is a certain style not too bad thing is rian johnson never got the essence of star wars that would not be too bad if this was not part of a trilogy but it is and he should have work in a team between two other films he did not he just wanted to do his thing and show how smart he is that did not work  all the characters who should induce fear and danger are mocked the tone is totally off you see main characters laughing when they should be desperate woo i like that you hear yo mama jokes while fellow soldiers die in space and so on  many of the characters do not seem to be humans but cynic tropes they are not believable it is hard to attach to them  the surprises often are not believable and feel like not set up or earned the characters bare simple logic they should have in their functions i can give a lot of for instances but i think i am not allowed to  and one of the main fight scene is so laughable bad choreographed   so all in all this one is bad and i blame the author director for his arrogance that star wars is able to do all this with decency one can see in andor something new without breaking the old love for every character style and tone in one flow
Jan 17 2023,negative,not only did the last jedi veer any hope of a faithful star wars followup off course it did it with insults along the way the pointless 45 minutes of time spent with characters whose entire development is thrown away and action scenes that look like they were choreographed by playground children are just the beginning it begs viewers to suspend not only their disbelief but their intelligence and join them on rain johnsons descent into brainless fan fiction
Jan 17 2023,positive,simply the best its loyal to the heroines and heros journey which is for rey and ben solo
Jan 17 2023,negative,rewrote lukes entire character to be everything he ever wasnt and then killed him off wtf they took the guy who refused to kill vader and chose to forgive him for everything he ever did and turned him into some pessimistic hobo who tried to murder a kid
Jan 16 2023,positive,best star wars movie since the original trilogy captures perfectly everything that i love about star wars and expend on it great twist that keep you on the edge of your seat it is by far my favorite star wars movie now let rian johnson make his trilogy 
Jan 16 2023,negative,by far the worst experience ive ever seen on the big screen ruin johnson should not be interview by anyone except a psychiatrist and kennedy should receive her pinkslip after this fiasco 
Jan 15 2023,negative,unplanned franchise destroying money grab i had high hopes but those were dispelled in the first 30 minutes
Jan 13 2023,negative,poor character development laughable military tactics assassination of the worlds most well loved character this is just bad
Jan 13 2023,negative,what is there to say that has not already been said  truly this is just another of so many rebootssequels of beloved franchises that openly mock and insult their fan base  claming to be made for modern audiences
Jan 12 2023,positive,really overhated its not that bad i do hate what they did with luke but its ignorable the story is ok and gets your through the movie with a nice ending and a ton of cool fights the special effects are fine and overall the whole thing is pretty dang solid
Jan 12 2023,negative,the most egregious tomato meter ive ever seen this movie is just a junker with no spine or plot its essentially just a really long chase scene with rose and finn going to kanto bite everything about this movie is lame from the fights between the red dudes and kylo  mary sue to the holdo maneuver is the worst plot hole ive ever seen
Jan 12 2023,negative,by far the worst of the late trilogy was a complete failure in story and also insulted and made a complete joke out of luke skywalkers character the first choice movie critics have no idea what they are talking about the film had plot holes in that didnt make any sense and i honestly almost fell asleep watching it i just stayed awake to see something that would spark my interest as an oldskool fan unfortunately nothing it deserved thw 1 star rating maybe even just half a star but i felt a little generous
Jan 11 2023,positive,perfect and original movie
Jan 11 2023,negative,when we thought a movie could not go any lower than the force awakens rian johnson has proven there is no limit to how bad a movie can be the characters we love from the past are destroyed in front of your eyes while it fails to build  create likable new characters supposed to transfer on the franchise fan equity plote holes absolute lack of coherence of the new ideas with the established universe characters pacing all is off this movie was better not made
Jan 11 2023,negative,takes one of the most iconic characters in movie history and makes him a joke
Jan 9 2023,positive,the most emotionally moving and visually stunning star wars movie and its not even close  sure the story doesnt go exactly where i would like it but its not exactly a fault on the films quality
Jan 6 2023,positive,clearly takes a different path to what the force awakens was setting up but still fits comfortably on the rails laid out for it incredibly powerful messages about failure growth legacy and lineage just enough humour to keep it from feeling too downbeat without becoming obnoxious looking at you marvel a couple of admittedly dumb moments and the following movie refusing to build on this one are the only things that really let it down in my opinion
Jan 6 2023,negative,bad writing bad movie easily the worst of the entire series
Jan 4 2023,negative,at first this movie was one of the my worst movie experiences because of how badly they treated the characters and defied the world of star wars and create problems like hyper space scene with this movie being one of the biggest pieces of trash in star wars i do have to give it credit for trying to be new people liked the force awakens cause it was just a reboot of a new hope and was easy but the thing is even though this star wars didnt feel like a star wars movie it still tried its best to do what the prequels did and that was to expand the universe i want to thank johnson for putting his best attempt at moving disneys unplanned and messy trilogy forward and trying to make something new for the next generation johnson and the actors are not to blame for this horrific movie and trilogy it was disney
Jan 3 2023,negative,no continuity with the rest of the trilogy horrible concepts wwii style gravity bombing in space the whole running out of gas thing if i could give it less than half a star i would
Jan 3 2023,neutral,the last jedi is ok it has its moments and beautiful visuals however the whole movie is brought down by the way luke skywalker was written and the pointless and unnecessary storylines like canto bight what wasted potential
Jan 3 2023,negative,every time i watch this movie out of obligation to the story line i notice more plot holes continuity issues basic space physics etc that are just flat out wrong i want to blame rian johnson but i dont know if thats totally fair the script and plot itself are just so dull this movie is a net detractor from the entire franchise and the world would be better off if it were never made
Jan 3 2023,positive,still not a patch on the original trilogy entertaining to watch but something just doesnt feel right
Jan 2 2023,negative,pretty much ruins the rest of what star wars has done completely changes established rules for not much terrible casino subplot with the new worst star wars character not recommended
Jan 2 2023,negative,horrible storyline pointless subplots and wasted character development opportunities starting with captain phasma are but a few of this movies many failings my least favorite in the star wars franchise even below episode i the phantom menace
Jan 1 2023,negative,im sick of writing the samesimilar review    disney has ruined the star wars movies the actors are terrible the plots boring and terrible they dont know how to use music to their advantage in scenes overall another film that i wish i hadnt of had to watch
Jan 1 2023,positive,having seen this opening night and several subsequent times i have consistently felt this was the most inventive of the star wars trilogy films more so than empire but similarly so the rap some die hard fans give this film seems misplaced i like ryan johnson as a filmmaker and i have enjoyed all of the films i have seen from him thus far
Dec 29 2022,negative,awful writing painful to watch from start to finish
Dec 28 2022,negative,this is by far the worst film ive ever seen this from a life long star wars fan we were sold down the river to tick boxes and make a modern day mess worst film ever made
Dec 27 2022,negative,a unique and daring approach to a 2nd film in the third trilogy of a beloved franchise  the sense of dread and embarrassment i had leaving the theatre was incredible  i was speechless as i tried to posthoc a rationale for the plot devices in this film  in the end this film eradicated the sequel trilogy as a whole from my headcannon and im a more whole person as a result  this film cost disney billions in merchandising  it was certainly a choice
Dec 26 2022,negative,the film that mortally injured the most popular franchise of all time so bad its likely damaged the entire series irreparably  prey they keep rian johnson away from the brand forever or its all over a crime against cinema
Dec 23 2022,negative,ok actors but terrible writing nothing actually happens to move the story on
Dec 23 2022,negative,dont kill off the biggest space hero of all time   kathleen kennedy you belong to the devil  hope you suffer as much in life as in death or something like that spit poi
Dec 22 2022,negative,still not sure why they decided hey we have a legacy here and 40 years of good will and a huge built in fan base lets just take a steaming dump on it all and blame fans when they do not like it
Dec 21 2022,positive,uneven mix of fresh and headscratching best of the new trilogy and improves with age
Dec 18 2022,negative,what you all did to the character of luke skywalker is unforgivable
Dec 18 2022,negative,terrible villains were not threatening because they were so stupid and the good guys were even dumber  a star wars movie made by someone who hates star wars
Dec 16 2022,positive,the best written and best directed star wars movie since 1980 while also visually stunning and endlessly fun
Dec 16 2022,positive,at the time 40 years have passed since this iconic franchise began with george lucas star wars changed the face of sciencefiction as well as technological advances in filmmaking then in 2015 new series of movies paved way for more potential stories featuring new players as well as appealing to new fans of the franchise the series has not only generated a new wave of enthusiasts but also merchandise now with lucasfilm ltd being owned by disney the story here now directed by rian johnson takes place after the events of force awakens after scavenger rey exstorm trooper finn resistance pilot poe and older characters joined forces and destroyed the starkiller base weapon run by the first order rey follows a map to luke skywalker once again played by mark hamill but hes much more chiseled and less hopeful this time around going into exile on achtoh after believing he failed as a jedi master training a new generation and having his apprentice turn on him so rey must convince him to help aid the fight against the first order while also unlocking the force within her kylo ren the leader continues to prove himself to supreme leader snoke voiced by andy serkis while also baiting rey to join him meanwhile the resistance has new players like paige tico who has a sister rose played by kelly marie tran admiral holdo standing in for leia played by laura dern benecio del toro as a code breaker named dj who has a nervous tick and plays both sides on a system named canto bite love the new characters the various worlds the creatures and even how the filmmakers continue to build the storytelling as well as adding to the mythos even the force has new elements added to it which is refreshing the color scheme in here is really nice mixing red and white of course we cant forget the many inside references and callbacks to the older films as is tradition i really like the moral psychology behind this with many of its themes like mentorship being invigorating and not always having to fight but run instead warriors can be deified and romanticized hypocrisy can be hubris maybe there is no good or evil just morally grey areas maybe we should let the past die the true burden of masters is what students grow beyond theres always a need to accept imperfection the only way to get rich is to profit off of war the worst part of the movie is definitely the pacing yet it does try to break away from traditional star wars formula after every other plot thread has been explored snoke is also very underutilized in this which is a shame but this is truly the best acting from both the late carrie fisher and mark hamill theyve solidified themselves as leia and luke for over four decades luke shows his level of frustration with rey being empathetic on how to approach the jedi way of training this movie is definitely polarizing since many will feel it betrays the original canon but also adds new elements although it doesnt answer all the questions i really appreciate the film for taking risks despite pacing issues and some things not making any sense 
Dec 15 2022,negative,was never a star wars fanatic but heard a lot of people were not happy with this movie and after going back to watch all the movies i have a much bigger appreciation for the original trilogy specifically this movie just hurt to watch and i cant imagine what it was like for huge star wars fans
Dec 15 2022,positive,i actually liked this movie a lot it deserves way more credit
Dec 15 2022,positive,on its own i enjoy this movie its not the best star wars movie and definitely makes the rest of the trilogy disjointed but thats at the fault of disney and lucasfilm as a whole further i truly feel that this movie tried to set up a final film that was way more interesting than rise of skywalker which ended up failing to deliver entirely
Dec 14 2022,positive,i like this film i dont think its perfect but it is an objectively good film ive never been the biggest star wars fan but i can see why avid fans may not like the direction johnson took the story i do think snoke was wasted     but as a standalone film its good its better than the rise or skywalker and force awakens but avid fans wont have that discussion as theyre crazy
Dec 12 2022,neutral,yikes the story was rough and theres an entire story line that goes no where interesting casting choices with some poor decisions but there are also some awesome parts of the movie and some killer scenes with rey and kylo must watch for star wars fans even with the flaws
Dec 11 2022,negative,very boring with no logic or plot and very bad characters would give it 0 if i could
Dec 9 2022,negative,episode 7 was a wonky flawed attempt to make a star wars film but you could tell that they were trying there best to live up to the originals  this film seemed to go out of its way to disrespect the legacies of the original characters and to intentionally make the wrong decision at every turn  it was a beautiful looking film but the story and dialogue was just abysmal  bland unlikable new characters  pointless side plots  good characters turned into comedy relief  just awful
Dec 7 2022,negative,it is really simple  rian johnson and kathleen kennedy believed it was their mission to bring down the patriarchy of star wars  their solution was to utterly emasculate luke skywalker and create a mary sue character rey that nobody cares about  disney is still trying to clean up the mess these two made
Dec 4 2022,negative,destroyed all the setup from the force awakens turns fin into a comic relief character completes the mary sue transformation of rey broke existing canon and the physical laws of the star wars universe to the point that nothing makes sense going forward killed off the big bad requiring jj abrams to resurrect palpatine in tros worst of all it completely obliterates luke skywalker one of the most iconic and beloved characters in all of cinema history
Dec 4 2022,positive,rian johnson has made a great star wars film that builds on the lore  most criticism is from people who are not star wars fans many who dont understand luke or the jedi thankfully rian johnson did  many cite luke wouldnt try to murder his nephew well luke didnt try to murder his nephew luke reacted to the vision he had of all he loved being destroyed luke can never not an emotional reaction  just like his father anakin he grew up with loving parents and formed attachments trained as jedi from an older age unable to suppress feelings for people  luke out of instinct ignited his lightsabre and when he came to all he saw was a frightened young boy and he was left with shame  luke feels about himself the same way the people who call him jake skywalker felt this is why he fled    if you dont like the last jedi are you really a star wars fan
Dec 3 2022,negative,star wars fans beware this movie is more like bad fan fiction than a star wars film
Dec 3 2022,negative,not remotely any thing like star wars they butchered this beloved story
Dec 2 2022,negative,this is not a good star wars movie the setups are wasted and there are just a lot of dumb ideas in this film
Dec 2 2022,negative,i have never regretted paying and watching a movie in theaters till i watched this movie
Dec 1 2022,negative,i was absolutely blown away by how bad this film is hard to find something good about it
Nov 30 2022,negative,this movie ruined the sequel trilogy of starwars everything you love about the series is devored and then shitted out they ruined luke skywalkers character so horribly to the point that mark hamil himself advised against their decision i dont understand how someone could ruin a beloved and iconic character such as luke skywalker a character that supposed to represent hope and redemption for others down the toilet
Nov 28 2022,positive,pacing and execution couldve been better but ideas are fresh and original and the ending is terrific one of the more cerebral star war movies which i like
Nov 27 2022,positive,the best sound editing ever done in a movie
Nov 25 2022,negative,i only give a half star because i cant give a 0 star rating that and the visuals were nice this movie meanders aimlessly diverting story plots that have no satisfying payoffs and subverts expectations just to be edgy basically every male character portrayed in the movie is either a jerk a screwup a bad guy or a combination of all three i mean finn cant even kill himself properly without being saved by his lady friend lol there is no fear of losing either when you watched empire you felt like the good guys just got knocked down and were getting the standing 8 count in this movie the villains seem like theyre either inept or prone to throwing tantrums oh and the choreography of the fight scenes was by far some of the worst drivel ive ever seen after having some interesting leads setup in force awakens this movie discards pretty much everything that came before even the rules of how this universe functions oh no were gonna run out of gasand lets just now 50 years into the franchise decide we can make light jumps through other ships could have destroyed both death stars a lot easier and prevented this movie from ever being made if they knew that before
Nov 24 2022,positive,this movie isnt bad the only thing people didnt like was what they did to luke how they made him a puy i give this movie 8520
Nov 24 2022,negative,i remember being filled with excitement at the idea of a new star wars trilogy in my adult life time i remembered with fondness the ot being introduced to me by my father and him reliving the moments of his first experience with star wars as he introduced it to my sister and i i was young when the prequels came out but the thrill and exhilaration for each new chapter was a cultural sensation regardless of the shallow poof instead of a boom they were i had books comics shirts toys heck even a tray that made tiny solo in carbonite ice cubes and while the force awakens awoke deep emotion in me it was a movie full of potential and nostalgia that provided little more than member berries so with bated breath i went with some friends to see the next chapter in the star wars legacy expecting some answers plus this rain johnson guy had a few fun movies under his belt and i was excited to see what he would do with one of my favorite things to say this movie broke me would be an understatement i remember actually laughing out loud when leia flew through space and during canto bight leaning across to my friend and saying this movie isnt very good i remember saying what out loud in the theater as rose delivered some bs line about saving what we love or something like that and the disappointment of never seeing the original cast in the same place at the same time i remember leaving the theater in silence and my friend driving me home in silence i remember sitting in front of my computer and wondering if maybe there was something wrong with me maybe i was too old maybe i just didnt get it and maybe i was out of touch then i remember seeing the internet explode and knowing in that moment i was justified i didnt even bother going to see the rise of skywalker and i could care less about any of the star wars shows disney has put out this movie was so bad i didnt go back to the theater for over year because i didnt see the point this movie spit in the face of not only the legacy actors but the fans that have kept this franchise going since the 70s something beautiful was handed carelessly and without any understanding of what made it special and why people loved it it is an embarrassment and a mistake and something i refuse to acknowledge as anything more than fan fiction star wars will always be 3 great movies 3 meh movies and a bunch of wonderful books whatever this abomination is it is not star wars
Nov 23 2022,negative,where do i begin from jake skywalker to carrie poppins to the holdo maneuver to the entire canto bight subplot space horses rey being overpowered with no real training the godawful throne room scene    the last jedi copied empire strikes back while simultaneously tearing down everything that made star wars well star wars lukes character development as the compassionate and hopeful hero was slaughtered mercilessly the first order and resistance are just rebels vs empire 20 because kennedy and jonson couldnt come up with a single creative difference besides massacring everything fans loved about star wars and there was senseless comic relief everywhere poe prankcalling the first order and trying to order a boneless pizza then we have new characters who are absolutely atrocious to watch holdo the hackerman rose these actors deserved better than what jonson did to them and did not deserve the backlash they got that fault belongs to the horrible writers who have never heard of character development    to top it all off the choreography for fights in this film was abysmal not to mention they never once allow dismemberment in this movie or the entire trilogy as far as i can remember
Nov 23 2022,neutral,the writer and director rian johnson had ambitions plans but was unable to execute them the plot felt disjointed where multiple intriguing themes never become momentous or emotionally eliciting the lack of  wittiness and humor is particularly noticeable whats up with super depressing score just kill off every already
Nov 22 2022,positive,as many star wars fans complain how this film was the worst of the sequels i have to immediately disagree its an amazing film with an amazing cast what more can i say  rated 355
Nov 21 2022,negative,rian johnson takes the opportunity to write his own fan fiction as once beloved characters become a shell of their former selves knowing disney the critic reviews are likely paid for    were it a stand alone film i wouldnt view the film as badly but as part of a well established three trilogies where certain rules cannot be broken it fails on many fronts rian johnson did the equivalent of making tom eat jerry or wile e coyote finish off the road runner he doesnt understand the purpose of the franchise
Nov 18 2022,negative,very bad  haven only watched it once
Nov 17 2022,negative,took the magic out of star wars this was the last star wars movie i saw
Nov 16 2022,negative,this film is not just as terrible sequel its a terrible film     lets start with the positives its visually appealing and the music is fantastic some of the locations are just gorgeous    ill just summarize the negatives the characters and plotting make no sense it wastes not only the classic star wars films but also the few promising elements introduced in the force awakens finn is suddenly just a bland random guy and somehow tagged as comic support his interesting background as a defector is forgotten except for when the plot needs it rey loses her mysterious background and her surprisingly strong force skills go unexplained rendering her just a mary sue when her power was hinted as being due to something far more interesting in the force awakens the hostility to everything thats come before  including the classic star wars films and the force awakens  is just tragic the waste of mark hamill and luke skywalker is just terrible sequel it doesnt do better as a standalone movie its tonally inconsistent starting with a your mommy joke and making heavy misuse of comic relief    the director and writers clearly wanted to subvert star wars  trying to copy what empire strikes back accomplished  but failed utterly because they completely misunderstood what empire strikes back actually did with a new hope inverted rather than subverted built rather than destroyed     sigh it does open up a copy of interesting plot points but then immediately closes them if the film had ended with rey and kylo ren taking control of the first order it would have set the ground for a fantastic sequel instead it shut that down without doing anything interesting with it    its just a trash sequel and trash film ruined by corporate mismanagement
Nov 16 2022,positive,movie looks amazing and there is a really good scene but just not a good followup
Nov 15 2022,negative,for me this film ended a lifetime of being a star wars fan  coming out of the cinema everyone around me was discussing how bad the film was  clearly the critics were all either paid off to give good reviews or are in the wrong job  this film is terrible with no redeeming features it lacks any skill at story telling or understanding of the lore of the previous material
Nov 11 2022,positive,initially despised i think much like the empire strikes back the last jedi has grown on me and will continue to grow on fans as perhaps the best film in the sequel trilogy for its willingness to take risks and explore darker less fanserving themes
Nov 11 2022,negative,the most expensive fanmade feature ever you almost have to love how awful nongenre johnsonkennedys episode 8 truly is
Nov 11 2022,negative,worst star wars movie i have ever seen wow destroyed luke skywalkers character
Nov 11 2022,negative,this movie lacks in any significant or meaningful plot the writing is absolutely atrocious with the plot effectively being the rebel ship running away from the first order in order to escape they need to find a mcguffin that betrays the good guys this was very obvious effectively making half the movie irrelevant the side plot with rey and kylo that was painful to watch i believe adam driver was a miscast for this character honestly this movie shows how disney has milked that franchise coxing people in with flashy effects and trailerable character moments leia using the force but no actual substance they are making these films for a cash grab and not for the sake of good cinema only the hardest of star wars fans should watch this film otherwise stay clear 
Nov 10 2022,negative,star wars isnt breaking bad   there was no veggie bacon   there was no methamphetamine   there was no 3d saul goodman  also this movie disrespects the star wars legacy
Nov 10 2022,positive,never listen to the audience scores especially when the audience is star wars nerds they wouldnt know a good film if it bit them
Nov 9 2022,negative,no longer star wars fan bc of this movie destroying luke skywalker
Nov 9 2022,positive,i dont care what anyone says the cinematography and soundtrack carry this movie lukes arc is one of the best arcs ever written in all of cinema history ever period sure the canto bight sequence was weird and finn rose and poe didnt get used as much as they should have but the juxtaposition of rey and kylo lukes arc kylos emotions and the dyad is truly impeccable rian johnson deserves all the praise and non of the hate star wars has been repetitive and this brought beauty complexity and true art to star wars that we havent seen in a long time truly amazing
Nov 8 2022,negative,new characters in this movie wont work
Nov 8 2022,negative,this single handedly destroyed star wars for me personally    luke skywalker kept believing in his father till the very end even gave himself up in handcuffs to vader and the emperor believing his father would come backthen this version turns him into the polar opposite of that what because the first order rearose when he is more powerful than he was in rotj    the man who believed darth vader can be turned back to the light after decades of mass homicide and tyranny couldnt accept ben solo went through a rebellious adolescent phase  heretical    you also fail to mention how the last jedi breaks the whole way star wars works a huge death star just get some droid controlled huge space ships and jump to light speed straight through it once the sheilds are down    what about the absolutely pointless ark given to finn and having his girlfriendnot girlfriend save him from killing himself fornothing    what about the stupidest decision general leia ever did by not telling poe what she was planning why whats the point oh yes short term curiosity and awe not to mention wasted time    what about the fact you had 3 opportunities to get the original cast all together and not take it instead killing them off one by one just to replace them with new not loved characters that were not built properly at no fault of the actual actors quality    snoke being absolutely the most pointless big bad guy that dies in the 2nd movie of a trilogy what genius    strange directing decisions nonsensical story decisions for a shortterm aweeffect that completely destroyed star wars till this day
Nov 7 2022,positive,it is a must see it trying going a new way in star wars   it was good
Nov 6 2022,positive,not deserving of a 43 at all decent movie not the best star wars movie ever but pretty great trying to do its own thing instead of blatantly ripping off a new hope like another sequel movie trying to make rey her own person and moving the storytelling forward i must admit i wish that snoke hadnt been killed off so quickly
Nov 4 2022,negative,thanks for destroying the guy youre calling luke because whoever that was he wasnt a skywalker you guys suck for this one
Nov 2 2022,negative,childish humour irrelevant side plots plot holes and yeah just not really star wars and more like all this avengers and dcmarvelmovies
Oct 26 2022,negative,this is a movie so bad it ruined star wars which is really saying something the plot is awful the characters have terrible arcs and some of the scenes in this film are so ridiculous this movie does not fit well in the star wars universe at all and for that this movie is a failure
Oct 26 2022,negative,would not watch this film or sequel trilogy again
Oct 26 2022,negative,absolute nonsense a girl comes out of nowhere and becomes the hero or i should say better than a hero the powers and skills which took forever for other characters to hone she was able to do everything at once waste of time
Oct 25 2022,negative,oh thats real nice of that rian
Oct 25 2022,negative,one of the worst movies i have ever seen having seen all star wars movies in the cinema i was introduced to something that i never thought possible star wars can be boring dull stupid and forgettable
Oct 24 2022,positive,amazing i dont care what anyone says still has some valid flaws tho
Oct 23 2022,positive,the last jedi exactly what star wars need its bold  beautiful amazing work by rian his writing and direction was superb daisy ridley  adam driver just nailed it in this movie one of the best acting performances u will ever see in star wars its a true masterpiece
Oct 23 2022,negative,a lot of action beautiful imagery and lots of things getting blown up the story on the other hand was similar to taking a mud bath in a sewer nothing was answered the space battle was a joke and that was not our luke skywalker what a disrespectful way to treat the flagship character of star wars if rian johnson what an appropriate sir name writes episode nine i will not see it
Oct 22 2022,negative,another laughable and easily forgettable disaster piece watching this was a slog there were several movie inconsistencies poor acting and adding salt to the wound  some of the worst military tactics seen on screen are you telling me that there is no remote control or autopilot in the far flung future unnecessary sequences to kill off characters but i guess the plot has to work so who cares about these nuances this movie was confusing and hap hazard
Oct 22 2022,negative,not a good movie i will continue to go see star wars movies in the cinemas but i have such low hopes for anything star wars these days
Oct 22 2022,positive,the best star wars film since the original trilogy 
Oct 21 2022,negative,disney continues to ruin everything it touches and this is another prime example
Oct 21 2022,negative,rushed bad acting lazy writing useless plot plotholes forgettable characters overall bad
Oct 21 2022,negative,sooooo boring  no decent fight scene
Oct 21 2022,negative,what was disney thinking here
Oct 19 2022,negative,brilliant visuals but the stupidest writing and story ever
Oct 19 2022,negative,the force awakens opened the door to a new part of the star wars mythos  rian johnson went ahead and closed that door and all its potential with this movie it was a slap in the face to the original trilogy and its beloved characters there were so many things wrong about this movie i knew we were in trouble when luke unceremoniously threw away the light sabre just handed to him by rey  symbolic of rian johnson also throwing away throwing away all the star wars mythos that had become so iconic and then there was what was done with snoke  he was supposed to play some mysterious part of what was to come in the next sequel and instead rian johnson killed him for no good reason destroying the setup by episode 7   there will be people who like this film because it is different but i am sorry this is not star wars  let rian johnson play in some other corner of the star wars galaxy far far away from our beloved iconic characters
Oct 16 2022,negative,i was a star wars fan then this came out  when this came out i prebought tickets for the earliest available 3 days after release but i wanted to watch it sooner so found a ticket for the second day of release  i wanted to like this movie at the very least  it is a telling sign when everyone from a packed theater leaves in awkward silence  i was in shock and could not understand how this could be released as a star wars film let alone a film from disney  i was beginning to question my sanity    the second viewing i paid extra attention to as many details as i could just to be sure there wasnt something i was missing  it only solidified what i feared this film was beyond abysmal  i am just a fan of star wars i feel so bad for those who are closer to this than just a fan  people like mark hamill and all of the original cast  mark tried to say something  to fans it is an insult but it is shameful what they put mark hamill through    i do not expect another lengthy review listing how appalling this film is will impact anyone at all  but if it prevents just one fan who has not yet seen this travesty to consider not to then the time spent writing this would be worth it for me  if i could go back in time to prevent myself from watching it i would in a heartbeat    any expectation of the continuation of character arcs subplots even explaining much from the previous film is laughable  almost to question if writer was given notes or even watched what happened in the previous film  i submit that there is not 2 consecutive minutes in this movie which are redeemable  any character development from the previous film is quickly written off by some quick explanation or just completely ignores the first film and is a change in character  new characters carry cliché arcs with no character development written with a heavy hand for the convenience of some sequence of events which the writers think makes a coherent story  due to this their impact or audience reason to care is nonexistent      the opening sequence of events is a disaster and insult to the viewers intelligence which should provide a glimpse of what is to come for the rest of the film  the dialogue and basic respect to many of the characters decision making ability and rationale is enough to question if it was done intentionally by the writers like they were taking on a dare to be more insulting to the viewing audience  there is better dialogue and character development in childrens saturday morning cartoons than represented in this movie    this review could go on as long as the movie  but to cut it a little shorter  yes this movie is an insult to star wars fans but it is more than an insult to people like mark hamill and carrie fisher rip    after seeing this i had to invent a story in my mind to reconcile the absolute garbage this movie was  something that goes along the lines that this was either a vision into a a bizzaroworld multiverse universe branch of what could happen if a thanos creature strung out on shrooms snapped their fingers and distorted things enough could end up being or the ramblings of an escaped mental asylum patient written in script form and made into a film maybe both    maybe sometime down the road the mandalorian will be recognized as the new the new hope  for its role in restoring some of the damage done by this mess and giving star wars fans a reason to be one again
Oct 15 2022,positive,this is another visual feast with top quality cgi and some pretty impressive battleaction scenes its quite an engrossing watch even though i cant claim i followed all the plot intricacies ill leave that to others it did feel like it covers quite a bit of ground as it were there are some thought provoking pieces of dialogue present and even some amusing comedic moments as well as of course the numerous fast paced battle scenes i thought the different landscapes were intriguing nearly everywhere seems to have big sweeping vistas theres one scene in particular towards the end which was quite a gripping watch  two big characters facing off against one another but ill say no more so as not to provide full blown spoilers    yes id recommend this to fans of action scifi films and anyone looking for a cgi filled bit of entertainment for the 2 hour and 25 minute run time it lasts if you stop just as the credits start
Oct 15 2022,negative,rian johnson and kathleen kennedy should be allowed within 100 yards of a star wars anything somehow they took the hero of the original trilogy and turned him into a spineless coward  they turned princess leia into a space mary poppins when they probably should have killed off her character at the time snoke was supposed to be a huge character with a secret identity and they outright kill him with no explanation totally ruining anything setup by episode 7 the only good thing that came out of this movie was porgs it is because of this movie that the new trilogy has failed imho this movie should not be canon and disney should renounce the new trilogy
Oct 15 2022,negative,hands down the worst star wars movie painful to watch and painful to think about the repercussions of this movie on what came before it truly a disappointment unlike any other
Oct 15 2022,positive,well the story has a slight improvement from the force awakens especially when it comes to the main characters this movie actually gives some chills within the war and the ending that left us curious to what might happen to the rebels
Oct 14 2022,negative,it is as if rian johnson watched the star wars movies on mute before writingdirecting this film visually the movie is stunning from the set pieces to the action sequences the last jedi has some of the best visual moments in the franchise unfortunately the story and a true understanding of the star wars universe is lacking     the actions of some of the characters are completely against what we have seen in other films the treatment of luke skywalker is absurd   the new characters introduced are irritating and shallow laura derns viceadmiral holdo might be my least favorite character in star wars history   force sensitivity is a joke leia luke kylo and rey   the entire master code breaker plotline is frustratingly pointless    when i look at the poster for this movie i think about the epic fight sequences and the daring visuals this is fortunate because the rest of the film is frustratingly disjointed from the rest of the franchise    best character kylo ren  best quote pass on what you have learned strength mastery but weakness folly failure also yes failure most of all the greatest teacher failure is  yoda  best moment the battle against snokes guards
Oct 12 2022,negative,what can be said that hasnt been said already while rian johnson isnt a bad director his awful pride tendency to subvert expectations and the bad material he was left to work with by jj abrams didnt work well and made this one of the most hated star wars movies of all time for good reason
Oct 12 2022,negative,people who say this movie is good okay or a masterpiece need to watch a classic movie for comparison any movie people consider a classic the actors are acting well but besides that the pacing is horrendous like literally as disastrous as transformers 4 almost nothing in the movie makes and sense i think rian johnson needs some anti depressants ive never seen a movie so depressing and painful to watch this makes schindlers list feel not bleak in comparison and makes pans labyrinth a fun watch in comparison this movie is so utterly miserable and drab and a downer how on earth was this released by disney into theatres if youve seen the first two trilogies youd know that rian johnson has no clue how to force works this is probably the worst movie ive ever seen
Oct 11 2022,positive,it is one of the greatest movies ever created
Oct 10 2022,positive,hands the best of the new trilogy take away the casino scene and this is up there with empire
Oct 9 2022,neutral,the first half of this disneyfied installment to the star wars series is quite disappointing it is deeply politicized with its save the ponies and capitalists are bad agendas the girlyoushowthatboyhisplace female protagonists humiliating male protagonists are cringeworthily painful to watch particularly difficult to watch is lukes character admittedly played masterfully by mark hamill in the first half of the film i would grant that hes disillusioned with the jedi order but it does not seem to be in keeping with his character to have him attempt to kill his nephew in a flashback daisy ridley a good actress was dished out some crummy material for her character as a mary sue jedi who never seems to struggle with success      the latter half of the film felt like an apology for the first half lukes ending was decent but not the what fans have come to expect from the heroic jedi it would have been better for him to have shown up to the resistance battle in person one could argue that lukes character undergoes an interesting arc but almost every other character remains undeveloped and seems to have been placed there as a prop for advancing the next action sequence     a comment on the villains these imperial guard knockoffs were sissified and the female shinyarmored storm trooper makes me grateful for jar jar as for snoke why should we care about this character he is randomly mean was given no character development and looks out of place from what i can see darth maul could have appeared out of nowhere and killed snoke instead and the movie would have improved at least there would have been a compelling villain to fight and not this adolescent ben solo character which to his credit adam driver performs well when he was given only so much leeway with this poorly written script
Oct 9 2022,negative,such a terrible and cringe writing gave it one star only because mark hamill  was present in this total mess the good thing about this movie is that it helped me to decide not to watch the followup movie
Oct 9 2022,negative,the last jedi is by far the worst star wars film  luke is completely different than the luke everybody knows  this movie could and shouldve been way better  most of the movie follows a very slow chase in space  the movie feels very rushed and poorly written  if only they wouldve planned out the whole trilogy from the start
Oct 8 2022,negative,visually this was probably the best movie in the franchise but all apart from that this movie isnt great all the new characters are all so annoying the fact that they killed of han luke and leia in the sequels is awful this movie has more bad than good
Oct 7 2022,negative,if you take away all memory of previous films maybe excluding force awakens this is an objectively cool movie that being said an entire universe with rules has been established and this film completely ignores them and wings it you can definitely blame the changing of directors and scripts in the middle of these two films but i blame disney most of all for taking hold of this franchise and making it entirely a marketing scheme with no actual desire to make a good story just make groups look empowered and we did our job go corporate baby it is truly upsetting to see how entertainment has taken such a turn away from pushing the boundaries of story telling and creativity and instead making sure the viewers are aware of companies stances on issues and politics i dont mind deep rooted real world problems being introduced like done marvelously in the batman but ignoring plot to push only a message is not entertainment i dont feel like anyone goes to a movie wanting to be informed pretty sure that would be a documentary or biography and if you think im not in favor of randomly strong female characters with little explanation and backstory shoutout kill bill for making probably the coolest protagonistantihero i think ive ever seen with many societal messages that dont scream it at you and let the plot take it along please corporations let us just be entertained in peace i want to be invested in the world of creativity so many writers wish to produce but are getting denied because of writers whose messages align more with the brand maybe ill just have to learn how to write myself 
Oct 5 2022,positive,although not quite as fresh as its predecessor the last jedi is still filled with great humor and intense memorable action and heartfelt moments that hardcore star wars fans will dig
Oct 4 2022,positive,the screenplay was the films demise major storyline holes and confusing sequences plagued the writing which was all over the place even the jokes that were made were tired this didnt really feel like a star wars movie it was more like a disney movie the screenplay for this movie should have been tighter considering how long it is although the narrative was a shambles the cinematography and visual effects were still fantastic and the directing was passable im not sure how somebody could give this a 1 after seeing so many of those without giving the visuals any credit i give it a fair and honest 6 out of 10
Oct 4 2022,positive,a controversial opinion here but the last jedi is no bad it certainly is different dont get me wrong but it does not deserve the hate rian johnson took a risk and it wasnt what we expected at the end of the day its still star wars and i believe theyve never truly made bad star wars content tlj while far from the best is a good movie
Oct 2 2022,negative,one of the dumbest setups for a plot ever a pointless trip to a pointless planet to have a man who escaped slavery and the horrors of war have slavery and the horrors of war explained to him a terrible leader assassination of the previous characters looking at luke and utter mauling of the star wars cannon how did this movie even get made how did no one look at this script and burn it instantly
Oct 1 2022,positive,amazing movie ryan johnson outdid himself the action plot and cinematography is great
Sep 30 2022,neutral,so the first and second time watching this i thought this movie was okay or at least believed this one is not good rey is horrible they completely went on a different track with finn and was about to have a good moment but rose ruined it luke is actually not the worst but still really bad i really like the scene with yoda and when luke reunites with leia the score is still pretty good but not the best sfx is unlike any other star wars movie though it is incredible
Sep 28 2022,neutral,okay movie kinda disappointing and probably wont watch again
Sep 27 2022,positive,this movie worked for me though i get why it doesnt for a lot sw fans  if you can get past some of the more controversial choices flying space leia the cartoonish canto bight section a disillusioned luke skywalker theres a movie here that crackles with energy and tense wellbuilt scenes  the reykylo faceoff and corresponding space battle are among the most memorable sw scenes of all time little moments shine too such as a nervous leia watching a coffee cup rattle as her flagship drops out of lightspeed following a battle with heavy losses  flawed to be sure but one of the better sw movies
Sep 26 2022,negative,has a very long review that was deleted at some point in time so ill stick with the lowlights  this movie makes subverts expectations into an insult  the bombing run is a awful shoehorn of ww2 era combat that ignores everything in star wars imaginary combat until now rose is annoying and although its not this movies fault her entire character arc is wrecked in the next movie  carrie fisher is terrible as leia and it is apparent why her career never went anywhere the midmovie romp in the casino is pointless and terrible in that its about characters that dont matter based on incredibly bad reasoning that isnt made better by the fact that it fails so we can subvert expectations with the stupid holdo maneuver which again breaks the star wars universe  the longest slowest chase scene as a whole sucked incredibly like a battlestar galactica with none of the charm lukes death was almost as stupid as obiwans  snoke dies pointlessly simply because the guy in charge didnt like him     suffice to say that this was the last star wars movie i watched in the theater  not even jarjar and the mediocrity that was the prequels managed that  this movie is not only awful in its own it ruins the narrative arc of the movies before and after it and the character arcs of everybody in the movie even the ones from the original trilogy  its a black hole of suck a festering pustule on the franchise that can only continue to harm everything in the franchise just by virtue of being core canon and yet even taken on its own merits it is a terrible movie  but it cant really ever be meaningfully taken as such because its core theme is again subverting expectations at all costs
Sep 24 2022,negative,this is a disgrace to star wars and overall bad movie  the first time i really had tears from anger while watching this abomination and up to this date each time i see parts of this work  i simply loose mood and have anger boiling in me i wish disney canceled this thing
Sep 24 2022,negative,well i wasnt expacting to see episode 5 again but i did and it was not good
Sep 22 2022,negative,better than rise of skywalker but just barely this movie sucked it needs to be removed from canon asap
Sep 20 2022,negative,i posted a review of this movie on rt previously but it seems to have been removed in brief below is my opinion of tlj    i really did not enjoy this movie at all it is described as dividing the fans but i actually think that the majority of movie goers did not like this film either the main issues were    1 the main plot was boring the slow chase in space as well as not making sense was really dull increadibly dum and incomprensible descisions made on both the first order and rebel side but mainly the first order    2 as has been said many times the canto bight side quest was pointless and not entertaining    3 i really hate what they did with hux character he went full clown in this movie    4 did not seem to fit well with the previous movie i was expecting a trilogy but really these are three stand alone mediocre movies    5 the main characters are really unlikable and some of the dialogue was just cringeworthy i like adam driver and kylo was the best of a bad bunch but there was not much the cast could do with an awful script such as this    6 terrible glaring distracting plot holes holdo etc there are plot holes in all the star wars movies but this was another teeth grttingly bad level    i am sure there are people who genuinely enjoyed this and thats great for me though i found this so boring annoying and such a wasted opportununity that i was close to walking out of the cinema several times     as others have said visually it is a great movie and the sound was good but every other aspect was appalling     rian johnson is a talented director i really enjoyed knives out but this was the wrong movie for him and the fact that they clearly had little to no plan about how the overarching story of the new trilogy would work is just unbelievable given how much money went into this sadly i think tlj was so bad that star wars will never again be what it once was    definitely a 1 star cinema experience for me unfortunately i cant remember the last time i disliked a movie as much as this
Sep 19 2022,negative,rian johnson hate star wars he planned to destroy this story for his entire life and he managed to do it its dead now he killed my childhood hero in a way that i cant explain i hope that hes proud now
Sep 19 2022,positive,best of moviestv series collection
Sep 16 2022,negative,a slap in the face of all star wars fans
Sep 16 2022,negative,if you want to ruin the hope and awesomeness you have experienced from star wars up to this point go ahead and watch this movie i cant express how awful and pure ridiculous this movie was they destroyed every character in this film i left the theater feeling sick i almost abandoned all the lucas era content avoid at all costs
Sep 15 2022,negative,one of the most depressing releases in the series ever
Sep 15 2022,negative,sad just sad the writer was given a free layup instead of making the layup he air balled it you had one chance to use luke and it was totally blown how did the others in leadership let the writer get away with this an epic artistic mistake from all in charge
Sep 15 2022,negative,what a mess of plot holes cringy dialogue inexplicable writing and wasted opportunity this was truly a low point for star wars
Sep 14 2022,negative,lets take years of a consolidated story a huge fan basis and the rules of this cinematic universe to blow that in million of pieces and do whatever the directors tried to do in this film the villain for this saga is the horrible overpowered hero with no respect for the original material
Sep 14 2022,negative,the script unashamedly destroys one of cinemas greatest heroes as well as wasting the viewers time with pointless sidequests new characters introduced are annoying and not at all likeable at their expense are characters from the previous film who are reduced to side shows and comic relief might as well wipe this from your databanks because this film has no place in the star wars franchise
Sep 13 2022,negative,it was absolutely horrible the way they treated the character of luke skywalker was crap they bring him from return of the jedi where is a jedi knight fighting the empire never running from a fight never abandoning anyone even darth vader who he still saw the good in despite all the awful things he had done all the crimes he committed all the people he killed he still saw good in him but now in this movie he is hiding from the fight his friends who are dying and his sister who has asked him to help in the fight who has not seen him in years but he still hides when he is givin his fathers lightsaber a thing to remember his father by and his first lightsaber the first thing he ever used in jedi training he throws away when his nephew is feeling tempted to the dark side instead of talking to him about it teaching him how to control it or still seeing that even if he turns evil theres still good in him like he did with darth vader he decides to try and kill him in his sleep which obviously turned him to the dark side i could keep on going but i dont want to spend anymore time on this film
Sep 13 2022,negative,star wars is dead for me disney killed it not looking forward any star wars stuff now not even mandalorian can get my intrest back
Sep 12 2022,positive,my favorite movie of all times its refreshing to watch a movie with a soul nowadays it was so beautiful thrilling and emotional what a shame that what followed was a total opposite i absolutely cannot wait for rian johnson new star wars trilogy i love his style and i know it will be amazing
Sep 12 2022,negative,the movie was so bad i had to force myself through it in order not to leave the cinema the plot was random it felt like disconnected from the first movie and had nothing to do with star wars clearly the director never watched any sw movie so many parts made no to little sense this movie was so unwatchable that i decided not to watch anything else from the sw cinematic universe
Sep 10 2022,negative,taking into account budget and name recognition this is one the worse films ever made
Sep 9 2022,negative,this movie ruined finn and luke as well some scenes were incredible but the way this movie set up the future of star wars is an absolute disappointment i give 2 stars only for mark hamil carrie fisher and the scenes that i liked
Sep 9 2022,negative,worst starwars movie ever thats not how space works thats now how hyperspeed works  thats not how any of that stuff works
Sep 9 2022,positive,its an okay movie but its not as bad as most audiences say
Sep 9 2022,negative,dont know were to start  its a mess it ignores part 1 and left nothing good to build for the next part in the end there are just some stupid villains the characters have no development  the story is stupid the twists also there is nothing that works in this middle of a trilogy hard to watch really bad never thought there will be such a bad sw movie
Sep 8 2022,negative,the worst and most insulting star wars movie of all time  the force awakens was bad stupid and lazy but this one is a disgrace this movie divided the fanbase and damages the franchise forever thank you ryan johnson and kathleen kennedy
Sep 8 2022,negative,the worst piece of content ever created under the rubric of star wars its a travesty and has the entire fandom revolted with disney to this day a bad movie in every aspect bad writing ignoring canon bad pacing bad action bad acting bad everything with a few cgi exceptions
Sep 7 2022,positive,i grew up watching the original trilogy constantly on vhs i was at the age where the prequels were okay when they came out in the years to come i warmed up to them like many did the last jedi in this cinema and star wars fans opinion is the best star wars film since empire the conflict cinematography and originality are 1010 now thats not to say the movie is perfect there are very much some bad scenes but my goodness did rian johnson knock it out of the park
Sep 7 2022,negative,absolutely terrible filled with shallow characters and needless dialogue that goes nowhere the plot does not make sense and is filled with holes lacks the soul of the prequels and heart of the original series
Sep 6 2022,positive,loved this movie it went in more of the unpredictable way than the normal lightsaber fights and predictable story plot  not bitter at all that this didnt go the same way as the prequals or the originals rian created a formula that struck a nerve with a lot of audience members as either bad or good but guess what it worked because look at what movie is still being talked about 5 years later  analytical instead of sporadic sensationalism storytelling works in the end just have to have the right receptors to engage in watching and not hang on to expectations
Sep 6 2022,negative,despite some great moments overall fell quite flat felt like more of a stand alone movie  kind of derailed the trilogy
Sep 6 2022,negative,i make no exaggeration when i say this is one of the worst films i have ever seen satisfying character arcs are entirely lacking the dialgoue is painfully cliche many of the characters that the audience is clearly supposed to root for are thoroughly dislikable the antagonists are laughable stereotypes only positives are adam drivers performance and the visuals
Sep 5 2022,positive,my favorite star wars movie of the sequel trilogy and the best star wars movie since empire strikes back the last jedi brings a fresh new perspective to what balance in the force means and writes terrific arcs for rey kylo luke finn and rose especially
Sep 5 2022,negative,its hard to give a star wars movie 2 stars but honestly thats all it deserves the changes it made ruined star wars for me it only gets those 2 stars due to its great cinematography
Sep 5 2022,negative,one of the worst films ever made from the terrible story to the ridiculous characterizations to the total destruction of the star wars mythos this film deserves every bit of the hate and mockery it receives
Sep 5 2022,negative,worst movie ever  the last three trilogy were a complete fail someone reboot it and make it better
Sep 5 2022,negative,totally destroyed my 40 years of loving this saga and expanded universe the greatest charter assassination in movie history
Sep 5 2022,negative,during the movie i felt as if a giant behind appeared on the screen and emptied onto me for about 2 hours an absolutely mortifying devastation of the star wars saga
Sep 4 2022,negative,this movie fails as a star wars movie having little interest in what came before it     but beyond that it fails as a movie of any variety subplots have zero payoff and no impact on the outcome of the movie essentially no characters have any arch and there is no consistent theme     the slow speed chase framing device is nonsensical and boring    this movie is trash
Sep 4 2022,negative,while rise of skywalker is a worse movie the last jedi is pretty bad while some people may find the shocking characterization of luke skywalker and the dynamic between rey and kylo ren entertaining i didnt that doesnt change the fact that on a production level this movie is horrible most of the plotlines go nowhere the humor is absurdly bad and the films big twist snokes death just feels like wasted potential rise of skywalker is even worse but i have last jedi more because it was actually trying to be a good movie and still failed
Sep 4 2022,negative,if you are a fan of star wars do not watch this movie  it is both terrible and bad it is terribad    subtle racism by the studio and in the directors handling of the few actors of color add in destroying a beloved character and dividing a fandom makes this movie officially the worst     total scenes make no sense  military leaders who dont communicate with subordinates bad fight scenes where you can literally see they are even aiming in the protagonist direction  potential villains killed off just because  the disaster artist is more cohesive
Sep 4 2022,negative,the plot makes no sense
Sep 4 2022,negative,this movie destroyed my dreams i am disabled and i live isolated stars wars was everything to me and damn disney stepped on it i will never forgive them curse you disney curse you billionaires
Sep 4 2022,negative,what to say about a film that is supposed to be the second part of a trilogy yet threw out most everything that was set up in the previous film and left little for the third film to follow up on beyond the character assassination and absurd death of jake skywalker it is a crime that the big three of luke han and leia never shared a scene together in the sequels and who can forget the holdo maneuver that irrevocably breaks the mechanics of fasterthanlight travel in the sw universe
Sep 3 2022,negative,the first and only time i ever felt like walking out of the theatre made me question whether or not i was a star wars fan at all had all the bells and whistles of a star wars movie but none of the heart i think the swtors cinematics disorder sacrifice return betrayed were much better its a shame that not nearly as many people will ever see them
Sep 3 2022,negative,pretty but unfun lukes fall is not entertaining to watch we get two out of three lessons senseless asides and terrible leadership actions pass
Sep 3 2022,negative,oh boy this film is so edgy and hipster it wants to subvert everything and say its cooler then old star wars the edginess just drips of it   but the thing that kills it is the character assassination against luke skywalker the paragon and heroic archetype of hope stripped down to a sad cynical old man
Sep 3 2022,negative,definitely the worst star wars movie ever made it betrays everything that was set up in the previous installment and completely disregards character continuity how this movie got to be is beyond me its blasphemous and horrible
Sep 3 2022,negative,worst star wars film ever madeby a lot
Sep 3 2022,negative,a movie that went in a circle and somehow still ended worse then it started
Sep 3 2022,positive,truly the best since empire strikes back a bold step into a new direction  that sadly was rejected and retconned in the most cruel and needless and clumsy manner in probably all of blockbuster history which doesnt take anything away from the achievements of this movie for me the star wars films end with episode viii they might one day continue with the promised johnson trilogy but i dont believe it the studio has been cowed into submission by rabid fans its a pity but so is life maybe within 20 years time  but dont keep your fingers crossed
Sep 2 2022,negative,total disgrace to the star wars legacy it basically showed someone who hated star wars and wanted to tear it all down
Sep 2 2022,negative,just really not good at all no characteristics of any basic story telling
Sep 2 2022,negative,the turning point for the entire franchise into mediocrity
Sep 2 2022,negative,i honestly wish i could give this less than 12    i dont know what happened in the background but it seems like they tried to reboot empire but hired a kid out of film school or something and just made a mockery of something that so many of us held dear     i consider this some joke alternate dimension where simpletons write all the movies and critics stand and clap when ordered
Sep 2 2022,negative,the worst big blockbuster i have ever seen and i have seen thousands of films arguably the worst film of the 21st century so awful in every area its scary i could be here all night describing how bad this movie is
Sep 2 2022,positive,tied with rogue one for 3 star wars film in my book and ive been a fan since 1977 it swings for the fences and doesnt always hit but when it does it does
Sep 2 2022,negative,even after 5 years i still didnt like it  how in the hell did the resistance didnt just escape like fin and rose did  how is rey that powerful without training   as a star wars fan i owe rian johnson a rotten tomato in the face if not a kick in the balls for ruining star wars
Sep 2 2022,negative,i went to the midnight showing of this movie and i am not exaggerating when i say that it was the most disappointing i have ever been with any form of entertainment  movie tv video game book nothing  it killed my enthusiasm for the entire franchise
Sep 1 2022,negative,one of the worst shows ever written and directed  completely tanked the star wars ip and ran off most of the fan basegolf clap as a huge star wars fan growing up after this i actually no longer want anything to do with star warsthank disney
Sep 1 2022,positive,the last jedi is the most enjoyable of the sequel trilogy it definitely has its fair share of problems but it makes up with ideas that should have been explored further the film gave the characters time to develop from their status quo after tfa into more mature versions of themselves in most  cases  the whole sequel trilogy suffered from incoherence and a lack of world building with jj abrams having set up some good characters in a world that makes little sense followed by this film which tries to continue the mess and in some ways improves and in some fails to do so no matter what i think of jj abrams the whole trilogy should have been written before filming a single scene the worst thing done to the series is not tlj but jj abrams retconning tlj with tros and ruining every bit of character development
Sep 1 2022,negative,the slow space chase main plot was boring lukes dismissal of the jedi ways was unbelievable  the casino subplot managed to be irrelevant boring  also  incredibly obnoxious all at the same time
Sep 1 2022,negative,boring disrespectful and breaks canon doesnt do any true service to fans and in fact seems to mock them through the treatment of characters and lore present in the film
Aug 31 2022,negative,so disappointing an ambling and irrelevant journey of useless characters accomplishing absolutely nothing instead of deepening our respect understanding and fondness of the characters and furthering the star wars journey the audience gets a lecture and a reprimand  quit thinking that your heros are heros johnson keeps pounding the viewer in the face with a no one is special message save the lecture for another storyline star wats fans want to believe in unlikely heros and special people it doesnt diminish who we are its inspiring
Aug 31 2022,negative,the plot mechanics are nonsensical it looks pretty though
Aug 30 2022,negative,possibly one of the worst movies ever made
Aug 30 2022,negative,none of it makes any sense even in a madeup world
Aug 30 2022,neutral,i did adore lucasfilm for trying something different with this franchise this movie still looks absolutely gorgeous and the vfx still top notch character motivations being changed or dropped poor character motivation and development erratic continuity glaring plot holes and poor execution of a story that could be massively riveting are the major flaws of this movie you can see what the filmmakers are trying to do with this movie they were reaching for the clouds and came to emptyhanded this movie is not without its merits the acting from everyone is still sensational
Aug 29 2022,positive,better then force awakens in many ways far less fanservice and more focus on characters and story had some really cool momentsaction scenes but some really bad narative choices and meandering dragging plot held this movie back a lot
Aug 28 2022,negative,the way they treated the character of luke was really disrespectful and they made the rey character into a mary sue who had no flaws the film itself has no story and your left not knowing if there is anything to look forward to in the final film
Aug 27 2022,positive,narratively one of the best star wars films     unfortunately stuck between two jj abrams movies rian johnson is a very capable director and should have directed the entire trilogy in the first place
Aug 27 2022,negative,disney harvested more rubbish from the midden heap just plain awful  rewatch anything made by lucas for real entertainment
Aug 26 2022,negative,this movie is an affront to everything star wars and not only that its boring i patiently waited through force awakens to get a big luke skywalker moment that never came this movie rewarded my patience by taking a childhood hero and totally dismantling him all i wanted to see was a jedi master luke with his peak powers totally forcing it up instead i got a broken old geezer who was unlikeable and unrecognizable from his prior iteration and dont even get me started on the mysterious gravity in space poes character castration or the holdo moment i hated this movie so much that i still havent watched the rise of skywalker it is absolute garbage
Aug 23 2022,negative,i wouldve rated this zero stars but rotten tomatoes wont let me do that thanks to this pile of garbage star wars is home to the greatest movie of all time and the worst i absolutely and totally despise this movie its like rian johnson was intentionally nuking star wars there are several major problems with this one rian johnson obviously doesnt know how star wars works there is way too much humor in this for star wars a little bit of humor is okay but this was way too much the next problem this was not the same luke we all know and love from the original trilogy i get it hes been through a lot hes made some big mistakes and is somewhat responsible for his nephews fall to the dark side and the murder of several young children but he wouldnt turn to this speaking of luke there was absolutely no reason whatsoever to kill luke george lucas original plan for the sequel trilogy was to kill luke in episode nine but that was before he was so well received so im sure he wouldve changed his mind i saw a lunch showing of this and lukes death ruined the rest of my day but quite possibly the stupidest of all leia flying through space marry poppings style need i say more i believe that the official legal ruling describes this the best the last jedi and rise of skywalker are mediocre and shlokcy 010
Aug 23 2022,negative,disney you undoubtedly ruined and killed star wars with this film you destroyed luke skywalker and made him a pathetic old man when he was the symbol of hope and the most powerful jedi to have lived the fact you wrote him as this weakling and made him depressed and resentful is the greatest injustice that you couldve done to this character and pop culture overall star wars is successful because of the fans and this movie is just a huge metaphorical middle finger to all those fans that made this franchise lucrative for the last 40 years
Aug 23 2022,negative,what a terrible conclusion to a terrible trilogy  the 1st trilogy sw were and still are the best  the 2nd trilogy was good enough but not the best because of episode 1 was a major snooze fest up until the last fight scene that fight scene seemed to be choreograph with a surgical blade
Aug 21 2022,negative,just an absolute assassination of the character of luke skywalker  literally an almost deliberate eff you to fans  nothing redeeming about this movie
Aug 21 2022,negative,this pile of crap isnt nowhere near what star wars used to and should continue to be
Aug 21 2022,negative,it was a letdown compared to the previous trilogies and falls apart quickly
Aug 21 2022,positive,i might get a lot of hate for this but this is pretty much tied with force awakens for my favorite of the sequel trilogy i really dont like any of them too much and looking at the trilogy as a whole its just absolutely abysmal there are some genuinely terrible things in this movie i dont like most of the story that happens with finn and rose or even the subplot that involves poe i also wasnt a huge fan of luke becoming an asshole but i liked a lot of things that people hated any of the new things i liked leia force floating through space that was cool using lightspeed to cut an enemy ship in half i thought that was awesome i also like all of the character development that happened with rey and kylo one of the the biggest problems i have with the trilogy is that they gave the next movie back to jj and he spent way too much time trying to undue some of those changes i liked that direction and the trilogy could have been saved for me if they had hired someone who was willing to further it in the last movie   72510
Aug 20 2022,negative,well done disney youve failed at star wars again and oh my an anticapitalism theme from disney disney
Aug 19 2022,negative,learn to write and how to show a change in character and loose the mary sue
Aug 16 2022,negative,the movie that killed star wars saw it in the theater with my son after he asked what i thought and i had to tell him honestly i hated it
Aug 15 2022,negative,this movie is by far the worst star wars film introduces many plot holes and has many strange choices made by rian johnson
Aug 15 2022,negative,i hated this movie the subplots were entirely unnecessary it completely deviated from the original course of the sequels broke its own rules and overall made no sense
Aug 13 2022,negative,all i can say is thank god the audience are smarter than the critics there is absolutly nothing good about this movie and i wish that disney would not plauge star wars and make it the absolute failure it is today
Aug 11 2022,negative,mary sue characters are not a good watch
Aug 10 2022,negative,i paid 20 for the privilege of watching my childhood hero betray every character trait associated with him off camera and as a kicker got to watch him milk a space lizard chug an bottle of it and look spitefully at the camera as he gave himself a facial with the green goo     also 70 of the movies runtime of 0 to do with the actual plot it was just watching supporting characters from the previous movie run around on a hamster wheel as if the only reason for them being in the movie at all was contractual obligation     lastly this movie is the 2nd part of a trilogy this isnt a trilogy at all though i dont think lucasfilm has the slightest clue what theyre doing this is just three movies released in a row that do whatever the hell they want
Aug 9 2022,negative,easily the worst star wats movie ever made horrible comedy that doesnt land assassination of once beloved legacy characters a complete retcon of everything abrams was building up to and overall just a completely pointless movie with no logic to it
Aug 8 2022,positive,the movie suffers from a lot of problems but the movie is creative dont get the hate a really ok movie
Aug 7 2022,positive,this one is a real grower  i remember feeling very disappointed when i first watched it then better on the second viewing even more so when i sat through a trilogy premiere screening knowing a conclusion was forthcoming but this time ive got very little negative to say about it i think i like it a little more that the force awakens just a little  it saddens me to realise that my opinion towards this upon release may have been heavily influenced by certain negative reviews at the time hatred towards this being something of a trend although i did have a few very particular frustrations that i think were born from my perspective  in any case this movie does very well with time like a fine wine
Aug 7 2022,positive,the greatest 02 hours and 32 minutes ever
Aug 2 2022,negative,its so sad how they massared the whole star wars genre with this movie
Aug 1 2022,positive,its a good movie but ultimately its nothing we havent seen before from star wars just like in the movie before one small ship from the good guys destroys one massive ship from the bad guys rey should have joined kylo and created their own rule one between the sides of dark and light if this was a stand alone movie it would be better but its not and sadly could of been much more for a trilogy again the acting was good with beautiful scenes and shots rarely were there scenes that looked noticeably cgi
Jul 31 2022,negative,objectively a bad movie completely ignores the events of the previous movie and goes off on its own making the whole series inconsistent and incoherent and throws in a random scene near the end that detracts from everything else in the movie its a mess from start to finish
Jul 28 2022,negative,this movie seems to have an actual disdain for star wars words cannot describe how much contempt for the original property the creator of this movie has the creation of this movie is akin to a greek tragedy and the movie itself wouldnt even qualify for a bmovie had it not been for expensive fx and the skinsuits of disney and lucas arts
Jul 27 2022,negative,never really enjoyed it it was too boring disney couldve done better
Jul 26 2022,negative,last jedi was my first disappointment in life with a star wars content i left the theater and i was stunned i couldnt believe the garbage that i had watched thanks rian johnson and disney to make me feel so miserable with something that always gave me so much joy
Jul 25 2022,negative,a huge disaster shouldve never switch directors
Jul 23 2022,positive,my rating for the film is a 6710
Jul 20 2022,positive,i decided to finally review this movie after a lot of time and after watching it a few times because i still was trying to figure out why so many people hated this movie and im just going to say that yes it has some definite flaws but i still think its way better than the phantom menace attack of the clones and the rise of skywalker which i like less and less each time i watch that one
Jul 18 2022,negative,i would give negative ten stars if i could the kindest thing i can say is that this movie was just terrible and thats the kindest thing i can say
Jul 16 2022,negative,this film was nearly unwatchable trash that only gets points for being pretty but falls apart under any reasonable scrutiny
Jul 14 2022,positive,i was confused about what i should give this film but i gave it the highest my heart would let me a 35 this film messes with luke skywalker and who he is at his core this film also messes up finns character they should have let him die giving his character purpose and meaning this film was not hot trash but is far from good
Jul 13 2022,negative,the last jedi is not only an insult to the very foundations of what makes star wars such a beautiful escape from reality but it is also a downright sloppy movie with blatant plot holes that run throughout the movies entirety with appalling writing and plot lines so confusing and pointless they make admiral holdos plan look genius this abomination is one of the worst examples of story telling to ever be created
Jul 13 2022,negative,horrible movie disappointing 
Jul 12 2022,positive,this is the most polarizing film ever some things in this movie are so beautiful and amazing and yet at the same time other things in the movie are awful like the hacker plot line on cantobite this movie has a lot of good subversion and some bad ones too the last jedi is mostly amazing in the third act and mostly bad in the first and second but somehow i feel like the highs over so slightly outweigh the lows so in conclusion its okay
Jul 12 2022,negative,worst star wars ever stupid attempts at humor lightspeed into another ship come one and luke they turned into a grumpy cry baby disney and done nothing but ruin star wars and now marvel as well i loved the star wars movies up until disney took them over and this is worst of them all
Jul 11 2022,negative,a movie that has great execution with beautiful visuals great cinematography and brilliant visual effects while having a story that craps on every person who has ever enjoyed the star wars ot and is a big middle finger to all fans johnson has made it his goal in this movie to ruin every character you used to love not just luke han and leia but even characters from the same trilogy he proceeds to turn almost everyone except rey into a pathetic idiot making stupid decisions jake skywalker of course is completely butchered and destroyed in favor of elevating the new characters good or bad movie it just is a terrible sequel movie not only in follow up to the ot but also tfa for example general hux a once strong fierce general of the first order is now a baffon and idiot laughed at at every oppertunity same with kylo ren honestly the best i can say is that if youve never watched the ot movies you might be able to semi enjoy this movie after all the visuals are fantastic and some characters like finn and poe are still semi enjoyable but even as someone who has only seen star wars first a few years ago and thus has no nostalgia glasses watching this had my blood boiling as it is an insult to everything that came before it johnson has the privilege to stand on the shoulders of giants and proceeds to take a huge dump on them
Jul 11 2022,negative,i somehow think this was even worse than the rise of skywalker  this movie had zero direction it was filled with nonsensical scenes quotes scenarios and worst of all they ruined luke skywalker  luke  skywalker  that alone is unforgivable and irredeemable  youre telling me the luke skywalker  arguably the most pure and optimistic of the jedi  who never turned his back on his father and quite literally revived anakin skywalker turned his back on his nephew who hadnt even turned to the dark side yet  give me a break  nothing else even needs to be said  this chaotic mess doesnt deserve to be associated with the star wars name and the directors should be ashamed of the damage theyve caused to the franchise
Jul 11 2022,positive,i loved this film from the first viewing ive been a star wars fan since 1977 and this was my favorite first viewing theater experience of all the films most people claimed to love it when it came out until it became popular to hate it and to falsely claim that mark hamill hated the filmhe didnt and he has repeatedly asked people to stop lying about that this film has amazing action solid story and some of the biggest surprises and twists in star wars history love it or dontbut decide that for yourself
Jul 11 2022,negative,a perfect example of a filmmaker taking an existing universe and saying i know better than the fans  making a perverse mockery of beloved hero luke skywalker completely undermining the big bad guy built up in the previous film and giving rey no humbling defeat loss or sacrifice to develop her character not to mention how they pushed the most interesting character introduced in episode 7 finn off to the sidelines bottom line is there are very little saving graces for this film beyond the wonderful special effects that unfortunately are unable to save this disaster of a film
Jul 10 2022,negative,this has a very all over the place story with finn and rose with another being a very dragged out plot with the resistance trying to escape the first order fleet  its literally the whole movie luke isnt luke and rey is fine but confusing the infamous throne room scene i think was choreographed badly but filmed well and the cgi of smoke was good this films only saving grace is the visuals  crait looks beautiful
Jul 9 2022,negative,this is a horrible part of star wars saga it is very bad with the lot of the story plot having the gambling planet excursion was so stupid princess lea flying through space as she is like super woman was almost saddening to watch and finally luke drinking that disgusting alien milk who thought of this was a bad idea and this only names a few of the terrible atrocities to the franchise whatever work that was done in the force awakens was destroyed in this with this version of star wars i am speaking as a big star wars fan feeling terribly disappointed with this star wars film
Jul 8 2022,positive,the best star wars has been since empire
Jul 6 2022,negative,beyond the amazing special effects and visuals that you should expect from a high budget disney film there is not much to enjoy in the last jedi for dedicated star wars fans overtime you will notice the many plotholes and plotcontrivances that plague this film furthermore the humour in the film is quite polarising love it or hate it the jokes often take away from the already limited tension of the scenes on your first watch you may really enjoy the last jedi but the films poorly written story will prevent it from becoming as beloved as other star wars films that are still rewatched decades later
Jul 5 2022,negative,im consistently baffled every time i attempt to give tlj another chance as to what was going through rian johnsons and kathleen kennedys heads when the put this film together and allowed it to be released like this insufferable character writing poor attempts to subvert expectations that just result in lost momentum and ruining plot arcs and the sacrilege destruction of a beloved original series character i continue to hope that the reception of tlj from fans will finally convince disney star wars that what we really want isnt politics or subversion its star wars media thats fun to watch and exhilarates us even when you peel back the simple visual spectacle
Jul 3 2022,positive,a solid exploration of the star wars world with the gravitas of empire it suffers from the whole canto bight section feeling disconnected from the rest of the film which means the pace kind of ramps up superquick as we enter act 3
Jul 3 2022,negative,a terrible mess full of logical errors and laughable character motivation a disgrace for star wars
Jul 3 2022,negative,definetly an episode that ruined the sequel trilogy
Jul 2 2022,negative,this movie is so bad and it tuned me off of star wars probably for ever so long as disney owns it just a terrible movie
Jul 1 2022,negative,an astounding disappointment i could explain further but then i would run the risk of putting more effort into this review than they did the whole movie
Jul 1 2022,negative,star wars  the last pile of poop i ever watch do you even care about your fans this is not what we asked for
Jun 30 2022,negative,very bad nothing to do with the original canon 
Jun 30 2022,negative,disney needs to stop milking these films and drinking it like luke
Jun 30 2022,negative,this is a good movie but a terrible star wars movie
Jun 28 2022,negative,i wish i could give this zero stars  the film completely ended the prestige of the star wars series  rian johnson is a good tv director but he had no business directing a project of this size
Jun 28 2022,negative,poorly made movie with bad acting and doesnt stay trust to the lore dont waste time on this movie
Jun 28 2022,negative,if i could give it a lower rating i would i honestly wish this movie had not been made 
Jun 27 2022,positive,yeah this is better than cats
Jun 27 2022,negative,  an abomination of a film it completely forgot about lukes entire arc in the original trilogy it sidelined a major character to the role of comic relief and derailed the entire sequel trilogy not that it had any sort of overarching plan anyway  it ignores any plot points set up from tfa and any narrative threads in this film turn out to be completely redundant  the whole sequel trilogy needs to be struck from canon and ignored
Jun 26 2022,negative,imagine making a movie that has nothing to do with the first one and pretend to pass it off as the sequal to that onethats this movie it felt like a star wars parody movie this was a not a star wars film it was a hack job
Jun 25 2022,negative,much of the criticism thats been said about this film is true of this review  the last jedi if taken seriously lays waste to all we know and love about star wars lore
Jun 24 2022,negative,plot holes inconsistencies in plot points and themes that go against the nature of the star wars universe but most damning boring while tfa was a purposed anh ripoff it was exciting engaging and full of action the only thing to say about this film is that rian johnson made a gorgeously shot film this is the worst of the nine skywalker episodes
Jun 24 2022,neutral,couldve been so much better disney need to start working on a good storyline
Jun 24 2022,positive,the worst of the franchise the only star wars movie that i was bored while watching
Jun 23 2022,negative,might be the worst film of the franchise characters from the original trilogy not being true to who they were and plot lines that dont make sense tough to watch such an important universe being handled so poorly
Jun 22 2022,negative,the sacred texts   blue milk   gambling planet   horses   broom boy   general hugs   dj   mary poppins    enough said
Jun 22 2022,negative,this movie was bad in a lot of ways but the most major one is how badly luke and rey are written and that part where finn and rose go to whatever the planet was called made me want to fall asleep
Jun 22 2022,negative,worst movie ever broke the movie universes own laws of physics and upped the dangers to pointlessly ridiculous levels that made it feel like eating raw sugar instead of a lovely dessert
Jun 21 2022,positive,the bit on the casino planet ran a little long but otherwise i dont see why it gets all the hate solidly the best of the sequel trilogy
Jun 21 2022,negative,star wars is honestly  truly dead adam driver  get out of these   youre far better than anyone here
Jun 20 2022,positive,a fantastic film way ahead of its time it has the most beautiful cinematography and story highly recommended and among the best in the star wars franchise
Jun 20 2022,negative,when thinking that the prequels was bad in the late 90searly 2000s and then they butcher sw like this
Jun 19 2022,negative,if you like or even vaguely respect star wars do not watch this movie
Jun 19 2022,negative,i did not appreciate the handling of luke skywalkers character in this movie i felt like the fans were spat on in favor of the new fans
Jun 18 2022,negative,the worst film in the sequel trilogy
Jun 18 2022,negative,watching cars 2 was more enjoyable than sitting through this movie and if you have 2 12 hours of time to kill i would suggest watching almost any other film or if you feel like watching some true sw watch the mandolorian or a new hope from the original trilogy
Jun 17 2022,positive,after force awakens gives fans nothing challenging or new rian johnson was ready to step in not to mention the challenge of answering why luke would abandon his friends in the force awakens this movie moves the story in an exciting new direction much to how the prequels were unlike the original trilogy it just so happens its a sequel to the force awakens
Jun 17 2022,negative,action was good plot was bad     final rating 4110
Jun 17 2022,negative,i could not give this movie a low enough review absolute trash did disney even try to make a good movie this was everything star wars fans didnt want its better to just pretend this movie never happened
Jun 16 2022,negative,how is this even star wars i cant believe that this film was actually made 
Jun 16 2022,negative,this film runined starwars for me i honestly think between the plot holes and universe inconsistencies it was a well put together film but what it did to starwars from a logic stand point matters more in scifi than any other genre force me no pun intended to make this review utterly devastated after watching it
Jun 15 2022,negative,while this film was an attempt to be bold with its direction this movie ultimately fails to deliver and instead destroys the legendary story that is star wars
Jun 15 2022,negative,this movie was the moment that i lost all interest in disneys star wars
Jun 15 2022,positive,some people hate this movie im not one of them
Jun 15 2022,neutral,this movie is equal bad and good it gets really creative with some things which are ruined in the next film the fights were pretty good which is also ruined in the next film and overall its okay not great but not bad
Jun 14 2022,negative,difficult to watch if youre a huge star wars fan this movie put a lot of emphasis on destroying the legendary character luke to flourish the new one rey there was space for both old and new jedi to deliver epic adventure
Jun 14 2022,negative,just the worst thing ive ever seen
Jun 14 2022,negative,at the time of release this was the worst star wars story to ever be told now though disney shows are giving it a run for its money someone take this ip from these activists before they ruin star wars for all future generations
Jun 14 2022,positive,good but the original characters definitely needed more i know the focus is on rey but the characters just felt wasted definitely needed more development
Jun 14 2022,negative,there is a bad scene comedy i do not like
Jun 13 2022,negative,the film that finally broke and ruined star wars rian johnsson succeeded in infamously subverting expectations only in that no one expected disney would allow the worlds most beloved franchise to be smashed to pieces in a single movie for no good reason at all despicable
Jun 13 2022,negative,as a star wars fan that was just not it
Jun 12 2022,negative,this was so bad same level with the worst movie of all time ghostbusters 2016  disney is a plague that is turning everything to s
Jun 12 2022,negative,only decent of the disney made ones but still not good
Jun 11 2022,negative,somehow the story in this movie makes the most sense out of all the sequels but its still really bad
Jun 11 2022,negative,in a vacuum the movie is alright but very heavy handed with its messaging and extremely bloated it does not follow the universe it is
Jun 11 2022,negative,disney seems determined to murder star wars by humiliating all the original cast and then killing them all off i guess its a great strategy if you want to burn a pile of money and destroy a cultural icon at the same time but i wont be adding any of my money to this fire ever again
Jun 9 2022,negative,disregards the surrounding universe and characters within it to tell a mediocre story your characters should inform the plot you shouldnt be changing core parts of your characters to tell a story you want to see
Jun 8 2022,negative,what can i say that has not already been said this movie was trash from beginning to end wrecking anything the original trilogy had established about these characters  ill make sure my children never have to witness this abomination
Jun 7 2022,negative,although rian johnsons cinematography is great and there are some nice shots in the film  the script falls flat this film destroyed lukes character reys backstory was also poorly written overall the last jedi is one of the worst in the star wars franchise
Jun 7 2022,negative,complete lack of cohesion luke rey finn could be so much more kylo ben should just pick a side already
Jun 6 2022,negative,the entire series that disney made here with star wars has been a disspointment  but i gave it a 2 because i am a huge star wars fan  i miss the predisney star wars
Jun 6 2022,negative,by far the worst star wars movie ever i cant understand why some people like it at all i really hate that they butchered luke so hard that is the biggest flaw ever from star wars and it bugs me so much the first two movies of the prequel trilogy look like astonishing movies compared to the last jedi 2017 was the year where star wars lost its charm and you can clearly see why that is
Jun 6 2022,positive,overhated but its not amazing either wasted potential on finn by giving him and rose a sub plot that doesnt really work out with the story
Jun 6 2022,negative,not going to lie its fun to watch i liked the way the story was going better than the way it did in the force awakens but it didnt work the the former film already out the rise of skywalker did not help reversing most of the films big progressions finns arc roses character the broken lightsaber etc wasted snoke and luke as a character
Jun 5 2022,negative,what can i say that has not already been said they finally started to get the look and sound of star wars but forget how to write a story to make you feel like it
Jun 5 2022,positive,havent seen the original or prequel trilogy recently enough to december them but of all the star wars films i have seen this is undeniably the best beautifully shot and actually feels like a story unlike the previous and next in the trilogy which focus on drawing out fan reactions through the pop culture of star wars as it exists outside the universe of the films
Jun 5 2022,positive,an awesome star wars movie that the toxic fans sadly tore apart
Jun 5 2022,neutral,5510    it was a very decent movie i thought a lot of the concepts were pretty neat such as rey coming from a family of nobodies a concept they completely scrapped in the third movie and also that rey and kylo had this connection with the force also the film looked pretty at times  however overall it was pretty meh there were plenty of stupid scenes such as leia using the force like mary poppins to hop back onto the ship the holdo maneuver looked cool but does not really make sense on paper lukes character wasnt really treated well and finn and roses side quest was extremely unneeded its such as shame because finn had so much potential   still not as bad as the rise of skywalker
Jun 5 2022,negative,this movie is objectively terrible  poorly written  this show should be called you slay queen yasss  and the admiral holdo sht     most women like rian johnson arent funny and cant write rational stories because they only experience the world through their emotions valid or not  they shouldnt be given jobs writing for star wars
Jun 4 2022,positive,still better than any star trek movie 
Jun 4 2022,negative,a series of subverted expectations that betrays each beloved character and theme one by one until there is only rey
Jun 4 2022,negative,as a rabid lifelong fan of all star wars films i just did not like this one at all never clicked at any point for me 
Jun 3 2022,positive,one of my favorite of the star wars saga i know this movie gets a lot of hate but i loved to see luke essentially take on the role of yoda from episode 5 and grow into the master passing the torch this movie contains one of the best explanation of the force and really gives us a great finish to luke skywalker salty fans will never stop me from rewatching this movie
Jun 3 2022,positive,better with every watch
Jun 3 2022,positive,absolutely one of the most masterful pieces of star wars media ever crafted
Jun 3 2022,negative,this was pure and utter  garbage disney destroys another franchise
Jun 3 2022,positive,such a great installment to the franchise im bummed they walked back some of the messages in ros but overall this was a great star wars movie
Jun 3 2022,negative,blatant disrespect to the lore
Jun 2 2022,negative,they destroyed lukes character the man was an inch away from murdering his nephew in his sleep   im not sure what universe this is but it isnt star wars
Jun 2 2022,negative,this movie ruins luke skywalker star wars yoda the force and much more terrible story no character development for the new characters very awful movie
Jun 2 2022,negative,the worst star wars film ever made
Jun 2 2022,negative,worst movie of all time  nothing nothing could ever stoop as low as this movie did
Jun 2 2022,negative,rian johnson should never touch star wars again
Jun 2 2022,positive,one of the best star wars movies of all saga
Jun 2 2022,positive,oh céus o que fizeram com star wars georginho vc tá bem
Jun 1 2022,negative,a bad movie can be excused salvaged loved attack of the clones has a great fanbase    but a bad movie made on purpose to ignore an ip its rules its lore troll the fans and ruin the following movie after 8 we all knew 9 would be sacrificed for damage control cannot be forgiven   i also firmly beleive solo suffered a lot from releasing too close to 8 as well as many of my friends refused to go watch another starwars so soon after 8    some may like 8 good for them respect to them some of the designs are pretty cool like ghost lukes blue robes  but i know i will never forget the actual shame i felt after dragging my non starwars friends to see it on release night and they all looked at me when the animated ghost of leia was doing superman in the vaccum of space    at least 8 will serve as a springboard  for other disney sw who will look better in comparisson    as always and its a shame it needs to be mentionned the actors are innocent and should be respected     this one is mostly on you rian   and whoever on the narrative group forgot to mention how lore breaking that movie was going to be
Jun 1 2022,positive,though some view this as disappointing the includes some very neat plot twists and action scenes all throughout
Jun 1 2022,negative,a desecration of the star wars lore
May 31 2022,negative,ruined luke and everything he stood for fuck lucasfilm
May 31 2022,positive,the only reason the audience score is so low is because old star wars fans are clouded by emotion objectively this was a great stand alone film     it feels out of place as a star wars movie but its still way better than the fanfiction that is tfos tfos lacks any substance and is entirely fanservice while this movie has depth and takes risks not everybodys cup of tea but it is a good story with character development and amazing cinematography
May 29 2022,negative,the most boring chase scene in film history freeing horses over child slaves and destruction of beloved characters make this film eminently missable
May 29 2022,negative,i hate that movie form the bottom of my heart
May 29 2022,negative,took the potential that tfa had and ran it into the ground one of the worst star wars movies since attack of the clones but didnt have a cool fight scene to help no idea what movie the critics saw
May 29 2022,negative,the last jedi is an amazing film but terrible star wars
May 29 2022,positive,the hate around this movie is odd but im pretty sure that this is the best sequel on disney star wars
May 29 2022,negative,its so bad i do not know where to begin  absolutely ruins the entire franchise  why have they not fired the heads of disney star  wars yet
May 28 2022,positive,disney had a different approach and i think we should except that  they took a risk and that is a good thing  fail  first  attempt  in  learning
May 27 2022,negative,rian johnson is a great filmmaker but made what is very clearly the worst entry in the star wars saga the sooner we forget about this movie and its contribution to the skywalker story the better
May 20 2022,positive,the directing was great and was a great set up for a future movie this could have been an infinity war but unfortunately the rise of skywalker happened they could have done luke better in the movie but i like the approach taken to the movie
May 19 2022,negative,the worst movie i have ever seen in my life i was a life long star wars fan but this killed all of it worst movie ever
May 18 2022,negative,worst star wars movie ever made the worst star wars content wver put out fire rian johnson
May 18 2022,negative,does the film honor the sagas rich legacy absolutely not does it add something new also no but if you are not a fan of star wars will you like the movie probably not is there a twist or are you hanging onto your seat in suspense you are more likely to roll your eyes and fall asleep rian johnson gives you the finger whether you like star wars or not   if you claim to like tlj you should have your head examined thats not from me the director of the other two in the trilogy said it it was so bad that attendance was low for following star wars films jarjar didnt turn fans off the franchise this badly   the movie starts cheezy but okay the rest is depressing things happening for no reason plot hole after plot hole the twist or subverted expectation is that the movie attempts to explain how the hero who saved everyone was wrong and the stupid characters that got everyone killed are right if you are the kind of person that thinks for themselves instead of being an easily amused simpleton that likes being told what to think then you wont like the film if you clap when people jingle keys in front of your face and have trouble counting to ten then perhaps youd enjoy this you dont even have to watch any of the other movies since nothing that happens has anything to do with the others nothing of any consequence happens a complete waste of time from beginning to end
May 18 2022,negative,it misses all the great things that should be star wars it looks amazing but the over the top developments of the jedi just run unbelievable where the series has a walking carpet get me
May 17 2022,negative,cant believe they can do worst than the previous episode but they did  less action less sense a story without rhyme or reason that come from nowhere and totally unrelated to star wars universe
May 17 2022,negative,over the top palpatine action a fleet  a fleet that is copied and pasted beyond the horizon  ridiculous  a sith would have the ability to destroy a planet with the amount of power it took to put the rebels out of commission  over powered jedi force usage that even among fiction requires complete suspended faith in the effects  poor writing poor execution and even poorer judgement
May 17 2022,negative,just no this was a pointless movie that put shame to the name of our favorite characters as well as have the most annoying and unbearable cast of characters ever rey is such a mary sue that it is hard to get invested into anything that she does whatsoever
May 16 2022,negative,unfortunately star wars the last jedi was a huge disappointment the plot and the characters were boring and onedimensonal
May 14 2022,negative,litaraly pure garbage would rather watch the christmas special on repeat for an week then to have to watch this pile of rotten money grabbing waste of time
May 14 2022,positive,a good solid film the riskiest sw installment by far not at all perfect its a sw movie after all definitely not for hopelessly backward looking comicgamergate chuds or assorted bigoted mothballs offended by diversity in casting
May 10 2022,negative,the worst film in cinematic history for a multitude of reasons
May 9 2022,negative,the single worst piece of star wars media besides the holiday special ever
May 8 2022,negative,an insult to decades of star wars law full of plot holes and ret cons that take away from the original series
May 8 2022,positive,the best star wars movie since the empire strikes back
May 7 2022,negative,this movie never should have been made i grow more fond of nearly all star wars movies with time and repeated watching this one i liked the most right after leaving the theater and i despise it more and more every time i think about it i could list a dozen things that are awful about this movie but just to keep myself from wasting any more of my life on this awful film i will just say that what ryan johnson did to luke skywalker was criminal
May 7 2022,neutral,a bad way to close a historical franchise good cinematography and a great villain they fucked him up at the end enough said
May 6 2022,negative,highly pretentious rehash of empire strikes back and return of the jedi that is undeservedly touted as being bold and different
May 5 2022,neutral,i dont have as much to say about this film as i do others in the star war saga i remember the absolutely unwarranted backlash it received upon release and i think the fact that so many hate this movie for no reason kind of makes me like it more than i should its not great its got many problems and doesnt build from the first film as much as a sequel should finns character development is neutered rose is a mess of a character and a large chunk of the middle of the movie feels extremely unnecessary but it does have some incredible cinematography it does some good things with the plot that are sadly retconned in the next film and overall id say i have a good time watching this movie a perfectly ok star wars film
May 4 2022,negative,watched it again what a terrible movie put me off watching anymore for another 5 years good  lord
May 3 2022,positive,not a popular opinionbut i loved it
May 2 2022,negative,completely ruined lukes character and turned kylo from a menacing villain into a whining brat
May 2 2022,positive,i think the movie was good but it could have been better the entire casino plotline with finn and rose was absolutely pointless and only added more runtime to an already long movie other than that i enjoyed most of the movie there are more instances of things that make no sense and that i would change but that was by far the biggest one
May 2 2022,negative,the directing lacked execution also there were many opportunities in the story to allow genuine character development however the director chose to either kill off a character too quickly without providing more background or to have a character display superficial traits to rush the story through quite a shame the director had a fantastic opportunity of opening a door to this spectacular star wars world and decided to the opposite
May 1 2022,negative,a movie so bad it ruins the legacy of an entire franchise it begs the question what if the answer to every question was the least appealing answer imaginable this is what happens when subverting expectations becomes the purpose of a director rather than a tool used to tell a resonant story ps  you could cut out the middle hour of this film and it would not change anything that is how meaningless most scenes were literally made me hate every character involved and has prevented me from caring to see any future installments
May 1 2022,positive,i have kinda weird feelings on this movie i love lukes arc in this movie i kinda like rey in this movie and overall i can enjoy it however it has so many problems   i dont like finn in this story i find poe dameron really annoying although he could have got a potentially really good arc but he didnt get it i dont like roses role in the story i like the actresss performance but not her characters role in the story this movie has too many jokes and the casino scene is really bad but overall i kinda like it
May 1 2022,negative,it was horrible it wasnt fun to watch nor exciting nothing like what star wars should be bad choreographed scenes and some scenes was boring
Apr 29 2022,positive,star wars the last jedi is the sequel to jj abrams the force awakens this one directed and written by rian johnson this one is the most controversial star wars movie that led to many angry fans and critics praising it in the end this movie in my opinion is the best movie of this trilogy rian weaves a story based on the theme of failure and how failure is a part of life but it helps us become better daisy ridley returns here as rey and she greatly develops this character more rey is not always as likeable as luke was but we sympathize with her desire to know who her parents were and daisy greatly humanizes this character but the best character is kylo ren by adam driver adam is tenacious handsome brutal and this is the best he ever was in the entire sequel trilogy we know he is evil but we grow to like him this is an ensemble cast and there is too many to mention but mark hamill gives one of the best performances of his carrer as luke skywalker but as a defeated hopeless and cranky old jedi thats the best part of the entire film the cinematography is beautiful the visuals make it one of the most beautiful star wars movies to look at and the climax is one of the best in the saga regardless of the controversy this movie will stand on its own in the star wars legacy because of ryan johnson taking star wars to places it had never been with plot twists and turns that make it unpredictable
Apr 29 2022,positive,by far the most controversial starwars movie yet yet among the awful subplots and downright hateable side characters there lies a deeply misunderstood film trying to tell a lot rian johnston ends not saying much as the true heart of the movie is dragged down by nonsensical character choices and subplots reminiscent of the dreaded prequels love it or hate it the last jedi tells an interesting and flawed story capable of equal bad moments and great moments
Apr 29 2022,negative,one of the worst movies ever
Apr 29 2022,positive,this film went on a direction that i didnt expect and was honestly even better than any way i couldve imagined the story going  i love everything with luke rey and kylo and the resistance vs first order conflict is the most intense in this film  while the finn and rose stuff isnt great the good heavily outweighs the bad  top 3 star wars films for me
Apr 28 2022,positive,slower than the usual star wars epic but i dont see that as a bad thing
Apr 27 2022,negative,this was an okay movie  
Apr 27 2022,positive,one of the best movies of the whole franchise
Apr 25 2022,negative,trash a total disgrace to the original movies if you like pretty cinematic scenes and vibrant colors and thats all you need in a movie this one is for you if youre looking for something that makes sense as either a star wars fan or a casual movie goer good luck
Apr 23 2022,negative,a jumbled poorlythoughtoutmess  the plot is chaotic and not well thought out and the characters backstories and actions dont align  at least the creatures and special effects were nice
Apr 19 2022,negative,i am not going to repeat what was said already but the thing that got me angry is that they were not even able to include a real lightsaber fight between kylo and luke
Apr 19 2022,negative,if you arent a star wars fan this movies terrible it breaches unity of setting and action not in interestingly subversive ways but in an incoherent mess that reminds us why storytelling has structure character behavior is so incongruous it breaks suspension of disbelief in a movie about space wizards that says something     if youre a star wars nerd this movies personally hurtful its a badfaith trojan horse for rian johnsons contempt of everything star wars including its fans hes stolen the standard of goodversusevil heros journey genre fiction and plunged it into proselytizing nihilism spoiler protagonists only succeed at major plot goals through suicide including such a message in a movie marketed to children is abhorrent    dont trust the critics ratings on this one the last jedi is so rotten its sequel goes out of its way to disavow it in an attempt to salvage the saga i cant imagine a harsher indictment of a movie
Apr 19 2022,positive,the best star wars movie after the original trilogy and rogue one  finally a sw movie that took ballsy risks in the same way that empire strikes back did way back in 1980  the cowardly fans who tried to tear this movie down are sadly incapable of understanding what makes a good sw movie
Apr 19 2022,negative,that critic score is a literal joke it is exactly why people do not trust mainstream media or industry critics anymore   this movie is bad on every level  if you like star wars youll hate this movie with a burning passion it destroys established lore and characters  it single handedly stained the franchise and split the fan base  if you dont like star wars its just an odd preachy and boring movie
Apr 17 2022,negative,an absolutely diabolical film with possibly the worst writing i have ever seen this film is extremely boring with a terrible plot i should also mention that this has the worst choreography i have ever seen as well also mark hamill luke skywalker tried to warn us that luke would be very different to how he was in previous films its crazy to think that luke went from saving the galaxy as an incredibly powerful jedi to becoming a careless old guy on a random isolated planet this film is painful from start to finish and you should stay away from it by far the worst star wars film there is
Apr 16 2022,negative,disney did it again another one bites the dust
Apr 15 2022,negative,short version mark hamil was right    long version without spoiling they killed too many cool characters had unnecessary plot points and they botched luke completely kylo ren was great and hamil did the best he could with what he was given
Apr 14 2022,negative,i appreciate rian johnson for trying to go against the norms and trying to do something different and some of his ideas were good yet they werent carried out correctly for example the idea of luke being cut off from the force is fine but the movie makes it seem like luke is just some grumpy old man that the audience should have no connection to whatsoever despite him being the hero of the star wars saga it could have been good and is well structured but it misses the mark in critical places not a terrible movie like everyone suggests but it is very far away from great
Apr 14 2022,negative,the worst film of the saga has a boring story and even if luke skywalker reappears the film is not saved an atrocity from start to finish
Apr 12 2022,negative,so clear this was created by people who did not care for starwars extremely crazy decisions plots completely destroyed charters out of charter all bad
Apr 11 2022,negative,i had a good time watching this movie at the cinema when it appeared binge watched all the sw movies now sorry but i like the movie but i dont like it is a star wars movie it has mark hamill in it but he definitely doesnt play luke skywalker
Apr 7 2022,positive,i love this movie the one part that should have been changed was the canto bight scene which dragged on for way too long and felt too realistic
Apr 6 2022,positive,loved the original star wars films as a kid still do especially empire strikes back while considering a new hope a genre landmark didnt think the prequel films were that bad personally but they had a lot wrong with them and were a long way from great especially attack of the clones    found myself loving the force awakens which to me was the best star wars film since the return of the jedi and more an affectionate homage and universe celebration than the rehash some have criticised it for seeing the last jedi with quite high expectations judging from the positive critical word of mouth and despite enjoying it and finding a lot to like the fans disappointment is understandable though some of the hate has not only been disrespectful but vitriolic the last jedi is not as good as the original trilogy not even close or as the force awakens but it is better to me than the prequels    as said the disappointment is understandable and some of the problems fans had with it are also shared by me the last jedi would have been an even better film with less new characters with variable effectiveness and less subplots because while it was never dull it did feel at times too busy and bloated    this would have been solved with not having the rushed and pretty unnecessary romantic subplot which seemed more an excuse to introduce a new character and give an older character more depth and doing much more with the villains with the exception of ren the films most interesting character along with rey all are underwritten especially the missed opportunity that was snoke he looks good and andy serkis portrays him beautifully but he is criminally underused and even more wronged by a far too easy and anticlimactic defeat    can also understand the outrage at the rather onedimensional and out of character even with the selfdoubt torment and regret treatment of luke despite mark hamill objecting to this treatment it does not show in his nuanced performance that ranks among his best recent work as well as some of the humour some of it was forced and out of place in being placed randomly at less than appropriate times    however for all those faults there is also a lot to like about the last jedi it does have enough to satisfy the nostalgic while like the force awakens having its own identity while it certainly dazzles in spectacle and action the last jedi doesnt feel too big too noisy or too chaotic fans will disagree with this and thats fine at the expense of brains or heart of the characters rey and ren are especially well realised and it is their subplot that is particularly successful of the storytelling    for all its unevenness and reservations about it trying to do too much that it is a richer and more elaborate experience with a deeper and darker perspective on space fantasy allegory and the condition of humans and aliens than the previous star wars films was appreciated    visually the last jedi is a triumph it is gorgeously shot and designed and benefits with some very imaginative and energetic visual storytelling the special effects are a dazzling marvel john williams delivers yet another rousing score that has its own character but cleverly includes the wellknown iconic themes from the previous films    enough of the dialogue is thoughtprovoking and entertaining while reys journey rens conflict the scenes between rey and luke and the rey and ren subplot are handled very well the action is thrilling particularly the knockout final showdown    when it comes to the acting despite not liking their characters treatment there is no fault to be found with hamill and serkis as aforementioned daisy ridley gives another winning performance and is more comfortable this time round john boyega is charismatic and carrie fishers final performance has a nostalgic poignancy with ren being even more of a conflicted villain than in the force awakens adam driver brings more menace and conflicted edge    in summary good but not amazing 710 bethany cox
Apr 5 2022,positive,this is the best star wars film ever made rian johnson shows his deep knowledge and love of star wars in this masterpiece
Apr 3 2022,positive,the best looking film in the franchise without a doubt
Apr 3 2022,negative,this movie is really terrible everything about this sucks
Apr 3 2022,negative,amazing cinematography but the storytelling absolutely trashed the entire sequel trilogy
Apr 2 2022,positive,hurt by some mediocre cg and a sluggish second act this is still among the very best star wars movies its unfortunate that so much of the audience is afraid to be challenged and see their beloved characters grow mark hamill is phenomenal in this of course he isnt the same tattooine farm boy this is a luke with experience and the weight of his legend on his shoulders he subverts that legend while he lives up to it just fantastic
Apr 2 2022,negative,plot has loads of bugs  misuse  interpretation of the force  killing off luke unnecessarily  worst movie ive ever seen
Apr 1 2022,negative,embarassing just watch 16 and stop there
Apr 1 2022,negative,completely unnecessary deconstruction of luke skywalker by an infantile screenwriter why did disney leave the star wars franchise in the hands of star wars haters  go home purple hair lady
Mar 31 2022,positive,not focusing on the logic in the star wars universe enjoyable i guess
Mar 31 2022,negative,there are so many things wrong with this film its hard to put everything in a single post the list of things that the film did right cinematography thats it the scores in this movie are just rehashed versions from the ot nothing original the tone is all over the place  serious funny serious funny this movie has no consistent tone it doesnt know what it wants to be verisimilitude characters behaving consistently is none existent hux is a bumbling idiot finn goes through the same character arc poe is portrayed as an incompetent leader even though he makes the right call at every point holdo is portrayed as a brilliant leader when she is incompetent rose is a pointless character added in the middle of a trilogy leia is is now incompetent snoke is incompetent the only two characters that were consistent were rey and kylo and kylo is consistent because hes an indecisive character the middle of a trilogy is supposed a low point for the good guys especially for the protagonist except this is apparently a high point rey never suffers any actual loss she succeeds at everything she is trying to accomplish
Mar 29 2022,negative,this laughable mess of a movie was hated by actors writers and fans disney completely overlooked lucass vision and thats the result just a terrible film with fake political views a plot worthy of a 10yearold and a series of plot twists made for the sake of pulling off something unexpected not for actual good writing  not much else to say rip star wars
Mar 29 2022,neutral,rian johnson falls off story development and ignores key elements from the previous film that therefore creates a movie that makes no sense and lack of character of develop and not understanding of star wars
Mar 29 2022,negative,darth vader looks nothing like luke skywalker and princess leia and i guess thats the way its suppose to be ruining everything from the first trilogy which is the best shame on you disney trying to capitalize on the star wars saga i can only give this one a 12 star
Mar 26 2022,neutral,rian johnson is great with the visuals and a good director but he butchers the tone set ups characters and more frustrating to see all the artistic talent from the others put to waste aggghh just not the right project for him it needed a fan of the franchise to be the director
Mar 24 2022,negative,its a disrispect of lukes character meaning basically its killing what has made in the original trilogy destroys the arc of the original characters to try to lift the new ones doesnt add anything to the star wars universe
Mar 22 2022,positive,a showcase of the failures of our favorite heroines and heroesshowing these figures we look up to arent infallible the last jedi is beautifully shot masterfully written and a compelling film that i consider one of the best films from the last decade
Mar 21 2022,negative,most of the action in this movie isnt what i was expecting after watching the original and prequel trilogy what a waste of my time
Mar 16 2022,positive,star wars fans my left nut way to completely bomb a good movie all of you who gave this movie half a star can go fall in a hole and cuddle your captain kirk teddy bear 
Mar 16 2022,negative,pretty awful and disappointing on every level i dont recommend ep 7 8 or 9 i remember getting picked on for liking star wars in elementary  junior high and this movie brought back that same feeling but it was like the movie was intentionally picking on everyone watching it not one single character makes a single decision that amounts to a lick of sense
Mar 15 2022,negative,nothing is good writing sucks acting minimal characters are dumber than ever rip starwars  disney killed you
Mar 15 2022,negative,missed potential doesnt feel have the positive unique feel of star wars this movies vibe just feels like any other high budget scifi film
Mar 14 2022,negative,this movie is boring has a nonsensical plot and ruins the characters from the ot  it does look great but its all style over substance  congrats to the writers of this atrocity you ruined star wars  consider my expectations subverted  i cant believe critic review of this movie are in the 90 range how many of them are getting paid by disney
Mar 14 2022,negative,turned off after less than one hour a totally rotten embarrassing disaster compounded by professional critics getting bribed by disney to publish a torrent of fake reviews so pathetic that it discredited rotten tomatoes and famed movie reviewer peter travers of rolling stone  dont even bother with this one youre not missing anything
Mar 13 2022,negative,even worse than the force awakens it is a torture and a waste of time to watch movie
Mar 12 2022,negative,i dont have all the time to list what is wrong about this movie but it is as if a parent gave a kid a beautiful new car and the kid wrecked it just to see what a broken car looked like clearly rian johnson is not a star wars fan he took an epic story line with a cogent universe and destroyed everything he could with poor logic poe destroys a empire ship only to be demoted star wars needs a han solo shot first type character has kylo ren destory his helmet we all enjoyed in episode 7 luke skywalker who we waited a whole movie to see not only is a pathetic recluse his battle scene is slight of hand not skill fins plan to save the rebels is simply a cheap parlor trick that was given a considerable amount of time in the movie fin tries to be heroic and save the rebel base but is stopped by a onescene nobody when the general does so on the rebel ship the same heroic act then its actually ok but wait couldnt a drone have flown the ship for her and wait if the whole movie is a stupid chase scene in space with a lightspeed collision then why didnt the empire send any one of their ships to do the same perhaps rian johnson thinks we are stupid and just want to see explosions phasma does nothing snoke means nothing what is the point of this movie
Mar 9 2022,negative,terrible movie just the worst fire kathleen kennedy and never let the director near star wars again
Mar 9 2022,negative,this movie has a fundamental misunderstanding of luke skywalker as a character a lot of filler a lot of story that goes no where pass
Mar 7 2022,negative,characters are uninteresting fight scenes are lazy lukes character is completely ruined these movies should be retconned
Mar 7 2022,negative,really really crappy shit destroys every character on so many levels especially luke the story is idiotic no single decision is as a sane person would make in the film i dont know what happened to star wars still cant decide which is worseltj or fall of skywalker
Mar 6 2022,positive,the last jedi is one of the best star wars movies shockingly it has the best vizuals to a movie ever  my problem is the director rian johnson i like him as a director but not in this role
Mar 5 2022,neutral,the worst sw movie terrible script not sense at all
Mar 5 2022,negative,not just the worst star wars movie but one of the worst movies of all time 0 plot 0 continuity 0 character development it takes more than special effects and music to make a good movie
Mar 4 2022,negative,even if i was trying i would have never been able to do such a bad star wars movie rian johnsson should be ashamed cant believe studios are still letting him work    some great visual nothing more
Mar 3 2022,positive,the last jedi somehow is able to balance classic star wars with a uniqueness that changes star wars for the better
Mar 3 2022,negative,this is not it fam really disappointing and really screwed up the trilogy this is not luke skywalker still disney money gets really cool visuals
Mar 2 2022,negative,it felt all over the place as a stand alone film and alongside a trilogy film characters had a lot of potential but had such a basic set of dialogue the sci fi visuals were unnecessarily overexaggerated and felt like the film was spread thin trying to accommodate as many consumers as possible
Mar 2 2022,negative,the only thing i have to say star wars holiday special was better worst star wars movie ever
Mar 2 2022,negative,i hope rey palpatine gets eaten by ewoks after that acting the character rey palpatine has terrible character development because she never lifted a lightsaber in her life and somehow beat kylo ren kylo ren not to mention she somehow used force heal with no training which takes jedis a long time to master and in the next movie she some how used force lighting i dont think the directors of the movie actually put thought in to this movie im just praying right now that these sequels are just fan fictions because i cant deal with these terrible movies all the sequels are a 010 because they are all terrible not to mention how did ben solo even die he looked fully alive 5 seconds ago then literally had a heart attack or something im positive that ben solo died of some other unknown disease that instantly kills you than dying to palpatine that is all i just hope next movie it will be about pre prequels instead of this sad excuse for a movie for now i will be hoping that rey palpatine dies by ewoks and eaten alive or jar jar binks finds her keep in mind that jar jar binks is around 80 to 90 when the sequels are taking place and becomes the jedi he was destined to be and finished rey palpatine then he creates the new jedi temple and then created the jedi order
Mar 1 2022,positive,i will go down for the rest of time defending this movie because i think it truly tried to do some great things with the saga it also pulled out all the stoppers with the actor performances cinematography and a truly deep look at the force and the legacy of the jedi the themes it explores feel fresh to the series while still making sense i dont think its a perfect movie canto bight but i think it stands for me amongst some of my favorite star wars movies of the series
Mar 1 2022,positive,an exciting entry in the star wars franchise it takes risks and to me at least it pays off well
Feb 28 2022,negative,the last jedi is a meandering mess of a movie trying and failing to live up to past installments while adding something new the writing is all over the cast is a mess and the audiences intelligence is insulted at every turn the last jedi goes down as the worst star wars movie ever created an accolade i can only hope is not challenged in the future
Feb 28 2022,negative,worst movie in the star wars universe even george lucas and his wife who edited episode iv say this is terrible and doesnt hold true to canon this is what happens when a major corporation takes over and you can see all the boxes they tick off compare this to episodes iv  vi and its much more saccharine and pandering and not surprisingly very intolerant of nonmainstream views which is ironic as it has a group of rebels as its heroes jj abrams also said how hard it was to salvage the series after the complete mess rian johnson made
Feb 27 2022,negative,worst star wars movie nonsense plot bad characters and not even a real lightsaber fight
Feb 26 2022,neutral,this was marginally better than the force awakens it had good ideas but mediocre execution rian johnson had a better understanding of making a star wars film than jj abrams the musical score unsurprisingly was still good the effects are great but i still dont care about the story it feels derivative not from previous star wars films but uses the same tropes that other movies have used before however i really enjoyed the fight between kylo ren and luke skywalker it was properly executed and the one highlight of the entire film at least to me while marginally better than force awakens it still falls flat on its face and doesnt justify its existence
Feb 26 2022,positive,i know im in the minority but i think this is a beautiful movie that did some bold things and took star wars in a completely fresh direction from a completely fresh angle it has the perfect balance of epic nostalgic awesome moments new plot threads and beautiful character arcs unlike most people i actually love what they did with luke in this movie giving him a temporary disillusionment before completing his arc in the most luke skywalker jedi way possible in a decade people will look back on this and realise how awesome it was like revenge of the sith im calling it now
Feb 24 2022,positive,the sound came back as a proper character as every star wars movie should be cinematography and performances are excellent as well be prepared to meet someone special one time again patience you must have lol
Feb 24 2022,positive,film appreciated above all for the special effects we are talking about disney anyway the plot unfortunately lost me a bit for half the film an excellent performance by the whole cast with worthy combats and choreographies only because the scene of the attack by ren a little as usual recycled from the empire still strikes for the rest i liked it
Feb 22 2022,negative,the worst star wars movie ever and a very bad movie in general a lot of no sense scene a lot of sceen that ruins the sw atmosphere that accompanied us for decades and not to mention scenes like the battle of crait copy pasted from ep5 in a movie where the director pretend to be original and tries to subvrt expectaions every 3 minutes  i consider myself not a toxic sw fan but this movie disappointed me so much im very sad for nearly 99 of the decisions the director made lacking sensibility knowledge of the saga and msot of all talent  the sequel trilogy could have been better at leat we could have seen something new and improved after the copied from ep4 ep7 but with this movie rian jhonson decided to doom all new decision and as a consequence condemned ep 9 too  i hope disney learned a lesson with this disaster they are lucky people will eat anything with the sw logo on it but this will not change facts
Feb 21 2022,negative,after the mediocre and immediately forgettable the force awakens i watched this pile of h as a result i abandoned anything with the star wars in the title  i have no plans to watch the rise of skywalker after and i have not watched the original trilogy before this only the prequels i know i watched the ot recently tho  as a notadiehard star wars fan this movie made sure i never become one
Feb 19 2022,positive,some tough reviews on here but i liked it why its episode 8 they couldnt bring the viewer in with the same bag of old tricks on new faces eg episodes 12 we got depth to new engaging characters and even old ones that depth made us care critiques some of the lines were so poorly placed and timed that they ruined scenes at the crescendo eg fens helmet comment  what was that not a classic and certainly not rewatchable like 46 but it was a good flick
Feb 19 2022,positive,taking storylines into new area if it doesnt match up with 40 years of fanfic  folks overreact 
Feb 19 2022,negative,movie didnt really tie into the force awakens pointless side plots that didnt make sense
Feb 17 2022,negative,this move is a joke that butchers luke skywalker and his whole character by forgetting the hopeful and determined luke who never gave up no matter the difficulty of any situation and instead depicts him as an old and depressed man who drinks alien milk and gets his butt kicked by an untrained marry sue i just cannot stand this kind of stupidity
Feb 17 2022,negative,terrible just terrible disney and the directors of this movie dont have the courtesy to cater for its fans the only things that interests them is the box office profiting  the characters were just cringe and forgettable which is why itll never top the original trilogys
Feb 14 2022,negative,preexisting characters are unrecognisable and the new ones dont make sense the directors desperate mania of subverting expectations is on full display and its really a shame that this saga had to be collateral damage of his ego the previous movie was ok at best but this one derails everything in a way that cannot be fixed nothing about this can be redeemed whatsoever what a shame
Feb 13 2022,positive,im the shift away from the chosen bloodline was one i was grateful for
Feb 13 2022,negative,the director seems to think the bad reviews are from a toxic fan base or a dumb audience not able to appreciate his brilliance when in reality the movie just sucks  its just as bad now as when it came out in 2017
Feb 13 2022,negative,by far the worst star wars film of all time rian johnson took everything we love about star wars and its characters and sht all over it the only thing i did like about this one was the relationship between kilo and rey everything else was terrible
Feb 12 2022,negative,worst star wars e v e r give all the franchise rights to favreau and filoni they really know sw and actually care for its lore btw how tf are the critics giving this pile of crap a 91 i know why i never come here for movie reviews id rather stick to  the critical drinker than this crappy page
Feb 12 2022,negative,in simple words is a bad movie a bad bad movie for me thats noo luke skywalkerthe plot of that casino in space was out of place even this whole thing about the resistance ship stranded in space was filler but what hurt me the most was what they did with luke skywalker it was the worst and his death i would send mr johnson to prison for what he did to this saga
Feb 12 2022,positive,the best star wars movie in this new trilogy the natural evolution of luke skywalker and a good ending to the character
Feb 11 2022,negative,meh  a feeble attempt to save star wars after the last jedi fractured and destroyed the franchise  this one was better for sure not as much subverting expectations bs but bringing palpatine back felt extremely tropey contrived and unoriginal  this movie was pretty much jj abrams trying to repair one wing of a plane while both engines are on fire and the planes nosediving toward its inevitable destruction
Feb 10 2022,negative,while this movie came out a couple years ago and ive only seen it once until recently when i decided to rewatch it i am still immesurably disappointed  what an utter pathetic excuse of a movie i wasted several hours of my precious life watching this movie not one genuine star wars fan likes this film and if they do its because they jumped on the disney bandwagon when the series got a reboot probably the same people that jumped on the avater the last airbender bandwagon even though that show was out for years already anyways this film is utterly disappointing not sure who wrote this but even game of thrones season 8 had more structural world building and a modicum of character arching more than the last jedi   its predecessor was a cheap knock off of a new hope but at least allowed room for development that the director bulldozed over in this film how do you retcon so much material in the middle of a trilogy   when you pull up reviews for the last jedi it has a 91 on this site with 400ish critic revies yet holds an abismal 42 with over 100000 reviews from everyday people thats such a statistical difference   this movie destroyed the star wars saga not even disney just rian college student director trying to make star wars what it isnt   lastly is just a fun fact but in the us military you can put jedi on your dog tags as a religion thats how integrated into our society star wars is and rj took a big dump allllll over that legacy
Feb 9 2022,negative,ryan johnson and kathleen kennedy have no business being involved with sw this was not only the worst sw film that ive ever seen and by far its possibly the worst film that ive ever seen in my life these people are out of touch this film was abysmal wokeism ruins everything
Feb 8 2022,negative,no i am not a bot i am not review bombing i am under 30 and i was even younger when i saw this movie at the theaters so i dont think i fall into the old star wars fans that disney seems to be eager to insult im not even american and i dont reside in the us i am a lifetime star wars consumer and i think this movie was an insult i was literally disgusted when i came out of the movie theater the scene where luke milks that alien cow thing is what almost made me throw up i felt trolled and as much as i love bobf and mandalorian i dont think the saga can be healed from what this movie has caused
Feb 7 2022,negative,average movie at best and a very bad movie at worst it lacks subtlety and nuance which is okay if it can back it up with a good story good characters or fun scenarios but unfortunately the movie have none of those the plot is nonexistent the characters are flat and in many ways contradicts what the previous movies has established for those characters the scenarios are boring and when you actually think about them doesnt make much sense    all of this arent too egregious individually but all of them combined plus the films pompous and pretentious writing makes them hard to ignore
Feb 5 2022,negative,disaster of a movie waste of time to watch treats all its characters like idiots
Feb 5 2022,positive,not a stellar acting job and it got kind of got masked by special effects due to my tendency to watch scifi works  i have worked in the hightech industry and find myself gravitating towards gizmos doohickeys of all kinds  many effects or gizmos and gadgets that were poohpoohed in the past as utterly outrageous find them having been implemented or realized today
Feb 3 2022,negative,do you like poorly written scripts with characters that make terrible decisions that no sane person would make do you like awkwardly shoehorned social politics into a fictional scifi world do you like watching established events and history rendered irrelevant and ignored at every possible convenience do you hate star wars and dont care about any character or plot continuity then youll love this movie no seriously this film is awful and should be erased from our collective lives
Feb 3 2022,positive,the main problem is that the luke skywalker that we see in this film behaves differently than what the characters characteristics were although this change is motivated some behaviors really detach too much from the luke we knew for the rest the movie is really nice
Feb 1 2022,negative,not only was this a bad star wars movies it was just a terrible movie full stop
Feb 1 2022,negative,that was a slog to watch i swore i wouldnt do it but got dragged into it where is the story where is the character development at this point the force has no meaning and ray is pretty much a god who can do whateverso i guess thats the end of star wars and no more movies are going to come out since we have a jedigod     this could have been so much more but they had to take the easy way out while checking a bunch of boxes to fit the current trends just sad
Jan 31 2022,positive, im being generous by giving the 8th movie a 35   i think the producers could have done a lot more with the movie i believe that it wasnt a terrible movie but they could have done so much more with the story for a decadelong movie franchise    they threw out most of the character development along the way that genuinely would make it less attractive watching it all through in and out    seriously for a decadelong movie franchise its just not good enough
Jan 31 2022,negative,terrible ruins luke space battles the force and has a useless b plot characters that are so bad you think they are a spy an admiral acting like a child awful comedy an inconsistent kylo ren the only decent villain dying one of the worst fights in star wars and deep political messages that totally belong in a movie like this thanks rian 010 pretty much killed the franchise
Jan 30 2022,positive,the story arcs were great especially luke and poes arcs the rey and kylo connection was interesting there were some polarizing scenes however the film does not deserve the hate it gets
Jan 30 2022,positive,although the movie does have its flaws for example the cantobyte why being nearly useless to the movies plot further develops finns character luke skywalkers arc although controversial for many i disagree with those statements as this further develops the character in an interesting way while expanding on the ideas of the force some jokes land and some dont this movie doesnt deserve as much hate as it gets which is why i am giving five stars
Jan 30 2022,positive,i liked it brilliant duo kylo x rey very good intense third act
Jan 29 2022,negative,for a star wars movie it was really bad i just think it was a mess of a story that makes no sense whatsoever
Jan 29 2022,positive,my favourite star wars film to date the mistakes it made didnt bother me that much i was way more interested in the themes and character development nice fresh set of eyes on the franchise and everything star wars represented watch it with an open mind please
Jan 29 2022,negative,the only movie in the sequel trilogy that tried to be creative though not well thought out and executed countless flaws worst of them the inconsistency with the preestablished frameworkrules of the universe and characters thats not luke in addition those numerous cheap plot twists gotcha moments and jokes undermined emotional investment a lot moreover as an asian i hate what they did with rose when asians finally got a part in star wars we got a stereotypical role an unimportant subplot noncontributory to the main story an unreasonable final act stupid lines and a forced romance   i might give it 3 stars if it was an indie but 05 for a highbudget film
Jan 25 2022,negative,absolute waste of time ruining our heroes to prop up and make your new heroes look good is such a mishandling of the source material the characters are all forgettable and the plot makes no sense     the writing is boring and childish characters in leadership positions dont act like adults and are forced to be impish and smarmy just to keep the incoherent plot moving     stunning that this is where we are at with a beloved franchise
Jan 24 2022,positive,parts of it are really great but half of the movie is very boring even my dad fell asleep in the theather during the climax and we had to wake him up because he was snoring too loud probably the most controversial movie of this decade
Jan 23 2022,negative,this movie is a absolute insult to fans of the franchise it brings in new concepts that break the universe of star wars and it makes you question why didnt they just hyperspace into the death star killing of the main villain was a outrage its not good storytelling it may be surprising but that is temporary when you release the main villain is dead for no reason rey once again cannot be beaten and she is the biggest mary sue put to screen luke skywalker was ruined forever and roan johnson did a absolutely terrible job in making luke luke all rain johnson cares about is surprising you in stupid and dumb ways without thinking on how it impacts the story characters and fans the start of the movie is a joke starting with poe making fun of huxs mum and stalling him it was embarrassing dialogue luke throwing the lightsaber behind his back is the most hatred filling moment two years of wait to see how luke would react to the giving of his fathers lightsaber just got it to become a joke just like this movie the only original stuff in this movie is the outrageous universe breaking moments the entire movie is a boring chase and the use of fuel as a main contributor to the story is childish overall never watch this movie and no star wars nerd will like this movie it is terrible and the entire disney trilogy is laughably bad
Jan 22 2022,positive,i like how this film is full of new ideas and good storytelling  maybe just give us more jawdropping action next time  i think that the next trilogy is in good hands with director rian johnson  and i like rose tico
Jan 19 2022,negative,the worst movie in the series story was horrible character development was thrown out the window characters are not likable and boring and the directory really shows how much he cared for star wars by creating a mess and throwing away already established characters for a new generation that doesnt work
Jan 17 2022,negative,this movie starts off decently strong around the midway point finnrose escapades and hyperdrive suicide bombing the movie starts to fall apart save for poh laia and rey virtually all the characters potentials were wasted episode nine while flawed is the far better movie listen to the audiences on this one and episode nine
Jan 16 2022,positive,this movie is a little jarring it doesnt seem to know who its audience is trying to balance childish humor with dark backstories i for one still enjoyed the disneyfied visuals but its story is lacking the best characters in this one are not given sufficient screen time it does a good job of showing the heart behind the rebels though and i enjoyed seeing all the cameos of actors in any case it is still better than some star wars movies
Jan 14 2022,negative,minor spoilers ahead i didnt like luke skywalker in this movie like the first sequel it relied too much on nostalgia i did however like supreme leader snoke i didnt think they shouldve killed him off so soon
Jan 14 2022,negative,a new emperor a new vader who turned to the dark side due to poor training a new young person learning the force  why they could not come up with a new storyline  forget the bombers that drop bombs in zero gravity when every sifi story on forty years has fired torpedos or missiles i was so impressed with rogue one and i even liked solo but this  let down the whole franchise
Jan 10 2022,positive,the stuff with kylo rey and luke is pretty good even the dilemma with the fuel is intense i think its just the canto bight stuff that people despise
Jan 10 2022,negative,youd think by the 8th film in the franchise theyd pick a director and writers who know the franchise sadly not an exciting blockbuster on its own merit an intentional butchering of 40 years of storytelling in context
Jan 9 2022,negative,i dont think i can have a lower opinion of a movie this movie is a mess pushes the social justice message destroys previous character development of iconic characters of the original series and quite simply and blatantly seems to absolutely hate the universe it exists in     also note that writers for wikipedia are doing damage control for this movie to include both lying about both the critical and audience reviews while at the same time disparaging rotten tomatoes     let me repeat that information sites are trying to hide how terrible this movie was and how disgusted most people were about it they are literally suppressing facts and information about rian johnson and this star wars trilogy make your own conclusions about why since rian johnson is doing a new star wars trilogy apparently it seems disney has people actively working to repair its reputation instead of actually making good movies
Jan 7 2022,negative,doesnt do previous films any justice terrible film that is overly reliant on cgi and special effects to retain views with absolutely no plot line or meaningful character growth
Jan 6 2022,negative,i play a game where i sit down and watch this movie until it pisses me off i cant even make it five minutes before i have to turn it off and watch something else
Jan 5 2022,negative,cinematically beautiful and very different from any star wars movie but the bastardised luke sidelined finn and ignored almost everything that came before it so its a no from me 
Jan 4 2022,positive,a movie that people dont understand
Jan 2 2022,negative,terrible movie did its best to ruin both star wars in general and what jj abrams was going for in episode 7
Jan 2 2022,positive,there are some great ideas and there are some really bad ones but i like that it took risks and mixed things up
Jan 2 2022,positive,the last jedi stands best on its ability to truly take some new and exciting turns for the general formula of a star wars film and in its ability to make you feel connected to its characters unfortunately some of the particular narrative choices and writing feels a bit forced and undermines the project leaving a dull feeling of emptiness at the end
Jan 2 2022,negative,literally a copy and mix of episodes 4 and 5 luke at the end is the only reason i rated it this high
Jan 1 2022,negative,probably the up there with episode 1 as the worst star wars of the bunch really did a disservice to the characters of the universe as well as the fans of these films
Jan 1 2022,negative,least favorite of all the star wars movies
Dec 31 2021,negative,ugh crapped all over a good franchise  so much of what happens in the movie is completely pointless
Dec 31 2021,positive,the last jedi is the most mature grounded and misunderstood star wars movie to date this movie forgoes all of the trappings of conventional scifi and fantasy of lengthy but isolating exegesis of stories characters and histories that appeal to only the most hardcore of the fan base the last jedi seeks to appeal broadly to humanity overall in a more relatable and surprisingly refreshing way it speaks of living with the consequences of failure and missed expectations and not letting those mistakes define usthat we are who we choose to be not by legacy or privilege and learning to trust the wisdom of those more experienced than ourselves even when we dont understand the reasons i hope that the appreciation for this movie and the themes it promotes will grow over time with the fan base the last jedi went big and it went bold the only mistake is it may have made was in overestimating the viewers it was intended for
Dec 30 2021,negative,just never let the wrong people near star wars
Dec 29 2021,negative,in my top 5 worst movies of all time were the effects good yeah  but that is not why i fell in love with start wars it was the story  this movie tried to single handily undue all of the star wars universe to date
Dec 28 2021,positive,while not as bad as ep nine this film butchers so much of what was good about star wars but even then is not a bad film as much as it relies on nostalgia it is full of heart and worth a watch if you dont focus too much on its relation to the original trilogy
Dec 28 2021,negative,im not mad just disappointed did they actively want to destroy the franchise
Dec 27 2021,negative,not understandig or honoring the sagas rich legacy and adding stupid twists  a fans nightmare
Dec 25 2021,negative,a steaming pile of   the movie starts with a patheticly weak joke and only gets worse from there it almost manages to make solo seem watchable  just awful hopefully as low as this francise can ever get
Dec 25 2021,negative,this movie wasnt just a bad star wars movie it was a bad movie in general    the only thing that was good about it was the cinematography there were some amazingly shot parts of this movie but unless you want to watch moving art then this isnt worth it    i think the only reason it made money is because its predecessors were so good yes i include the prequels in this at least they followed the starwars formulae    in fact i think this movie was so bad it made it next to impossible to fix in the third movie     bad story premise   pointless battle sequences   nonsensical dialogue   odd character desicions   poor character growth   completely ignores preestablished starwars lore and character personalities   so many missed opportunities    this movie has now become my metric to judge all future movies well its not as bad as the last jedi or its almost as bad as the last jedi so far i havent gotten to that was as bad as the last jedi
Dec 24 2021,negative,i walked into this movie wanting and expecting to like it  anything star wars is usually great for me even its just middling because i get to relive some of what i used to love  the first day it opened i saw it in the theatre and i left confused which then grew to be annoyed then furious  this movie was so critically bad and so untrue to the spirit of the franchise that subsequent attempts to rewatch it to find something good about it have failed      i mean the entire thing starts out with some drama around some kind of gravity fed bombers in space introduces rose and holdo who are possibly the worst characters in star wars history aside from jar jar and take a completely unnecessary trip into an offplanet casino for no reason whatsoever as the plot doesnt pan out  the holdo maneuver is the final nail in this coffin as until it was retconned in 9 makes pretty much every movie in the series unnecessary  i just cant  i dislike everything about this film
Dec 24 2021,positive,the movies flaws are more noticeable on the second and third rewatch but enough bright points to make it a good film some fans of the original trilogy might not like it but it tries to go in a new direction would is nice from just doing a remake like that seen in the force awakens
Dec 24 2021,negative,missed opportunities and lack of buildup from the last movies storylines combined with completely ruining luke skywalker made me hate this movie
Dec 23 2021,negative,this movie is a slap in the face for every true star wars fan
Dec 23 2021,negative,was just very all over the place not a lot off good scenes and the ending bad
Dec 23 2021,negative,so bad i couldnt even finish it with the aid of alcohol  just awful  rey has no character arc  what they did to luke was inexcusable  it just gutted the reboot trilogy  there was obviously no communicationstory team for the trilogy and it shows  it was so bad i didnt even bother watching the next movie and havent gone back to watch the first one again  it literally killed star wars for me  they should retcon this out of existence and give luke skywalker the heros deathpassing of the torch yoda death that he deserves
Dec 22 2021,negative,the force awakens started a story that could have been built upon and expanded in tlj but instead johnson inexplicitly throws it out the window for forced social justice messaging and a degrading treatment of luke skywalker    the rose tico scenes should have been cut  other than making the film more diverse and giving finn something to do the whole half hour side quest adding nothing but bloat to an already bloated film      seriously most of the movie is about a slow moving space chase  stay away  this movie ruined any potential for the sequel trilogy
Dec 22 2021,negative,the director changed the star wars to be his own movie it is too bad
Dec 20 2021,negative,complete trash first movie i ever watched where i felt robbed leaving the theater
Dec 19 2021,negative,rian johnson should have never been allowed near the franchise right from the start with the cringe fest that occurs when poe and hux mock up some sort of red dwarf phone conversation in space utterly embarrassing and completely misses the mark for humour in star wars the rest of the film just caters for equal opportunities and diversity to ensure that the galaxy far far away doesnt exclude any race religion ir sexual orientation absolutely pathetic
Dec 19 2021,negative,somehow the best movie of the goofy trilogy    great scenery suprising plot twists of which some worked snoke and kylo ren and some didnt luke and hux  also mix some serious star wars law breaking issues into the movie and  yeah its still the best of the 3
Dec 19 2021,positive,this is the best star wars movie and im tired of pretending its not    it pushes the powerful message that anyone could be a hero whether youre a pilot of bomber who loves their sister a no one who was sold for drinking money or a slave boy longing for adventure even if some people dont realize it now its a message star wars desperately needed the franchise needs to grow beyond special bloodlines and nostalgia because if it doesnt it will die with the original star wars cast i want to see a future star wars universe that is much bigger than that where anyone even no ones could be heroes and every force power or battle format there ever will be hasnt already been seen in other words a universe where new and exciting stuff like force projection and light speeding a ship through a star destroyer could happen
Dec 17 2021,neutral,this was in many ways my favorite of the sequel trilogy i respect the fact that they tried to take the film in different directions than previous installments of the franchise however despite the good intentions the film did not sell me on the lead characters taking away from many moments that would have otherwise been impactful i think that if it had focused on developing these new leads instead of going on various side quests then i would have likely had a better experience i think it also repeated the mistake of the first film in this trilogy by taking away from much of what made legacy characters so special despite this this is without a doubt in my mind the most visually beautiful of the star wars films
Dec 16 2021,positive,this is the movie that made me care about star wars my favorite character was luke i thought he was boring before i grew up with the prequels and i completely forgot that they were connected to the original 3 now im an actual fan of all the skywalker saga the only thing that bothered me was captain holdo if she was trying to teach poe a lesson then she did a horrible job
Dec 14 2021,positive,quite possibly the best star wars movie since the original trilogy
Dec 14 2021,positive,its actually pretty decent id  definitely recommend it
Dec 13 2021,negative,out of the 3 sequels this one was undoubtedly my least favorite from a boring and somewhat unnecessary side plot with finn and rose to making finn seem irrelevant the entire movie there were very few things about this movie that we really good one definite highlight was the throne room scene with kylo and rey overall the last jedi was a drag to get through for the most part and wasnt very enjoyable as a star wars film
Dec 13 2021,negative,just watched it again and hasnt got any better this is by far the least thought out most poorly written and laziest out of all 9 movies from useless ww2 bombers in space light speed ramming and lazy choreographed fight scenes oh lets not forgot the laziness of who reys parents were to this writerdirector killing snoke was just dumb so much potential for a good upcoming story their with snoke but i guess that would have been to much work so just kill him off laziness again  anywho this was star wars should and could have been so much better after the force awakens this was a major disappointment and disappointment as fellow up to that movie and as a star wars movie in general
Dec 10 2021,negative,some of the most beautiful  damn near perfect shots in all of star wars in fact the yoda  luke scene is without a doubt one of my alltime favorite in the skywalker saga i cant even begin to list all of the problems  unfortunate mistakes that were made this movie along with ep 9 are the most infuriating  damaging installments both are completely disconnected from canon and the universe 40 years in the making rian and jj selfishly ignored what came before because they were only interested in making a movie that they wanted the utter lack of connection to the prequels is by far one of the biggest mistakes that they made and it was very clearly an intentional move on both their parts their disdain for the prequels has always been on full display
Dec 10 2021,negative,complete garbage bad story bad acting bad excuse for a star wars movie
Dec 9 2021,negative,as a star wars fan this feels like a completely different franchise turned john boyegas character into a joke that did not provide any actual comedic relief it was just hard to watch lazy writing and no continuity luke is basically the polar opposite of his former character and the values he represented no passion behind this project sad to see kathleen kennedy has to go
Dec 7 2021,negative,ruined some of the characters not enough new ideas
Dec 5 2021,positive,despite the negative reviews of the sequel trilogy id say this one was the best
Dec 3 2021,negative,absolutely awful complete trash even the prequels where meme worthy these films are just painful to watch
Dec 2 2021,negative,id give it zero stars if i could the prequels were not great films but at least they didnt blatantly contradict the whole story world they were meant to expand the last jedi is a perfect litmus test for a movie critic anyone who didnt hate it is thenceforth not worth reading
Nov 28 2021,positive,the best one of the sequels exactly because it dares to ignore the more dogmatictoxic fanbase and takes a risk by injecting some real palpable originality into star wars instead of being yet another destroythedeathstar clone of ep v  a new hope like ep vi  return of the jedi ep vii  the force awakens or being an absolute shitshow like ep viii rise of skywalker
Nov 26 2021,negative,went out of its way to destroy beloved characters only to replace them with nonentities has there ever been a character so devoid of personality as rey
Nov 25 2021,negative,absolute horse crap the fact that im angry enough to write this review years after it came out should give you a sense of my disappointment just in case the pointless subplots werent bad enough they made sure to butcher luke skywalkers character beyond recognition they betrayed the heart and meaning of star wars and they replaced character development and good story telling with stupid political messages and plot holes i wish i could get back both the money and the time that i spent to see that movie
Nov 25 2021,negative,as competent as this movie is on a technical level that cannot save it from bad writing nonsensical plot or unfaithfulness to its core narrative at the end of the day while defenders of this film hail its merits for diverging from previouslylaid star wars groundwork it is that precise deviation that causes it to fail as a star wars film it is irrelevant how good the movie would be if its title wasnt star wars because its title is star wars
Nov 24 2021,negative,the worst thing i have ever seen on the screen since dogville where i was violently ill its that bad makes zero sense
Nov 24 2021,negative,one thing sums up this movie  what the frig were they thinking at times that princess lea as mary poppins sequence should have won a razzie for worst sequence in a movie for the year the rest of the film is either lifeless goofy depressing or an attempt to make a mockery of its series fanbase this film proves you can only go so far away from what fans expect before you alienate most of them i was certainty one of them star wars at its lowest point
Nov 24 2021,negative,awful movie the criticisms have been covered ad nauseam but ill point out the most infuriating moment for me rose sabotaging finns heroic last charge which was followed by the cringiest lines ever dozens of people sacrifice their lives to stop the death ray thing and she makes their sacrifice meaningless great writing jfc
Nov 23 2021,positive,the last jedi reaches the depths of storytelling pathos and imagination that havent been tapped since the early 1980s all of the storytelling and technical elements fire on all cylinders as rian johnson takes old fans and new on a roller coaster ride of emotions which some may and will find unsettling he respectfully pays homage to the mythos and boldly expands on it to varying degrees of success
Nov 23 2021,negative,awful pack of inconsistencies bad writing and dull characters shame 
Nov 23 2021,positive,kylo and reys relationship are the best in the movie they should have expanded their scenes further the actors have great chemistry in this movie they honor the saga very well
Nov 22 2021,negative,until they made rise of skywalker this one was the one i hated most
Nov 21 2021,negative,for starters there where too many plot holes to count then this movie also broke the internal consistency of the star wars universe poorly written and poorly directed
Nov 21 2021,negative,i almost dont even want to call this one a star wars movie because it was written like the previous movies never existed but it is by far the worst movie with star wars in the title both the plot and characters make no sense in or out of the star wars universe
Nov 20 2021,negative,easily the worst star wars film to date the last jedi is bogged with a confusing story uninteresting new places and very dumb choices made throughout the film with very bland new locations and characters that are just horribly written the movie just fails in so many ways the cgi is good though and the throne room duel is honestly the saving grace of this film however due to the many dumb decisions and obvious filler subplots added into the movie it just ends up being a terrible film especially considering what the force awakens promised and set up
Nov 19 2021,negative,is this cinematically pretty to look at yep and i would expect as much from a disney film does this film play heavily on your memories and nostalgia of a cinematic masterpiece absolutely is this a hollywood blockbuster to entertain your kids and eat popcorn to most certainly     but beyond that this is just poorly made after finishing the film i had to wrack my brain for hours to try to understand what i witnessed and what it meant and ive come to the conclusion that it is simply confused masterfully confused it tries both to be everything at once and an intricately focustested action romp it tries to be a skit comedy an actionadventure a space opera a drama a romance and an action spectacle and it fails on almost all counts     at very least it was entertaining if you enjoy star wars youll see everything you want to see here there are xwings and blaster lasers there are jedi and lightsabers epic swordfights big explosions and more its quite fun if you dont take it seriously at all    but thats the inherent issue isnt it star wars isnt just some nonsense scifi romp its one of the biggest scifi epics in the entire genres history and the last jedi squandered that entire legacy for a few laughs and cheap thrills to the disappointment of assumedly everyone
Nov 19 2021,positive,in my opinion the best star wars movie since the old films  if not better  i dont get the hate from everyone an original plot great characters and the force is more thought through it has some lengths granted and the soundtrack is not the best it ever has been thus half a star less   overall a brave movie with great humor     unfortunately the executives got intimidated by the toxic fanbase and retconned most of the great creative decisions so we ended up with the fanpleasing mess that was rise of skywalker
Nov 17 2021,negative,would give a zero terrible ruined characters set horrible rules dragged on terrible writing and ended with nowhere to go overpowered rey just awful only decent thing were the shots but the writing was so awful and ruined previous set star wars rules
Nov 16 2021,negative,there are almost zero to like about this show it is truly shocking how hard they seemed to try to keep people from caring about this movie
Nov 15 2021,negative,i agree this is a good movie in every sense but an awful star wars film
Nov 14 2021,negative,there is a reason this franchise got rian johnsoned is now a phrase its a phrase for killing the past deconstructing old beloved characters having stupid plot twist for its own sake having no respect for the old fans at all pushing a political agenda and using a franchise to parading your own ego as a filmmaker what rian johnson did here  as a filmmaker not as a person is unforgivable many fans watched star wars in their youth when they had troubled times  they looked up to the characters  especially to luke skywalker its not only a shallow action figure  it was a symbol of goodness and hope the last jedi makes a bitter cynid old grump of luke  who cowardly nearly killed his defenseless nephew left his friends and family alone and dies off alone in the end yes rian you killed the past and subverted our expectations successfully  and damaged star wars beyond repair no thanks for that but at least you made history
Nov 11 2021,positive,i know a lot of people hate on this movie but i loved rian johnsons continuation from jj abrams the force awakens considering that they didnt quite know where this story was heading to i think johnson did a fantastic job the theme of failure being a lesson throughout the movie was really cool to see it wasnt just blasters and action and everybody wins it was much more layered than that luke being an irritable hermit to me was very fitting after what he went through and on top of this was the intricate budding relationship with rey and ben solo was great it showed them both of having flaws and i think thats needed in the star wars universe more both feel lost and hopeless and alone but they realize they have a connection this way is it a healthy relationship not at all but i like that it showed the grey of their personalities inside such and black and white universe also bringing back the puppet yoda made me tear up in nostalgia a great star wars movie with deeper layers and unexpected twists toward the end and as always the music scores of john williams is untouchable
Nov 11 2021,positive,a great twist to the saga and an amazing end to luke
Nov 10 2021,positive,great movie definitely one of the best star wars movies
Nov 10 2021,negative,the whole movie occurs like during a half a day time frame there was no real story and didnt do anything with the characters this officially ruined star wars for me unreal disappointed
Nov 9 2021,negative,while its attempts to be something different in the star wars universe are noble they arent executed wellbeing different and unexpected shouldnt have to mean ruining timeless characters and replacing them with mellowdramatic falselyinspiring statues like laura dern or kelly marie tran the script doesnt helpat every possible opportunity the story is forced to be some sort of swelling dramatic climaxstrange since it is hard to feel anything given how soulless it turns out to be good visuals and acting from adam driver but overall its a bit of a mess it seemed like it should have ended about six times before it did and its generally not a good homage to the stories before it
Nov 8 2021,negative,as a long time star wars fan it really is with a heavy heart that i say the last jedi is one of the worst films i have ever seen rian johnson is on record of saying the best films are ones that half the audience likes and the other half hates mission accomplished though id say it was 1090 likehate the films story had no cohesive structure it was more like multiple unrelated subplots hewn together like a kindergarten level collage the last jedi was a rian johnson troll job
Nov 8 2021,negative,enough said poor story line
Nov 7 2021,positive,this movie succeeds in entertainment and visuals and likable characters yes the movie at times comes across as cheesy and slowly paced but the movie is so entertaining that i dont care
Nov 7 2021,negative,13 a very good star wars film  23 a god awful star wars film
Nov 7 2021,negative,the worst film ive ever seen the story turns one of the most beloved heroes into a useless bum this movie doesnt even deserve half a star
Nov 6 2021,negative,worst violation of a franchise ever committed historians will one day look back on this and study the motivations of a director and company in the early 2000s for ruining the most beloved story of the late 20th century it is the equivalent of making a sequel for the iliad and turning achilles into a henpecked ninny that none of the other greeks want to play with a masterclass in the kind of bad storytelling that results from a director trying to appear sophisticated a masterclass in misunderstanding your audience so badly
Nov 6 2021,positive,terrific film although some of my thick friends struggled to understand it
Nov 6 2021,negative,a stagnant mess this movie broke my heart
Nov 6 2021,positive,its impressive to see such a longlived saga still being able to build so many classic moments and memorable twists the last jedi breaks everything we know as a trilogy and thats perfect you just have no ideia of what to expect because actually everything can happen at anytime and things really does happen director rian johnson knows what make a star wars movie and a great scifi epic setting the bars pretty high for this one visually technically and narratively not just making it a love letter for the real fans but putting it up there with the empire strikes back in a kind of surprising manner while also setting it apart from his older trilogy brother by the inventively corageous plot the gorgeous presentation and the mindblowing twists
Nov 5 2021,positive,breaking the star wars formula at least a bit tlj dares go in a different direction performances are passionate with mark hamill giving a careerbest rian johnson made the best looking stars movie ever but visuals cant save slowdowns in pace and awkward marvellike humor  which still dont heavily affect the excellent end product
Nov 5 2021,negative,star wars the last jedi feels like an empty shell there might be visual stunning fights and action nonetheless the characters feel so constructed we cant help but struggle to believe their actions the plot is nonexistent and as linear as it gets the villain has no motivation whatsoever therefore his maliciousness solely exists because there had to be a story told
Nov 3 2021,negative,oh what potential this movie had the end product is just boring and downright sad there is no concernable narrative thread from the force awakens to this movie nothing is built upon what was already done fins background is non existent giving the character very little depth the lack of world building is prevalent the most idealistic person in the galaxy was turned into a cynical and brooding hermit the fact that the true escape plan is kept from poe damaren is infuriating they kill off snoke and captain phasma before any arc can be established their main character is so utterly forgettable instead of exploring finns background they turn him into a bumbling idiot he could of been a scarred antihero with a dark past by attempting to subvert the viewers expectations the film makers subverted all the fun right out of the movie why did they hand the reigns over to ryan johnson why was lucas not consulted why did they not write 3 cohesive stories at once in order to make a better more immersive and entertaining trilogy why why why
Nov 2 2021,positive,im rewatching the newest trilogy and i still cant get over my desire to see the storylines in this movie through their continuation it would have been a much more interesting movie than the sequel we got i still think tlj is the most rewatchable of the new trilogy
Nov 2 2021,negative,destroyed the entire franchise bad characters bad politics bad movie
Oct 29 2021,negative,the characterization of luke skywalker in last jedi is so completely contrary to his character in return of the jedi that this story is terrible there is no justification for how he bent over backwards to save his father mass murderer but when his nephew has a few evil thoughts luke decides to just murder him also the holdo maneuver would have been more effective at the beginning of the chase thus saving the rest of the vessels of the resistance also where is the rest of the new republic military how were they all destroyed by the starkiller in the first film when the new republic theoretically spans most of the galaxy
Oct 29 2021,negative,this deserves an essay on bad writing there are many of those already to be fair check youtube its hard to ignore the palpable arrogance in the treatment of the broader source material and it only devolves to farce from there we should be able to get refunds for tickets purchased when movies are broken and as unserviceable as this one why it has such a high critics score is beyond me
Oct 28 2021,negative,i felt like i was watching a movie that someone directed that has never seen the original movies or if they had they didnt like those characters at all and decided to try to sabotage the whole series on purpose   its like taking on making a incredible hulk movie where the incredible is barely in it and is depressed the whole time and boring  its like saying im not making this movie for the fans  example im not making a marvel comic book movie for the fans and take the main character out of the characters own story
Oct 27 2021,negative,bad choreography poor writing and no overall point to the story its like they dont understand george lucas original vision
Oct 23 2021,negative,there was a lot that doesnt make sense the entire movie theyre running from the order losing ship after ship when they could have turned one around and kamikazed it to save all the others and still had a rebel fleet and army admiral holdo is literally one of the worst military strategists in the history of scifi with that massive blunder there was a lot bad with this movie but this was just rage inducing stupidity im seeing a large pattern with hollywood making big shiny movies that visually look good but have absolute garbage for scripts and this was just a shiny turd
Oct 23 2021,negative,this is an awful continuation of the star wars story there are an incredible amount of plotholes and an astonishing amount of inaccuracies and the worst character writing in cinema theres no way that this movie can be canon because of these    edit not to mention what they to lukes character my goodness im so sorry mark hamil
Oct 20 2021,negative,this is the moment star wars died
Oct 18 2021,positive,loved it great visuals
Oct 18 2021,negative,single greatest disappointment ive had in the star wars universe  not only did this movie undo the build up and character mysteries from its immediate predecessor it also undid all the overall plot and direction from the previous trilogy  it ends with hope  a dozen people left alive in the rebellion on an old tramp freighter  i think you guys lost
Oct 15 2021,negative,this makes attack of the clones looks like citzen kane
Oct 15 2021,negative,the worst star wars film ever made so many plot holes nonsense character moments destroyed the characters of luke and leia rey is a annoying mary sue finn is a janitor who can beat brienne of tarth with not explanation purple hair lady is probably the worst character rose had the worst line ive ever heard when she said now theyre free after the most pointless canto byte scene and wtf since when did light speed become a weapon should hv just done that to the two death stars in ep 46 i hate this movie so much it isnt canon to me and to most fans of the original trilogy
Oct 15 2021,negative,barely passable not horrible but not good either
Oct 13 2021,negative,worst star wars movie ever made i wish this wasnt canon the whole trilogy actually
Oct 13 2021,negative,another unmemorable try at recreating the first trilogy it is shocking how much money and potential was wasted on such an unoriginal boring and disrespectful to the original creator continuation to george lucas original six films the arrogance of disregarding lucas original plans and doing their own thing wich turned out badly planned and altogether uninspiring is striking
Oct 13 2021,negative,unfortunately it relies on lore so much i never really watched star wars completely before so this completely screwed me over when i watched it another thing that was a problem was the pacing issues because the movie can get boring sometimes however i liked the climax
Oct 5 2021,negative,this is the film that derailed the star wars franchise and might actually be one of the worst movies ive ever seen it is beyond corny they absolutely trashed the character of luke skywalker this movie is a huge middle finger to true star wars fans the prequels have never looked so good 010
Oct 3 2021,negative,awful wtf were they thinking
Sep 26 2021,positive,this movie is a little overrated with critics in my opinion but its much better than what fans give it credit for i understand the hate for this movie because i once hated it i was a lot more naive four years ago so i couldnt understand why luke would turn into a bitter man after all what ive seen and been through since this film was released i understand luke a lot better now if anything this concept was brilliant im still not a fan of him throwing his family lightsaber or carrie poppins though
Sep 25 2021,negative,this movie doesnt even deserve half a star rian  johnson was so concerned with subverting the audiences expectations that he never considered how his vision would gut the franchise of its integrity its popular to say but the character of luke skywalker is utterly defiled to the point where he is forced into an antagonistic position the brave hopeful inspirational master of the force created by george lucas is irreversibly twisted beyond recognition and reduced to a pitiful coward i am certain people on set argued with johnson about this awful decision including mark hamill who seems visibly disturbed by johnsons unfortunate understanding of the luke skywalker character disney understands that this movie is a turd and that its target audience predominately hates it for the above reasons if that isnt true then why was the promised rian johnson trilogy cancelled why did they rehire jj abrams to direct the next film and throw johnson back into the pasture too many horrendous errors to list here this is my one and only time i will ever view this film for the rest of my life
Sep 23 2021,positive,i know this film is polarizing i know that a lot of fans felt slighted when it released to me though this movie did it it recaptured star wars the irony of the main theme let the past die was a clear message to us fans fans that hold on dearly to these franchises to the warm nostalgia we feel when we hear williams longing score as luke looks over the suns of tatooine fans that have read books after books of evil generals of rogue squadrons of droids and play games based on the knights of yore  we can no longer be the gatekeepers of what makes good star wars no we are merely voyeurs in a vast cosmos along for the ride     star wars belongs to a new generation and though i walked away from this movie feeling like i did when i was 5 and my dad showed me empire strikes back on laserdisc it pales in comparison to how much joy this movie brings the next generation of fans something ive witnessed time and time again    its second core message that greatness can come from anywhere is one that the sequel loses with its split jedi family tree between the palpatines and skywalkers this movies message inspires and gives hope though i may be too old to have those dreams and whimsical feelings of doing great things i hope it gives kids those exact sentiments    be open minded with this film from the cinematography to its challenge of generally held star wars cliches to its absolutely gorgeous score particularly the spark this movie is awe inspiring though not perfect its worth a watch at the very least to see what all the controversy was about
Sep 23 2021,negative,by far the worst star wars film in the series the terrible dialog wasted character arcs misplaced  marvelstyle humour lorebreaking plot points and complete misunderstanding of the point of star wars had made for what goes beyond a selfparody and appears as though an insult to the franchise and its fans
Sep 23 2021,positive,star wars the last jedi stands out as a glimmer of originality in a movie trilogy just trying to copy its source material
Sep 18 2021,negative,worst star wars ever plothole story is generic force healing is just stupid
Sep 18 2021,positive,my favorite star wars film of all time it used to be empire but every time i watch this one it amazes me even more than in the first time when i already loved it deeply    failure is the main theme of the film for me and also learning from it we see  and listen to yoda saying  it in luke again very clearly in poe and finn as well as in rey who failed to bring ben to join them as she was so confident she would do    visually the film stunning and has some of the most beautiful scenes in the whole saga finally i dont even need to talk much about john williamss score which is fantastic as usual
Sep 14 2021,positive,it wasnt a good star wars movie but it neither was so bad as people say attack of the clones is even worse stop the hate 710
Sep 11 2021,negative,010 by far the worst star wars movie ever made
Sep 9 2021,negative,i have never seen a movie more cheesy ridiculous more stupid more disappointing than this movie right here
Sep 9 2021,positive,ambitious and competent this movie on its own merits is a complete success save for some rather poor use of this trilogys major characters such as finn and rose
Sep 9 2021,positive,this actually a really damn good film
Sep 8 2021,positive,underrated the finn side plot did absolutely nothing for the film which is worth knocking off a star and the idea that holdo would have withheld her plans from her senior officers seems implausible but despite that this is probably the second or third best star wars movie since the 80s solid plot and interesting themes outside the useless finnrose arc
Sep 8 2021,negative,poor writing abysmal character development and crippled the franchise any cinematographer or connoisseur of good movies will know that this is a bad film all the characters who had such amazing potential were dashed away avoid it like the plague everyone that i know just kind of wants these movies to be decannonized already
Sep 6 2021,negative,an incoherent story full of plot holes and silliness terrible character development the bad guys are still incompetent buffoons how did they take over the galaxy if theyre this incompetent and destroys the character of luke skywalker worst of all its not even particularly entertaining its not good if youre sitting in the audience just thinking about the silliness of it all and even the kids are unimpressed awful
Sep 6 2021,negative,this movie is so bad you need hours to explain all the mistakes and bad writing
Sep 5 2021,positive,a movie thats brave enough to try new and bold ideas that make this film stand out alongside some incredible action defiantly makes this one of the most controversial star wars films but in my opinion it is a fantastic addition to the franchise my only flaw is that although the events of the movie impact the finale the themes are not explored or picked up upon in the next film which makes it feel like a black sheep that stands out making it feel like the odd one out as a part of the sequel trilogy still a fantastic watch
Sep 5 2021,positive,star wars the last jedi has many many issues such as irrelevant plotlines obvious screenwriting problems stupid character decisions etcetera etcetera however i cant hate the movie its just okay
Sep 4 2021,neutral,this movie is so painfully average it hurts star wars the last jedi actually has some great ideas and themes but it struggles to maintain its greatness unfortunately the character development given to rey kylo ren and especially luke are all truly phenomenal and some of the best in the entire franchise the fight choreography in the throne room scene is extraordinary and the theme of failure being the greatest teacher is executed beautifully by showing that those who accept this philosophy end up succeeding by the end of the movie the entire segment on crait is actionpacked and thrilling the fight scene between luke skywalker and kylo ren is magnificent as it shows how luke isnt some warlord who pulls out his weapon at every opportunity but instead has learned from his mistakes and uses his words instead of his saber everything in this movie leads back to that theme of failure being the greatest teacher and its incredibly symbolic and majestic this is only a small part of the movie however the remaining bit follows finn poe and rose as they try to get the resistance to safety and boy howdy this is the exact opposite its boring uninspired doesnt add anything to the story and has the pacing of a snail the confrontation between finn and captain phasma couldve been a lot of fun but is way too short and shouldve had more dramatic weight behind it snoke gets murdered with no real consequences and the main characters forget about it almost immediately the new characters are given so little screen time that we barely get to know them and get attached to them holdo dj and rose all fall under the great idea poor execution umbrella they couldve been a great addition to the cast if they just made the movie a bit longer and gave them some more screen time all these facts explain why this movie is so divisive its the best star wars movie and the worst star wars movie at the same time it had a unique vision with a lot of merit to it but alas it never truly reached its full potential
Sep 4 2021,positive,i like the creative risk in this film  i like the artist style and the symbolism  i like the dynamic between kylo and rey  its daring and that needs to be seen in movies more  if only fans could accept these changes then we could have had a great ep 9 instead of a weird fanfic film  dont like the cassino scene
Sep 4 2021,negative,a movie that is a waste of time done by a director that didnt care about making a terrible abomination     the fights are piss poorly done and if you look them up even the stunt actors are ashamed     the story flows like it was written by a bunch of high school kids while they were smoking something bad an entire 40 minute arc is done for absolutely no reason other than to pass the time
Sep 3 2021,positive,the best star wars movie in years
Aug 30 2021,negative,hate it one of the worst movie about star wars i hope that i never see it again ever
Aug 28 2021,positive,star wars the last jedi b 81  there is some amazing cinematography here and i love the pacing of this movie the only problem is that some of the things they did to beloved characters did feel wrong and out of place when i first watched it i wasnt bothered to much but after i have sat on it and rise of skywalker has come out it feels very out of place i loved this movie when it came out but rise of skywalker kind of ours backspace on all that happens here the kylo and rey stuff is the best of the trilogy here though and the guard battle scene is so amazing
Aug 26 2021,positive,words cannot fully express how absolutely delightful this film is  every second that it is on your screen is a feast for the eyes  the use of color and lighting is just outstanding cinematography  the story fits perfectly within the context of the larger themes of legacy that run through the heart of star wars sequel trilogy yet at the same time is able to stand fully on its own  the performances of those within it bring life and meaning to their characters as they grapple with questions about who they are and want to be  its one of the few star wars movies that dares to be more and hits every note it needs to  by far one of the better entries in its galaxy if not the best
Aug 25 2021,positive,my favourite of the sequels and has really good graphics
Aug 25 2021,positive,im only giving it 3 stars because this is where the movie stopped comparing to the older ones for me i still liked it though
Aug 23 2021,negative,almost 4 years later and it is still the worst thing disney ever put out subverted our expectations by taking the most important movie in a trilogy and making it terrible
Aug 20 2021,negative,unfortunately as a fan of star wars this was merely passable the lack of character development and consistent themes was stunning
Aug 17 2021,positive,this movie is pretty bad and does not deserve to exist but the only reason why it has three stars is because the world building and lightsaber duels are gorgeous but the worst thing about the film is that they killed off luke skywalker in the worst way possible
Aug 10 2021,positive,the best star wars film since empire strikes back  a great arc for luke and further development of kylo ren a solid film with a ton of depth
Aug 9 2021,positive,the best movie in the franchise
Aug 8 2021,negative,this movie was so bad i wish they never would have made it
Aug 6 2021,negative,better than rise of skywalker
Aug 5 2021,negative,this movie even though enjoyable from my point of view cant get more than two stars as it is the biggest disrespect to one of the largest most revolutionary and one of the most beloved movie franchises and its legacy up to this date especially the treatment of lukes character being the main protagonist of the original trilogy is close to criminal  when seeing this movie as an actionscifi movie and not a star wars movie i would consider it still only slightly above average 3 stars because its plot is slow and mediocre containing some plot holes and questionable decisions the action overall is solid yet the most anticipated confrontations between certain characters were kept short for some odd reason what the movie does the best are the visuals and the frequent and good comedy that being sometimes made at the cost of character consistency
Aug 5 2021,negative,i came out of the midnight screening on opening night and texted my nephews that i think i hate a star wars movie  as a former prequels apologist and now someone who cant bare to look at them this shouldnt be new but i had so much hope for this new trilogy  no matter how many times i went to see it i couldnt warm to it  i appreciate the film is well made but my head and my gut are aligned to just not like what rian johnson did with the characters and story  by the end it leaves the series with no real direction sure there is now a handful of resistance left in one ship vs the first order but character arcs werent set up in the same way as done in previous trilogies    the resulting mess that was the final film goes to show how much this film led the trilogy off course  i could jump on board with some of the character decisions made particularly around luke but as a whole it doesnt convince me  the film essentially killed all my enthusiasm for star wars which ive loved since i was a kid
Aug 5 2021,negative,the 8th in the saga has some cool battles and scenes but story and unlikeable characters is what makes this film a flop
Aug 3 2021,negative,not good and what the hell
Aug 2 2021,positive,the last jedi provides the audience with thrilling battle scenes jawdropping visuals and cinematography incredible dialogue a great score fun moments and it is nostalgic to see luke skywalker again yet its also compelling to observe him in a darker light the film also lands some really emotional moments and some funny ones too however the finn and rose sub plot goes on longer then it should still the feature is a worthy installment in the star wars franchise 810
Aug 1 2021,negative,ruins the legacy of luke skywalker ruins the continuity of tfa an awful film 
Aug 1 2021,negative,i actually dont like most of my favourite movies when i first see them and its not until i let the movie really sink in and i really start to think about it that i begin to really love the movie  that having been said this is the first movie where i actually left the theatre really liking the movie i probably would have rated it around a 45 but the more i thought about it the more i hated it  as others have said the whole horse racing and bar thing was so painfully pointless i genuinely believe that without that whole mess this movie would have been insanely better i think that the movie really set up an intriguing end and it did leave me off wanting more but the journey there was rough  also why have a background character that no one really knows purple hair lady cant remember her name become so important and not someone more beloved like admiral ackbar
Jul 31 2021,negative,what a shame i wish i had never seen this movie i used to have such a respect for lucas and the star wars  universe he created  obviously movies are not written to appease every fan but at the sake of sounding cheesy and naive they should also not be made solely for the sake of making a buck  horrible writing horrible plot decent cinematography bringing back dead characters because the writers lacked the creative vision to do anything bold its funny to say but if you are a fan of star wars the best way to enjoy the saga is to stick to the original 3 films
Jul 30 2021,positive,it is an original creation by rian johnson and i respect him for trying something new but its just a meh movie for me
Jul 29 2021,negative,its crazy i used to think this was a pretty good movie it only gets worse the more you watch it the side plot with finn and rose was boring the pink haired admiral woman was frustrating and luke skywalker was plotforced to be out of character in regard to his motivation     luke was always the one with agency in past films why would he seclude himself to an island on a planet far far away    someone else made this point but i think its worth repeating if luke was so afraid of his nephew going evil then how is it that this fear is happening after he saw the good in his evil dark lord of a dad and never gave up his redemption he says the jedi should end over this luke did a 180 in terms of his character here
Jul 28 2021,positive,great movie because the way luke gets character growth on this star wars film is great becoming not a warrior but one with the force as yoda explains to luke in chapter v the empire strikes  the best star wars film
Jul 28 2021,negative,when a series as old and beloved as star wars releases a new movie it is an event of joy and celebration for its fan base for what its worth the parts are all hear to make a great star wars film it looks beautiful and with the performances given you really wish they were given parts you could actually love this movie gives you the characters you want but in doing so strips them of what made them endearing and loved for decades not in a way that benefits any other part of this franchise previously or going forward it takes all that was good and manipulates you with it until youre angered or dismayed as to how this could even get past its script and into shooting the last jedi comes across as a film whos creator forgot he was making a single part of a continual story and doomed the next instalment into damage control  it is a movie that wanted to challenge its audience but ultimately dares them to switch it off
Jul 28 2021,negative,there was so much wrong in this movie probably the worst thing about it was breaking the story line of star wars the force awakens which effectively broke the trilogy then this leia flying in space and somehow surviving luke turned out to be some lame hermit who became completely irrelevant too much political messaging where it is completely unnecessary star wars should first and foremost be an enjoyable experience this movie is however everything but that this combined with some disastrous dialogue set the stage for the unavoidable disaster that was to transpire in the rise of skywalker
Jul 26 2021,positive,absolutely loved it  rian took all the best parts of star wars and opened up a world of new possibilities for the future  looking forward to his new trilogy
Jul 26 2021,negative,finn and rose storyline is tokenistic bull they literally just decided to have another person of colour only to shorhorn her and finn into an entirely inconsequential plot line that makes the most childishly vapid political point ie poverty is bad mkay i have no issue with aiming for greater diversity in film but this was so badly done the only narrative purpose rose serves is to take time away from the already far too large group of main characters ensuring the neither she nor they get any meaningful development     too many terrible decisions to list in the movie but this has to be the cardinal sin for me
Jul 25 2021,negative,ridiculous violet hair admiral was beyond idiotic half the movie was useless main characters completely sidelined due to what    this movie should be put out of canon
Jul 25 2021,negative,luke wants to save his father  also luke wanted to kill his nephew
Jul 25 2021,negative,what ruin johnson did to star wars truly opened my eyes to the garbage hollywood puts out before i would just dismiss a bad movie and move on but this movie was so bad if youre a star wars fan that i actually looked up who wrote and directed it trying to find out who is responsible for this trash 30 years later after return of the jedi  luke skywalker goes from a jedi master full of hope to an old man hermit
Jul 25 2021,negative,this movie doesnt honor the legacy of the characters it actually does the opposite and alienates any fan that grew up with leia luke han and chewy in favor of a modern take of the sagaa saga that is about legacy a skywalker legacy
Jul 24 2021,negative,that was the start of the declive of star wars
Jul 24 2021,negative,tlj aka the franchise killer  it did not feel like star wars  i cannot add much to why this movie is really awful everything has been already written basically it did not feel like star wars this gigantic space opera possibly because of the boring story possibly because of shitting all over the legacy characters replacing them with dull unlikable new ones possibly because of shoving a political agenda down our throats possibly because it simply is not for people who grew up with the characters but for a younger audience since it is not for me any more personally i will not support this garbage with my money
Jul 24 2021,negative,i was a lifelong star wars fan until i watched this movie the plot was written by a kindergartener and the political messaging was completely over the top and cringeworthy after watching this movie i decided not to follow star wars anymore and definitely not recommending or showing sw to my kids thanks disney
Jul 24 2021,negative,absolutely no respect for the prior set lore and absolutely disrespects important character yes the movie has some beautiful scenes like the final battle but ryan johnson clearly never read a star wars book or just doesnt care for the lore or characters mediocre
Jul 24 2021,negative,please take this out of continuity
Jul 24 2021,negative,what is there left to say  it was like the intentional destruction of the original trilogy and luke skywalker
Jul 24 2021,negative,what is wrong with people  what could make you do this to star wars  seriously they just wanted to destroy everything we loved just to subvert our expectations learn to hire good writers first then learn to plan a story and finally enjoy the fact that you fd it up just to p off the fans
Jul 24 2021,negative,what a damned waste
Jul 24 2021,neutral,something that you can dont watch to dont feel bad
Jul 24 2021,negative,what did i just see i would say they disgraced luke skywalker but i think the disgrace is rian johnson
Jul 24 2021,negative,ive watched the star wars movies so many times that i couldnt count them if i wanted to however i would rather watch the ewok movies again and again than than sit through tlj again its that bad
Jul 24 2021,negative,terrible ruined lukes character from the original
Jul 24 2021,negative,favourite part was the credits
Jul 24 2021,negative,it doesnt matter what it is anymore as long as it is called star wars  rian johnson massacred luke and he knows it
Jul 24 2021,negative,the worst cinema experience in decades
Jul 24 2021,negative,this movie was pure doodoo  the entire plot is based on a space fleet running out of gas  glen larsons estate needs to sue because ruin johnson just copied the main plot point from battlestar galactica
Jul 23 2021,positive,not nearly as bad as most make it out to be  some great action scenes  lukes end scene is awesome and such a cool way to go out  but still could have used more out of him as the most popular star wars character of all time
Jul 23 2021,negative,a  movie with a decent bit of style that absolutely fails when it comes to substance
Jul 23 2021,positive,a real star wars movie
Jul 23 2021,negative,the film has good cinematography and cgi but more than that no the story is very bad scripted all the potential pieces tfa had left are thrown out the table and that affects very gravely the story and makes it feel wrong
Jul 18 2021,negative,its the cinematic antidote to the it gets better campaign  you think it cant possibly get any worse and yet every single time it does
Jul 18 2021,neutral,what else do we have to say about the last jedi is bad and a low blow for fans of the franchise and the trilogy that seemed to be on a good path to become the best it is bad that jj abrams had not returned for this sequel it the only good thing i get from the movie is the development of rey or semi development
Jul 17 2021,negative,disgusting bad terrible boring and destroys de character of luke skywalker to make place to rey as the new leader of the franchise horrible
Jul 11 2021,negative,the movie is visually very appealing but the world feels totally empty no reason for a franchise with 50 years of world building to feel this way the movie also destroys  established characters and throws off the plot of what would otherwise be a decent trilogy  if you dont want your starwars experience  tainted dont watch this movie
Jul 10 2021,negative,this movie broke the star wars universe along with a whole lot of other major gaffes the least of which was how badly luke skywalker was treated so dissapointed in disneys horrible attempts at star wars
Jul 9 2021,negative,the force awakens was a good start but the last jedi is an absolute mess did the director and writers even watch episode 7
Jul 8 2021,negative,this is what happens when disney makes a trilogy with no real plan or direction you get a director who is given free reign and directly contradicts parts of the first movie in the trilogy and destroys both the lore of the sw universe and a beloved character to subvert expectations
Jul 6 2021,negative,im so disappointed  could have been better and changed star wars fore ever  but went other way 
Jul 5 2021,negative,this movie had boring characters an uncreative dull plot and they killed off the one villain with any potential in the 3 new movies
Jul 5 2021,negative,i love star wars dont get me wrong however this movie is piping hot trash forget character development of any sorts lets just make some more stuff up lets make an awful version of the great ot the fans will eat that right up right right
Jul 4 2021,positive,much more depth to the story in this installmentfelt it lost something because of that thonevertheless still a good watch
Jul 4 2021,negative,dont think about it and its a mediocre sci fi action movie think about it and you might be diassapointed even angry seeing the distruction of beloved characters also they almost created an interesting villain but brought him down with the help of a a mary sue unengaging protagonist
Jul 3 2021,negative,i love star wars i watched prequels and original trilogy multiple times but i hate whole plot of sequel trilogy i hate how luke was showed and that rey is so op also there are few stupid things and even some politic im not racist but in previous films there were only white people and im saying second time im not racist but its obvious that its just because politic there are also much more things why i hate this film and whole sequel trilogy but this reviev would have 5k words so thats all dont watch that film
Jul 3 2021,negative,this shit was garbage and rian johnson ruined everything george lucas and co worked for
Jul 3 2021,positive,i love star wars 1 2 and 3 are bad and 4 5 6 are legend but 7 8 9 i thought were weird but 8 took my precious luke sky walker and turned him into a old man who is to scared to leave his small island also the entire movie rey tries to get him off the island and in the end he never does and dies in a bad way listen if your a star wars fan watch rogue one solo and the madalorian before watching these
Jul 2 2021,negative,first of all this movie was terrible it completely ruins luke skywalker as a character and ruins the lore and laws of the star wars universe its also quite boring especially in the casinolike part its quite a shame that disney took this direction in star wars as they set this sequel trilogy very well with the force awakens this movie pretty much ruined star wars at least for me and many others this movie made the sequel trilogy a mess and hopefully disney will learn to listen to the fans better
Jul 1 2021,positive,this movie was extremely disappointing the best part phasma and porgs thats it i was completely disappointed by lukes sudden and complete change in character that was horribly explained the luke that we came to know and love would not have done what he did this required way more explanation and unfortunately we never got it i do not find kylo ren a sympathetic character at all overall this movie left me feeling angry and incomplete
Jun 29 2021,negative,this movie was a masterpiece of failure it lacked any kind of cohesion with the previous movie to the point it appeared to be a deliberate sabotage of the trilogy    rian johnson should never be trusted with another film but unfortunately it is too late for this beloved franchise
Jun 29 2021,negative,worst star wars saga story ever for now     i could barely finish the movie disney shouldnt let this teamproducers who has involved with this movie to touch any of the marvelstar wars franchises again    watch mandalorian if you care and enjoy star wars but not this bollywood movie this is just using the star wars label for skimming your money
Jun 29 2021,negative,rotten tomatoes deleted my in depth review from back when this movie first came out so just gonna say cool movie but didnt do justice to they old characters had a long boring stalemate with the ships chasing each other and left no where for ep 9 to go therefore kinda sucked
Jun 27 2021,positive,while it isnt quite as amazing as the force awakens it still manages to be a very worthy and watchable sequel with daisy ridley and the rest of the cast doing marvelous jobs and containing another round of great special effects
Jun 24 2021,negative,how does this movie get 90 from the professional critics the whole movie is spent trying to make a lesson that there are no heroes that only a team can succeed i dont get it and i felt like i was being preached at throughout the movie then it goes on a strange expedition to try and show that the resistance isnt any better than the first order which honestly went nowhere i didnt get where rian johnson was trying to take the audience there in either of these lessons and there didnt seem to be any continuity of thought from the first of the trilogy the force awakens it was obvious when he took over that he dumped whatever plot direction that was planned for this movie and did his own thing      the first offense of these serious really is that rian johnson used it as a pulpit to preach to his audience there are no heroes we must do everything together the resistance is no difference from the first order see all the enslaved kids why are you holding up such lore about the jedi dont you know theres no meaning behind all these story lines these are the lessons that rian johnson attempts to preach to the audience and it became so tedious to watch the no heroes bit was so annoying not just because its a smack against the protagonists of star wars past but it truthfully felt like rian johnson was rebelling against a character portrayal in star wars films that really wasnt the case yes luke and han were the heroes in the first movie but that because they were the ones who were able to destroy the death star if this were a real battle then accolades they received at the end would have been considered a fair recompense in the empire strikes back the heroes were really just running for their lives right up to the end in return of the jedi yes luke was transcendent but it was their whole team that pulled off hans rescue and in the final conflict luke actually took no part and though han and leia were critical parts of the final showdown it was the entire rebellion that pulled off the victory yes though lando was the one who got to finally blow up the second death star it was clear that he had help    this movie has difficulty with trying to create an identity with an original storyline it starts off following the same plotting as empire just as the force awakens really is just a beat for beat repeat of the original star wars a new hope but it does make a valant attempt to vear off and do its own thing however though it does create multiple plot lines in the end the story is very uncompelling and exceedingly disjointed in its storytelling certainly it gets points for introducing some new concepts and ideas in the end it left me confused with where rian johnson was trying to take the theme and unsatisfied with what he was trying to push    the battle scenes are less than compelling the bomber scene doesnt make strategic or tactical sense in the same way that previous battle scenes in star wars  did it seemed to try to replicate a wwi or wwiii bomber attack which doesnt really work in outer space or in the context of a space conflict how do you drop bombs in outer space where theres no gravity on the one hand it is well understood that star wars has its own physics on the other hand the audience has be able to buy into each science fiction trope the only purposes of the bomber scene was to introduce one of the series more annoying characters rose tico and to give a black eye to poe dameron as a tactical commander thereby creating a conflict between him and vice admiral holdo the battle scene didnt give me a sense of why it was a bad idea as holdo implies as the tactics werent presented in a way that shows how it was wrong the explanation by holdo afterwards seemed as bureaucratic as holdo seemed     the battle on the first order ship seems more like a video game than a live action space battle as this movie continued the trend of star wars movies starting with the prequel trilogy of blurring the lines between live action movies and cartoons the final battle scene has serious spacing issues as you cant tell the scale and size of the imperial walkers compared to characters riding around on those weird speeders in this series its really hard to appreciate the scale and size of the really large in comparison with the really small or when individuals are very far apart verses being very nearby in fact it would seem that rian johnson also doesnt have a concept of when characters are close to each other or very far away as it seems like everybody can see each other as if they are right next to each other in the same room rather than being spaced many miles from each other when luke faces off against kylo ren again the scale doesnt make sense and though the idea of lukes new ability is tantalizing the final end is underwhelming the idea of everybody standing around to watch these two fight so the resistance escapes is so very spectatorial and how it ends for luke left me in a state of meh     the fuzzy line between a live action movie and a cartoon is best exemplified by the yoda scene the way that yoda performs a silly act of destruction leaves one with a sense of meaninglessness of the underlying tenants of the show in fact the entire way that the new series treats much of the force theory doesnt create any sense that it exists at all the series created the idea of a chosen one by calling for a prophecy of one who will combine the light side with the dark but a chosen one character should be somebody who is exceptional however this flick tries to create a sense of how unexceptional both luke and rey are theres nothing unique or special about them the show wants to bring them down so that theres no difference between them and the others it betrays the original idea of having a chosen one at all as was established in the very basic concept of star wars going back to the original series the point of the prequel trilogy was they thought anakin was the chosen one but he wasnt which led to empowering palpatine the original series propped luke up as the chosen one and though he started off as an ordinary kid what eventually distinguished him is his righteousness this righteousness is what won over darth vader this movie brings luke down as a broken man repeating the trope established in the empire strikes back and completing a series of story rehashing that this movie undertakes to hide their lack of an original story concept for this series the only originality of this final battle scene is that with luke they seemed to combined the broken down yoda from empire with the broken down ben kenobi from a new hope and interpreted them in a broken down luke but its hardly original or creative it seems like something that a high school drama student would have come up with this movie makes it seem like luke made no use of the obvious resources he had at his disposal at the end of the return of the jedi that is he could communicate with the dead yoda and kenobi it would seem as if anybody who has that ability would make better choices but rather rian johnson decided to make luke a lesser person     and as a chosen one rian johnson did his level headed best to seem that there was nothing special about rey she was just an ordinary girl who happened to fall into a weird place in the rey and kylo scene its obvious rian johnson is trying to show how creative he is by repeating the return of the jedi emperor luke and vader scene with a different outcome but its really not the creative because its obvious what hes trying to do but at this point in the movie all the characters motivations dont seem to mean much because its clear that certain things have to happen to keep the action going theres a lot a plot hole at this point in the movie that it seems like this flick was on autopilot and wasnt checking the boxes kylo ren doesnt seem like the kind of villain that is capable of leading such a massive organization as the first order between his bouts of adolescent temper childish pouting and a serious lack of charismatic leadership it doesnt seem likely that hed be able to perform such a corporate takeover     and the plot holes are so big that you could drive a truck through how does dj know this incredibly important detail of information at the end that he really shouldnt have privy to his character was such a cliché working in the background and seeming to have omniscient clairvoyant connections and insight from the moment we met him we were just waiting for him to betray the heroes     theres a lot of cheesyness to the movie particularly when leia does a mary poppins active and comes back to life after a brief trip in the vacuum of space the special effects werent even that good it feels like the effects were done in the 1980s and this is a plot hole as well because there was never an indication before that she was strong in the force though she shouldve been considering the lore of the movie and if she was that strong why in the world would she never have manifested it before and always played the second fiddle as a character it doesnt make sense    the entire casino planet trip seems to be a completely pointless distraction from the main action in fact there seems to be a lot about this movie that seems like a pointless distraction from the theme if there is even one it tries to confuse the audience by focusing on the injustice of the resistance but never goes anywhere with that line of thinking and leaves us in the audience scratching our heads     much of the movie like the entire series seems awfully juvenile in comparison with the other series with the exception of a phantom menace the characters seems a trite bit childish the jokes seem less thought out and not so witty and instead of original snips by r2d2 and c3po we get rehashed nostalgia or force feed humor thats out of place is there at least one charismatic character in this new series thats probably what dooms vice admiral holdo is that shes such an uncharismatic character or the actress is such an uncharismatic actor im not sure which is the worse offender and in a vain attempt of fanservicing the bring back captain phasma not because she has some important function in the story no rather simply to stick it into finns face it was a cheap and juvenile stunt that really doesnt add anything to the overall narrative it felt like something that the wwe would do on ultimate smackdown the whole battle scene that followed felt like it was straight out of ultimate smackdown     snoke seemed like such a letdown the built him up identically as the emperor was built up in the original trilogy again in a not so original way and trying to recapture the nostalgia of the original trilogy and then they dropped him in a way to make it seem like he really wasnt nothing at all it was clear rian johnson was trying to be original and creative but it really just made it seem like the first order thing was nothing at all ya know it seems like a lot of things in this series was like nothing at all like getting on and off first order ships and rescuing people from first order captivity this seems to happen so often that it really becomes clear that the first order are amateurs with really bad security bringing down that ship by having the resistance ship jump into it thought i have to admit it was certain creative and something that science fiction shows really do miss about the idea of being able to jump like that in the end it left me with another sense of the first order as nothing at all    and i can drone on with further issues but i think you get the idea though rian johnson desperately aspires to heights of originality it really is just a mash up of ideas and attempts at being cutting edge but it truly is lacking it lacks a clear theme it lacks continuity from the previous series it lacks any concept of scale and size it lacks any sense of charisma it tries to reuse and rehash previously used tropes and plot points it doesnt create a visually pleasing live action movie that can be clearly discerned from being a cartoon and many of the effects seem cheap and cheesy i would expect better from a premium science fiction property
Jun 23 2021,negative,spoilers spoilers spoilers  where to start  the film totally ruins luke skywalker for one even having him almost kill his nephew a totally out of character move  the finnrose subplot makes no sense why cant del toro be the codebreaker the didnt find the codebreaker and for some reason happen to bump into him and he can break the code as well wtf just make him the codebreaker rose emphasizes mission above all else then almost ruins the mission by running her ship into finns ship should have killed them both but they were unscathed  besides finn sacrificing himself for the good of the group would have been a perfect ending for his arc  captai phasma is made to be useless once again and the ship blows up killing everyone but the good guys  instead of autopilot or a drone which would make sense laura dern has to run a ship into the destroyer to win the day after she basically keeps this secret throughout the whole movie for no reason whatsoever  reys parents were said to be nobodies totally changed in tros and shes a mary sue in this one  leia flies through space  the film is one long ship chase and makes no sense  the casino planet message of rich people hurting the poor is really nice coming from disney which is a large corporation  also saving the animals and leaving the workers behind was really a nice touch sarcasm  lastly snoke is wasted here should have carried over to the next film but rian had kylo destroy him in a really stupid scene  one of the worst films ive ever seen
Jun 21 2021,negative,can i give it less than half a star
Jun 20 2021,negative,the last jedi is an objectively bad movie it lacks both consistency and continuity with the rest of the star wars universe its damage to the franchise is so severe that it may never recover im convinced that in years to come this film will be seen as a learning lesson to all in the industry
Jun 20 2021,negative,the critics that gave this thing a positive review should be ashamed of themselves nonsensical characters that make illogical decisions no coherent plot and worst of all it defames and degrades well established characters from better movies not to mention it derailed the sequel trilogy certified fresh lmfao
Jun 19 2021,neutral,the 8th installment in the skywalker saga is a messy follow up to abrams previous film feeling mostly like a tug of war between the two directors over the direction of the franchise which in turn loses the films identity the strengths of the film lies within the visual spectacle and acting once again but also with the originality of the story that attempts to distance themselves from the rehashes that the previous film did with its script  however the script is clunky with its shutting down of abrams ideas in favor of johnsons concept with choices that are nonsensical at times dialogue is also hit or miss sometimes with a focus on comedy in times of drama that feels out of place editing is also lazy at times especially with the notorious red room fight scene  510
Jun 17 2021,negative,opical its great but characters plot fitting in the unisverse is horrible
Jun 16 2021,positive,the movie that made luke skywalker interesting this movie has some of the best things star wars has ever done but at the same time there is some bad choices but overall a great star wars movie that is a nice change of pace and did the best possible thing with luke skywalker
Jun 16 2021,positive,other than the casino stuff i liked it but you could see the not planning of the trilogy start to show with this film
Jun 14 2021,negative,its beautiful as it should be with a mountain of money and the house of mouse behind it but it is not only disrespectful to the lore established characters and the fans worst of all it is directly disrespectful towards the other movies in the trilogy not only that but its not even a good movie if it werent star wars and were just a stand alone film ahh yes a 2 hour space car chase that feels like its happening at 5 mph with ill timed humor and uninspired characters on meaningless side quests because they have nothing to do in the actual film    dont waste your time watch empire strikes back and pretend this film ever existed youll be happier if you do
Jun 13 2021,negative,worst movie ever hateful toward the original characters completely disloyal to star wars themes and philosophy treats luke abysmally the people who made this foul abomination clearly despise star wars fans
Jun 13 2021,positive,the film is absolutely precious and flawless
Jun 12 2021,neutral,frustration the movie theres a lot of good in here but also so many underwhelming and aggravating moments its impossible not to be annoyed
Jun 10 2021,negative,terrible mess of a movie not sure why the writers and the director decided to ruin a star wars movie this way the story doesnt make sense all characters behave illogically and it has nothing that used to make star wars great to be fair the special effects and action are pretty good so not a complete loss but close
Jun 6 2021,negative,terrible plot and dialog no development characters that had zero impact on the story this just the worse star wars product ever made and next to the holiday special thats saying a whole lot rian slaughtered the franchise with this movie
Jun 4 2021,positive,as someone who has gone through life and faced its ups and down  i reckon moviegoers who were offended with lukes storyline should be open to the messages of this movie an event that causes great disappointment in life will likely rock the core of someones deep inner being great people in life have not evaded this luke skywalkers character included    perhaps reviewers who gave it a low rating  may change their mind when they themselves encounter a great disappointing event in their life especially when they have been betrayed or betrayed themselves   may the force be with you and see you through difficult times
Jun 1 2021,positive,the best of the sequels because it dared to introduce a different angle than the one expected by the crybabies i mean fans
May 31 2021,positive,this was the best movie of the sequels and prequels and 2nd best in the franchise after empire strikes back tied with rogue one i know this is an unpopular opinion but as a film lover i appreciate what rian johnson did with this movie i truly wish ros didnt just retcon everything and ignore the storylines introduced in this movie
May 31 2021,negative,trash no story or character development no respect for characters from the original series just makes them older 2d caricatures of themselves i thought towards the end that the film was going to redeem itself finn sacrificing himself was a bold direction it was true character development and a very brave decision from disney to allow it to happen i had literal goosebumps and then he was stopped by rose crashing into him at full speed to save him giving some nonsensical explanation there is nothing new or exciting here despite whatthe critics or the director might say it was utterly predictable disappointing and directly copying ideas from the films that came before it
May 30 2021,negative,gave a childish tone to one of the best sagas of all times tried to turn star wars into marvel
May 29 2021,negative,the last jedi was a tremendous letdown after a great opening to the trilogy with the force awakens finn was looking to be a great character but was completely discarded in favor of rey the force awakens left a lot of questions that the last jedi either did not answer or did so in the worst way possible snoke had great potential but was tossed aside for no reason the throne room fight was the worst lightsaber fight in history even if the effects were better due to previous ones the best parts are adam drivers acting and the duel between luke and ben the repercussions for luke after the battle was completely heartbreaking and unnecessary making this a disappointment for the star wars community
May 27 2021,negative,to me this movie was a pain to watch even when i was at the cinema hopping the next scene was the last ryan johnson neither know his target audience nor the product he was handling and this movie really sour the star wars experience for me it took all those years for me to even try to watch a star wars related product in the mandalorian for me to start appreciating the galaxy far far away once again all because of the bad taste this movie left and now of the new of johnson directing the new star wars movies means that ill remain with the small screen stories that are by far better handled than that train wreck of a movie
May 27 2021,positive,second best in the whole saga johnson had balls to expand the universe and give us the most interesting story in sequel trilogy amazing shots good plot twist and amazing dialogue its a love letter to star wars film ruined by toxic fans and their fanatical activity on the internet but i am sure that it is the only one that will pass the test of time and will become legendary in a decade or so
May 27 2021,negative,this is the film that broke star wars   i dont know how to properly express how much this movie actually ruins nearly everything about star wars    the kamikaze scene breaks the in universe science of hyperdrive  having luke the jedi who helped redeem darth vader attempt to murder or even briefly consider his own nephew breaks his character  having leia survive in space with no jedi training breaks her  holdos plan breaks logical consistency   having finn relegated to a nothing in regards to the plot just because china doesnt approve of the color of his skin is racist af  there is so much broken that this has movie has broken my excitement for anything new disney will be putting out for star wars  ive already skipped ros solo and the new shows      ill be bummed but i can go back and enjoy my old movies you cant break those
May 25 2021,negative,the bad guys werent scary or threatening the good guys were pathetic the good gals were bad leaders the environments were a reheated version of empire strikes back and the battle scenes made no sense all in all a bad movie
May 25 2021,negative,seemed to be written by a people who wasnt aloud to read the script of the first film  simply the wrong shaped jigsaw piece for the puzzle
May 20 2021,positive,a very underappreciated movie that set up a lot of potential ideas for the series that were never carried over to the next entry to everyone who review bombed this movie youre wrong thank you rian johnson for taking risks and staying true to canon i was amazed when i learned how much you consulted from george lucas
May 17 2021,negative,these movies just disrespect the fans of star wars and the characters we grew up loving like luke skywalker why does disney want to alienate the very people they want to watch these movies and buy merchandise luke would lever do what you have made him do in this move the mandalorian seems to be the only star wars release since rogue one that respects our beloved characters
May 17 2021,negative,you would almost have to be purposely trying to destroy the franchise to make a movie this bad
May 16 2021,negative,the way they destroyed lukes character was horrific probably the worst star wars movie to date but they are still making more 
May 16 2021,negative,worst star wars movie of all time
May 15 2021,positive,rian johnsons changes to certain characters and story beats range from excellent to illogical but the last jedi proves an alright star wars film with plenty of inspired action and fine work from its dedicated cast
May 14 2021,negative,worst star wars movie by a huge margin
May 14 2021,negative,the worst star wars filmperiod i will say that i love how it evokes debate and draws lines between fans it does seem to contrast between young and old progressive and traditionalist adam driver is a fine actor but an awful villain when he isnt a raging maniac he is a slobbering crybaby daisy ridley and john boyega seem bored with the film and its treatment of luke skywalker is criminal after a second viewing i may never watch it again
May 14 2021,positive,way too underrated i enjoyed a star wars movie that went in a different direction like the humor was great at first i did seem gypped that there was no actual lightsaber battle but the praetorian guard battle definitely made up for that it was a more fun star wars movie from all the rest and characters didnt argue as much as they did in the previous films in conclusion it outdoes the whole skywalker saga
May 12 2021,negative,terrible movie they could not even make lukes hand look good special effects not impressed at all the ending was really predictable and the story contradictory a sad ending for luke this movie should have never happened
May 11 2021,negative,disgrace to the star wars franchise even worse than rise of skywalker which is the only impressive thing about this
May 11 2021,positive,loved this film  rj honors luke leia and the ot favorites while developing the stories of a new generation of heroes
May 9 2021,negative,in my opinion this was a slight improvement on the force awakens however it seems that the audience does not agree as they rated the last jedi way lower than the force awakens i felt the opposite i was so disappointed in tfa that it could only get better from there at least tlj had an original storyline the force awakens was basically the same storyline as episode 4 which is why i rated it so low i still do not like daisy ridley john boyega and especially adam driver as kylo ren i am not sure who was in charge of casting but adam driver looks nothing like harrison ford or carrie fisher plus adam driver looks and talks like a nerd not a super villain and because they chose these three actors for all three episodes it really was a big disappointment i was also extremely disappointed in the fight choreography like i say in all of my reviews movies and tv shows who use hand to hand combat should hire whoever choreographed into the badlands or warrior because those two shows have some of the best hand to hand combat scenes on television or movies
May 8 2021,negative,this movie is suppose to be a sequel to star wars the force awakens and the original trilogy however it seems as if all the ideas for the trilogy was scrapped when they made this movie not only does the movie feel out of place but it also feels like a complete mess with little to no logic it even goes so far to completely ignore the already existing rules of star wars when making a sequel to a franchise you can add new things and create interesting stories but dont literaly change the laws of physics in the same franchise that is a great way to ruin already existing movies the only interesting character to me in this movie is kylo ren everyone else feels like a missed oppurtunity or an already finished character with no room for character development    overall this is a visually stunning movie with terrible writing and a plot with little to no logic if youre not a star wars fan who would like to see a visually cool scififantasy movie then this movie is for you however if you happen to like star wars and enjoy good writing with an interesting plot then this is one of the worst movies i can think of
May 6 2021,negative,the film is an absolute mess and makes no sense the characters are so unlikeable skip this trash
May 6 2021,negative,betrays lukes character has massive plotholes shitty plotlines like canto bight terrible caharacters undermines finn and poes characters
May 5 2021,positive,92510 rian johnson as writerdirector was the right choice for a franchise that has long struggled with taking risks the last jedi is the most creative and unstar wars like film you could hope to see but is all the better for it johnson introduces a level of gravity to the saga by deviating from franchise formula where the good guys beat the odds save the day and are relatively unscathed and instead explores the folly of heroic recklessness no victory achieved by the heroes is anything less than pyrrhic the characters fly by the seat of their pants as they often do in the star wars universe but suffer grave  and fatal  consequences as their spontaneous rogue plans fall apart the true heroes of this film are the characters who remain calm and steady who realize the costs of slapdash foolishness and know when the time is right to make sacrifices in this way rian johnson has weaved together a cautionary tale one that brings the franchise to a darker more mature and necessary place despite this and other radical departures from the star wars formula johnson is able to retain the fun humorous visually dazzling spirit instilled by his predecessors mark hamills return as luke skywalker was a highlight in terms of his acting  hilarious grizzled and yet tortured  and of character development in fact johnson nearly matches the screenplay for the empire strikes back in advancing interesting character arcs reys training is reminiscent of what luke faced in his youth but carries a heavier emotional burden poe and finn spend the film learning what true heroism is and what crossing the line into hubris can bring to bear adam driver as kylo ren may be the most consistently engrossing performer and character as he is constantly facing internal battles that manifest in rage but with desperation fear and longing percolating under the surface this is the most beautiful star wars film to date weve come to expect great special effects from the franchise but the cinematography has reached a high point for the series offering homages to previous installments while seeking to leave its own distinct mark the scene with storys ultimate sacrifice is breathtaking its stark beauty serving to brilliantly reflect the greatness of the sacrifice that bore it additionally the air and light saber battles are among the best in the series expertly choreographed and framed the last jedi is everything you could hope for in a star wars flick ironically by throwing many of the characteristics we most identify with this franchise out the window johnson derailed the franchise from the safe albeit entertaining tracks jj abrams intended ultimately setting it on a course for daring and depth that star wars hasnt charted in decades its a shame that star wars fans are so toxic  they may very well cause studio executives to shift the course back and perhaps rob us of an incredible finally only time will tell
May 5 2021,negative,it is overall a very bad movie massive plot holes and betrays the legacy of luke
May 5 2021,positive,a really beautiful looking film which frustratingly wastes a lot of potential and all the momentum created by the previous film there are many bold choices here but also far more ideas which fall flat before being able to make the hyperspace jump 6510
May 5 2021,negative,absolutely horrible movie tragic what theyve done to star wars
May 4 2021,negative,i dont know how a room full of people decided that destroying the legacy of luke skywalker was the way to keep fans into the star wars universe  big mistake
May 4 2021,positive,i love all star wars so this review might be a little bias but its still a must see
May 4 2021,negative,still fails to capture the magic that george lucas brought to the screen in the begning and the film strugles to find a consistent tone likeable plot and by the end the film makes a joke of the film with its clihe ending that has little inpack with its charactors completly unfoucsed and unlikeableness
May 3 2021,negative,a tremendous let down of a film that had the potential to redeem a story the world had given up on the new star wars trilogy is full of plot holes and inconsistencies but even if youre going to watch this strictly for the action youre making a mistake horrible film
May 3 2021,positive,it was nice  visually stunning
May 1 2021,negative,star wars the last jedi im mad i feel disappointed and mad and sad and everything else i did not like this at all but here it begins it starts off and we once again watching a droid making a hugely important move to save the moment the first battles are looking awesome and the special effects are great kylo ren feels the bad decisions from the last movie and snoke is making him small for losing a battle against someone that didnt freaking touch a lightsaber beforeim still mad he kills one of the best characters and then loses against a complete newbieargh we look at rey and luke and what are we seeing luke as a completely selfish asshole which annoys the hell out of me the next scene just made me shake my head kylo has the chance to destroy a large number of rebellions he hesitates for no reason he killed his father without any hesitation and here he is like a 9yearold child that does not have any idea how to make an important decision which kills so much of his character but someone did actually shoot the ship and heeey here we go every rebellion onboard is flying through space but well here we go leia saves herself which looked awful in the movie and was super unrealistic a little cute scene i actually liked was when chewie was sad and he was not being over the death of han we get introduced to another character and oh boy why did we rose within the first couple scenes for whatever reason she already achieves to annoy the hell out of me lukes training sessions with rey are really good and entertaining while rey is training to manage her powers we see finn and rose looking for the codecracker what an incredibly boring story here prison escape afterward was over dragged unfunny but at least original i guess the telepathic moments between kylo and rey are one of the few highlights of the movie then again we have an awful scene we see like 200x reys in front of a mirror searching and screaming for her parents awful lets stay with reys character for a second her development is so bad she has heard and seen what the evil side can do to the people and somehow she is still listening to what kylo told her and stays in contact with him yoda what did they make out of you i loved him in the previous movies but what is he doing here he literally laughing out luke yoda is one of the serious characters and in such an important moment he laughshorrible what would you do when your side is in a war and its not looking good for you at all right lets battle each other so smart the writing in this movie is lazy from another star even though it was quite obvious i liked kylo finally having a standout moment by turning against snoke and killing him it was freaking stupid that the reddus flying into the bridge destroys every good scene at that moment and of course she is flying into it right before they are executing finn and rose lazy poes relationship with bb8 is cute and a good callback to luke and r2d2 all battles are looking awesome especially those within the sky now to one of the dumbest scenes in this movie rose flying into finn who is about to sacrifice himself how selfish stupid and shit must a character be wow i was almost screaming at this character at this moment this whole luke is getting shot but he is never there once again making kylo look like a complete moron at this point they dont even care about his character the finish is okay but at this point i was already too mad to really enjoy it to close out with some positives the vfx is awesome adam driver alone is owning the kylo ren character even though his character is being written like it was written from monkeys laura dern is playing also very very well
May 1 2021,negative,i cant believe how deep this trilogy and especially this great franchise fell with this installment sometimes i feel that the new trilogy to argue new stories in the star wars universe should never have existed it is an installment that contradicts everything before made from the original prequels and the previous one again being a remake of the originals as was episode v
May 1 2021,negative,putting up a strong fight against attack of the clones to be the worst film in the franchise the only decent part of this entire movie is the royal guard fight this film was made buy a director whos only care was putting his big crappy stamp on the star wars franchise by doing everything he could to make the most unstar wars film possible even ignoring how much this movie seems to hate its own franchise its still a flat out horrible film it is absolutely disgusting how highly rated this trash heap is by critics and new star wars fans if all you want is a movie thats nothing like star wars then watch something other than star wars
Apr 30 2021,positive,wow if you want a little bit of the original star wars franchise with a touch of the modern effects this is your movie amazing music thrilling scenes a edgeofyourseat storyline and emotional acting make this a real nod to the past
Apr 29 2021,positive,dragged in too many places and assassinated luke skywalkers character
Apr 29 2021,negative,i appreciate the attempt to explore deeper themes in a star wars picture but these themes were not explored very well
Apr 28 2021,negative,subverts expectations poorly rewrites characters and changes the star wars laws to the point that its hard to believe its part of the same saga
Apr 27 2021,negative,enjoyed the beautiful scenery and captures but incredibly unrealistic events in the star wars universe like a whole fleet getting destroyed by a kamikaze ship seriously and the humor was just not funny at all star wars was initially serious in its story telling way to ruin it
Apr 26 2021,negative,the movie was a mess theres about 45 minutes on a side planet thats a waste of time the infamous leia scene was a laughing stock and there was only about 2 good scenes in the movie only worth 1 watch through if youre a star wars fan
Apr 25 2021,neutral,its not great but at least watchable it is by far the best movie in the sequel trilogy
Apr 25 2021,negative,  the film is a great disappointment as a star wars film it lacks nearly all the elements that mark the franchise its self indulgent and twisted many characters and pushed them in directions that seem counter to their traits
Apr 25 2021,negative,doesnt capture spirit of the original trilogy and fails to do anything original in its own story
Apr 24 2021,neutral,i havent watched this movie in quite a while so it isnt as detailed  the movie isnt great for the average star wars fan lots of expectation subversion luke s arc is decent and couldve used so much more they couldve built up so much more in snoke with answers to fan theories and then killed him i appreciate the expectation subversion but there was a lot of disrespect and disregard for the fandom finn is so fucking underused and so is rose finn doesnt need to see any more horrors of war hes been in a war poe needs an actual arc hes kind of learns a bad lesson this is because the portrayal of feminism is kind of bad in this movie and feels unnatural poe learns to what exactly trust women like even if they dont trust you and dont tell you anything like its not a very good lesson its a pretty ok movie but needs so much more to appease both star wars and casual movie fans i think its overrhated by star wars fans who i think are just doing some herd behaviour    510
Apr 23 2021,positive,in my opinion this was the star wars movie that the trilogy needed 
Apr 23 2021,negative,what a beautiful way to break star wars cannon
Apr 23 2021,negative,the script was apparently written by an overmedicated 13 year old girl with a goddess complex the dialogue is stilted forced and hyperbolic the direction is representative of the infantile kitsch disney specializes in the acting is atrocious the millennium falcon has more personality than daisy ridley i was just old enough to remember seeing return of the jedi in theaters as a child sad to see luke and the jedi come to such a miserable pointless and ultimately demeaning end in order to serve a deranged and hysterical narrative for me this literally was the last jedi disney has killed them all and not just the men
Apr 23 2021,positive,stylistically perfect johnson added depth to the characters while adding humor in just the right places i cant wait for his trilogy
Apr 22 2021,positive,a lit bit of a let down compare to the force awakens but still a very enjoyable movie with an intresting story  this movie could and should be 30 minutes shorter just because one storyline that didnt add something new or intresting to the story
Apr 21 2021,negative,such a bad star wars movie that i have yet to see rise of skywalker no desire to ever watch it and almost stopped being a star wars fan altogether    ive been a fan since the early 90s so while the disney purchase of star wars stung when they announced the expanded universe of stories and characters were no longer cannon i still enjoyed the rebels tv series faithful and respectful to the classic trilogy and rogue one the best star wars disney movie to date i was not a fan of the force awakens but it did introduce a lot of potential for the storylines which were all then aimless pointless or nullifiedignored in the last jedi    for some reason the folks at disney thought it wise to not just write off many of the classic trilogy characters but decided the way to do it was to kill them and disrespect some before their death  very sad and i am not alone in thinking this nearly ruined the sw universe    thank goodness for filoni favreau and the mandalorian for saving star wars
Apr 21 2021,positive,the last jedi is a film the challenges the ideas and philosophy behind all previous star wars films it is well executed and look beautiful the deconstruction of the hero that is luke skywalker is compelling and refreshing some may say that this film in not loyal to the star wars franchise and i both agree and disagree this gilm captures the heart and tone of the franchise while still bring a new and innovative tone to it
Apr 18 2021,negative,reys character arc is weak and the purple haired commander is just the worst uninspiring
Apr 17 2021,negative,i am a sw fan from the beginning and totally hate the decisions made in the movie it is visually stunning but this only glosses over both logical errors and gigantic plot holes that were explained in the ratings here to the thousands so i wont get into that    but i can give you an impression of the value of this movie by quoting a radio station which overwhelmingly praised it the last jedi has done a big service to the franchise by introducing the color red no further questions
Apr 17 2021,negative,literal crap ruined the whole feel of star wars even hamill himself said disappointed but not surprised
Apr 17 2021,negative,terrible breaks the laws of its own universe 100 shit flick
Apr 15 2021,positive,deserves better than the audience is giving well made and nice and intense like a scifi film should be
Apr 14 2021,negative,worst star wars movie ever spaceballs did a better job as a sequel than this
Apr 13 2021,negative,mediocretopoor story and writing just absolutely riddled with gaping obvious plot holes the creators sacrifice a credible villain in favor of lackluster comedy nonsensical character decisions and plot lines massively detract from the films adequate acting and excellent special effects    watchable but far from enjoyable one of those movies you leave when its over feeling i cant quite place my finger on it yet but that that wasnt very good
Apr 13 2021,negative,everything about this movie is alredy kcommon knowledge  just no
Apr 11 2021,negative,i only went out  saw this in theaters because half the reviews when it came out were positive its been the last new star wars movie ive paid to see having killed any enthusiasm i had for the franchise as a whole for a star wars movie this just isnt any good some people praised it for subverting expectations but what youre really getting here is a bunch of fakeouts to cover for the fact that its really just a bad remake of empire strikes back in a looser way than the force awakens was a remake of the original star wars from 1977 these new directors are making it up as they go along which to be fair george lucas did too back in the day but theres no excuse not to improve upon his past failures is there the best part of the movie is the jokey way that luke skywalker brushes off rey and mocks her but it feels more like it belongs in a comic book or a late night comedy skit than an official star wars episode if there werent already seven other star wars movies before this one i might have judged it less harshly looking back many are to blame not least of which is rian johnson the director but also jj abrams who made the previous installment kathleen kennedy who hired these guys and george lucas for selling his franchise to these white slavers his words at disney many have tried to blame the films artistic failure on the fans but a work if art is created for a purpose and if that purpose was to upset its target audience then i guess it succeeded nothing more this movie will not have any staying power except perhaps as a counterpoint to some future worse product the disney sequel trilogy has been very polarizing but i could have done without the whole thing you can still make money off of star wars fans without antagonizing them with subpar new episodes youre a multibillion dollar company you figure it out this is also a series that has tarnished the faith many of us once had in the integrity of the rt ratings but thats another story for another time
Apr 11 2021,negative,this movie fucking sucks all the plot twists are unpredictable in the worst way possible its so stupid that you would not even think of such a dumb way for them to do a plot twist thats how incredibly childish the writing is they also managed to ruin old and beloved characters whilst simultaneously ruining the new ones in the process if you like star wars do me a favor and dont watch this
Apr 10 2021,negative,the worst star warsmovie ever if it still could be called star wars for me the skywalkersaga just consists of the original trilogy and the prequels even though episode 1 a phantom menace was not that good to put in nice words but not that crappy try of disney to make money by exploiting the star wars the real fans love i mean can u name just one planet that appears in this movie which also previously appeared in the first six movies no because there is none
Apr 10 2021,negative,ill never forget the day i watched this movie in the theater when i saw luke throw hisanakins lightsaber over his shoulder i remember i chuckled not even a few seconds later i realized just how wrong and out of character that was thats basically how the movie begins and it only gets worse from there anyways im going to start out with some positives this movie is absolutely beautiful to look at the cinematography in this movie alone is probably the best out of all the other star wars movies i enjoyed rey and kylos relationship in this movie and i feel like the potential was through the roof there were also a few amazing scenes sprinkled throughout like lukes reunion with r2 yoda and leia now that thats out of the way lets get real behind the pretty facade is an atrociously bad movie that takes a massive dump on the once nearperfect franchise known as star wars the whole plot line on canto bight is a complete cringe fest that is actually painful to sit through rose and holdo are some of the worst characters ive ever witnessed the purple haired feminist admiral doesnt explain her plan to her subordinates for no apparent reason and then proceeds to kamikaze singlehandedly destroying one of the most basic principles of this fictional universe her suicidal hyperspace maneuver is such a blatant plot hole that makes zero sense furthermore this movie is riddled with jokes that are so unfunny it hurts theres an actual mom joke said in the first five minutes once interesting characters like snoke phasma and hux are either killed off to subvert expectations or turned into a complete joke the only character that was going to sacrifice themselves which made sense was finn however instead of ending his character arc on a high note rian johnson decides to have rose save him last minute tell him one of the cheesiest lines in the history of cinema and then in the end give him a kiss i literally laughed out loud at that scene this time around so congrats rian you added a an actual funny joke in the movie this movie is such a slap in the face to the fans that it makes my blood boil we couldve had so much more but instead we have this steaming pile of garbage ive gotten used to the idea of luke being a depressed secluded old man but i feel like the execution for it couldve been way better i can never be 100 on board with the idea that hed even for a split second think of killing his nephew when he couldnt kill his own father if he saw the light in anakin he shouldve seen the light in ben also the final thing that i will mention is that the throne room scene with rey and kylo had the potential to be one of the best moments in star wars if rey wouldve joined kylo it wouldve been such an amazing plot twist instead its a bait and switch and that feels like such a wasted opportunity honestly we shouldve just listened to luke when he tried to warned us that this is not going to go the way you think what a waste
Apr 10 2021,positive,my personal favorite out of the new star wars movies however this film does not push the franchise the visuals are amazing and twists on the story i like however being the middle movie it needs to hype the audience up for the final film so were waiting for the final film in the star wars universe this movie delivers very flat on this the pacing in this movie is very up and down and makes the film drag however it is a good film to watch and i find some what enjoyable its just a shame its linked to this franchise as it doesnt push it any further and doesnt get my excited for the next one more risks or plot twists should have happened
Apr 10 2021,negative,want a movie that absolutely destroys quality characters that were painstakingly written in exchange for corporate carbon copied characters this is a great movie for you
Apr 8 2021,negative,the last jedi successfully balances destroying the beloved characters of a once loved franchise whilst also dooming the new trilogy with poor decisions no characterdevelopment and an awful plot
Apr 7 2021,negative,was this supposed to be a serious sequel or a joke how many times in a movie can you try to fake out the watcher before it just gets stupid
Apr 6 2021,negative,ruins characters from the star wars that came before it ruins potentially amazing characters and gives us boring plot lines not to mention that throne room scene was one of the worst choreographed fights in all of star wars gutted by how this film turned to be
Apr 6 2021,negative,ruined the franchise
Apr 5 2021,negative,visually its very attractive however it rises to the lowest bar of storytelling and character fidelity ever seen in a major film franchise the force awakens was a lazy rehash of ep iv this was unbelievably dreadful on almost every level
Apr 4 2021,positive,this is easily the best star wars movie it gives the characters the outstanding development that the other movies have lacked so far it was so refreshing to see luke make a mistake and have to learn from it for once finn got actual character growth and a story that didnt revolve on rey and rey alone we saw him go from a deserter to a man willing to die for the resistance rose is a beautiful character that adds a level of humanity to the core group who all come from such extreme situations she brings a level of humility and honesty to the cast as a lowlevel resistance member whos less in the heat of things and is used to focusing on the individuals and their sacrifices in the rebellion thankfully this movie finally breaks the tired habits of george lucas and the previous archetypes and tropes of the others like respect to george bc we wouldnt have star wars without him but its rian johnsons work with kylo ren  ben solo making rey powerful without the weight of male legacy unfortunately jj ruined that and bringing humanity into lukes character that set this movie miles and miles ahead of the other films in the franchise rian johnson is a genius and i cannot wait for his trilogy
Apr 4 2021,negative,everything about this movie was either trash or a soulless remake of a good part from empire strikes back the only star wars movie i have come out of the theater of being disappointed
Apr 4 2021,negative,its true he subverted our expectations because no one couldve expected something this bad    lukes entire arc as a character is ignored just so he can be torn down they shouldve listened to mark hamill
Apr 3 2021,negative,absolute utter garbage made to confuse and disappoint the entire star wars fan base leaving ripples and damage to the franchise to even this day tarnishing the brands good name and lowering the overall quality of the series as a whole would have rated no stars if an option
Apr 1 2021,positive,i was talking to my friend emily the other day about how we both loved the last jedi and we didnt understand the hate my friend is so smart and obviously knows everything about star wars and she explained it so well it was different than any other star wars movie in both tone character and story the force awakens was good but it didnt try to do too much or was too risky i think the last jedi was a refreshing change to the franchise i think the fact that rey doesnt have special parents at least at this point was good because it really showed how she had to struggle and learn to be a good jedi rather than just being born talented i like how the good guys fail because it shows that they are not perfect and what they are up against is truly a powerful force over all great movie
Apr 1 2021,negative,this was trash  it destroyed years of lore and disrespected  everything george lucas built it  made luke from a hero to a scared shell of a man
Apr 1 2021,negative,sweet jesus this movie was absolutely horrible kathleen kennedy spit in george lucas face with what she turned luke into i have absolutely nothing positive to say about this movie not one single thing
Mar 31 2021,negative,so much wrong with this film just a few that have probably been discussed many many times  no explanation of reys parentage or mastery of the force no explanation of snoke just kill him off nevermind  leia flying through space luke tries to kill kylo because he sensed darkness in him  he turned darth vader for gods sake after just a couple of force conversations rey puts herself in a pod and delivers herself to kylo and snoke she sensed good in him ya sure  they find the master code breaker but just end up going with some random guy they bump into in a jail cell no use of captain phasma a short fight and kill her off nevermind holdos refusal to tell anyone her plan making nearly everyone lose hope and resulting in poes mutiny holdos hyperspace maneuver that somehow has never been tried before it occurred to no one to try that with the death star
Mar 31 2021,negative,id rather have explosive diarrhea than watch this the movie is nothing more than a monument to rian johnsons ego    while the visual effects and cinematography were quite exceptional the scattered and irrational plot stole the spotlight and we were left looking at the ugly thing rian johnson and his cohort call a star wars movie    the desecration of lukes character the misuse of a potentially great villain snoke and the wasted character development of rey and finn all culminates into a fiasco of a film which became the inadvertent nail in the coffin of disneys sequel trilogy
Mar 30 2021,negative,i dont know if there was a thing in this movie that i liked overall i rather dislike what they did with luke fin poe leia ackbar and rey for reference thats almost all the main characters rian johnson clearly had a very different idea from jay jay abrams about what he wanted to have in his star wars film and it really didnt mesh well with the previous film not to mention how blatantly bad some of the things in film were on the positive side john williams was fantastic for the soundtrack
Mar 29 2021,negative,this is what you call an absolute disaster as a star wars fan i am disgusted
Mar 29 2021,negative,id give it no stars if i could    terrible terrible film  and dull  and boring  how can a star wars film be boring    the casino planet sequences make watching paint dry interesting    characters that are built up in the first of the trilogy are randomly dispatched here    the humour is shockingly bad and misplaced    its as if rian johnson purposely wrote everybody into a corner at the end to make it impossible for the next director to carry on    shockingly bad film
Mar 29 2021,negative,worst movie i have ever watched hands down i went to see it with a group of friends when it came out in 2017 we all left the theatre disgusted i was once a die hard star wars fanatic and now i can care less about this franchise
Mar 29 2021,positive,a very good movie and a sequel to this third trilogy with a very good plot perfect special effects with actors who continue to surprise in their careers by showing it in this movie very good
Mar 29 2021,negative,utterly disrespectful to the source material completely stupid and poorly acted the first truly terrible star wars film
Mar 29 2021,negative,terrible felt physically sick when leaving the cinema and cant watch it now rian johnson ruined star wars and this film utterly derailed any plot with endless subversion of expectations
Mar 28 2021,positive,this film gives you all the warm fuzzies that you get from star wars movies and more its wondefully shot the story is amazing the actors performances are perfection  like this film is literally perfect
Mar 27 2021,negative,a two hour and thirty two minutes bruh momment
Mar 27 2021,negative,sucks destroyed star wars suck it lucasfilm make a better movie without politics and maybe youll bring us backin the theater seats of another movie as far as im concerned you dont know what a good movie owls if it hit you in the butt
Mar 26 2021,negative,mediocre movie bad star wars movie
Mar 26 2021,negative,worst star wars movie ever made wtf were they smoking
Mar 25 2021,positive,the best of the sequel movies with one of the greatest displays of force use in the whole saga in the battle between luke and kylo ren and people who complain about lukes behavior in the beginning of the movie seem to forget how yoda was introduced to us in empire strikes back
Mar 25 2021,negative,the visuals are really good but the movie is an insult to luke skywalkers character and the story is weak
Mar 24 2021,positive,man i wanted to like this movie more then i did but funny enough i did really like this movie when i left the cinema but then i focused on the of how the characters were done  luke skywalker was really badly done in this movie which upsets me because he was amazing in the original trilogy and of course he wouldve helped rey the things that saved the last jedi was the relationship between rey and kylo they had really good drama between each other and shockingly enough i liked them in rise of skywalker
Mar 24 2021,negative,disney doesnt want the fans that came with star wars so ill go wonder what the impact to goodwill was on the balance sheet after the last jedi    this is not a star wars movie that is not luke skywalker
Mar 24 2021,neutral,was not that great it ruined one of my favorite characters and left me with more questions than i started with that werent even answered in the next film  if you have nothing to watch watch this but otherwise watch something else
Mar 23 2021,negative,the most beautiful movie with a star wars logo on it ever filmed  however the writers were not aware of the star wars universe or the intended direction from the first film  they managed to destroy the force awakens and make any further movie impossible by devastating every possible plotline in the worst writing in an established franchise in a century  the actors and sets and clothes were amazing  this movie can be used as a great film study on how to make a gorgeous movie as almost every aspect of presentation and angles and sweeps and filmography itself was absolutely outstanding  yet at the same time the content was the worst it could have possibly been  disney did not get competent writers to sit down and flush out a 3 movie plotline where everything could be cohesive and of course have some detail experts about the universe that they were writing in to go oh no that has previously been explained here and thus it works this way  it would not have taken much to make this film amazing  in fact i would not be upset about hiring this director again but he just cant touch a pen  no writing  it saddens me that this movie destroyed the force awakens as it was such a solid opening act  i do not comment on the last film as nothing could have saved the series after this movie  there is no writing in the universe that could have recovered from this trash heap
Mar 23 2021,negative,star wars the last jedi is a mess of a movie this movie fails as a sequel to the force awaken but as its own movie is above average at best this movie changes the original concept for many of the beloved characters it changes luke it changes finn it changes poe and it definitely changes the idea of the entire trilogy in a whole this movie is enjoyable when focusing on rey and kilo ren when the movie is unfocused around them it creates plot points that are very convoluted the only reason this film is enjoyable in the least is for the rey and kilo ren scenes and also the amazing visuals it provides if you dont look at this movie like a star wars movie then you should have no problem enjoying the visuals and some of the plot but since this is a star wars story at least thats what were told in advertising it fails completely in making a sequel to a trilogy a trilogy needs to have one writing and one vision this movie proves the vision is all over the place luke has changed from the last version we previously saw him in and is a totally different character mark hamill even hinted at hating the portrayal of luke in this movie the movie changes poes character too from a confident and helpful leader to a cocky pilot whos willing to let people die to finish the mission finns character arc is thrown away in this movie and instead he plays a comedic relief with the new character rose who is essentially pointless and shouldnt be in this movie leia is out of this movie most of the time and is instead replaced with a new captain who refuses to tell anyone her plan which makes no sense its sad to see the characters completely change because the entire cast is filled with amazing actors and actresses they just have nothing to work with in this movie a compliment ill give this movie is that it has some enjoyable action set pieces at times the movie also at least tries to put themes in it but since the movie has so many different sets and themes it doesnt coerce properly together as a final product if you look at this movie away from star wars its a 610 on first watching but as a star wars movie and a sequel which is what im grading it on since thats what its supposed to be its very much a 410 only saved by the fact that some scenes in this movie are really like star wars
Mar 23 2021,negative,worst thing ever porduced even worse than this hollydayspecial
Mar 22 2021,negative,literally the worse nonbmovie ive ever seen ruins all the set up from the last and leads to a pathetic sequel
Mar 22 2021,negative,lets all give a slow clap for the newly mad dumpster fire that is thebsecond installment of the disney star wars mainline trilogy how pathetic can it be to lack even mediocre level writing in a disney funded star wars movie tone deaf unrealistic character logic ham fisted political messaging terrible driving plot points and most disgraceful yet a very transparent disregard for the actors of the original trilogy and their characters very impressive disney heres hoping that this is a wake up call to all the corporate scum that preys upon the masses that you cant just let a brand sell us shit enjoy your 42 audience score and may all those prepaid critic reviewers burn in hell
Mar 22 2021,negative,truly awful this movie simply leeched off the name better writers directors and actors built
Mar 21 2021,negative,bad writing destroying beloved characters and histories for no valid plot reasons
Mar 21 2021,negative,horrible this movie is a disgrace to the name star wars it is boring and trashes all of the other movies it introduces random characters with little to no backstory that are supposed to be important but are hard to watch
Mar 21 2021,negative,what a way to destroy a character like luke skywalker this movie is advertising for the progressive and feminist movement it is advertising not a movie
Mar 21 2021,positive,while this may be an unpopular opinion i loved what the last jediseemed to be setting up for raising what looked like real world issues within the world of star wars the acting of the entire cast was on point there were plenty of palette cleansing moments of fun and humor the last jedi seemed to argue that the idea of the force is not as simple as light and dark or good and evilthat it is much much more complicated than that
Mar 20 2021,negative,awful just awful i need a stronger word than awful 
Mar 20 2021,positive,it had some great moments it had plenty of bad ones ultimately it is quite clear that disney didnt know what to do with luke his reason for exile was baffling the luke in this movie is nothing like the luke from the original trilogy
Mar 20 2021,positive,it may be an unpopular opinion but i have really enjoyed the last jedi it is by far the best directed star wars film its visually impressive as for the story it has it flaws such as the canto bight sequence but it stands quite well as a whole
Mar 20 2021,positive,my favorite star wars movie of all time  the cinematography in these sequel movies is unmatched and breathtaking  the story in this one was fresh and new with new things being thrown into the force you would think some things would change over hundreds of years  tears smiles suspense  the 3rd best scene 1vader rogue one  2luke mandalorian in star wars history imo with the luke projection scene so awesome watch it every time i can  overall gave it a 961100  go see for yourself
Mar 20 2021,negative,this movie is by far the worst star wars movie of all time it stabs the rest of the franchise in the back and basically says looks are the most important it shatters what was and replaces it with a steaming sock of shit buy copies of this movie just to burn
Mar 20 2021,positive,some aspects i dont love but also some of my favourite moments in the entire saga
Mar 20 2021,negative,literally the worst big budget thing ive ever watched absolutely cringey especially the horrifically choreographed fight scenes  ugh what a shame cant even bring myself to watch it a second time
Mar 20 2021,negative,to think that a star wars film could represent some of the most negative aspects of modern cinema modern pop culture fandom and even society is the sad reality we live in once an institution of imagination technological achievement and effective storytelling simplicity the last jedi becomes the antithesis of what star wars once stood for becoming an icon of one of the most cancerous social mentalities of our times and its damage not only to the entertainment industry but to the cult of fiction and even the making of such should not be understated    its divisive in a way that it shouldnt its perplexing in its creative decisions like infamously firing the director and main creative force half way through the trilogy mozel tov kathleen kennedy and its experimental in extremely unappropiate ways even going as far as to insult any member of the audience that disagreed to the genius as if us mere mortals werent deserving of such a masterpiece an honor it shouldnt proudly boast of since its juvenile first draft pimples could be smelled from the back seat of the theater it gets an extra star for some token efforts in terms of art direction but that aint saying much it isnt enough to consider it style over substance even thats the level of tokenism it executes then again disneyslucasfilms history of corporate racism and performative activism is evidence enough of their tendencies of tokenism so thats that speaking of which it makes you feel sorry for the cast who had to smile through the fallout in what once was the dream of any aspiring actor now just a regretful stain in their résumé    this movie hasnt faded into the oblivion of the public consciousness solely on account of its infamous legacy since as far as its cinematic merits go its as mediocre as you would expect from a cashgrab sequel amazing spiderman 2 style which is not exactly what you paid for in the ticket booth its painfully mediocre to the point of frustration since a greater evil wouldnt be this damaging barely holding a candle to the likes of attack of the clones at least that one had a decent lightsaber battle something tlj couldnt even bother to attempt its bland it undermines the previous movie and its predecessors it tarnishes its legacy and it sent pop culture into an obscurantism of sorts its fair to deem it one of the worst sequels of all time as it truly is an excercise of caution for any aspiring filmmaker writer and artist who honestly cares about the craft    not even the memes can save this one
Mar 19 2021,negative,excellent if you want to uproot and divide the fan base poorly written contrarian for the sake of being contrarian this seems to be the brain child of someone who hates star wars and wants their film to have nothing to do with star wars
Mar 19 2021,negative,a film that contradicts and disrespects its predecessors and begs to be praised for doing something different unfortunately subverting expectations doesnt automatically make a movie good
Mar 19 2021,negative,rian obviously doesnt know anything about starwars and he did finn dirty on his character development
Mar 19 2021,positive,finally star wars is good again
Mar 19 2021,negative,what do you get when you bring in someone that doesnt care about anything other than flipping all the laws and rules on its end then relying on all those rules and laws you get the last jedi a film that starts as a giant middle finger to the story itself when it starts with luke getting the lightsaber then immediately disregarding it that is a metaphor to how the rest of the movie will be treated     the fact that the overall arch of the characters played by the actors had reservations proves that people will go along with anything once rank is called and the inevitable just read whats on the script is mentioned     not to mention the problems with a prepackaged feminine icon that automatically is the greatest and best and a role model i would rather have seen the character of rey have struggled and learned and lost everything to then realize where she is in the world the movie ended up being a product not a movie with a good character study or story     given that they may or have given the director another film sums up that the lessons of the past are not required to make the stories of the future if they had any sense they would remake all the more recent films again and this time give it to capable people that want to make a story not a hollow vehicle for toys and halloween costumes
Mar 19 2021,negative,i thought there was nothing worse than the force awaken until i saw this i will not even waste time writing a long review this movie is summarized in 5 points  1 all characters are forced  2 no one really has a defined purpose  3 ray is still a super powerful character who still does not deserve it  4 bored costars without motivations that only give shame  5 sabers figths are ashamed    a disgusting movie sincerely leaves evidence that the president of lucasfilms is more interested in her political agenda than telling good stories
Mar 19 2021,negative,what was rj thinking completely disregarded tfa and the story of luke skywalker
Mar 19 2021,positive,overall a well written story with a very well defined yet controversial arc for the character of luke skywalker poorly executed ideas pacing issues unnecessary sub plots and annoying character interactions
Mar 18 2021,positive,as a middle chapter this carries the story forwards in great ways and delves deeper into the themes of light and dark sides with confidence and a freshness ultimately questions whether the force is a birthright of a privileged few or something more prevalent opening up the potential for anyone to feel empowered in the galaxy
Mar 17 2021,negative,unfunny nonsensical and disrespectful to the original trilogy through its treatment of luke
Mar 17 2021,negative,seemed to be made by people that really hate star wars
Mar 16 2021,positive,a great mpovie one of the best sw movies to date and it is a awesome camera quality incredible
Mar 16 2021,negative,the main issue with the movie is the ending is so anticlimactic and underwhelming that it just doesnt come close to any sort of pay off for having to sit through the broken failure tlj paints luke to be  secondary issues include inconsistent character development and dropping of plot threads set up in tfa there is also the issue of the writer not seeming to understanding established lore in the starwars universe which further detracts from the movie  further some of the issues with tlj arent realised until you watch tros for example its not obvious that snoke was killed off prematurely until you see how they filled this void in tros  in short tlj does have its moments but overall is disappointing and really fails at playing its part as the second movie in a trilogy it feels more like a stand alone film which its obviously not meant to be
Mar 15 2021,positive,too long too loud but overall pretty good not my favorite star wars movie
Mar 14 2021,positive,the most visually stunning and beautiful movie in the stars wars universe but the plot and character development are horrible    thankfully jj abrams came back for the last movie
Mar 13 2021,negative,watching this movie is not enjoyable the way that luke skywalkers legacy was handled bothered me rey and kylo are magnetic but everything after the throne room scene was disappointing
Mar 12 2021,positive,the best film in the last sw trilogy for sure the only thing i did not like is that luke skywalker seems to be a loser something i did not think would ever happen i always pictured him like a great hero you have good action sequences and carrie fishers portrayal of princess leia is wonderful as always the casino and rose story arc feel that does not belong as it cuts the pace and feels forced into the movie
Mar 11 2021,positive,episode viii in the star wars saga continues where episode vii left off as rey seeks out the reclusive luke skywalker for his help  meanwhile the resistance is fighting a losing battle with the first order  not the strongest of the star wars films but like most of the franchise it is filled with stunning visuals and some cool moments wth returning characters such as skywalker
Mar 11 2021,negative,uhhhh honestly just the biggest disappointment in my life
Mar 9 2021,negative,a movie that has no respect for the past and in fact looks to tear down what someone else built a good sequel adds to the story and this movie does not do that it only takes away from story lines of the past
Mar 9 2021,negative,this is a disappointing sequel to a not to bad film
Mar 9 2021,positive,the filmmaking was incredible there are so many cool scenes i cant stop thinking about although the story did differ from what people thought would happen i love the shock it gave me  i loved rey and kylos characters overall amazing movie
Mar 7 2021,neutral,i am 100 on the fence with this film mark hamills return is awesome the action is captivating and the visuals are stunning but the social commentary is forced plot points are brought in then immediately left to die and the villain they built up in the last film is killed then quickly forgotten
Mar 6 2021,positive,a fantastic story amazing character development  fantastic performances i did not like the finn and rose mission they went on but other then that i love this movie
Mar 6 2021,positive,star wars the last jedi is the best movie of the saga since empire strikes back a new hope and the force awakens this movie is fresh and brave than star wars movie that ever made this movie respect the prequel and original trilogy so this movie is so fresh and beautiful with some unexpected scene
Mar 5 2021,negative,was just checking my account after a while away and saw i had given this one star i cant believe i had been so generous this movie is terrible on every single level obviously as a movie for star wars fans it is dreadful it couldnt care less about the characters of this beloved franchise but what baffles me is that lots of critics love this movie the film makes no sense its so lazily written and the actings poor furthermore it ruined any chance of the trilogy being good cause jj abrams spent the third one putting out fires this one caused if you enjoy this film fine you do you but there is no doubt in my mind that this is one of the worst movies ever made
Mar 3 2021,positive,star war film that is absolute perfection it goes against the grain of everything you believe in as a star wars fan and it is amazing for that the central theme of this film is failure and the failure of the systems in place in previous films how these failures have effected these characters tremendously especially lukewho comes out triumphant in the end i will never understand the hate for luke in this film in 20 years people will realize that this is the best star wars movie second to empire the extreme risks plot lines that you would not expect canto bite sequence has an amazing underlying message to it as out of place it may seem i cant say enough good about this film 
Mar 3 2021,negative,the last jedi is so bad that years later i thought about it got irritated and decided to make a rotten tomatoes account just to add my voice to the pile the depiction of luke the casino subplot admiral holdo and her very secret plan that poe should just trust because just awful disney should reboot this franchise make the zahn trilogy
Mar 2 2021,negative,awful nothing has sense in this movie it just have good cgi
Mar 2 2021,negative,i would give it zero stars if i could the sequel trilogy as a whole is terrible but this throws away the entire character legacy of luke skywalker and spits in the face of all star wars fans not only that the plot is slow incomprehensible and advances the storyline in no meaningful way it is worldbreaking rian johnson clearly does not understand star wars at all and makes fun of people who actually fundamentally understand star wars congratulations rian johnson i will never watch a single one of your movies
Mar 1 2021,negative,this movie just doesnt fit in the saga if it was a movie alone i would give it 15 stars because its too absurd and contradict itself in some parts but as a star wars movie i have to give it 05 because it just dont fit in the saga luke is another person there are flashbacks in star wars never have been flashbacks disrespect lightsabers a lot of things are bad with this movie i hate the movie but if some one like it i respect it
Mar 1 2021,negative,this is literally one of the worst movies ive ever seen      there are two star wars movies ive ever seen once  the last jedi and the rise of skywalker  this isnt without trying either  every single time i try to rewatch tlj i get to the can you hear me now part roll my eyes and turn it off     the only good film to come from modern lucasfilms is rogue one  mandalorian is a good start but i still dont care for it but go favreau  you at least know what youre doing
Mar 1 2021,negative,wow what can i say about this bs of a movie rian johnson you and your shit movie sucks you and darth kennedy just killed it and the way darth kennedy went about firing  some 1  with out doing it face to face aint a great more hope she gets fired herself on the 9th of march  you fook wit
Feb 28 2021,negative,i was heartbroken at what they did to luke i was incredibly disappointed at what they did to my luke skywalker personally i cant say i feel like this is star wars
Feb 28 2021,negative,the critics are completely avoiding how the fanbase feels if they truly think this is a good movie luke was completely disrespected force powers were bs and all the focus was on sequel characters like rey who are perfect from the beginning talk about a marey sue
Feb 28 2021,negative,imagine a beautiful woman constantly flirting with you only for her to tell you she is not interested in you and calls you stupid for thinking that she is thats what this movie feels like critics praise the movie for subverting expectations if building up excitement only to disappoint you is rian johnsons definition for subverting expectations then he did a good job at it   i am not a huge star wars fan i grew up watching the 6 live action films but never owned them on dvd or blue ray i have never seen any of the cartoons read star wars comics or read any star wars books as much as i enjoyed the original films and the prequels i was not obsessed with them however i always knew one thing luke skywalker is a fictional hero whose fame is comparable to superman spiderman batman or wonder woman when i first watched the trailer for the force awakens i was excited i was happy to hear that there would be a sequel that would include all the original characters i enjoyed the film in theaters and was intrigued by the riddles it introduced to the audience who is snoke who is rey related to why is luke hiding i watched the last jedi while it was still in theaters on a plan ride to california courtesy of delta i was hoping some of the questions would be answered even if none of the questions were answered i knew i was going to be entertained by a new actionpacked star wars film i was dead wrong i remember walking out of the plane thinking what did i just watch rian johnson either gave us poor answers to the questions presented to the audience in the previous film or lets us know that those questions are not important this movie disgusted me so much i made it a point not to watch the rise of skywalker i did read the entire story in wikipedia though to my surprise critics loved the last jedi i did not think much of it for the last couple of years but recently curiosity got the best of me and i have been doing research on the critical reception for this movie i have noticed that lots of fans hated this film while critics have been constantly insulting them and accusing them of being upset that their farfetched theory was not considered critics also state that fans have not reviewed the film properly and that some of the account on rotten tomatoes are robots this has bothered me as i am not someone who is heavily invested in the star wars franchise yet felt this film was a mess for several reasons        the plot basically a flat tire in space the resistance tries to run away from the new order but they are running out of gas meanwhile rey finds a disappointed luke and spends half the movie trying to convince him to train her he refuses and she still becomes a jedi on top of that finn and a new character named rose have a side quest looking for a code breaker in a space casino        mark hamills luke skywalker i dont have a problem with a depressed luke however he needs to be able to climb out of this depression and train rey to become a jedi instead we see a luke that stays depressed and only decides to help at the very end of the movie rian johnson will argue that he has taken on the role of obi wan in the original star wars film obi wan saved luke twice started training him to become a jedi cut a villains hand off helped the heroes sneak into the death star helped the heroes escape from the death star and died while fighting darth vader how exactly is luke skywalker obi wan in this film again did he train rey did he fight the new order johnsons comment is a poor excuse for misuse of one of the most famous characters in fictional history to add insult to injury whoever wrote this characters lines does not seem to be familiar with him if you watch any of the original films and hear luke speaking it will not sound anything like the luke we see in this film mark hamill was right when he said that this character sounds nothing like the luke skywalker he knows        pacing let me speak in laymens term this movie is boring action packed films tend to make up for their poorly written plots with fast paced scenes that leave you sitting at the edge of your seat wondering what is going to happen next i remember sitting on the plane thinking when are we going to get to the good part only to find out i was more than halfway done with the movie the only intense scene turned out to be a disappointment which was at the throne room more about that below if you dont think it is boring i can prove it to you in a couple of ways first the number of children that have lost interest in this franchise is an example of how dull this movie is this can be seen in both the lack of toy sales and visits to the disney themed star wars park pre covid19 if you are still not convinced on how boring this movie is think how many times have you watched this entire movie for sheer pleasure not many i would guess         snoke why would you kill this character off so soon who was he according to johnson it doesnt matter because he is dead this is a perfect example for excitement being built up for no reason i am sure jj abrahams original plan was not for him to be an empty vessel controlled by palpatine this death made it inevitable for luke to die because kylo would be little to no threat if both luke and rey stayed alive        lack of light saber duels the throne room scene does not count because killing those cult leaders who carry staffs while dressed in red is not a duel projection luke and kylo is also not a duel this is the only star wars movie without a proper light saber duel say what you will about the prequels the light saber duels were awesome        the relationship between rey and luke you would assume that rey and luke would form a bond as jedi and padawan instead we see two characters who simply will not stop arguing with each other it feels as if han solo and rey had a stronger and he was not even her jedi master rey turns out to be wiser than luke making her trip to his desolate planet a waste of time        finn remember finn dont worry if dont because rian johnsons doesnt either this character was hyped up to be a potential jedi after wielding anakins old lightsaber instead he written off as a side character with little to no importance the side quest in this movie appears to have been written so that this character stays out of the way from the main conflict while keeping him alive        luke skywalkers death last but surely not least our beloved heros death this must be the lamest death for a well know fictional hero in the history of storytelling luke does not even leave his temporary planet but dies there by distracting the villains with a projection of himself this projection drained the living energy out of him and he dies gazing at the sunset james t kirks death in star trek generations pales in comparison with this atrocity   after reading many positive reviews i am still puzzled at why critics love this movie the twists in this films were simply a message to the audience saying their expectations do not matter and they are stupid to think that they do and critics seem to love it some will admit that this movie has problems it not only has problems but is a big problem itself they will also say this movie say it is visually stunning however this is what is expected of any scifi film this day and age especially one that has a budget for a star wars film some will also point to the groundbreaking box office numbers to state that this movie was a success but they do not seem to notice how much lower the numbers were for the rise of skywalker because people like myself decided to ignore it due to this films disappointments all i can say is this is the last disney star wars film i will ever watch and i feel very sorry for the fans who are deeply invested in this franchise good luck everyone
Feb 26 2021,negative,this movie is just disney corporate think tank trash
Feb 26 2021,negative,especially disappointing for anyone who grew up with the original trilogy
Feb 25 2021,neutral,seems a little out of place in the star wars franchise they split the main protagonist apart in way which isnt natural have them all gather together at the end with very little threat and they kill of the main antagonist half way through with no explanation of who he is bb8 is still annoying
Feb 24 2021,negative,its amazing how you can throw a budget of this size on a disastrous script with unengaging characters portrayed by  with one or two exceptions  mediocre actors that this travesty could make it all the way to the screen without anyone intervening says something essential about both disney and lucasfilm
Feb 24 2021,negative,spoilers in review  they had a good setup left over from the force awakens interesting characters intriguing potential plot lines to follow and backstories to fill in while the force awakens wasnt the best it set up a lot for the last jedi tlj to follow  not to mention the cinematography was immense  then the last jedi comes along the entire plot is a slow chase until one ship runs out of fuel how lame and unimaginative they really build up the interaction with luke in the force awakens and then tlj turns it into a complete waste of time im certain the real luke skywalker died in episode 6 because this luke is not the same person  mark hamills own words paraphrased i cant even name a scene which is not awful the way that they treat the original characters is completely disrespectful i hope rian johnson never gets another directorwriter job ever again
Feb 24 2021,positive,the greatest jedi movie despite the pg13 rating
Feb 23 2021,negative,the second part of this trilogy is just disappointing character arcs are inconsistent with the previous part plot armor keeps driving the whole story its like completely random things happening in succession and no one cared about making the motivations of the characters visible to the viewer in addition dialogues are significantly weaker than in the first part in some very important scenes the dialogues are completely superficial and general you could confuse them with children talking a lot of fancy things had to happen in this movie and no one cared about telling why in the first part this was ok because it fitted into an overall mystery but if there is a mystery you have to progress it and not put it into a mixer and scramble it to an unrecognizable word sausage
Feb 23 2021,negative,rian johnson is a terrible director and it shows in this terribly made movie such a great potential though butchered by incompetence
Feb 23 2021,negative,the last jedi has to be one of the most dissapointing films and sequels of all time i wasnt that fond of force awakens it was ok but rogue one came out and it was really good and i couldnt wait to see this one just by the star wars logo being changed red i had so much hype building up i never found any of the previous star wars movies bad i thought at the very worst they were ok i heard the director was rian johnson the director of looper and that was a movie i thought was great at the time i loved the movie but that  was before i realized what cash grabs were if i were to be the same person i was right now in 2017 then i would be so dissapointed then one day i rewatched the movie and realized how awful this movie was im gonna start talking about the things i liked because theres very little things i praised in this movie i liked the sets it looked really nice adam driver gave a decent performance and the score was good as always besides that well the dialouge is absouloutely horendous personally i only think theres no star wars movie with bad dialouge they were either hit and miss or good this one on the other hand oh boy if you thought the love scenes dialouge from attack of the clones was bad well this makes it look like the screenplay for taxi driver it is very clunky unfunny and i never thought id hear a yo mama joke in a star wars movie the acting is horrible yes even from mark hamill and carrie fisher you could tell they didnt like the direction from johnson they ruined every character from force awakens theres a scene where rey destroys some villagers supplies looks at them and walks away how god damn rude and now rose tico i am not putting this hate on the actor and i do feel sorry for the harrasment shes had towards her the character however is one of the worst charaters in all of cinema history she is incredibly disrepectful annoying and selfish there is a scene at the end which is one of the worst scenes i have ever seen in a movie ever finn is sacrificing himself to save the jedi and rose tico decides to save him and itd be ok if they saw rose as a selfish character but she says that they can beat the empire by not fighting who they hate and fighting with love yes because millions of ships that will murder you at any point will be destroyed by love she is ruining the jedi because of her selfish decision the movie is incredibly disrepectful to the character of luke skywalker the most optimistic person in the whole galaxy the jedi who thought that they could destroy the empire and have hope that his dad darth vader the most evil and powerful man in the galaxya would leave the sith and here he lives on an island milking creatures he would never give up the scene where he is milking the creature and drinking the milk raw is absoloutley disgusting and pointless that scene was replaced for luke mourning over han solos death thank you very much rian johnson the cgi looks too unrealistic it barely looks like there even there and the scene where leia is floating in space after the ship exploded and could fly like clark kent was so extremely stupid her head shouldve freezed up at this point and why is there no security with some of the most important on the ship in that area they killed admiral ackbar for a bratty pink haired disrespectful childish character called vice holdo just take a second to process that the death of snoke in this movie was awful compare this death to other deaths in the franchise remember in the phantom menace when darth maul killed qui gon kin with liam neesons subtle performance and ewan mcgregors scared subtle and upset performance with john williams amazing score in the background or how about when anakin died in return of the jedi with the great performance from mark hamill getting to see his dad one time before he dies and anakin is finally satisfied that he killed palpatine heres how it works in this movie snoke is sitting in his chair and kylo ren uses the force to put his lightsaber between snoke and he had no idea it felt more like a nickelodeon prank than a star wars kill the throne room sequence sucks too the fact that snokes workers are fighting better than snoke is so stupid and the fact that rey can lift up all these rocks with just her hands when she barely trained makes absoloutely no sence what so ever i shouldve taken all the warnings from mark hamill about how bad this movie was going to be the last jedi is an incredibly disjointed unfunny dissapointing horrible horrible film that i would never reccomend to anyone to ever watch the last jedi 10 f
Feb 22 2021,negative,worst star wars media out there horrible story  the actor and the universe is great though
Feb 21 2021,negative,i give it a full star only because it is visually very well made having said that this is a clusterfck of immense proportion and the fault falls squarely on the immense ego of rian johnson in one take he managed to a derail the whole plot of this last trilogy b defecate on the role and meaning of certain characters just because i want to give my spin on it and its cool to destroy heroes and c decide to talk about themes that have nothing to do with star wars themes i agree with yes but that you cant introduce at episode 8 all in all this is the one i will never tewatch you can skip from 7 to 9 with no impact to the overall story
Feb 21 2021,negative,what a terrible movie favs were waiting half a century to see luke as this jedi master the hero instead we got this blue milk drinking shell of a man rey is still super powerful and has no rival amazing character arc there snoke was the subject of so many youtube videos who is he whats his relation to all this did they answer this nope and dont get me started with the white ford bronco in space chase scene talk about stupid running out of gas and the entire not just crushing the rebellion because the plot needs them to survive stupid
Feb 21 2021,positive,i think it was amazing it was a new and refreshing take on how a star wars movie can be made the backlash clearly came from a large amount of fans who wanted to see a strong luke skywalker which he ended up as but just not in the way that they expected andor wanted all in all the movie introduced a lot of new very interesting things to the star wars universe in a very entertaining and beautiful way the fact that the luke skywalker we knew and loved have come to the conclusion that the force is nor good or evil or anyones to take but it is a balanced force that has been manipulated and used wrongly by everyone both jedi and sith for a long time it is in my eyes a long time star wars enthusiast and well nerd just so brilliant
Feb 21 2021,negative,characters without depth and horrible story plot with shitty acting probably from actors who didnt even like the movie they were part of because of the lack depth and story as previously mentioned if you like good movies this is not the movie for you especially if you are a person that question nonsensical things that keep happening
Feb 21 2021,negative,there isnt a lot that can be said about the last jedi that hasnt already been said it destroyed the greatest franchise in cinematic history if you think that its worth watching then more fool you
Feb 20 2021,negative,people dont like talking politics at work but sure lets add it to our favorite space opera dripping with sarcasm
Feb 19 2021,negative,a couple of good actions but overall a disappointment
Feb 19 2021,negative,this movie is pretty much an insult to star wars fans it puts in very inappropriate jokes takes a beloved character and makes him look like a fool and a loser makes fun of things making the audience think they are watching a battle ship in space but then shows you it is just a clothes ironer makes yoda look like a drunken idiot the list goes on and on truly this is an insult to fans mocking them desecrating  star wars and making you watch it
Feb 19 2021,negative,i feel i need to do my part   if i could give this disgrace of a movie zero stars i would but i think that would have been to high of a score as well   this movie is like shitty fan fiction made by someone that does not understand star wars or scifi in general there are no redeeming values to it at all rj should be ashamed of himself for making the absolute worst and most hated star wars movie and for personally being responsible fro the decline of the franchise he should be blacklistedbanned from ever working on anything related to star wars again as a life long fan i am saddened at the missed opportunity this film could have been and am mad with the dumpster fire we got
Feb 19 2021,negative,terrible characters awful story cheap laughs this isnt star wars its the biggest disappointment in movie history totally wasted opportunity to bring luke back    i really hate what disney have done to star wars its just sad
Feb 19 2021,negative,well filmed with terrible humor this movie changed the established personalities of characters to the point that they became different people  rey  optimistic and powerful tfa  emotional and stupid but still powerful tlj  finn  pure and passionate tfa  dumb and stupid tlj  poe  brave and heroic tfa  irrational and dimwitted tlj  kylo  traumatized and angry tfa  emo and lovesick tlj  luke  eternally optimistic and good all of ot  grumpy and negative tlj  leia  respected and powerful tfa  powerless yet suddenly magical tlj  snoke  mysterious and powerful tfa  dead tlj    this film completely subverted my expectation that it would be great i walked out of this movie wanting to believe i liked it but just felt  disappointed
Feb 19 2021,negative,terrible film utter trash trilogy
Feb 19 2021,negative,worst star wars movie ever the director rian is a disgrace who ever chose dude should get fired   they absolutely ruined star wars
Feb 19 2021,negative,so many good ideas are inside this movie but the fakeouts and bizarre tone shifts between scenes leaves the viewer confused and upset is poe the good guy or is he a reckless danger to the resistance random new character holdo is set up to be an antagonist vs character we know and like from episode 7 the movie goes out of the way to imply that following orders blindly from weak and indecisive leaders is bad but then theres a confusing twist where main character is in the wrong for not wanting to die strange side plots go nowhere characters watch everyone they knowcare about die slowly in space siege but seem relaxed and jovial emotional payoffs are robbed at the last minute for no reason luke is done dirty and confusingly so is he a sad old man if so why not really ever explained just blown past with pretty effects    this movie hopes the audience is dazzled by the beautiful visuals and shock value but ultimately is a emotionally confusing and tone deaf sequel that answers nothing and creates problem after problem for the plot trilogy existing characters and franchise there was a lot of good ideas here that died on the table in order to get a cheap laugh or to subvert expectations director should take a class on what foreshadowing and payoffs are and how to use them
Feb 19 2021,negative,it i could have given no stars i would have there has been 12 star wars movies and the last jedi would rank below all the movies series and books thankfully the mandalorian has saved star wars
Feb 18 2021,negative,worst star wars movie of all time couldnt even bring the original characters together one last time like the long time fans wished for then made luke a bitch and killed him off after he meditated too hard
Feb 18 2021,neutral,this was so disappointing it disrespected the original trilogy and the lifes work of george lucas the mouse is killing star wars
Feb 18 2021,negative,this movie is hot garbage  the characters dont match their own personalities from the previous movie in the slightest  their actions are incongruent and mostly seem to be forced by the plot rather than being a natural result of their own goals for that matter the universe itself seemed to follow different laws  its almost as if you didnt even bother watching any of the previous movies before directing this one  finns character was completely abandoned and we all know why  tlj was the very first star wars movie where i didnt bother buying the dvd  that may not seem like much but it comes from a guy who bought all the visual dictionaries and incredible crosssections of the ot and pt not to mention a number of 800 page novels that oh whats that kathleen  oh apparently those dont exist  there is no source material  congratulations rian  you helped kathleen dismantle a 40 year old pop culture cash cow in less than a decade by making sure half your audience walked out of the theater wishing they hadnt bought a ticket  your snoke theory sucks
Feb 18 2021,negative,anyone with even the shortest connection to star wars should realise what a terrible movie this is starships with massive guns bombers whose top speed is walk a pilot that can singlehandedly take on a star destroyer no character progression more original trilogy cast sacrificed for wow factor i want my money back really really really bad film the director can handle stand alone films but should never been connected with a ongoing series ever again
Feb 18 2021,positive,i have never seen a blockbuster in such a large franchise work so hard and effectively to present develop and make a statement on a singular theme failure the beautiful way in which this film articulates humans different reactions and coping with failure both of ourselves and of the previous generation makes me continually return to it as one of my favorite movies of the last decade and easily in my top 3 star wars movies
Feb 18 2021,negative,jesus what did they do with star wars  and i thought it couldnt get any worse than ep 1
Feb 18 2021,negative,horrible movie stuffed so much bs politics down my throat that i cant even breath my favorite part was definitely when they set free the enslaved horses and left the enslaved children 
Feb 18 2021,negative,tlj is the worst movie ive ever seen a slap in the face to true star wars fans the woke director wasnt thinking about the fans only his agenda its as if he wanted to piss off the fans and destroy the legacy of the greatest scifi hero of alltime there was nothing bold about it star wars is going down a dark path to disaster
Feb 17 2021,negative,appalling ideology over entertainment the scourge of our time
Feb 17 2021,negative,just ruined star wars  i wish we could take it back 
Feb 17 2021,negative,the character development for luke is just god awful also when did star wars even mention the aspect of fuel ever this movie is atrocious i hate it so much
Feb 16 2021,positive,i have a lot to say about this movie mainly it can be summed like this this is a gorgeous movie but not a good star wars movie
Feb 16 2021,positive,a great movie within the star wars series sequel trilogy and as a standalone film block out the noise of undeserved hatred and simply enjoy    may the force be with you
Feb 15 2021,negative,dont watch this movie i have no words
Feb 15 2021,positive,easily the best after empire many cannot accept the portrait of legacy characters the pacing in the middle was a bit strange otherwise its very enjoyable if you keep an open mind
Feb 15 2021,negative,destroyed the trilogy horribly gimmicky      worst star wars movie
Feb 13 2021,negative,rian johnson destroys all the hopes that we had for the trilogy just to add some twists and destroy some already established rules of the star wars universe
Feb 13 2021,negative,if you loved the star wars holiday special then you are in for a treat this movie surpasses the holiday special only just for cringiness the actors do a good job with what they have but even if every actor had put in an emmy winning performance they didnt they are sorely let down by very lazy script and horrible directing     if you are a star wars fan this movie is a slap in the face introducing mechanics that if applied retroactively to the previous movies makes the desperate situation feel out of proportion considering what they could do     rian johnson has certainly left his mark on the star wars universe pity it looks like the aftermath of an elephant with diarrhoea
Feb 13 2021,negative,oh my goodness holy god this movie just missed in every scene something is awful the entire movie is out of step with the entire sw universe  but also even as a standalone it makes absolutely no sense and has no compelling interest   the only way to enjoy this movie is to watch the redlettermedia takedown of it seriously  spend your hour there not on this trash
Feb 13 2021,negative,terrible left me with more questions than i started with
Feb 13 2021,negative,i never thought a star wars movie would be released that made me think maybe attack of the clones wasnt so bad plot holes galore and generally just a huge stain on the incredible franchise jj should have owned this trilogy endtoend kathleen kennedy should be ashamed of her gross mishandling of the disney trilogy on the bright side it looks and sounds absolutely beautiful
Feb 3 2021,negative,the previous movie was so bad i was not going to watch this one boy i should have listen to myself i wanted to walk out of the room but was on a date i did not think they could do worse than the last movie boy was i wrong i guess the last final film i will never watch now and my girlfriend owes me big for making sit through that disaster
Jan 31 2021,negative,completely destroyed my favorite star wars character
Jan 26 2021,negative,this movie took my childhood hero out behind the shed and gave him both barrels  also they took finn my favorite character from the force awakens and turned him into a joke  its too long you feel  every  single  minute  of it as it drags on  rather than developing rey as an actual character she just continued on being the bestest evar without ever having to work or struggle for anything  shes such a boring vacuum of personality that i have a hard time staying awake when shes on screen  the only thing i actually enjoyed was kylo rens storyline not because the storyline is very good but because adam driver puts in a great performance  the movie just isnt worth the time to watch and completely derails star wars as a whole
Jan 17 2021,negative,truly disappointed so many story lines that never gave any real satisfaction
Jan 14 2021,negative,jesus what even is this movie
Jan 13 2021,negative,beautiful images terrible terrible movie it seeks to destroy everything that makes star wars fun and enjoyable
Jan 4 2021,negative,i cannot express my disappointment in this film it completely neglects all the previous films built on i can say they bravely and boldly made unexpected turns such as killing off supreme leader snoke and have luke skywalker attempt to kill his nephew however these twist completely destroy what the previous films had set up for these characters and leave later writers in a difficult position when it comes to what they do for the 9th movie absolute turd of a movie and left jj abrams trying to wash out the taste of shit that was the last jedi
Dec 31 2020,negative,the film that derailed the sequels only the special effects are good in this
Dec 31 2020,negative,its just not a story that makes sense and is so full of holes and annoying parts
Dec 31 2020,negative,absolutely horrible 
Dec 31 2020,negative,a pointless slow chase scene through space and the writer didnt bother to do his research on one of the main characters madness
Dec 31 2020,negative,hot incoherent garbage
Dec 30 2020,negative,bad bad bad bad movie not good dumb purple haired girl luke drinks alien milk and is a crab leia flys now
Dec 30 2020,negative,i thought it lost the way of the previous movie  hopefully its all just a dream 
Dec 30 2020,negative,luke dropped his lightsaber   the force and the jedi are a religion   the script is very bad  it is not what we expected to see  i didnt like the movie made by rian johnson
Dec 30 2020,negative,2d  characters a lot of wasted potential and an average story
Dec 30 2020,positive,a great star wars movie criminally underrated by fans
Dec 30 2020,negative,im giving extra halfstar cause of photography and fx aside from that it destroyed the star wars universe awful story character development and turnouts nobody wanted to have expectations subverted we just wantedto have  great jedi lessons great epic characters with trials and epic deeds thats all
Dec 30 2020,positive,a bold and fresh take on the franchise full of surprises and breathtaking scenery
Dec 30 2020,positive,its a good movie people just cant handle their idols being humanized and showing basic human feelings
Dec 29 2020,negative,if youve just watched the first 6 starwars movies dont bother to watch the sequels disney really fucked up on them but their spinoffs are great the skywalker saga ended when revenge of the sith was released and its a shame to call the sequels a part of the same storyline
Dec 29 2020,positive,possibly my favorite star wars film rian johnsons story inject new life into the franchise while still respecting what makes star wars feel like star wars lots of fun
Dec 29 2020,negative,terrible beautiful movie but awful directing and story dishonours the real star wars and laughs at star wars fans everywhere
Dec 29 2020,positive,for me the last jedi is the second best star wars after empire strikes back like a lot of star wars fans who grew up with luke skywalker as their hero i too had initial issues with a defeated and depressed luke who had decided to withdraw from a galaxy in need but the broader message about failure and how to respond to it as well as the bigger questions about legacy and how to avoid the mistakes of the past are worth the cost of taking lukes character to this place i think the last jedi is groundbreaking daring and helps to solidify star wars as relevant to the issues facing us in the 21st century
Dec 29 2020,negative,just an exercise in style it reuses elements from star wars original trilogy but lacks its spirit the director tries to surprise his audience and make a turn of the screw for lukes character however he totally fails moreover the rythm of the storytelling is too frenetic with three stories happening at once without the required gradation and going nowhere
Dec 29 2020,negative,its just sandwiched between epi 7  9 with no coherence epi 7 was a straight up new hope take then epi 8 where rey starts training herself coz luke didnt want to i mean he tried but gave up 12 way into training her i did like the force projection that luke did to buy the resistance some time to escape but more or less thats it the protagonist doesnt work for me  too many reasons for that
Dec 29 2020,negative,i hate this movie with a passion its so idiotic it makes the prequels seem good it honestly hurts to watch it
Dec 28 2020,negative,couldve been a halfhour short film
Dec 28 2020,positive,this movie has aged amazing
Dec 28 2020,negative,this was literally the worst star wars movie imaginable  it made me hate every character more and spit in the face of everything i loved about the movies growing up the fact that the audience gave it a 40  approval rating is pretty telling in the fact that the so called critics are useless asshats that serve zero purpose rian johnson should kill himself
Dec 28 2020,negative,just totally threw out an interesting story line was just laughable excuse and disgrace regarding great team of actors its as nothing matters in this film and nihilism is the way  very disappointed most certainly should be thrown out of star wars canon and universe something like the infamous star wars christmas special this was even more disappointing with just poor story line and made zero effort to continue 1st films promising plot
Dec 28 2020,negative,an absolute disgrace to the series
Dec 28 2020,negative,this movie throws out everything from the force awakens even though that movie was not very good at least it set cool stuff up for future movies in favor of two and a half hours of two fleets slowly chasing each other all characters especially luke and leia are made completely unlikeable going through the motions of a plot that goes nowhere it was a recycled empire strikes back if that movie was completing boring and disrespected everything from a new hope the dialogue is bad the twists are worthless and the humor is placed at the most awkward moments most disappointing movie i have ever seen
Dec 28 2020,negative,when i watched the the force awakens i thought the film was flawed but i thought tlj may answer some of the questions especially as to why rey without training was able to defeat a trained jedisith in kylo ren i was sorely disappointed    the last jedi represents everything wrong with hollywood and film making at this moment in time the days of story telling and fun seem to have taken a side line over making political statements and moralising to the audience    when i watch star wars i watch it to be transported to a galaxy far far away not to be told what a bad person i am and that i represent the evil patriarchy     rian johnson is clearly a good director some great cinematography but his storytelling is woeful if anything he seems to hate star wars    as for the critics who liked this all i can say is they watched a different film from me
Dec 28 2020,negative,this movie was a franchise killer  2 hours of wokeness misandry and uninteresting storytelling      i sincerely hopes disney has the guts to retcon this piece of trash
Dec 28 2020,negative,all i need to say shite
Dec 28 2020,negative,doesnt make sence and destroys all previous epizodes and characters 
Dec 28 2020,negative,this was one of the most annoying movies i have ever seen luke was a baby and it was full of bad acting and terrible plot
Dec 28 2020,negative,if it wasnt for the popcorn it would have been a complete waste of time probably the worst of the star wars movies
Dec 28 2020,negative,the last jedi is one of the worst movies ever made and it destroys all of star wars good job
Dec 28 2020,negative,this movie takes everything that star wars fans were hoping to see with their favorite characters and completely does the opposite luke was treated as a grumpy old man who said he came to the island to die and rudely told rey to go away this doesnt make sense because if he went to the island to die then why did he make a map canto bight was a laugh it was trying to teach us moviegoers that child slavery and animal cruelty is evil im pretty sure everyone knows that there is so much to say about this film the only good things about are the effects and the soundtrack other than that this film is the worst star wars film of the saga its even worst than the phantom menace
Dec 28 2020,negative,absolutely putrid garbage racist and misandrist it defecates on every star wars fan
Dec 22 2020,negative,a complete disaster of a film this movie totally ignores the character growth of the main character of the original franchise going in a direction unrealistic to the core of the character it also reduces the new main character from interesting and capable to a kind of ditz in an attempt to be unpredictable the director gives us a flashy yet somehow painfully boring movie that begs the question of whether he had absolutely no understanding of the source material or a pure hatred for it a monumental  insult to the history of the franchise its fans and its future a failure of unprecedented magnitude
Dec 16 2020,negative,an awful mess of a film for want of a better word destroys a 40 year old franchise insults fans intelligence and is boring as fk its a slow motion car chase movie ffs
Dec 15 2020,positive,although it may not be a perfect film id say its one of the strongest of the star wars bunch
Dec 11 2020,negative,it was flashy but i liked less the more i thought about it
Dec 9 2020,positive,almost perfect star wars film in my opinion say what you want about this film but i think its great the cinematography along with the great action sequences and performances just make this film incredible to watch the story is my only flaw and its just little nit picks the sequence with finn and rose i felt couldve been removed completely also with having such a star wars legend of luke skywalker i expected him to die fighting but to die like obiwan is a little disappointing overall amazing film 
Dec 1 2020,positive,actually only worth 35 stars but i gotta do my part to bring balance to the force    solid movie with its share of flaws that tells an impactful story
Nov 30 2020,positive,one of the best star wars movies
Nov 29 2020,negative,terrible pacing a nonsensical plot bad acting especially from daisy ridley and the most unlikable and unrealistic main protagonist ive ever seen in a star wars movie yes even more than anakin i dont like sand skywalker at least lil ani actually had to train and work hard to become a jedi
Nov 29 2020,negative,marey sue they should have listened to mark hamil and let me just say mark we still love you and we dont blame you terrible writing and we probably shouldnt blame the actress for her playing a character the way it was written
Nov 29 2020,neutral,i dont really know what to say about this movie for every positive there is a negative for every negative there is a positive i dont hate it as much as some but i dont love it as much as others i am split right down the middle
Nov 27 2020,positive,i was able to think this is awesome
Nov 26 2020,positive,when i watched this movie in theaters i was amazed and immediately loved it sadly when i went to discuss with others my mind was changed by the fact that no one else i knew liked it because they wanted jj abrams version now that the terrible 9th movie was released i think people are starting to realize that they overreacted and that jj abrams version like all of his intricate plots result in bad reveals overall my favorite of the new trilogy
Nov 26 2020,positive,absolute gem of a movie with wonderful acting visuals music characters themes and especially diretcing rian johnson is a genius and this film will be remembered very fondly 10 years from now
Nov 26 2020,negative,the worst possible continuation to the saga especially after the force awakens this movie did not answer any questions the last movie made us ask but only added more a very lackluster plot that added literally nothing to the universe the whole movie is just a bunch of unanswered questions this movie did not live up to the expectations that the other movies set and should be skipped in any bing watch
Nov 24 2020,negative,about the only thing good about this movie is the action and fighting the story is simply awful they take luke skywalkers character and turn them into a coward then they kill him off the whole thing regarding the code breaker wasnt even needed in the story at all and if purple haired lady had explained herself then that side of the story wouldve already been taken care of too someone needs to learn how to write a story
Nov 24 2020,negative,spoilers    how do you refuse to kill your father whose killed countless men women and children across the galaxy because you insist there is good in him only to try and kill your nephew in his sleep because he had an evil dream    how do you beat a jedi whose trained with a lightsaber since before you were born after only using one yourself for a few days    this movie is completely antithetical to the characters and lore of the universe in which its based    this movie sets the gold standard for how to inflict irreparable damage to a decadesold billion dollar constitution of american popculture a giant pile of hot garbage
Nov 22 2020,negative,the ego of the director is astounding the film is no pastiche of star wars but a mockery every creative decisions seems to be made on the premise of doing what no one else would have done so that the director can sooth his need to be recognised as a genius even the cut scenes come with his annoying commentary     in the first sentence of the first cut scenes commentary rian says i came up with this idea this clever idea so proud of my own cleverness his idea was to ruin opening scene continuity how different what a clever man 7 films have done it this way but here comes ryan to tell us that wasnt any good so they cut that scene and we get an opening shot that resembles a star destroyers ooh cool ooh cool oh no its just a shadow on some asteroid belt    this is quite a premonition for the rest of the film dont get your hopes up nothing you will see will be what you think it is no instead of a star wars film we get a rian johnson demonstration on what he thinks doesnt work in other star wars films which evidently is everything why else would luke have to break the fourth wall with dialogue like this is not going to go the way you think    this nightmare is the result of a lifelong fan who idea of fandom is thinking that he could do so much better but not because he wants to add anything but to prove his own superiority
Nov 21 2020,negative,this movie manages to ruin all the plot points created in episode vii while destroying the entire saga if i had to pick between this one and the holiday special id have a hard time
Nov 20 2020,negative,destroying the image of luke skywalker so they can promote their political agenda was horrible they put this idea in the viewers mind that the male mentor idea is bad when thats not true thats not the luke skywalker that george lucas had in mine bad movie really
Nov 19 2020,negative,only good thing is cgi and soundtrack
Nov 19 2020,positive,with the mouse in control it makes sense as to why we were introduced to two female supporting cast members who provide one thing heterosexuality this movie could have gone without the savior complex
Nov 18 2020,negative,what rian johnson did to the star wars series and the character of luke skywalker is unforgivable he betrayed a generation of fans with his shortsighted and misguided script that ignores character traits and entire arcs established over thirty years ago this is a gorgeous movie except for when it is flat and garish for some reason it achieves the unlikely feat of being both the most gorgeous star wars movie and the ugliest one as well moebius strip plots replace narrative threads established in the force awakens as rian johnson ignores advice and warnings from mark hamill to craft the most insulting star wars movie of all time congratulations rian you took a cant lose property and singlehandedly drove it into the abyss i hope he is given the chance to make his own trilogy one day so i can happily refuse to see it good luck with that and thanks again for betraying the forty years of fans that carried this series for you
Nov 17 2020,positive,one of the better star wars movies though never reaching the highs of the original trilogy     final score 78
Nov 16 2020,negative,oh man the movie was godawful never watch it
Nov 12 2020,negative,looks good sounds good isnt good if u havent seen star wars before you will probably love it if not you probably wont
Nov 12 2020,negative,this is a film for people who have never seen a star wars film by people who do not like star wars it is the 8th film in an epic story that bridges four decades which aims to make the subsequent 7 films irrelevant
Nov 10 2020,negative,for an infinite amount of reasons i think this movie was garbage  first and most widely agreed on ryan  jj  couldnt agree on what the heck they were doing in force awakens jj started us of with snoke  rey so now the two biggest questions in the star wars franchise were who are reys parents and what is snokes backstory in this movie spoilers kylo says shes nobody and hers parents where nobody sold you off for drinking money kylo ren  ruining the perfect opportunity for rey to learn the truth about her family and snoke lol hes dead now so i wasnt surprised to see jj come out and say in tros just kidding people shes a palpatine kylo was just lying  so i know what anyone reading this is thinking duh kylo was lying it was important for her not to know until she met palp and stuff right wrong  daisy ridley actress of rey in an interview after tros said that the ryan had no idea who rey was gonna be at one point she was a kenobi then a skywalker   then palpatine showing us that there was no plan from the beginning so during last jedi she could have been any one of those witch sucks   the movie wasnt really really bad until i picked it apart scene by scene i always buzz ahead past the throne room scene just cuz that parts embarrassing  but if you dont care about the quality of the movie or the plot or what it means for the rest of the star wars trilogy then yah the movie was ok
Nov 10 2020,negative,really bad movie i used covid restrictions to watch the prequels and the new trilogy never seeing them before phantom menace has a good story but the anakin actor was insufferable and jar jar binks was an embarrassing mess and well racist that one was better than last jedi though which was the worst of the 6 i saw the first half of rise of skywalker was bad too as for this one the plot was a mess lots of unnecessary things going on rey becomes ridiculously overpowered way too quickly facing almost no learning curve and luke as a grumpy homicidal mess was out of wack finn was criminally underused and lets face it he is force sensitive and it would have been cool to see him and rey training together the leia flying in space was maybe the dumbest thing ive seen in any of the movies and im not an akbar fan guy he had like 10 lines in return of the jedi but was unceremoniously killed off kind of like optimus prime in the cartoon transformer movie but that was done totally to sell new rodimus prime toys the humor was awful just awful and whoever greenlit the your mom joke should never touch a keyboard again finns plan would totally have worked and luck is the only plot device that didnt see rose being selfish didnt get all the heroes killed off the smoke thing was dumb like maybe the director didnt like the character but it made kylo seem like a chump for taking orders in the past from someone as dumb and weak as snoke was one thing though that people unfairly rip one is the idea that reys parents were nobody being palatines granddaughter was itself dumb and its pretty clear from the prequels that anakins dad was a drink or a hobo or something himself a nobody trying to make lineage a thing would only limit the series which as im saying it now given how bad this movie was maybe thats what those peeps are aiming to do
Nov 9 2020,negative,absolute stinker of a movie bordering on ruining the series luckily i am able to pretend nothing past the mandalorian ever happened others are not so fortunate
Nov 2 2020,negative,this film in my opinion sucked i am a big star wars fan so i was hyped for this film but my expectations went down the toilet first luke luke was meant to be a great jedi that never gives up but then we find out why he was in exile he was driven to the point of almost killing his nephew lost all his students and had great shame but instead of trying to fix this he just left and got other people to face the consequences of his actions then at the end he died of exhaustion and thats just total bs in cannon a jedi master not even as powerful as luke held a planet together yes he died doing so but thats a planet luke did a force facetime and died i think it was the right time to end lukes journey but they should of done it in a different way i think it was a really cool idea to show more to the star wars universe than weve seen before but the way that fin and rose sorry if i got the name wrong showed us the casino planet was really bad personally i couldnt be bothered what went on there i could barely care at all i have more to say but i think ive covered the main things
Nov 2 2020,positive,probably the most debated star wars movie to date ryon johnson director takes the franchise to unknown territorys our actors once again continue this new saga and take our characters into a new direction certain aspects of this films story work really well but sadly certain characters go on quests that are unnecessary i feel for a movie as long as this one there is a lot answered and a lot to be uncovered the movie is gorgeous to look at and once again the score is iconic we get a lot done here but something feels misplaced by the end that leaves us still thinking
Nov 2 2020,negative,the movie is chopped uninspiring does not introduce anything valuable just a few laser blasts on screen 
Nov 1 2020,negative,utter utter tosh this is some of the worst fakeitwhileyoumake it storytelling and sits awkward and disconnected from the rest of star wars in this ugly patchworkquilt story the run of three films perhaps flows a little better without inclusion of this middle episode but all feels very poorly thought out and is such a departure from the literary prowess of lucas heroes myth and legend generally feels like a showy bootleg ripoff of star wars but not star wars lacks substance depth and meaning
Oct 31 2020,negative,absolutely a horrible and pretentious film this is the worst star wars film ever made rian johnson has ruined his reputation
Oct 31 2020,negative,wasted lukes potential in the movie the force connection romance was cringy 2d characters stay long while the good ones disappear randomly twilight feels breaking established star wars canon what even was the plot development turned into harry potter all magic all the time
Oct 26 2020,positive,a true classic the last jedi is simply amazing its new and unpredictable after seeing rise of the skywalker i can affirm that this is the real ending of the skywalker saga with a spark of hope
Oct 26 2020,negative,rian johnson is more talented than this by far the worst star wars movie and phantom is pretty bad headscratching nonsensical scenes i have to assume things were meddled with too many cooks in the kitchen which is probably why ep 79 are all pretty bad esp episode 9 theres no way people signed on with a script that matched this final product  a ton of stuff was changed i think a movie about how badly these three films have been bungled would be more interesting than these three films have been    sw may not be as badly managed at disney as dc has been at warner brothers but it would benefit from being torn down and rebuilt with new people promising titles have been ruined by executive meddling and a general mess tarnishing a great brand very disappointing let jon favreau and dave filoni run things quick before the executives meddle with the mandalorian and ruin it too
Oct 26 2020,negative,a downright terrible film the critics are completely wrong
Oct 26 2020,positive,a garbage movie that is still extremely fun
Oct 25 2020,positive,best of the trilogy this film pushed each character forward in incredible ways and concluded lukes story in the physical realm at least beautifully it set up what couldve been an epic episode ix with ren as supreme leader  but jj just messed up everything the last jedi is visually the best star wars film and it has an amazing score one of the best star wars films of all time
Oct 25 2020,positive,i really liked it not as good as first thought but not as bad as people say
Oct 25 2020,negative,unfortunately disney star wars is hard for me to like  maybe the high expectations or just the lack of a plan it seemed disney had  idk but im thankful mandolorian is something i can enjoy
Oct 23 2020,negative,visually it is a great film amazing in fact but the storyline is shockingly bad there are so many annoying plot holes but the worst aspect is that its basically a ripoff of the original trilogy disappointing i also feel like daisy ridley isnt right for the part of rey she isnt convincing but i cant put my finger on why
Oct 23 2020,negative,complete garbage the plot of the film is not only incosistent and boring it also manages to destroy all the essence of star wars and of the skywalkers family
Oct 22 2020,positive,the last jedi diverts expectations but many plot threads are pointless and dont pay off in the long run
Oct 22 2020,negative,flashy thats about all
Oct 21 2020,positive,the movie is far from perfect but when i think about which star wars movies i wouldnt mind rewatching the list is  empire strikes back last jedi and then maybe binge the mandalorian
Oct 21 2020,negative,they ruined one of cinemas greatest heroes luke skywalker  this film is the biggest middle finger to george lucas and the star wars universe  rian johnsons writing amounts to a semiclever teenager using gotcha just kidding as the point of every plot action  there is no character development beyond the assassination of luke skywalker  leia is sidelined and misunderstood  the humor doesnt land  finns interesting character from force awakens is never delivered upon and he has another character lecture him about child slavery when he was a child slave for the first order  there is no skill in writing or respect paid to the source material  this is hands down one of the worst films i will ever have the displeasure of seeing
Oct 21 2020,negative,i dont know what the critics are smoking but it must be the good stuff
Oct 20 2020,negative,this is the worst star wars of them all i really love the star wars vibe since i was a little boy but how they treated one of the most iconic characters in movie history is a disgrace great parts of the movie are irrelevant to the plot it is suicide mission on suicide mission and another suicide mission and another this is the best those writers could come up with there even was a suicide mission to prevent a suicide mission come on
Oct 20 2020,positive,the second best star wars movie
Oct 19 2020,positive,a flawed yet entertaining star wars film the last jedi is the best film in the sequel trilogy this film is a great reminder of what star wars films used to be out of the ordinary with an original fresh plot while giving a fun introduction to some new interesting characters in fact that is this films biggest flaw while being so different that at times it doesnt feel like a star wars film at all which in it of itself is a great thing that the force awakens struggled with for example that whole canto bight sequence was a really fun scene but felt more like something that would appear in a marvel movie than a star wars movie but other than that this film does everything the force awakens got wrong right with an original unique plot great visuals character development and the perfect amount of star wars references this is a great film with an entertaining plot and is a perfect popcorn movie and in my opinion a fresh 810 film
Oct 16 2020,negative,naw this aint it chief
Oct 16 2020,negative,they joined the group didnt understand anything about it took over and chased out the founders where have i seen this happen before go figure
Oct 15 2020,negative,ive never felt so cheated and disappointed in a film in my entire life  pointless characters that serve no plot advancement or any sort of purpose  the opposite of star wars  i literally ordered the box set last week because i wanted to have an updated version of all the movies took this one out and burned it  atrocious
Oct 14 2020,negative,poorly written incoherent schizophrenic and trashes decades of star wars lore   a dumpster fire of a movie that i wish had never been created
Oct 13 2020,negative,star wars the last jedi honors the sagas rich legacy yes thats actually in the description of the movie that went and butchered great star wars characters  a movie that doesnt even try to make sense  bad writing and bad editing is just part of what makes this one of the greatest offenders to star wars  they really managed to grind every bit of that star wars awe i had since childhood
Oct 13 2020,negative,when considered a trash movie what it was maybe intended to be then it is quite a treasue
Oct 11 2020,negative,the script is devoid of logic all of the characters act like pouting children and this movie is a severe disservice to the star wars franchise
Oct 11 2020,negative,dont listen to the critics
Oct 11 2020,positive,to me this is the best of the star wars sequels by far it is the first star wars film since the prequels that attempted something new for the franchise and like its predecessors has had a similar fate in its reception    i would put the main problems with this film down to editing its a long movie with an overabundance of gags and plot points it almost feels like watching two films worth of storytelling in one film it lacks clear decisiveness at points and at other times i think it needed a stronger voice in the editing room keeping the boundaries in check if they had managed to smooth out these bumps along the way it could have been one of my favourite star wars movies of all time    this movie has so many ideas in it it is canned to the brim with ideas some amazing and a few not so much which makes it feel a little overcooked at times but when it gets it right it is in another league to jj abrams attempts whilst the legacy of the sequel trilogy will forever feel like a tug of war between two directors without a clear vision  i think its a shame we didnt get to see how rian johnson would have completed this story as the last jedi is the only notch in the story where new ideas are injected into this fairly tired franchise    we are what they grow beyond when yoda talks to luke towards the end of the movie he describes the burden of being a master as watching your pupils out grow you its a touching tribute to the fans who grew up with this franchise some now in their 50s for a film to show that luke is still struggling too and the hardships arent one day fixed it was a level of wisdom that truly caught me off guard     this film asks us to forget about skywalkers the force is around all of us its the vanity of the jedi to take credit for it  luke says at one point our main character isnt secretly of royal bloodline but their power comes from within    this film questions so many expectations of what a star wars movie could be but unfortunately i think it just juggled too many plot points and characters maybe its main flaw is its indecisive selfishness at the chance to be a star wars movie that it does too much is subsequently too long and closes too many story arcs that could have left the rise of skywalker with more to do it essentially has a lot of plot points in common with return of the jedi and essentially asks the question what would star wars 4 be about if the emperor died vader lived but he was still evil ultimately its largest failure as a movie was its final act it tossed away the baton at the start of the movie and handed the next director a bit of a dud
Oct 10 2020,positive,fucking awesome i loved so much of this movie despite what many people say i loved luke in this film he was interesting not just a yodaobiwan repeat people who say this is not luke are very wrong this is luke luke at the beginning is not luke at the end he has an arc the reason that hes back to square one after going through what he did in the original trilogy well this is a mostly spoiler free review youve probably already heard about luke in this movie so im just gonna say we see his transition we see why hes an angry old hermit so why do you complain about him going through the same arc he went through in the original trilogy when a its not the same arc and b we see what sets him back to square one i loved so many of the scenes in this movie tensionbuilding no matter what people say about this movie it undeniably subverts expectations everything is climactic the only thing worth why i took half a star from this review is the seven percent of the movie referring to the fact that this part of the movie takes up only seven percent of screen time is a certain part of the movie that proved to be completely pointless and it politically pandered a bit i may agree with those beliefs but to put realworld politics in a star wars film is ridiculous i love this movie nonetheless and by the way this movie doesnt break any lore just shut up
Oct 10 2020,negative,not supposed to be a comedy jjabrams must be sick seeing this after his masterful job on sw7
Oct 9 2020,negative,this movie is totally trash none of the story lines from the last movie was ever expanded on none of the characters has any actual development this is what you get when you let to incompetent directors make a movie in a trilogy without a coherent outline i only gove this an 12 star because i cant give it anything lower honestly the movie rubber was way berrer an had a better plot
Oct 9 2020,negative,holly cow batman the script is full of horrible cliché dialogue i found it simply excruciating to watch finn and rose go on a stupid side quest to find a codebreaker and it leads nowhere they turn luke into a jedi chump and a shell of a man the worst part of the movie for me was the mary popins treat meant of leia and i felt insulted who tries to kill their mother over all a horrible movie i think this will be the last new star wars movie i will ever watch just horrible only watch it if your inn need of a star wars fix its by far the worst star wars movie out of all of them
Oct 9 2020,negative,by far the worst star wars movie ever
Oct 3 2020,positive,its parts are kind of boring but even so it manages to get really excited and it has tense scenes that keep you in the story and give new opportunities to old characters
Sep 28 2020,negative,absolute garbage i cant believe people say this is one of the best star wars movie i could write a 10 page essay on why this movie sucks but ill try to condense it all into this small review finn and rose are given nothing to do poe is unlikeable holdo is a terrible and stupid leader leia is in a coma half of the movie and that space scene with her is the stupidest thing ive seen rey gets no training and is already a master jedi and she only cries for 5 seconds after learning her parents are nobody the canto bight segment is useless the first order is a laughable joke the plot copies empire strikes back and return of the jedi in loads of ways the most creative thing rian johnson can come up for a star wars is a slow chase scene it does little to expand the universe luke is so out of character with his actions and dialogue its overly long and it barely continues the story and despite a movie about failure no learns anything or deals with the consequences of failure congratulations rian johnson now from a filmmaking standpoint its outstanding but excellent filmmaking isnt enough to save an awful story and if it wasnt for that id give this 05 stars i cant believe people say this is the best sw movie since empire the only parts that i can see people defending is the stuff with kylo luke and rey but that only takes 40 of the movie and its mostly executed badly d i dont think a movie has angered me as much as this one not even the last airbender fk this movie worst sw movie by far
Sep 27 2020,positive,ok so i dont think it deserves five stars but it absolutely does not deserve 43 so im trying to bring the value up a bit yeah some of the characterization was wack and yeah theres a lot that the film could have done better but it was still really fun to watch i think they did a pretty good job with showing the inner struggle between the two protagonists especially with the imagery i also think that the film was just really beautiful there were some not so great moments but this film really doesnt deserve the slander that it got
Sep 26 2020,negative,ryan johnson visions of star wars destroying the canon badest movie in the franchise
Sep 26 2020,positive,ah yes the 2nd installment in the star wars sequels i hated this movie at first couldnt quite get a good review on it but its a pretty good and enjoyable movie there are some things i dont agree with but the movie is all enjoyable    director rian johnson did good on this movie added new characters new planets new theories and a lot of new elements that were not in force awakens the reason rian did this is to add new story elements that were not in jjs plans which i want to disagree with but its a film in the end    i would still give the film 45 stars for great cg great direction in the film great director and great music
Sep 23 2020,negative,terrible utter disrespect for the main character of the saga
Sep 22 2020,positive,while still mediocre this is a worthy addition to star wars many if not all characters remain interestingintimidating the visuals are once again top notch and the music is once again a john williams classic snoke is horribly written but well acted and reys training under luke is the best part of the film rose while overall a waste of time is a much better character than many give her credit for and phasma had potential to be a true villain meanwhile hux is rendered idiotic and weak which is sad as i was looking forward to more of his powerfully worded evil speeches
Sep 20 2020,positive,i thought it was amazing a very good movie some bad things like what they di with luke but otherwise it was pretty good
Sep 20 2020,negative,they didnt build off of the characters previously given killed everyone of any importance or mystery it felt like introduced characters that had and retained no emotional connection and it was just slow boring and not entertaining    im a massive star wars fan and this just looked like a movie made by someone who was texting and not paying attention while they were watching the movies
Sep 20 2020,negative,i love star wars i fing hate this movie  with its chaotic storyline poor plot lame characterization of characters both new and old dull dialogue lack of original ideas and edgy i can make an original storyline and circumvent expectations attitude it was an annoying experience it also add nothing interesting to the star wars universe also annoying is that there was parts and characters that had potential such as finns stormtrooper redeption captain phasma as a villain but it never took the opportunity to develop them visual effects were nice but definitely not enough to save it     it felt like disney was pushing out a film that would please critics and families but ignore and frustrate fans of the franchise
Sep 20 2020,negative,my main problem was the whole ultraslow speed chase which is much of the movie  he wrote himself into a corner by inventing new tracking technology obviously they could have had some ships jump to hyperspace and come out from the other side and crush them within seconds but most of the movie is just waiting for them to get within firing range and they shooting them one by one horrible writing meanwhile finn and rose have all the time to go chill at the casino get arrested break out with the code breaker get back and still they are just barely catching up absolute shit writing really kind of ruined star wars  force awakens was pretty good and rise of skywalker was good but had to try to fix what last jedi did and it was unfixable because he essentially broke it  they have to redo the last two movies at least
Sep 20 2020,negative,this was the worst spent two and a half hours of my life
Sep 16 2020,negative,characters that were set up for great development were cast aside for new characters with no character     the worst star wars film
Sep 15 2020,negative,this movie is so forgettable  theres not much to say people hate it and some people love it  yoda does something that destroys information that could help others but his explanation is that rey already knows lukes character is debatably destroyed  the message of this movie is to destroy the past
Sep 15 2020,positive,has great some scenes but first half is too slow
Sep 15 2020,positive,this is the movie that builds the climax for the finale it opens more questions
Sep 15 2020,negative,the worst star wars film ever made the plot is unbelievably awful and pointless
Sep 13 2020,negative,utter garbage proving that force awackens wasnt an accident again repeating the weird choice to parallel motives from the original thrilogie this time from episode 5 without any coherent story between these or reason for that even when it doesnt rip of and think of something itself it is confusing at best and insulting to both fans and the general intelligence of its viewers
Sep 12 2020,negative,this movie is just the worst star wars movie the galaxy has ever seen plot is just long and boring and the final battle is bad ripoff of the battle of hoth while the overpowered rey gets called a jedi after some medetation she can do more after a few days then luke could after months this movie should like the live action avatar the last airbender movie be something fans dont want to hear or mention
Sep 12 2020,positive,just brilliant i wish it was more appreciated
Sep 11 2020,negative,disrespects the entire franchise hate it
Sep 10 2020,positive,not quite 5 but it wasnt far away  been catching up with these in late 2020 having just watched the sad effort that was rogue 1 what a let down was that  but this one picked up nicely although the story launch and the draggedout business with luke on his faraway hideout took far too long to do their stuff  that said thats my only real beef with this one  which overall left me thinking this might just be the best of the entire bunch so far certainly this was better than its predecessor by no narrow margin  after rey left to join the action the pace really picked up nicely and did so well enough so that any plot holes these might have been there went unnoticed  except perhaps just why luke was so intent on nothelping when he eventually made it so irrevocably evident that he was more than able to step right up to the mark and deliver that was bad and silly writing  but you have to keep a little forgiveness when considering the overall effect of these movie entertainments instead of jumping up and down in artificial rage just because you can online and generally get away with it scotfree  for example  in the lotr flicks  and indeed in the books why did sam and frodo struggle over all those many weary dangerous miles when we see that master gandalf could whistle up giant eagles as carriers to do that job instead  not a criticism ive ever seen anyone make you need to retain some mercy in reviews  extend the same courtesy to these sw films which with this one i really didnt feel too needful because the overall result was so eminently satisfactory  i see theres a big gap on here between pro writers and amateurs of which latter im most certainly one  but my 45 stars stands  this is a damn good film and might be my favourite of the entire series  which before sitting down to watch this i did not expect to happen  reasonably well written by the standard of such flicks well enough performed with fire and enthusiasm although bad guy snoke had quite the stupidest name of any star wars villain yet encountered and the worst complexion
Sep 9 2020,positive,no this movie did not kill your childhood nor is it a flawless masterpiece the last jedi tugs in both directions at points but it deserves respect for trying something new in the star wars universe but every time the film is remarkable there is an equally trivial and stupid scene
Sep 8 2020,positive,i didnt hate it like the majority did but it had a lot of flaws porgs are great though
Sep 8 2020,positive,more original than episode 7 but it has bad jokes
Sep 4 2020,positive,let me start off by saying that this movie is nowhere near as bad as some people say it is this movie has some things that arent ideal but its not a horrible movie by any means id say its actually quite good its certainly no masterpiece like some people make it out to be but its not bad either this is a movie that is trying to say a lot but it isnt really the best at saying all of those things clearly ill start off by saying that luke skywalker in this movie is perfect i absolutely love his arc and his is by far the most complete in the entire movie i know some people really dont like it but id ask them this if luke was just like yoda in empire then the movie would have been boring and uninteresting this movie gives luke a completely new story to explore and it lets us see his redemption in every way we would expect it to be many will bring up the argument that why would the most hopeful person in the galaxy the only person who thought there was good in darth vader his father would try to kill a kid well in the movie we see that it was only a brief thought for luke and he regretted it instantly it wasnt something that he was dead set on doing for a long time it was just something that he impulsively did which is totally in character for him now that weve gotten my favorite character in this movie out of the way lets talk about a very strange one finn was one of the best parts of the force awakens and his arc was incredibly interesting i think that rian johnson misunderstood finns role in this movie finn gets the same arc to explore in this movie that he did in the last one finn the stormtrooper shouldnt be learning that war affects children and is bad he already knows this rose should not be teaching finn that war is bad we have a character that needs to learn that war is bad and thats poe dameron hes a hot head and he likes to blow stuff up what better character to show him that thats not always the best solution than the former stormtrooper thats not what we got and instead we have rose and finn switching gears here the acting is pretty good and the writing is also pretty good rey and kylos force projection powers were pretty interesting and made for a good dynamic between the characters i really liked both in the force awakens and this movie as well they were incredibly interesting and kylo specifically was very complex and added to his character a lot snoke dying was perfect because he was never the main antagonist kylo ren was snoke dies to push kylos character forward its really nice how everything works out and the throne room battle really is amazing i also really like how reys parents were nobodies because it really makes the force seem mysterious again we always expect her to be related to someone big in the series which of course she is but at this point they were headed in the direction im talking about but now we can see that the force can flow through anybody strongly and i thought that that was great i also really liked lukes death in front of the twin suns its a perfect death for the character and its the only way i would accept ifwhen he did die with everything said i think that this movie is good and i dont really understand why so many people hated it i think that one day people will look back on this movie differently as something that really had a lot of potential and is a lot better than everyone originally thought i like this movie and i think that its worth a watch from any star wars fan
Sep 4 2020,negative,this film destroys the character of luke and in doing so destroys the star wars saga it is one of the worse sequels ever made truly abysmal a waste of time effort and money from start to finish pointless stick with the original trilogy and youll be fine
Sep 3 2020,positive,i didnt enjoy this movie a lot but i did much more than i did with rise of skywalker  this movie makes much more sense the action is better and the character development is way better  i didnt like finn and rose romance and leias flying but other parts are ok
Sep 1 2020,negative,maybe im being too nice with my review i cackled at a few parts in the movie because i couldnt believe what i was seeing i dont enjoy hating on movies so ill keep this brief i dont like it it just felt off to me im not convinced that rian johnson watched the force awakens i will say that i find the cinematography to be great along with the vfx so props to rian johnson for that not good
Sep 1 2020,positive,loved this movie the last jedi was the best liveliest star wars movie since empire and to honestly demand that the series adhere to the narrowest possible parameters for what a star wars movie can be is everything wrong with mainstream filmmaking today the fanboys who hated this movie and boy are there a lot need to seriously seek a therapist and get their brains checked out my only gripe was roses characterization but its become pretty minor for me now given the way the rise of skywalker made her a side character again kylo ren and poe dameron are the best characters in this movie and it was great they are my favourite characters of this new trilogy the fan outcry is stupid and i love what rian johnson did with this movie genuinely enjoyed all of it it made you care about the characters themselves and not about who rey is related to or focusing on characters like snoke or anything around that every plot point you think is going to be important for this movie they take it and slap it in your face and they make you focus on just the characters except stupid fan outcry plot points which is why the audience rating is overall so low but realistically for anyone who has a brain this movie is the best of the new trilogy and one of the better overall star wars movies in the whole franchise the scale was amazing the cinematography was amazing and the plot points tease you and then tell you to screw off and i loved every moment of it this is the best movie of the new trilogy and i can say that with full confidence i dont care about these idiot fanboys who are daft enough to enjoy what rian johnson gave us because this movie is epic beautifully shot and incredible the characterization is next level they make every stupid set up from episode 7 irrelevant and i loved every minute of this movie 55
Sep 1 2020,negative,i cant believe they allowed this movie to happen ive given it multiple watches to be able to maybe change my mind but this is easily the worst of the sequel trilogy if the prequels didnt exist this would have been the worst    this movie disrupts to story line and tone without explanation or taking it anywhere things just happen for the sake of happening in this one how this has as high of a score is beyond me there is very little redeeming about this movie      forgettable movie
Aug 30 2020,positive,it could be better so i dont know what to expect
Aug 30 2020,positive,the last jedi takes the star wars universe in a completely different and rich direction it tests the very ideology of the franchise and is filled with intricate and undeniably beautiful and relevant arcs from leadership to heroism from choosing a side to knowing who you are the lessons learned by the audience and the characters of this film flow freely yet intertwine together in a way not many other films can pull off     rian johnson had ambition with this film he wanted to make a statement to create something worthy of the title star wars to make fans question all they knew about it to make them think to make them believe again to give them hope the force awakens was a dream come true a fun fairytale acting as a gateway to a new era of star wars the last jedi is reality what represents star wars truly alongside the originals rjs understanding of not only the messages george lucas portrayed but also the potential and opportunity he held within his own hands was much more so than that of jj abrams he looked at the franchise and thought how can i make this legendary how can i make my film not simply a facade of what this franchise is but the rich contents of what it can be what it should be and in my opinion he succeeded in a way only george lucas could the difference between him and george however was that george didnt have any expectations placed on him any diehard fans to live up to while rian had all of that and more and the thing is he lived up to those expectations by not living up to them he didnt care about what fans wanted or what they had all wrote in their heads he cared about the saga about moving star wars forward about writing a good story and he did just that
Aug 30 2020,negative,honestly  kinda terrible the writers have no idea what a character arc means      certain characters who had incredible potential from a story perspective have nothing but yelling to contribute where is the character development      the 90 of critics who liked this movie dont know what they are talking about
Aug 29 2020,negative,jj needs to be stopped please dont let him near another beloved franchise
Aug 28 2020,negative,im an enormous star wars fan and have been my entire life i had opening night tickets with my dad who saw the original star wars in theaters i had reserved the perfect seats this ended up being the only star wars film i havent rewatched it ruined just about everything the power and legacy of luke skywalker who tried to kill his student in his sleep threw away his old lightsaber for a laugh brushed his shoulders off for a laugh and had just enough force power to project himself this movie destroyed the power and legacy of leia who is now more of a nice grandma type then a force imbued leader of the rebellion it destroyed the lightsaber literally it destroyed just about everything to be honest that said i enjoyed the salt scene up until the point where luke brushes off his shoulder and despite all of the mistakes in the throne room scene disappearing weapon smith acolyte throwing his weapon to the side so he can die etc i found it fun to watch overall i found the movie visually striking and tried to take that into account when rating this movie i think if it was a standalone it would deserve about 4 stars because of the acting and cinematography but would fall short on the script but as a member of the skywalker saga it deserved 0 stars so 2 stars it is
Aug 27 2020,positive,this is the worst kylo ren movie there is a cool fight in the sand where the sand turns red when he steps in it good unfortunately half of the movie is wasted on an island casino resort with horses going everywhere and boring side characters that never become relevant they also kill the alien snope who was telling kylo ren what to do so theres no big bad for the last movie problematic and an old man on a different island turns into sand and dies and it turns out he was a ghost the whole time he was fighting you only find out after the movie that he was from the old star wars movies and then only if you ask 5 stars for kylo ren minus 2 stars for wasting my time with unexplained plot points and randos
Aug 26 2020,positive,this film has a lot of issues but i can deal with it i dont think this film is as bad as what most star wars fans said about this film for the most part it was a decent sequel but its my least favorite film of the sequel trilogy
Aug 26 2020,positive,the last jedi is one of those movies that i think is gonna have a more positive outlook on it in the future as potentially the best of the sequels much like empire strikes back for the original trilogy the film is adventurous offers a new outlook on the star wars galaxy and mythos and was honestly the only film in the sequels trilogy to develop any of its main characters rey from an aspiring force sensitive rebel to an actual jedi finn from someone who wanted to run away from it all to someone willing to die for the resistance poe from someone wanting to get the job done to someone who realizes that the lives of others and his comrades are why he fights and kylo ren from a darth vader idolizer to the supreme leader of the first order and wanting to carve his own legacy separate from his namesake its also visually stunning and maybe the best looking star wars movie all the set pieces shot angles framing and editing are all very tight and flow well ultimately this is a very well made film despite its divisive content according to the fanbase
Aug 25 2020,negative,simply a mess from beginning to end the story moves nowhere i simply cant believe how low peoples standards have fallen talking about storytelling and movies
Aug 25 2020,positive,with charm and wit star wars the last jedi unites the past and present as it looks toward the future
Aug 23 2020,positive,as we know the force is female
Aug 23 2020,positive,as star wars films go i find last jedi middle of the road i dont find it highly offensive the way the people that loathe this movie do nor do i think its anywhere close to cinematic brilliance which a lot of other people seem to claim yes how luke is handled is offensive and frustrating and it undoes much of what force awakens set up even though it was a weak setup due to abrams overreliance on his mystery box method of storytelling which favors setting up mysteries but never seems to stick the landing well it wastes actors and their characters on plots that ultimately do nothing to grow them it sidelines the agency of the three new heroes and robs them of a chance at a strong character arc    what this film did right though was it structured itself very well around its central themes let the past die failure as a teacher and from a purely constructionist standpoint it was very well done unfortunately this sort of mythdeconstructing arc does not sit well in the star wars franchise and will ultimately be seen as a misstep for the franchise along with the rest of the trilogy including the much much worse rise of skywalker    there must be purpose behind subverting the audiences expecations and when you do decide to go that route its a much harder job to nail the execution last jedi plays at greatness but ultimately fumbles the ball one can commend johnson and the studio for taking the chance unlike the safe retread of force awakens but the failure ultimately fractured an already fractious builtin audience
Aug 22 2020,negative,disgraceful the treatment of luke is
Aug 21 2020,negative,pretty pathetic for a studio with so much resources at its disposal but i guess you cant buy talent in any given position especially when making a good story isnt the primary objective from mom jokes to universe breaking physics this movie was a mess that fits into the star wars saga like a 2x4 in a 1000 piece monet jigsaw puzzle 
Aug 20 2020,neutral,very indifferent that is all it deserves
Aug 18 2020,negative,hated what they did to luke skywalker could hardly recognise him cos rian changed him so much and other than that the film just wasnt fun or exciting and didnt feel like a star wars film i suppose the plot was ok ish just for the majority of the film has most of the cast inside a resistance ship and no one is really doing anything exciting terrible film worst of the saga wouldnt recommend
Aug 18 2020,negative,i saw this twice in theaters just to make suer the first time i came out sad and confused the second time i just came out angry this was not star wars and it hurt
Aug 17 2020,positive,the best star wars movie it takes the fans builtup expectations and plays with them it challenges the viewer and thats the genius of rian johnson the story is beautiful  every character gets challenged i can identify with rey a lot  she has to face the fact that shell have to build herself up instead of getting an easy way out of her identity crisis this movie is about the power of the past the value of nostalgia versus taking a step forward if youre not the kind who only wants pistol fights new merch and old stunts out of star wars then youll enjoy this movie a lot
Aug 17 2020,positive,subversive take on the star wars franchise but in the end irritating and pointless
Aug 16 2020,negative,epic betrayal to the fans and the creator george lucas rian and kennedy should be ashamed for putting such garbage into the digital universe
Aug 16 2020,negative,the last jedi throws out the known laws of the star wars universe and completely fails to build upon its predecessor movie the force awakens and becomes its own thing despite being the second movie in an established trilogy leaving fans who were interested in learning more of teased characters and plot lines from the force awakens to be dissatisfied and even disappointed     repeat after me  you do not kill the main established villain in the middle of a trilogy unless you have a plan for what to do in the next movie   you do not kill the main established villain in the middle of a trilogy unless you have a plan for what to do in the next movie   you do not kill the main established villain in the middle of a trilogy unless you have a plan for what to do in the next movie   you do not kill the main established villain in the middle of a trilogy unless you have a plan for what to do in the next movie   you do not kill the main established villain in the middle of a trilogy unless you have a plan for what to do in the next movie   you do not kill the main established villain in the middle of a trilogy unless you have a plan for what to do in the next movie   you do not kill the main established villain in the middle of a trilogy unless you have a plan for what to do in the next movie   you do not kill the main established villain in the middle of a trilogy unless you have a plan for what to do in the next movie
Aug 16 2020,positive,thats right im one of those people who didnt hate the last jedi so much that i sent a death threat to rian johnson saying that he destroyed my childhood and ruined star wars in fact i kinda loved it of course its not a perfect movie so ill state its flaws first 1 the pacing is inconsistent at times but that doesnt completely destroy the movies pacing overall 2 the humor doesnt always work half of the time it does and half of the time it doesnt but even though it sometimes doesnt work rian johnson really just wants you to have a good time this movie was made and written to not only be enjoyed by star wars fans but also nonstar wars fans and i think he does a good job at this now let me get into the good things and the great things about this movie 1 the music has always been great in star wars movies but this probably has my favorite score out of all the star wars movies especially when luke appears at the rebels old base at the end 2 finally the cinematography in a star wars movie is actually really beautiful and isnt boring to look at the music and cinematography in fact compliment each other very well in this movie and i dont think this movie would be the same without it 3 i thought that the action in this movie was actually really cool and simple like the force awakens we dont have or even need any overcomplicated lightsaber fights that drag on forever people criticize the red guards fight scene a lot but i think that its actually really cool to watch 4 this movie had the most intense moment of any star wars movie hand down if you dont know what the heck im talking about its when admiral holdo sacrifices herself by going straight through the first orders ships by going into hyperspeed that was just insane i dont know how else to describe it 5 ben solos arc and reys arc are great in this movie ben solo overcoming snokes dark side control is so awesome and original then rey realizing that her parents were nobodies and still continuing to be a loyal and heartfelt person is awesome as well 6 lukes arc is probably the best character arc in the entire skywalker saga he went from hiding in shame on an island in the middle of nowhere to saving the resistance by finally facing his nephew the one person who hes been afraid to face for years also after luke shows up to finally face him nobody else dies for the rest of the movie except for luke he also doesnt hurt or harm ben in any way hes a simple distraction until the resistance escapes this is how a jedi should go down not in violence or vain but in peace and acceptance like obiwan in a new hope 7 this is the first star wars movie in a while to actually take risks and make it work the idea that a person can be a jedi and still come from nobody is a great and original idea a sith lord who is being pulled to the light side of the force instead of the dark side is something that we havent seen before the fact that the force can make two people physically touch is something thats kinda new theres so many new things in this movie that they actually turn into risks but most of those risks are executed very well unlike the prequels but for some reason star wars fans hates that disney is trying something new with this trilogy and cant accept the fact that they are actually making these movies good and are instead expecting them to be horrible 8 usually whenever i watch a star wars movie there is always a part in the movie whenever i get really bored and tired but with the last jedi i was never bored and every scene in this movie was either a really interesting to watch or b fun to watch i was hooked on this movie all the way until the end 9 ive never felt this much emotion in a star wars movie since return of the jedi for the first time in a long time i was actually emotionally connected with the characters it was so refreshing to care about star wars characters again  again this movie does have flaws and its not a perfect movie however this movie is a great star wars movie and it has a lot of strengths that people blindly overlook because of their pure hatred for this movie
Aug 15 2020,negative,as just a movie it was kind of good i guess but the problem is this was not supposed to be just a movie it was supposed to be a star wars movie and as that it failed in many ways with all my problems with this movie my biggest one is that lukes character was completely destroyed in the first movies he always had hope and he never gave up in this movie he is shown as this depressed retired old man in a mountain for some reason remember how obi wan tells luke how important light sabers are well in this movie he when rey hands him the light saber he basically just throws it away
Aug 15 2020,negative,the plot was all over the place it was a piece of crap
Aug 14 2020,negative,this movie is bad it had so much potentional force awakens was so awesome and this just wrecked the sequel trilogy let me list my reason why first off the luke and rey scene sucked luke just threw the lightsaber how stupid is that the moment people have been waiting for for 2 years ruined then the whole scene is just luke being a big wimp they shouldve made him like yoda wise like a true jedi no just some wimp that doesnt believe in jedi anymore second off we have snoke snoke was such a wasted character he was supposed to be the palpatine of the sequel trilogy but instead they showed nothing of him at all and he just died from a lightsaber being stabbed in him how stupid is that he shouldve been the final boss like how they made palpatine that in the original trilogy finally we have the worst thing about this movie the whole thing with finn and rose rose is a completely useless character that did nothing at all and the whole thing she was doing with finn was sooo boring it was like solo a star wars story which was also boring and bland this whole side thing with finn and rose was completely stupid and had nothing to do with the story like no one cares this has nothing to do with anything wow they found this random guy that no ones going to remember and now he is a traitor this whole movie is a disappointment to the sequel trilogy 
Aug 14 2020,negative,the entire film was a gotcha the plot twists so much and so frequently that you arent surprised by the end it also completely changes the characters as we once knew them from the first 6 movies such that it seems like they are different people entirely the fight scenes werent great either with so many small errors that you wonder if the actors were prepared at all to do fight scenes this movie and trilogy disrespects star wars as it once was
Aug 13 2020,negative,a terrible movie allaround the characters are bland and uninteresting though calling them characters is a stretch luke skywalker a beloved character has been utterly butchered to the point of being unrecognizable i left the cinema disappointed and with two questions what on earth was ryan johnson smoking when he made this trash heap of a movie and where can i get some literal garbage id give 05 if i could
Aug 13 2020,negative,this movie does not honor the legacy of star wars and instead defacates all over it
Aug 12 2020,positive,a movie with lots of action but not faithful to the franchise
Aug 12 2020,negative,my childhood was defined by star wars     this movie ruined my childhood
Aug 12 2020,negative,regardless of how disappointed i was in the other star wars trilogy episode 13 i have never fell asleep on a star wars movie until this movie it felt like 4play with no climax whatsoever this franchise has become a money grabbing embarrassment the book to any movie is usually better but this is just ridiculous in fact disney or whoever has the control took some of the most interesting stories and took them out of the cannon i think im done with this irritated beyond belief so i know real star wars heads are probably po
Aug 10 2020,positive,as someone who isnt a star wars fan to watch jj abrams set up a dull trilogy in force awakens was yawn inducing as i noticed every beat the final installment would have to hit when he returned to direct and i was not excited for this and i imagine neither was rian johnson god bless him when you allow a director to do anything in the middle installment and to watch him do just that destroying the road map by evaporating the pieces set up for the next film that were essential in this won made me watch with a mischievous grin at the 2 12 hours of anarchy its like if the no i am your father moment was stretched out into an entire film and thats why its my favorite to date 910
Aug 9 2020,negative,a movie made for kids but with adult themes strange choice
Aug 9 2020,negative,the worst star wars movie but mark hamills acting is very good
Aug 9 2020,positive,so many reviews here say that it is either brilliant or it sucks i think its just good admittedly not the greatest star wars movie nevertheless it was something fresh and different with no death stars it really felt that after a long time star wars was going in a new direction that i liked such a shame it was undermined by the rise of skywalker it could have been a four and a half but the racing and casino sequence was boring and unneeded
Aug 7 2020,negative,it had so much potential a story about questioning the light and the dark side and the rules of the jedi could have been interesting  but this movie does it poorly  disrespects the star wars legacy  boring and uninteresting
Aug 7 2020,negative,i honestly cant even describe everything wrong with this movie    i will say it broke my heart in a bad way
Aug 4 2020,negative,movie was nonsense lots of plot holes and plot conveniences that dont make sense
Aug 4 2020,negative,this movie is completely disrespectful to the entire star wars brand
Aug 2 2020,negative,it ruined the legacy of the old characters to allow for the new characters to take over when really they shouldve passed the torch to the new characters instead of ruining what came before and force everyone to like the new characters
Aug 1 2020,negative,they broke the universe as harshly as they broke my heart terrible acting awful story
Aug 1 2020,positive,i really liked this movies besides the finn and rose sideplot other than that i thought it was really good i thought the bond formed between kylo ren and rey was well done i also thought the change in him at the end was done really well i just really didnt like the stupid casino world adventure too much going on
Jul 31 2020,negative,such a wasted opportunity
Jul 31 2020,negative,easily the worst star wars film 
Jul 29 2020,negative,its simply the greatest disappointment ive ever experienced in movie theater it breaks my heart just thinking about what it couldve been so sad
Jul 28 2020,negative,i would give this movie no stars but the option isnt available  its hard to know where to begin in detailing all the terrible horrible decisions made in this film that ultimately killed a multi billion dollar franchise  this horrible deconstructing mess of a film should never have seen the light of day  it completely missed everything that is great about star wars while simultaneously stealing away what we all loved  one can only hope that rian johnson and kathleen kennedy are never let near a star wars movie againnot that it matters  ria killed star wars
Jul 28 2020,neutral,marked the end for what we all knew and loved
Jul 26 2020,negative,i give it to ryan johnson for at least trying to make a different movie then the rest of the star wars films however he did it in a way that completely split to fans there are some that truly loved the movie while others hated it i thought it was between ireallydontlikeit and itwasehhhh
Jul 25 2020,negative,the issue with the last jedi is that the concept shouldnt have been executed whatsoever if this was another trilogy or franchise the script could have worked to a mediocre level but this is star wars probably the most beloved series of all time star wars deserved better and so did its fans killing luke ruining og characters and killing off potential for new characters and having a mary sue as a main protagonist did the series no justice whatsoever
Jul 25 2020,positive,its really good but i was sad that luke died he was my favorite
Jul 24 2020,negative,worst movie of the entire series star wars universe is unrecognizable at this point
Jul 22 2020,negative,this movie completely ignores the existence of the previous movie and ends all plot lines before they could get off the ground it also has a pointless side story also it kills off the series new palpatine without giving him any backstory and still having a whole other movie to fill the only good thing about this movie was the beautiful shots of the island
Jul 22 2020,positive,the last jedi is a rule breaker   unlike the force awakens it completely changes course of following a familiar framework and takes an unpredictable course this obviously blew uncomfortable steam up elite star wars fans skirts but im undeterred in review in saying that is a movie that whilst being an entertaining space blockbuster it has a lot of compelling writing that needed to happen in the franchise
Jul 21 2020,negative,first im not a sequel hater  i gave tfa a very good score and ros a pretty decent score  i really enjoyed both of those movies  i also really enjoy several of rian johnsons other films  knives out was a very enjoyable movie where he subverted expectations at every turn and looper too for that matter  i just dont know quite what happened with this movie  yes he tried to go his own direction and subvert expectations about 3 or 4 too many times but beyond that the movie fluctuates between being a silly slapstick comedy a boring low speed chase snoozefest intercut with some incredible scenes and story telling    lukes a curmudgeony old guy  ok i can live with that  theres a weird force link between kylo and rey  thats actually fresh and cool  kylo and his squadron of ties almost destroy the resistance fleet and then instead of sending more fighters to the attack and finishing them off are instead called back so the first order can wait for them to run out of fzzzzzzz    if i was uneasy with the silly assault on the dreadnaught and the slapstick dialogue from poe then this is where i just couldnt keep my eyes from rolling back in my head  it just it makes no sense  so many things about this movie make no sense  some people have said that about rise of skywalker and there are certainly some fair points there but it just seems like so many motivations for plot points and characters feels completely wrong    i really have no problem with the first and third movies of the new trilogy i really just didnt like this one  sorry rian
Jul 20 2020,positive,the least bad out of the sequels in my opinion at least this one takes a certain amount of risk rather than simply relying on nostalgia towards the originals still for those who call this a bold movie i should tell you that this movie is not really that bold and risky it copies off many elements from empire strikes back and return of the jedi especially the former the movie could have gotten good if rey and kylo ren teamed up to rule the galaxy but rian johnson wasnt willing to be that risky and take the story in a completely new direction     i have many issues with the movie the finnrose subplot on a casino planet was a waste of time and served only to insert a outofplace political message about animal cruelty the poe subplot makes no sense since holdo could have just told him her plan or at least assure him that she had a plan if its such a secret i dont like what was done to lukes character since his character arc towards a wise powerful jedi was so beautifully done in the original trilogy if luke is going to be cynical when rey meets him at should at least turn back into the hero we love by the end of the movie and join the resistance instead he just helps them escape a momentary difficult situation and then dies his death by the way makes reys mission to find him a complete failure also the humor in this movie was really bad and outofplace    the dynamic between rey and kylo ren was the best part of the movie the force connection between them was a cool idea i just wish it was used to take the story in a new direction i think this is still a wellmade movie and rian johnson is a good director my issues are mainly with the choices in the plot and the lack of originality
Jul 19 2020,positive,its star wars of course i love it
Jul 19 2020,negative,very bad movie these are not star wars
Jul 18 2020,negative,i have seen this movie one time thats not a good thing
Jul 17 2020,negative,the 90 rating is insane it is the worst star wars film you will ever see
Jul 16 2020,positive,an absolute masterpiece why everyone hates it is beyond me easily the strongest and deepest star wars film
Jul 14 2020,negative,so bad it hurts all three are garbage what were they thinking rogue one is by far my favorite new sw film the rest should be forgotten and redone right
Jul 13 2020,positive,much more slow moving than other star wars movies not bad but one of the worst of the saga
Jul 12 2020,negative,theres no way luke skywalker would be a whiney pessimistic guy  this is one way to kill off a strong character
Jul 12 2020,negative,chuck a bowl of monthold alphabet soup on a wall and know that whatever you end up with will always be more compelling than this trainwreck of a script
Jul 10 2020,negative,dont see it trash of a movie
Jul 10 2020,negative,terrible flick a shot right through the heart of star wars
Jul 10 2020,negative,this movie has everything that you could ever not want the plot holes within it are frustrating at best the pacing left it feeling longer than bvs the only logic i can produce for many choices of characters is pis plot induced stupidity on the subject of the plot it also is a flawed i would rate it a little higher but for now it is the only movie that has made me audibly groan in theaters and was bad enough to make me quit on a franchise i was invested in if some other movie manages this i will consider moving up the rating
Jul 9 2020,positive,this movie was a bold and fresh move that set up some amazing character archs and unexpected twists its not without its problems but the bigger picture is so well crafted and it has the best cinematic shot in the star wars canon
Jul 9 2020,negative,far too many things made no sense i get disney made and sold books to explain everything about the movie after the movie came out which is a horrible way to make a movie but i went to see a movie not see a movie  buy a book plus even after answering several questions in the book the story still was not a good one if disneys and rians plan was to kill the past then they really should have come up with an original story with all original characters instead of having the original characters come out and not be themselves except for han who gets killed off
Jul 9 2020,negative,this movie is a disgrace to star wars the prequels were better than this
Jul 6 2020,negative,worst star wars movie ever rian johnson is to star wars as joel schumacher is to batman they destroyed their franchises  hoping it will be made legend and the fans get a do over
Jul 6 2020,neutral,ok movie but horrible star wars movie
Jul 5 2020,negative,horrible rian johnson killed star wars
Jul 5 2020,negative,just painful what a shame disney destroyed a franchise
Jul 4 2020,negative,why  why was this movie made why did no one come in and stop the director  it just defies all logic  from the very beginning this movie was doomed i really dont think the director has ever seen a star wars movie before
Jul 3 2020,positive,dont understand the hate great movie
Jul 2 2020,negative,pretty bad and very disappointing doesnt respect what came before it and removes all intrigue from the trilogy great visuals and acting though however people are still totally overreacting to it giving it 110 because it ruined star wars is ignorant and naive
Jul 1 2020,negative,shouldve been straight to disney chanel the critics mustve been watching a differnt movie then i was because this was trash 
Jun 30 2020,negative,this is easily one of the worst science fiction movies ive ever seen and to be perfectly honest it ruined star wars for me i have been a fan of the series since i was four and watched every movie repeatedly until last jedithis movie ruined the series ruined continuity ruined the setting and insulted the audiences intelligence on so many levels its almost tearjerking ironically this was called last jedi having driven away most of the fanbase from the series
Jun 29 2020,negative,shit i hated it god it was a waste of money
Jun 28 2020,negative,this is the worst movie ive ever seen
Jun 28 2020,positive,not being a big fan of most of the space wizard franchise i really like the newer movies e7 rogue one    not only does this have a great production value and great directorial choices the actors are perfect for their roles    the writing is fairly good the worst bits being the classic space wizards stuff where entire civilizations are being commanded because some super powered teen is cranky    sure it has some problems but is overall very good and i not only look forward to the sequel but watching it and the 79 trilogy again
Jun 24 2020,negative,is a bad movie already almost ruins star wars
Jun 24 2020,negative,oh god can i get my time back what a disjointed and illogical movie
Jun 24 2020,negative,again another terrible poorly written money grabbing attempt at a starwars film its total rubbish and creates plot conveniences to get itself out of holes conveniences which jeopardise the established rules of the star wars universe its junk 123456 are the only star wars films
Jun 24 2020,neutral,its okrey is still lost and need to find herself
Jun 23 2020,positive,i could say its the third or the forth best star wars movie
Jun 22 2020,positive,incredible film with some flaws and drawbacks the film answers many questions posed by force awakens in a satisfying way and takes an unoriginal first film and takes it in a fascinating and new direction
Jun 22 2020,negative,90 either they were paid off or these people have never seen this film or any other star wars film for that matter felt like a weird cult action film not a film from such an amazing and expansive universe  cringe worthy dialogue bad actionstunts bad story telling and character development catered exclusively to children who have never seen another star wars film and do not know anything about the history or importance of the star wars universe with small instances like look its chewbacca so that the real fans feel like theyre being heard were not  ea is making better star wars games  ea is treating us better than disney its sad just soooooooo bad hot trash  do not watch     look how they massacred my boy 
Jun 21 2020,negative,this is one of these movies that left me with a sick feeling in my stomach after watching it honestly it disappointed me more than episode 1
Jun 21 2020,negative,the plot was terrible choreography and imagery rubbish fails as both a standalone film and as path 2 of a 3 part series    characters are ruined or wasted the original films are ruined and the entire work lacks what makes a star wars film    this terrible film did the impossible and became worse than the phantom menace and the attack of the clones
Jun 21 2020,negative,exmachina the movie
Jun 20 2020,positive,never have i been as disappointing by a film as i was on december 15th 2017 when i watched the last jedi the movie feels very pointless and stupid because a big portion of the film is wasted on useless scenes with finn rose poe and holdo the parts with luke rey and kylo are fairly good since the movie needed a reason for luke to hide kylo is a more interesting character in this film by seeing him struggling with killing han solo the last jedi has it moments but in the overall picture it sucks
Jun 20 2020,negative,rian johnson seriously wtf have you done
Jun 20 2020,negative,are they trying to kill off the franchise
Jun 20 2020,negative,this disney trilogy destroyed every star wars canon possible its so bad they literally killed the franchise its done
Jun 20 2020,positive,star wars has been part of my dna ever since i saw it at the theater when i was 12 years old at the time it was only called star wars nothing about it being chapter 4 or a new hope  i remember in the schoolyard how we would all compare notes on how many times we had seen it and would thrill at rumors of that guy who saw it over a 100 times it had remained in theaters continually for over a year a rare feat that was celebrated by the following full page ad in newspapers across america in 1978    i revisited the original trilogy countless times since 1977 i even went to see the special editions rereleases in 1997 and was annoyed by the extraneous special effects i am one of those who is still yearning for a proper bluray release of the original theatrical versions of the films and has rummaged over the internet to acquire the painstakingly recreated despecialized editions by harmy    im one of those nerds who lined up with trepidation for a midnight screening of the long promised episode 1 falling asleep through the pod race scene and i remember coming out bitterly disappointed the star wars brand was no more a guarantee of quality although arguably its reputation had been already damaged by 1978 when the mindbogglingly dreadful star wars holiday special polluted our television sets    you cant go home again they say and george lucas had made sure of that and while i was grateful to him for creating a series that had pretty much set in stone my lifelong love of sciencefiction movies i resented him for being unable to fully grasp what it was that made star wars great in the first place and being incapable to capture that lightning again there was no point in returning to star wars after that for me i begrudgingly sat through episodes 2 and 3 in the theater never to see them again afterwards    so i wasnt saddened to hear back in 2012 that disney had bought lucasfilm and its stable of characters for 4 billion i wasnt scared that the mouse would spoil star wars because nothing could screw it up further than it already had been and after all disney had also purchased marvel back in 2009 again for 4 billion and their cinematic universe had proven to be for this reviewer at least faithful to the spirit of the original comics  and fun as hell    if disney knows one thing its what people want to see and director jj abrams who has a talent for reviving shaky franchises  like mission impossible and star trek offered with 2015s the force awakens a perfect way to reintroduce star wars to a brand new generation building on the solid foundation of the original trilogy borrowing some of the original cast and introducing endearing new characters abrams film was an exciting return to form relying less on the frigid greenscreen technology that mangled the prequels and more on the type of practical effects that populated the original trilogy     the one blame that surfaced though was how much a lot of the story developments felt familiar and how some scenes were ripped off the pages of the original series then again the very same approach was used successfully in creed and like the force awakens i feel that it was a clever way of creating not only as a sequel or a reboot of the series but also as a form of remake what mattered most was to make sure the following series could manage to wrest itself from this heavy reliance on familiarity and acquire its own identity    and it managed beautifully with the first in a series of films taking place in the star wars universe but not directly linked to the ongoing skywalker saga although ironically the film ends with a scene that connects perfectly with the beginning of episode 4  i hate to call it thati prefer to call it the original star wars but whatever rogue one a star wars story gareth edwards 2016 was a surprising foray into that world introducing a lovably rugged team of characters that would win the day in the most valiant of ways breaking with tradition while providing a sense of familiarity and giving one of the best film in the series not to mention the most bad ass darth vader scene in the whole saga    it was a tough act to follow but i can safely say that the last jedi by the talented rian johson who had made the trippy time travel mindfuck of a film looper keeps that new standard of quality to its expected levels but not without a few problems    the story picks up pretty much where the force awakens left off where luke skywalker a wonderfully grizzled and grumpy mark hamill is invited to join the resistance by young rey the refreshing daisy ridley hoping to defeat the evil first order     it may seem like a simple basic story but its populated by so many characters and the occasional plot twist that it can be a bit hard to follow at times and you find yourself wondering what exactly is chewbacca doing or r2d2 or c3po one feels they are present just for the sake of creating a link to the original saga or more importantly selling more toys we are even introduced to another high ranking officer in the resistance vice admiral holdo played with aplomb by a glowing laura dern who executes an act of amazing heroism that would have left people in tears if it would have been instead done by general leia for instance    and the series timehonoured tradition of cannibalizing itself is alive and well with certain scenes being extraordinarily reminiscent if ones that occurred in previous chapters  difficult to not think of the battle on hoth in the empire strikes back when witnessing the attack on the rebel base on the salt planet of crait one soldier even tastes the white soil and states salt to remind us this is not snow so its totally different right  or a chase scene between tiefighters and the millenium falcon through a crystalline maze is similar to scenes in force awakens and return of the jedi even 85 years old john williams music is starting to feel repetitive and is showings signs of exhaustion whereas he had created gorgeous new themes in the precedent episode this one shows no new notable melodies which is kind of a shame    but i am being fickle as the film is an exciting rollercoaster filled to the brim with humour drama pathos and spectacular action finding a choice spot in the ongoing skywalker saga     kylo ren an intense adam driver while still suffering from vader envy and in dire need of anger management therapy deepens his relationship with rey and attempts to seduce her to the dark side even further an endeavour that culminates in a tense and surprising confrontation scene in snokes throne room a moment assured to remain engraved in star wars fans memories their relationship is at the core of the film and is the thing that manages to hold it together    the other subplots involving finn john boyega or poe oscar isaac dont provide them with much to do and they end up feeling a bit underused if their characters hadnt been so well established in the previous episode i dont think we would have cared much for them at all lets just say they are not going to be what viewers retain as they walk out of the movie as derivative as the force awakens felt it did do a wonderful job making us care about a new generations of characters     there is however a scene where finn and newcomer rose the endearing kelly marie tran who meet a codebreaker played by a grungy looking benicio del toro that stands out by exposing the deep corruption and complexities of war by demonstrating the fact that weapons manufacturers sell to both the first order and the rebels its a level of nuance that is uncommon in the star wars universe and is a more than welcome bit of reality    the most touching moment remains the tribute to carrie fisher in the end credits and that scene someone tells her no ones ever really gone princess leia was a spunky tough character that provided geekdom with a much needed female rolemodel silly golden bikini notwithstanding  and i will miss the potty mouthed spitfire that deconstructed so beautifully in her books the entertainment industry in which she grew up     and the  4 million questions does luke join the resistance do we get to see him go face to face with the first order does he get to meet his sister leia again    i wont spoil it by revealing the answers but lets just say that rian johnson manages to deliver the goods while still taking the rug from under our feet promotional material for the film promises earthshattering surprises but i will shock no one by stating that nothing in the film comes close to the i am your father reveal from the empire strikes back but there are surprises some of them are cool some underwhelming and some may even aggravate people    but the film stays true to the wildly entertaining spirit of star wars and will please the fans while wetting their appetites until the release of the final chapter that will conclude in two years what george lucas started 40 years ago     one may wonder if lucas revolutionized the industry positively or negatively with the wild success of his epic independent film in 1977 but thats a debate for another day     ps ohand for anyone who were afraid that the pogs would be annoyingly cute characters that would spoil the film rest assured they are window dressing at best
Jun 20 2020,negative,i did not enjoy this movie the plot is boring and unimaginative luke is completely misused lastly the characters and twists that happen in the movie arent interesting and hurt the movie
Jun 20 2020,positive,this film has a lot of issues but i can deal with it i dont think this film is as bad as what most star wars fans said about this film for the most part it was a decent sequel but its my least favorite film of the sequel trilogy
Jun 19 2020,negative,amongst the very worst movies ive ever seen this looks like a bad episode from a shitty fanfic
Jun 18 2020,negative,fucked over the entire trilogy and lore the prequels were shitty because of acting and dialogue this one was because the ruined every character of the originals  ever also is super fucking long and boring
Jun 18 2020,negative,haaaaated it only seen it once in theaters and will never see again same goes for all the disney star wars films they destroyed something that was special to my childhood
Jun 18 2020,neutral,if you know nothing about star wars and lack a rudimentary understanding of physics  it is ok cant help but feel if this was not a star wars movie it would have done better
Jun 17 2020,positive,the story was welldone for the most part but i think more important than that is the fact that rian johnson was not afraid to do something different and write something truly new to add to the star wars canon he broke away from tradition and wrote a new movie rather than rehashing something that the star wars audience is already familiar with
Jun 17 2020,positive,this is the best movie ever made even better than star wars the empire strikes back the narrative pacing is perfect and definitely does not feel inconsistent and messy my favourite part is when luke extracts green milk from the alien and then drinks it its so funny and one of the best scenes of the movie i see no flaw with this film watch out the godfather because there is a new best movie in town
Jun 15 2020,negative,cannot honestly call this a star wars film
Jun 15 2020,negative,unfocused and selfindulgent
Jun 15 2020,negative,this movie takes all the things that could have been interesting from the force awakens and throws them away because the director thought being subversive was a substitute for good writing  the character of luke skywalker is completely destroyed and stays that way until the plot needs him to help again  the entire holdo scene is really stupid because one moment holdo is shown as an incompetent leader that is going to get everyone killed because of her plan then the movie expects the audience to just except that she is now a hero  the holdo maneuver completely breaks space battles for the rest of enternaty and is only used because of lazy writing  rey randomly becoming an expert lightsaber duelist is really odd due to her only training being randomly swinging a lightsaber at a rock  though you can tell that a movie is bad if it makes people rewatch the prequels because they didnt remember them being this much of a dumpster fire
Jun 14 2020,negative,this movie fully defiles the legacy of luke
Jun 13 2020,negative,watching whole last 3 movies was so cringe that i literally feel bad its the most senseless boring shit ever full of sentimental pictures and etc
Jun 12 2020,positive,i understand peoples legitimate complaints and the not so legitimate complaints but it was the most original story star wars has tried to tell since the original trilogy and the best cinematography since empire strikes back
Jun 11 2020,positive,while this isnt one of the best in the saga it is still an entertaining and fun film    final rating b
Jun 11 2020,positive,i know im in the minority here but i like the last jedi of course its far from being on the best star wars movies but it is definitely the best out of the three on the disney trilogy understanding that overall is the weakest trilogy first of all i want to clarify yes the kanto bai sequence is just a waste of time some characters are not useful to the story and it loses the opportunity of being awesome on some key moments     now with that out of the way i have to say when this movie does something good it nails it closure to luke skywalker yes and i totally understand his mood through the movie twists yes awesome cinematography the best in a long time thanks to this movie i understand kylo ren better and i love the fact that the movie states the force as something universal and not so much about lineages and families     again it is not one of the best but if you skip kanto bai this movie is entertaining and shines on some moments above what you expect
Jun 10 2020,negative,beautiful art shitty history i fell bad for rise of skywalker who had to continue and finish a broken trilogy
Jun 10 2020,negative,if i had to post a picture here to summarize my review of this film it would be of dumpster lit on fire not a nice one either one of those that cities leave by the side of condemned buildings
Jun 9 2020,positive,best of the new star wars movies alongside rogue one
Jun 8 2020,negative,i did not really enjoy this film i thought the cinematography was beautiful however the storytelling and character development was weak good actors but bad writing
Jun 6 2020,negative,shit on the legacy of star wars
Jun 5 2020,negative,terrible plot great cinematographie     after re watching this is an abomination of the star wars saga wtf is this xd
Jun 4 2020,negative,a disaster of a film boringly long sequences that make you wait for climactic moments that are nothing short of annoyances theres that childish set where the walls are red smoke cringe all of this on top of the destruction of the original plot trajectory its a shame
Jun 3 2020,neutral,i appreciate the subverting of expectations but it is a shame that luke later just did exactly what he was joking about earlier it also didnt really deliver anything valuable other than that on the contrary it brought even more absurdity
Jun 3 2020,negative,luke character is not realistic
Jun 3 2020,positive,this was just slightly better than episode 9 the only interesting storyline was lukes he acted out of character but it felt natural as he was alone on an island for a very long time ideally he wouldnt have thrown his dads lightsaber away but just dropped it that would have been way better for some stupid reason they cut a very important scene out of the movie luke heartbroken by the fact that his best friend was killed by his own son that was a beautiful scene mark hamill was generally amazing in this movie he gives an amazing performance in a fine movie the other storylines were just very poorly written handled and managed just very boring stuff i hate that they didnt kill of finn how sad would it have been if finn sacrificed himself rey and him wouldnt have seen each other again like rey promised that would have been a great ending to his arc but instead he got saved by rose by an action that should have killed both of them and then she says the single worst line ever and an awkward kiss decent all in all
Jun 2 2020,neutral,the film is very beautiful aesthetically but on the other hand it becomes very boring  besides ruining luke skywalker
Jun 2 2020,negative,so listen do i really have a to explain why i hate this movie it had terrible writing it doesnt feel like a star wars movie it shouldve explained better why luke wanted the jedi to end because i dont buy his motives i hate finn and roses story   now the good i think that this movie is the best looking star wars movie the throne room scene is a masterpiece the part where rey is training with a rock is beautiful and the colors in this movie are beautiful but over all 1510
Jun 1 2020,negative,this is not a masterpiece took what jj started  spat on it and through it out the window if rey  kyli are so similar why didnt rey let kylie get a force vision for the skywalker saber ep2  ep5 are 10x better then this clumsy mess
May 31 2020,negative,this was the worst star wars movie i have ever seen perhaps the worst movie period other movies have been bad but their awfulness was confined the last jedi not only is terrible on its own but it deals serious and lasting damage to the characters and world built by the preceding movies
May 31 2020,negative,i dont have time for a full in depth review of this movie there are various on youtube you can watch that do it justice this film is a mockery of star wars disregards logic and trivializes its audience 
May 31 2020,negative,absolutely terrible it breaks and insults prior installments of the series the main characters mary sueness evolves to be even worse character motivations make little to no sense the entire plot could have been solved in 100 easier ways and the fight scenes are atrocious and dont hold up in second viewings
May 31 2020,negative,lazy writing  too many plot twists  does every fbombing scene have to be a plot twist absolutely terrible character development  probably one of the worst movies ive ever seen next to jeepers creepers
May 30 2020,negative,it is the worst star wars movie together with 9 maybe   it just destroys star wars and made the not good 7th film which could be good   with another film which it set up  but they all are bad
May 29 2020,negative,i believe if rian johnson was the director of force awakens this could of been a good movie the problem is that it fought with the movie that came before it in story theme and tone so much it just left a rotten taste in your mouth it felt like two rich white boys fighting over who gets to play with their toys and how to play with their toys if rian got to direct all three movies in the trilogy i think the trilogy would of been great and if j j abrams got to direct all three the trilogy would of been ok sadly j j abrams got to direct the first and thrid while rian got to direct this movie this made this movie and the one after filled with your movie sucks and i can do it better no your movie sucks and i can do it better this made the viewing of the movie story and trilogy disgusting
May 29 2020,positive,this is where the new trilogy slipped a bit off the rails entertaining yet with at least one groaninducting scene not bad yet
May 29 2020,positive,this is a visually a stunning representation of the 8 episode saga that tributes the original trilogy while remaining original by itself simply the best since the the empire strikes back
May 28 2020,negative,please do not ever destroy star wars this much again    ever
May 28 2020,negative,it was terrible im sorry for everything theyve done to you mark hamill
May 27 2020,negative,i like the actors   everyone its great but the plot omg   painfully
May 26 2020,positive,ive watched the entire saga and i have to say this movie was one of my favourites though the one after messed it all up it was amazing
May 26 2020,positive,i dont hate it or love it it just erases what the last film did
May 26 2020,negative,i had never left a movie theatre angry until i watched this horrible insult to the franchise director johnson will be shunned forever in the star wars universe and we all wholeheartedly agree with everything mark hamill had said about how he and all the fans were fundamentally disagree about the way the character in the movie is portrayed horrible last stand for luke skywalker my childhood hero and of course a lot of filler and garbage and no actual real plot aside from not running out of gas 
May 26 2020,negative,this movie was bad on so many levels  lets begin with its connection to star wars or rather the lack of connection with the source material  its as if rian johnson didnt care at all about the rich amount of material in the star wars universe and just wrote a generic scifi piece  every character was reinvented to the point of being almost unrecognizable  this movie was such a divergence from the plotlines that had developed before that it felt like an alternate reality    star wars aside the movie failed on so many levels  the plot was contrived dull and nonsensical with undeveloped points  no star wars movie had ever been boring but this approached that level    sometimes you have to watch a movie multiple times to appreciate or understand a movies intentions  so i did watch the last jedi multiple times and its still a bad movie  i will even rate it as the second worst star wars movie with only the phantom menace being worse
May 25 2020,positive,my favorite star wars movie of all times
May 25 2020,positive,one of the best star wars films
May 25 2020,negative,the worst and most destructive peice of art  that i have ever seen in the film industry for as large of a company as disney to produce something this terrible is baffling considering how they have no shortage of money and resources if you ever want to see a six film trilogy torn down in two movies just watch this abomination and then rise of skywalker
May 25 2020,negative,ive wasted a lot of time following two plain characters in a subplot that leads nowhere  really you can cut those scenes un the casino and it wont change a thing  and thats only one of the issues with this movie
May 25 2020,negative,honestly i have watched the saga marathon style many times and this i skip a couple of others are sort of boring too but this is also well not in any way connected to the rest of the saga nothing makes sense
May 23 2020,positive,dont believe any audience reviews about the last jedi  critics are right      the last jedi and rian johnson does a wonderful job in bringing new fresh to something old and familiar  the story was great and the new force abilities are awesome as well  rian johnson was able to expand the universe we all have come to love and give disney the ability to write spin offs for it broom boy  if you are the star wars fan looking for something spectacular and fresh the last jedi is the movie for you      spoilers ahead    most people i have spoken to express how they hated how rian johnson wrote luke skywalker but when you actually come to think of it rian johnson had to follow in the foot steps of what was developed in force awakens   the question he had to answer is why is one of the most powerful jedi living in exile on an island  why is kylo ren looking for him which are all answered within rian johnsons writing  questions are not left unanswered and characters are not destroyed     kylo ren cements himself as a powerful force while rey continues her journey of trying to find her place within the story  rians decision of making rey a no body was reys worst fear  much like in empire lukes worse fear was that his enemy vader is his father  it was the last thing rey wanted to hear but it is satisfying in a way because great power does not have to come from family lineage      the only negative about this movie is that the canto bight sequence was a little too long  i feel like including the whole space horse scene was unnecessary  it was like disney was forcing rian johnson to include something about animal rights
May 23 2020,negative,the last jedi what i mean id say luke wasnt even a jedi he was trained by yoda but that doesnt make him or rey a jedi being a jedi meant that you followed all the rules and you did all of what the jedi council says luke wasnt a jedi because he didnt follow every rule for goodness sake he force chokes someone not a jedi power and rey dont even get me started she probably doesnt even know the first thing about being a jedi heck in the last movie she didnt even believe in the force
May 23 2020,negative,the people at disney should be ashamed of themselves for letting this piece of poorly written of cashgrabbing excrement loose into theaters someone should fire the person in charge
May 23 2020,negative,definitly the worst star wars movie ever made it is just a cheap nostalgia bait movie with no soul ruins plenty of good characters and has no redeeming qualities
May 23 2020,negative,as a longterm star wars fan this movie really exemplifies where disney chose to betray the audience theres enough good material to make it worth a watch if its free or a dollar but honestly its just a waste it does not advance the story and needlessly kills off two characters carrie fisher may she rest in peace could have simply disappeared gracefully rather than having disney tread all over her memory mark hamill was pointless in passing and thats the movie all of it
May 22 2020,negative,just bad do not recommend to anyone
May 22 2020,positive,i love that movie  i liked all the new ideas in the movie  and the fact that leave behind the old concept in the other episodes
May 22 2020,negative,that milking scene is forever in my head i wish i could erase my memory
May 21 2020,positive,how do you allow this review bombing its all lies
May 21 2020,negative,this movie is just straight up disappointing terrible script and use of characters which destroy a once treasured franchise
May 21 2020,negative,disney sentences luke skywalker to the same fate as han solo  he leaves the stage a washed up old man a remnant of a completely different cinematic universe which was adored by so many
May 21 2020,negative,found more enjoyment opening a pack of duracell batteries
May 21 2020,positive,i love star wars movies and i think this is one of my favorite ones but theres a lot of problems with the trilogy i think its a bad trilogy because you dont feel a strong connection between the movies but this one is a good movie looking for itself it makes you feel surprised with a lot of scenes and you feel the emotion from the start to the end thats incredible but i think its important to have a good trilogy thats why im giving 710
May 21 2020,negative,this movie is just a joke
May 20 2020,positive,really epic really beautiful
May 20 2020,positive,while the last jedi had some flaws rose mainly it brings something new and very interesting to star wars  it brings ourselves to a point where the whole plot resolves around 2 characters and their feelings instead of the repetitive intergalactic warfare episode vii gave us by basically redoing the plot of a new hope  it also describes what few understood from the prequels  nothing is all black or white the jedi order failed because of their flaws not because of the dark side  luke in this movie is the incarnation of this idea by being the broken old man that is so drastically different from the luke we left in episode vi
May 20 2020,positive,best movie in the series too bad jj had to go and  spend half of episode ix to try and revert everything this movie did
May 20 2020,negative,a disappointing plot hole riddled pretentious film that seems to forget its part of a franchise
May 20 2020,negative,the movie was incredible garbage    rough one and solo were good movies but holly crap the sequels are disgusting
May 20 2020,positive,this one was not so bad i think is the best of the sequels
May 20 2020,negative,this was such a disappointing film i had high hopes for luke to show how powerful he had become with the force but what they did to his character was almost criminal a lot of the film did not make sense too many plot holes to list and the casino planetwhy put that in at all  just a terrible film and wasted opportunity
May 20 2020,positive,rian johnson a true fan of star wars and the mythology of the franchise created a magnificent film that really brought forth some great questions about the force and the jedis place in this new era fantastic music by john williams again and the visuals were gorgeous carrie fisher and mark hamill were great and it was so amazing to see luke skywalker on the big screen again as luke skywalker the final performance of carrie fisher is one of the best she ever gave and she will be missed chewbacca was great as always daisy ridley again brought forth new depth and development for rey and adam drivers performance commanded the screen with kylo rens character john boyega kelly marie tran and laura dern were fantastic too
May 19 2020,positive,good film plot but slow in parts and the casino scene definitely wasnt needed a unexpected twist with luke skywalker makes the film even more enjoyable great experience
May 19 2020,negative,the directorwriter clearly had no understanding of the star wars universe they botched nearly the entire thing there was also no understanding of characters most notably luke
May 19 2020,negative,many dropped subplots from tfa and plot holes of its own big enough to drive a buick through  the writing is jarringly didactic during certain chunks of the runtime  jokes that feel like theyre from an snl sketch    its a thematically strong but a narratively weak movie albeit a very visually well crafted one
May 19 2020,negative,such a disappointment  this is not a star wars movie i think
May 19 2020,positive,i enjoyed the film and it was definitely better than the force awakens and the last skywalker but it couldnt help bridge the two films
May 19 2020,negative,terrible excuse for a star wars film i hate how they disrespect mark hamills luke skywalker character and turn finn into a mindless goof this franchise had so much potential but fell far far away into the deep void of moneygrabbing space
May 19 2020,negative,they should have just stopped with this movie its just bad
May 19 2020,negative,when i watched this movie on the big screen i was wanting more of luke skywalker which the last movie was lacking of while luke has a lot of screentime in this movie his writing betrays his original character spoilers instead of being optimistic and wise like in rotj he just becomes a washed up hermit who gives up even on life in the end also the main characters are not interesting or written poorly finn which was my favorite of the force awakens is now just a laughing stock and wasted character poe which i also liked now doesnt contribute anything and doesnt get any character development in this movie rey from the start and now is just a dull and boring character
May 17 2020,positive,the last jedi is an incredibly polarizing film it takes bold unpredictable moves in developing star wars luke has become resigned and disillusioned having lost his youthful optimism due to life experience and failure and the central message of the film is to stop clinging to the past     personally i really enjoyed this film a lot first of all i find its philosophy of letting go of the past worth pondering and find lukes character arc intriguing moreover if we take the film on its own merits rather than making the standard of its success how faithful and respectful it is to the original star wars films it is really good the character development is strong luke finally overcomes his depression due to his past failure and manages a last act of dramatic heroics poe dameron starts to mature in his judgment of leadership tactics preparing him for the greater responsibility he will take on in the future people criticize the casino excursion but it is through this experience that finn develops commitment to a cause rather than to be independent and sell himself to the highest bidder rey and kylo ren go through a fascinating development pulled towards each other and yet apart this culminates in an awesome fight scene where they team up together against a common enemy and then part ways its one of the best star wars fight scenes and lukes final stand is a powerful ending this has great characters development and character arcs incredible battles space battles lightsabers and internal battles it triggers emotions and proposes a controversial philosophy for fans to discuss     as the most polarizing star wars movie the last jedi is essential viewing id recommend anyone to watch it and to make up your own mind about it
May 17 2020,negative,i hate this movie my least favorite star wars movie by far ruins star wars canon and is boring it doesnt expand on the star wars universe the only star wars movie that i have walked out of utterly disappointed
May 17 2020,neutral,the entire plot that drives the action is complete garbage the nice cinematography and the quality of the acting are actually the only two things that save this movie
May 17 2020,neutral,im honestly conflicted about this movie when i watched it for the first and only time i would probably give it 45 stars but after ive thought about it i might give it 35 stars  this movie had so many jawdropping moments and some of the most exciting moments for me but also a lot of moments that are insanely awkward outof place andor flat out gross since im so conflicted about this movie ill settle with 25 for now
May 17 2020,negative,if i could rate this lower than half a star i would to be clear the last jedi had the most potential of any star wars movie  the cinematography is phenomenal the visuals are gorgeous the music is of course fantastic sound and set design and acting were amazing it has the prettiest lightsaber battles in any of the 9 films but the plot is horrendous there is nothing innovative about the storytelling the writing is non existent the characters  old new and otherwise  are so horrendously written that it feels like the story was written and rewritten well into postdevelopment and it doesnt seem like the writers director or editors really had any clear vision of where they wanted the movie to go the force awakens was mediocre and borrowed far too heavily from the original trilogy but it actually introduced some fun interesting characters and actually had some consistency and introduced a whole lot of really cool interesting plot and character arcs that could have had great payoffs but i wanted to wait until episode 9  to really weigh in and after seeing the entirety of the new trilogy a handful of times each including backtobacktoback and episode 8 had a ton of cultural importance and tons of potential and it left the trilogy  and the franchise  bereft of logic and sense and consistency i dont believe that rian johnson is a bad director  his work with knives out looper and breaking bad were nothing short of astounding but what he did with this movie was an unfortunate misstep its unfortunate and disappointing and there simply isnt enough room here to address the why behind these but suffice to say that what could and should have been a magnificent film and bridge between episodes 7 and 9 failed in story plot and character to the point that the things that it did well did not matter in the least
May 16 2020,positive,the best star wars movie in the disney era so far from a technical level it is the best star wars movie so far its cinematography is rivaled only by rogue one it is well acted well directed  well edited kylo ren luke skywalker  rey are the best parts of the movie the movie tries to juggle too many ideas  themes and can often be selfindulgent in auteur theory at the expense of being accessible to as many star wars audience members as possible but then again im just a pretentious star wars fan who loves themes themes themes  has always advocated for the writerdirector approach to film making so it is exactly my type of film i rank it as my 3rd or 4th favourite star wars film
May 16 2020,positive,a pretty good film significantly better than the rise of skywalker i actually liked that rey was just a nobody
May 16 2020,negative,useless movie was not made to complete de sequels lies deception
May 15 2020,positive,ambitious and challenging work  i saw a glimpse of the new era of star wars but it became ruined in ros
May 15 2020,positive,the last jedi was a very bold star wars movie and many risks were taken i believe more of the plot worked than did not and worked out to be a very good movie the last jedi set up episode 9 for something that could be both great and something that star wars fans have never seen before in star wars movies reys parentage reveal was something people could relate too as it sent the message that you dont have to be a part of a blood line to be something great luke having problems i didnt mind since he came back in the most bad ass way the snoke decision is something we have never seen before and set up the next film for something new ultimately the last jedi is a fantastic entry to continue on to episode 9 best of the sequel movies and would make my top 3 star wars movies
May 15 2020,positive,the force awakens which was great movie got me so excited for the last jedi specially at the end unfortunately it didnt live up to the force awakens the films is okay but it just feels very messy and i dont like whats they did with luke
May 15 2020,negative,there was so much potential in the star wars series for a sequel but disney blew it with these movies
May 14 2020,neutral,even as one of the better constructed and plot based films in the franchisestar warsthe last jedi lacks the fun and heroism of its earlier installments
May 14 2020,negative,although the movie has some undoubtedly good parts it overall brings down the value of the trilogy luke is no longer luke there are random spontaneous love stories supreme leader snoke remains a mystery there is major issues with continuity dealing with the world building put in place by the past two trilogies and even the newer characters have their potential wasted
May 13 2020,negative,such an enormous disappointment on the first viewing particularly everything with like skywalker the second viewing was actually worse  fin was sorely misused gutted
May 13 2020,negative,this film had a joke of a plot direction with all the side storys it just got annoying acting in this film was even worse than the plot line with all the actors only using facial reactions to express emotions half the time i was trying to stop myself from laughing at this joke of a film
May 12 2020,negative,i understand playing with rules and breaking them but when you create a plot whole in the rest of the series you really messed up
May 12 2020,positive,this is my personal favourite of the sequel trilogy  it is full of unpredictability exciting scenes and builds up the characters well especially the interesting plot between rey and kylo ren  it follows on well from the force awakens  it is certainly action packed and therefore may take a couple of viewings to fully understand what is going on
May 12 2020,positive,one of the greatest cinematic accomplishments for star wars since the empire strikes back the last jedi subverted expectations and challenged fans of the series to unlearn what they had learned while maintaining the themes of what makes a good story failure hope and redemption while the movie unfortunately misses the stylistic feel of star wars the decision to move forward in bold and creative storytelling rather than fanservice moments has allowed this to be a movie that will be marked as one of the greatest in the star wars franchise
May 12 2020,negative,bad plot bad fight scenes bad writing good looking thanks to disney money the sequels should not be allowed to call themselves part of the skywalker saga bring back lucas
May 11 2020,negative,i never want rian johnson to touch anything star wars ever again disgraceful to luke skywalker
May 11 2020,positive,this is a star wars movie that is thoughtful while still being entertaining and thrilling the best performances in the entire saga from the whole cast its a film that will grow more popular with time
May 10 2020,negative,nothing was good about this movie they changed luke beyond acceptable ways they answered nothing from the previous film they subverted expectations to just subvert expectations so many insane plots that never were explored i absolutely hated this movie i have never hated a movie more they had to try to back off of everything in the next movie that made it awful too
May 10 2020,negative,it is by far the worst star wars movie there is hardly a plot element which is not laughably illogical some grotesque even they should have given the job to someone who actually likes star wars and understands the very special way of storytelling the series deserves adam driver and oscar isaac are fantastic however but there are better films to enjoy their performance
May 10 2020,positive,great movie  stunning actors amazing visual effects a coherent story and most importantly its just great fun
May 10 2020,positive,i think tlj is the most interesting of the new trilogy because it begins to move the story forward again and it does some things no star wars film has done before instead of the juvenile goodbad duality we get shades of gray characters make mistakes its a very human star wars film i liked it
May 10 2020,positive,mesmerising visuals daisy and adams on screen chemistry is truly amazing you can see the difference in boths position while also seeing a similarity for both rey and kylo beautiful film
May 9 2020,negative,even the last part of the trilogy wanted to delete those facts and happenings it did it is so depressing that it could score that high
May 9 2020,neutral,it is very confusing in which direction it goes in and leaves me wondering what if would of been with george lucas
May 9 2020,negative,really unfortunate in direction but i suppose stories have to change  despite my feelings that these arent the characters that were developed in the original trilogy it was the terrible script and nonsensical screenplay that drove this movie into the ground  the constant tonal shifts in a single scene took dramatic moments and turned them into confusion about what we were supposed to be paying attention to and subverted any character development  how critics defend this is beyond me the movie is a bad movie not because its a star wars movie but because it doesnt adhere to basic elements of meaningful cinematography and story telling
May 9 2020,negative,its one thing to make a movie with plot twists and defying expectations when it makes sense and without throwing out everything that has come before it its another to change characters entirely and throw in expectation defying moments all for the sake of surprising the audience good cinema isnt about surprising the audience its about telling a good story that keeps audience interest you can get interest from twists but when those twist exist for the sake of throwing the narrative on its head you have a problem with your movie
May 9 2020,positive,the most unnecessarily controversial movie ive ever seen yes the casino plot was unnecessary but all the reykylo stuff was great and the luke outrage is insane a man who was taught and mentored by yoda and obiwan who both made a sizeable mistake and went into hiding for years would make a sizeable mistake and go into hiding for years and thats out of character give me a break rian johnson is brilliant as always its not perfect but anyone saying it ruined star wars needs to grow up
May 8 2020,negative,what a waste of budget and special effects
May 8 2020,positive,with the last jedi they brought more depth to all of the characters and the actors really nailed it with this one it is stunning visually and beautiful to watch everything play out in front of you of course there were a few moments that seemed out of place but overall a very good movie
May 8 2020,negative,really awful and wayyyyyyyy to long
May 8 2020,negative,how can you ruin such a great saga
May 7 2020,negative,absolute dumpster fire of a movie     wouldnt be half bad if it was a standalone film and wasnt called star wars but it completely botched its place in the sequels by retroactively changing characters established motives and personalities prematurely killing off the established villain reusing old characters and adding in way too many plotconveniences     for sure played a huge role in why rise of the skywalker was such a mess  jj couldnt salvage ryans mess if he tried
May 7 2020,positive,i thought is was excellent the only thing i dont love is some of the stupid dialogue for poe havent like him in the last two movies he seems to hate taking orders from women really stupid is such an advanced world
May 6 2020,negative,i could waste my time pointing out all the plot holes or how they ruined one of the best characters of the franchise but there is not much more to be said rian johnson is a good up and coming filmmakerwriter check out knives out looper but not for star wars i wasnt thrilled with force awakens and believe harrison ford the only reason why that film is watchable i thought things would go up from there boy was i wrong i knew this was going to be shit show right when poe did the mom joke at the start of the film i havent bothered to watch the sequel and i dont think i will ever
May 6 2020,positive,this is my personal third favorite star wars film behind empire and the original i think the direction was well crafted the cinematography was beautiful they expanded on the lore in a really interesting way and they also expanded on the character of luke really well from the sweet kid we knew from the originals to a man who has been through trauma my only problem with this is the finn and rose subplot other than that i love this movie i think its a great expansion on the skywalker saga and also just a great film in general        i think a lot of star wars fans go overboard with hating this movie because they do new things that werent expected however when episode xii came out fans complained that it was too much of the same i think this is a beautiful and emotioal continuation and expansion of the galaxy far far away
May 6 2020,positive,why does everyone hate this movie so much it kinda good 
May 5 2020,positive,a great take on the star wars saga with enough new twists to keep the audience entertained
May 5 2020,negative,this movie is beyond horrible if this movie was left out of the franchise i would be happy because this movie shouldnt have been made and dont get me started on the overrated red throne fight scene that scene is so poorly done and ive never scene a worst fight scene if you want proof look up robot head the last jedi review and watch it for a deep dive on the abysmal scene this movie is terrible
May 5 2020,negative,huge amounts of plot holes horrible dnd home adventure with a star wars sticker slapped on
May 5 2020,negative,worst star wars movie everyone in this movie is either stupid or an ass the only good sene is the throne room sene but then you realize how bad the fight choreography for the guards is
May 5 2020,positive,better than the last episode it actually has an original story and adds new lore that i found interesting i would give it a much better score if it wasnt for reys unusual strength in the force with very little training the movie does have plenty of surprises twists and turns which make for a fun ride i think it would have been a better decision narratively to have her fall to the dark in order to set up her redemption for the subsequent episode but sadly this does not happen overall it was okay but i would certainly headcanon this movie out of the star wars saga
May 5 2020,positive,honestly the movie isintersting i like the story and its actually a good idea the characters are fine and the acting is ok but man the way it was pulled off captian phasmas fate is wasted potential imagine her becoming the supreme leader wasted potential lukes fate as well the movie is overral fine
May 5 2020,negative,the worst star wars film by far because of the worst plot everits destroying character of luke
May 5 2020,positive,i hated this movie at first but after seeing e9 i like it a bit more at least they tried to be creative in this film
May 5 2020,positive,i hated this when i first saw it on the big screen i rewatched it recently and couldnt believe how much stuff i missed searching for the nostalgia tfa gave me its actually a really solid movie and i really enjoyed the second watch
May 5 2020,positive,i honestly dont understand why this film was subjected to such criticism by audiences it may not have been the no holds barred thrill ride of its predecessor but that doesnt mean it isnt a good film it is indeed more of a slow burner than episode vii however the build of the plot is well paced and the finale definitely feels earned yes there are a couple of scenes that seemed a little out of place upon first viewing but once one has revisited this film one can see exactly why each element was added and the plot is wellconstructed the only major criticism i have is that snokes character was criminally underused and discarded rather abruptly given the limited screen time we get with him in the flesh but apart from that it lived up to the hype and is a fitting followup to what has been a very strong series of sequels
May 4 2020,negative,everything negative has already been said ive watched it just now for the first time since i saw it since its release its a much much prettier movie than i remember and being prepared for thechoiceturns that the movie goes into makes it easier to ride with however its still garbage the flying superman bit is still jarring poe is annoying finn is idiotic and rey is too op if star wars was a football team itd be the cleveland browns
May 4 2020,negative,it ruined the whole franchise beyond recognition
May 4 2020,negative,bad no very bad it has no connection whatsoever with the previous one everything the previous director did because of his eagerness to play a leading role he does not know what trilogy means it seems that he wanted to give his own ending to the saga instead of give a continuation to the next movie the starwars mythology is loaded that the next movie is going to go thats the big question the prequels have more history than this
May 4 2020,negative,sorry kids but this franchise was officially over with after revenge of the sith
May 4 2020,neutral,the visuals are stunning and the score is absolutely fantastic the acting is great but sadly the plotholes are plentiful also definitely dragged on especially with the absolute waste of time side mission that rose and finn go on
May 4 2020,negative,a daring attempt to bring lots of new and exciting views into the starwars universe the indifference to good evil and humanity of the military industrial complex the role and difficulties of women in leadership how sometimes problems are bigger and cant be solved by the actions of a few chosen heroes and more unfortunately they were only able to accomplish them by dumbing down characters and washing out motivations and arcs causing the story and the messages they wanted to convey to suffer greatly beautiful visuals display the budget but overall not worth a watch
May 4 2020,positive,definitely not as bad as people say it is but i mostly didnt enjoy this film i loved kylo ren in this movie
May 3 2020,negative,an opportunity to continue star wars as epic  but alas it was lost and this is by far the worst of them all  if it had only been the last  the treatment of luke skywalker was unbelievable and the story was terrible  do or do not  no try
May 2 2020,negative,an absolute abomination of a film  insulting to the past trilogy and no coherent direction for this new trilogy
May 2 2020,negative,i simply hate it may the force be with disney alwehm maybe
May 1 2020,negative,this movie spends too much time on unfunny jokes and pointless plot twists that take the movie nowhere the movie also wastes 30 minutes on the canto bight which is the most uninteresting and boring thing that ive seen in star wars since attack of the clones this movie also underuses and wastes finns character which is a shame because he had one of the most interesting backstories of any star wars character rian johnson also does not seem to understand the rules of the star wars universe and trying to watch this movie after the original trilogy is frustrating on its own this movie could shine but it doesnt seem to have a place in the star wars saga
Apr 30 2020,negative,great visuals but the story is so dragged out and horrible decisions were made where you cringe
Apr 29 2020,negative,terrible story line that focused on an unnecessary side story and didnt answer any questions from the last one the cgi was impressive though
Apr 28 2020,negative,tragic it ignores every film in the series this film is full of awkward moments bad jokes forced relationships major plot holes and they managed to turn the franchises captain america into everyones drunk uncle forget about killing the past this film killed the franchise i cant even watch the previous films without feeling frustrated
Apr 27 2020,positive,this movie is proof that if the original star wars was released today the fandom would say its not the star wars they fell in love with
Apr 26 2020,negative,there were so many bad decisions made in the making of this movie theres no need to list them all as other reviewers have done a pretty good job already  i get the idea the director was going for and i didnt like it  a very strong dislike  i liked the actors and the whole miseenscène because i love everything star wars except the plot and in how some characters were portrayed this movie is jar jar binks yeah
Apr 26 2020,negative,the single worst movie i have ever seen in my entire life as a huge fan of star wars this was a atrocious addition to the star wars movies overall i wouldnt wish for anyone to see this movie from certain people floating in space and miraculously surviving to certain people fighting against a galactic force by themselves without consequence to awful needless humor for the love of god do not watch this film it will ruin star wars for you
Apr 25 2020,negative,bad story writing unnecessary new characters terrible direction and a step back from the force awakens which promised an interesting new trilogy and characters
Apr 25 2020,negative,i hate everthing about it the casinop was a waste of time and they killed the only good character left besides lea they killed luke1
Apr 25 2020,neutral,a disappointing and failing attempt that branches out the star wars universe in a disastrous way
Apr 24 2020,negative,worst star wars movie ever that says it all
Apr 23 2020,positive,its good   
Apr 23 2020,negative,boring terrible just as the others
Apr 22 2020,negative,nothing to keep in this movie except some special effects  not even an entertainement id rather tear my eyes out than watch this movie again
Apr 22 2020,negative,i dont even know what to say here its just really really bad
Apr 21 2020,positive,visually stunning with amazing acting the character development was extremely honest and real beautifully done
Apr 20 2020,positive,beautiful cinematography character development and acting this is one of my all time favorite star wars movies
Apr 20 2020,negative,absolute rubbish poor story line poor character arcs countless plotholes inconsistencies and moviemistakes the director clearly does not understand the concept of space and gravity total waste of time what a slap in the face of george lucas
Apr 19 2020,positive,this was a great episode in that it made me decide not to expect anything from new episodes of star wars there are so many wtf scenes that i couldnt understand
Apr 19 2020,negative,green lantern was better star wars is a great franchisebut this movie is a waste of time a ticket to get bored especially with rose
Apr 19 2020,neutral,a well made movie not a star wars movie though
Apr 19 2020,positive,i personally feel this movie is underrated i recommend watching this movie its not has bad has some people have said there are some plot holes but no movie is perfect
Apr 18 2020,positive,that final battle was awesome haters still gonna hate though
Apr 18 2020,negative,worst writing and directing in any star wars history
Apr 17 2020,negative,not as bad as everyone says but not as good as everyone hoped
Apr 17 2020,positive,many people do not like this movie i remembered walking out of the theather with a biterrsweet taste after watching it but not because the movie was bad but because what took place on the story yes it has plotholes and maybe some wrong decisions but i think the main problem is that people wanted to see something different on the screen things that did not happen but that does not mean the movie is bad
Apr 17 2020,positive,the last jedi is a beautifully shot star wars movie it has palpable energy twists and turns top notch acting and stellar sound design there are some issues with the plot but there are only two star wars films that dont share this problem star wars 1977 and the empire strikes back 1980 it is just a movie after all
Apr 16 2020,positive,best film of the sequel trilogy it made bold choices that pushed the series in a new direction that was unexpected and wasnt just a rehash of empire strikes back
Apr 16 2020,negative,not to surprised on this one
Apr 15 2020,negative,this isnt star wars this is a poorly put together fanfiction of star wars
Apr 15 2020,positive,leaving where the force awakens left off rey daisy ridley tries to be trained by luke skywalker in the master refuses to train the pupil but eventually does cliche meanwhile the resistance fleet is naturally being chased by the first order  it isnt star wars if the rebels arent being chased the resistance finds safe harbor on a salty planet but their safety is shortlived as the first order brings out the walkers in scenes too reminiscent of the empire strikes back if you like odes to the original trilogy then you may enjoy these scenes i for one thought the film  was too recycled and could have used some additional creativity at least go to a nonwhite planet to make a last stand is that too much to ask
Apr 15 2020,negative,more disney garbage destroying the saga thanks so much for taking a beloved franchise and turning it into a big steaming pile of shite
Apr 15 2020,negative,worst sw movie ever broke my heart
Apr 14 2020,positive,the last jedi is a truly special movie everything is on point from the characters to the direction to the cinematography the writing the story and the feeling the movie gives you this is everything ive ever wanted from a star wars movie because everything in this is something i didnt know i wanted   the force awakens was good but it borrowed too much from the original star wars movie this is a unique story that goes in a bold new direction whilst also being a love letter to the fans who have stuck with the franchise for this long it also brilliantly ties together the themes from the previous movie i once thought that nothing could ever top the empire strikes back it could never be done but rian johnson proved me wrong creating the best star wars movie
Apr 14 2020,positive,the best one of the sequel trilogy  surprising emotional great action and amazing tone  i can see where youre coming from if you didnt like luke in the movie but it wasnt a problem for me  just sad it got destroyed by the big fans because let me tell you the critics and the casual fans adored it
Apr 14 2020,negative,disrespectful and incoherent steaming pile of garbage
Apr 14 2020,positive,this is such a different view on the star wars series in the skywalker story and so enjoyable and the force connection is a different way to tell the story of rey and kylo
Apr 14 2020,positive,its different from all other star wars movies its extremely entertaining and makes you think about the jedi order
Apr 13 2020,positive,best star wars film since the 80s
Apr 13 2020,negative,this is probably the weekest star wars movie of the franchise i mean it has no story they misplay several star wars characters and there are many plot holes that easily couldve been solved and they killed off one the most beloved star wars characters luke in such a cowardly way he just sat there and meditated instead of facing ben in person so overall super disappointing
Apr 13 2020,negative,the score is because what they did to luke skywalker totally destroyed character
Apr 13 2020,negative,i would like to justify and conclude that the sequels should have not happened especially the last jedi all these critics praising how good of a movie this believe they are star wars fans but in reality do not understand the consistency previous movies and comics embraced which ruins the whole dynamic of it apart from the inconsistency there are so many plot holes and loose ends that are never solved throughout the sequels i still do not understand how people think this was a good film
Apr 12 2020,negative,ruined star wars for me
Apr 12 2020,negative,as a star wars movie its among the worst as a film on its own its laughable how poorly constructed the film is the more i thought about the actual plot the more i was amazed how awful it was    why didnt any of the star destroys just hyperspeed into the main resistance ship this is the film that introduced the concept of hyperspeed being used as a weapon so it baffles the mind who the writer could have missed that simple detail and thats just one of its many many many problems  cherry on top it gives one of the most infamous examples of character assassinations in luke skywalkers portrayal and it only breaks my heart that mark hamill gave his all in this performance and only shows how committed the man really is   tlj  may not be the worst film ive ever seen but it holds a strong contender for my nomination
Apr 11 2020,negative,the visuals were amazing looked great sound design was pitch perfect and the cgi was seemless but i come to star wars for the world and the story which wasnt present beyond deconstructing the plot and fan theories by the director it wasnt much a story more of a screenwriter monologue about being invested means nothing since anything can be dismantled subverted killed or omitted enitrely didnt feel like a continuation to the story of the force awakens changed everything about the film in a way that cuts off any overarching plotlines breaks canon by utilizing the inuniverse technology in a way that makes space battles pointless and feels like a 15 minute episode rather than a 2 hour feature film i like rians work but he himself said that he hates working with an already built universe and especially with a story that isnt enitrely under him control he prefers oneoff stories which seems to be perfect for his style the last jedi was a mistake that derailed the entire trilogy and begun the downfall of disney star wars
Apr 11 2020,negative,there were so many inconsistencies and problems with this movie how do you even begin first of all disney is just hell bent on destroying the origional cast poor luke they ruined him how can you turn one of the most beloved characters in all of cinema in a matter of 5 minutes lets turn him into a bratty five year old who doesnt want it anymore they must have said they ruined him so much i was a little happy when he died thats crazy and talk about a horrible ending you set up snoke as this big bad guy only to kill him in a split second with no big pay off at the end dude i got sent back to thoughts of highschool blue balls watching that scene    but then theres the inconsistencies the last movie ends with a solid win for the rebels and then picks back up with them literally almost extinguished  the goal of the last movie was to give luke back his saber and he throws it away like its trash the first movie sets up reys parents as something special then only to be let down in the second movie and dont play the whole but she was palpatines grandaughter bs why tell us they arent important just to let us down for no reason theres no pay off in that lets have the big bad destroyer struggle to catch up to a ship whos already on their last straw and cant jump to light speed because that makes sense then leia is magically a jedi how the hell does that make sense they ruined han for this i can go on and on but im sure you stopped reading thanks for ruining star wars
Apr 11 2020,negative,its obviously the wrong way to go when making a trilogy there is something new and i can give it that but they lack who they are
Apr 10 2020,positive,really well done fun movie and hope for future star wars
Apr 10 2020,positive,a fresh approach to what a star wars film can be enjoyed the overall messages presented in the film the broken luke skywalker  the rashomon style look at his failure was interesting really liked the connection between kylo and rey especially with how it was presented
Apr 10 2020,positive,rian johnson has always taken risks in his films and i liked the outcome from the last jedi it is far different from the other star wars films there are some unnecessary characters and the code breaker quest wasnt great but other than that it was a successful departure from the usual star wars formula
Apr 9 2020,positive,the themes and ideas introduced are intriguing i love the luke rey  kylorey dynamic in the film pacing is a bit off  i hate space horses but is still a very carefully crafted film also probably the most visually breathtaking star wars film
Apr 6 2020,negative,it havent been until now that i have seen it i am happy i did not contribute to pay a ticket empire strikes back rip off i didnt like it one bit
Apr 6 2020,negative,strange choices inconsistency huge problems with plot
Apr 6 2020,positive,too long too reminiscent of george lucass slippery downfall into bad cgi and too much action while thinning the story thought disney was supposed to make this better
Apr 5 2020,negative,if you want to know why this movie is bad go on youtube and watch the long analyses people all over this planet have put out this movie was filled to the brim with character assassinations terrible choreography and no knowledge of the star wars lore its an awful movie why did the critics love it was it because it subverted expectations well yeah my expectations were completely diverted when people did things completely out of character you would think that lukes lightsaber anakins lightsaber would mean something to him with all the history its seen but he throws it over his shoulder absentmindedly and calls it a laser sword a jedis weapon deserves more respect i think its completely out of character that luke attacked kylo in his sleep luke who didnt give up on his father when everyone else already had this was like watching a terribly made fanfic where the writer hated luke for no reason and wanted to make everyone hate him i did enjoy when luke faced kylo but then he died i remember watching this in theaters shocked thinking did they just kill luke i didnt like it when leia mary poppined back to the ship with the force everyone described this as mary poppins and they are absolutely correct i dare you to watch footage of mary poppins and compare it to carrie poppins in this movie theyre twins i think they shouldve killed leia off right there because fisher died it wouldve made sense and would also be heartbreaking along with adding depth to kylo ren as he had hesitated rey was very perfect in this film which makes her a badly written character she lifted all those rocks with the force with no issue and was better than kylo and luke without any effort its impossible to connect and relate to a character who doesnt mess up though rey is less perfect in tros im talking about how this movie is shes extremely powerful and when i say this its not because i cant handle a female jedi for example ahsoka tano is a character who makes mistakes constantly and everyone can relate to her ahsoka is powerful ex decapitating four mandalorians at once surviving a duel with vader but her skills feel earned because shed been training her whole life rey hasnt finn was a useless addition to this movie hes a coward and when he finally decides to sacrifice himself to save everyone rose swoops in and stops him i was fine with roses character until that point when she broke into prequel dialogue and said its not about destroying what you hate its about saving what you love and then kisses him poe meant nothing to me and holdo was annoying kylo went shirtless for some reason snoke died ackbar died hux existed the throne room fight looked really cool until you watch it slowly go on youtube and look at an analysis for the fight and youll understand this movie was so bad and i remember during the canto bight scene i checked my watch and wondered how much was left and when it would get good like the critics said it didnt this movie looks like a flawless unblemished apple from the outside the visuals the excitement about how things will be after tfa but its rotten once you break past the skin 
Apr 5 2020,negative,jesus fucking christ that was like taking a shit in a sock and having to stuff it back up
Apr 4 2020,positive,well this movie is not that bad ok two halfs of the movie are just crap lets face it but the other half is actually preety good i know that if two halfs of a movie are bad the whole movie must be badright not at all because when this movie fly it fly high
Apr 4 2020,negative,put simply this movie is dull retcon garbage with a story that sounds as though the writer didnt know or want to know how this universe works destroying  narrative tropes left and right doesnt make you a visionary  it makes you a lazy try hard  but ryan johnson wasnt simply content with destroying this movie but destroying any chance the follow up to this movie will be any good either by killing off the primary antagonist and guaranteeing that the follow up has to engage in some serious mental gymnastics to even make it half way interesting
Mar 29 2020,positive,an entertaining but flawed ride brought to life by its philosophical heart associating with rey luke and kylo ren yet dragged down slightly by the meaningless adventures the other characters go on
Mar 29 2020,negative,terrible  watch the robot head critic videos on youtube  makes you appreciate the bad prequels that i grew up watching
Mar 29 2020,positive,its completely justified for a star wars fan to feel disappointed about the last jedi snoke dying without backstory rose existing characters being worsened but ultimately i think that rian johnsons decision of putting lots of emotional weight and new elements into the saga makes it better sure there are a lot of misfires leia suddenly has the force luke throwing away his lightsaber laser sword holdo long runtime phasma just dies plot holes etc but that doesnt stop the movie from being interesting the cast is does a great job most notably mark hamill carrie fisher and andy serkis the special effects action and score are all expertly done besides rey botching a move when fighting the praetorian guard and kylo is still a complex if she babyish villain overall its a good star wars movie but its not as impactful as the force awakens and the original trilogy
Mar 29 2020,positive,mark hamill is gorgeous
Mar 29 2020,positive,my first star wars movie it was fun
Mar 27 2020,positive,i think people really underrate this movie sure it isnt great the pacing is kinda bad and i can also see how this could be disappointing to a dedicated star wars fan the scenes on canto bight are really bad although i see where rian johnson was going he was trying to change finn from someone who just cared about himself in episode 7 to someone who really saw the negative effects of the empire this leads to him willing to give his own life for the cause later in the movie which is really beautiful im really disappointed though that they didnt let him die considering he did next to nothing in episode 9 i really liked how luke died along with that final battle i love the direction rian johnson was taking the series as he made the lightdark side a little less black and white episode 9 just forgot all of that of course the light speed ramming scene was absolutely magnificent i really didnt like vice admiral holdo as well as the fact that she just blatantly didnt tell poe her plan leading to that enormous waste of time and wasted of a plot line overall this is a underrated not very good but exceptional in many areas movie
Mar 27 2020,negative,poorly executed illogical on many parts
Mar 26 2020,negative,pros pretentious acting and disturbing nonlinear script  cons impressive special effects and great  costumes
Mar 26 2020,negative,total garbage shittier than the prequels
Mar 26 2020,negative,the entire movie that had one good wallpaper there is no comprehensible decisions video game cutscenes are written better
Mar 25 2020,negative,super boring they ruined everything about star wars
Mar 25 2020,positive,i know this movie gets a lot of hate i dont hate this movie i used to but i give this movie another chance and liked it its a pretty good movie its pretty weird but still good
Mar 25 2020,negative,complete waste of a film as far as i am concerned 7 8 9 do not exist
Mar 24 2020,negative,this is one of the biggest let downs ive ever experienced the movie is just bad stale characters boring plot bad pacing a lot of unnecessary stuff dude humor and forced social commentary this would be bad on its own but what makes it worse is that its star wars this film clearly has no understanding of what made the star wars franchise a success and blatantly undermindes it this film is an affront to the star wars franchise and to be honest space balls would have been a better sequel
Mar 24 2020,negative,after star wars vii which was controversal to say the least disney made a real disney movie   weak story little to zero character development plot holes in dozens and an unmotivated luke skywalker   i love the star wars franchise since the first movie but the new moviesjust dont feel like star wars anymore
Mar 24 2020,positive,only a few important characters but still probably my second favourite star wars movies kylo ren rips
Mar 23 2020,negative,annoying charecter made with respectable actors and where is the emotion you would that we should see luke skwalker mourning the death of han everything is a mess
Mar 23 2020,negative,dump beond imagination
Mar 23 2020,negative,this movie is a shame it destroys the plot that was built by the classic and prequel movies
Mar 23 2020,negative,this film would have been better if geoge lucas never handed star wars to disney my verdict it is one of the worst star wars films
Mar 22 2020,negative,did they even try to make a movie it goes from one political theme to the next even the dialogues  every speech has a message  and then most scenes end with a flat joke     they should delete tlj from the trilogy and only make it 7 and 9 you wouldnt miss anything
Mar 22 2020,positive,the last jedi has impressive technical effects and cinematography and shows rian johnson is a compeling director despite its narrative choices and plot twist are left to be desired but are retroactively redeemed because of the rise of skywalkers nerve to correct the previous narrative flaws
Mar 21 2020,positive,the best star wars movie ever it was different and one of the best blockbusters ever my comfort movie 
Mar 21 2020,positive,most faithful bold and interesting star wars movie since the empire strikes backeven if its somewhat messy getting there
Mar 21 2020,negative,out of the latest trilogy this is by far the worst out of all the star wars films it is still the worst it has a few cool scenes in it but it feels poorly written subplots that are completely unnecessary such as the whole casino planet scene and whats most frustrating is that by the end of the film nothing really happened the plot hasnt really advanced at all a couple of things happened which could have been done within 20 minutes but everything that the force awakens set up and got started rian johnson took an element of that and went more in a direction that he wanted rather than just what would have been good for the trilogy and the saga he ruined luke skywalkers character he ruined the possible development and direction snokes character could have taken us finns character development from the end of the force awakens was removed from the start of the last jedi there was no good character development at all in the whole movie for anyone and when you summarise the movie nothing actually happened and was basically boring with a few elements that kept it just about interesting to put simply if they said that they were going to remake episode viii and then be able to improve episode ix because of it with the same actors etc but a new writer or jj abrams and assume the last jedi never happened i would be all up for it
Mar 20 2020,positive,the more i watch this film the more i appreciate it living in a postrise of skywalker world makes it seem even better while it does take several missteps with finn and rose the scenes with rey kylo snoke and luke are some of the best star wars i have ever seen this was a film i didnt know i needed
Mar 20 2020,negative,worst of the saga it subverted all expectations in a terrible way
Mar 19 2020,positive,there are some dull scenes but they are made up for mostly by an interesting story and awesome action luke vs ben was great 90
Mar 19 2020,negative,as you watch this movie you get the sinking feeling that the writerdirector didnt take the time to learn the history or lore of the past stories or even seen the original trilogy and had simple cliffnotes of the previous outing     from wwii bombers in space where was the ywings exactly at the beginning to the slow spaceship chase scene that lasted for two thirds of the film star wars the last jedi spits on the legacy that came before and then hacks up a political diatrade of ill defined characters with paper thin motives while blacking the eye of existing characters and have them mired in a story that goes nowhere     this is the worst star wars movie ever put to film and i would rather fire up the holiday special than see this again
Mar 17 2020,negative,even a john williams score could not give this tired film enough artificial respiration to keep alive
Mar 16 2020,positive,this is my favorite star wars movie out of all of them i really enjoyed the storyline and the characters in this plot i know people have nostalgic feelings with darth vader but i really believe kylo ren is a superior villain of the series overall it is a great movie with great action cinematography characters and storyline snoke was the only bad part of the film
Mar 16 2020,negative,all in all the movie just felt odd and not quite star wars everything that was built with the new characters and the story in the force awakens seems to be thrown out the window in this film rose was a terrible character addition and one that certainly shouldnt have been front and center in the development of finns character the rey and kylo scenes were just weird and felt as a distraction to the luke and rey storyline although in the grand storyline they make a little more sense after seeing rise of skywalker with their connection but in real time they felt more random and out of place when they did occur in the last jedi poe was one of the best characters in tfa but in this movie it felt like he took a backseat to laura deans atrocious character and since when did hyperspace become a weapon it took 8 movies to introduce that this movie has it moments but it feels like a complete one off from the saga and not a continuation of the story
Mar 15 2020,negative,film is all over the place
Mar 15 2020,positive,basically an extended version of the battle of hoth the empire strikes back in which its plot was evidently based on too lacked content that was relevant to the story and contained irrelevant characters and subplots
Mar 14 2020,negative,one of the worst films i have ever seen and ive seen some terrible movies in my time 1 dimensional characters that are inconsistent and ridiculous plot holes boring slow motion chase scenes that last the whole movie 30 minute pointless scene in the middle of the movie no link to the previous movies no direction for the subsequent movies flat jokes that are completely out of character stiff direction with failed attempts to subvert expectations that become boringly predictable after the first few minutes of the movie
Mar 12 2020,positive,rian johnson did something that jj abrams was afraid to do making something original fans were too greedy and picky about luke skywalkers change while the change itself is actually quite fitting rian johnson must be praised for this masterpiece of a movie
Mar 11 2020,negative,the plot was bad luke skywalker was ruined hyperdrive was ruined kylo ren was not treatening at all because he had already lost in the last movie now he lost again and he became just a joke snoke was for nothing the cassino planet part was very boring rey still a mary sue worts star wars movie ive ever seen its a shame
Mar 11 2020,negative,in my opinion the worst of the sequels it invents new things which is a releaf but just everything feels shallow and with not much thought put behind it
Mar 9 2020,negative,i absolutely despise all that disney has done in all three of the star wars movies it doesnt fit anything the last 6 movies have done and i am holding out a small bit of hope that the new disney ceo completely cuts these movies out forever and always
Mar 9 2020,negative,it definitely subverted my expectations good job on that i suppose i think disney should let this franchise go to rest we need new and fun movies anyway not dusted off dugup corpses of what used to be great classics
Mar 8 2020,negative,oof that was rotten
Mar 8 2020,positive,theyre doing too much with this one the story is not very well thoughtout probably because disney didnt even have the script done when they green lit this trilogy they were in such a damn hurry to cash in on the star wars brand leia flying through space is the most absurd thing in all of the star wars movies i actually dont hate the kylorey story as cringey as it can be and theres plenty of nice visuals and new creatures for disney to merchandise but theyre still fun its not a bad film but its more recycled premises from the original trilogy and the imperial walker scene is quite literally just a rehashing of the snow battle in the first act of the empire strikes back its just hard to be excited about a movie that doesnt add anything necessary to the star wars universe but relative to other movies in general its fine
Mar 8 2020,negative,bad ruined my star wars
Mar 6 2020,positive,absolutely better than the force awakens and the rise of skywalker
Mar 6 2020,positive,my favorite star wars movie besides empire loved the performances of all the actors involved in the film the story was interesting and very well directed the mystery between the connection of kylo ren and rey kept me very intrigued and i loved the bit with the green milk the luke drank it made me laugh dont understand all the hate
Mar 5 2020,positive,rian johnsons direction with the last jedi is something fresh that the star wars franchise needed    really sad that they didnt build on his direction for episode 9
Mar 5 2020,negative,painful disaster by rian johnson
Mar 5 2020,positive,beautiful and perfect star wars film great sequel to tfa
Mar 4 2020,negative,franchise breaker i wish i could unsee this
Mar 4 2020,positive,certainly more engaging than its predecessor this one may be less of a crowdpleaser but is more rewarding 355
Mar 3 2020,negative,it committed the cardinal sin of any bad scifi  fantasy movie it was boring the long drawnout chase that lacked tension or surprise made the movie feel longer than it was    the second act was goofy in a prequels kind of way and the story beats that the second act followed ended up not mattering the star protagonist of the decadesold franchise luke skywalker was lazily written as the tired old guru hermit trope by a writer who clearly didnt understand the character who seemed afraid to explore any growth or change the character may have undergone in the intervening decades the conclusion was awkward and left the story pretty much dead ended handicapping the filmmakers of the follow up     its only saving graces were a pleasant aesthetic style for many scenes and some solid acting from several members of the cast
Mar 3 2020,positive,nothing really happens its probably the most skippable movie of the whole saga apart from episode ii how ever ryan johnson manages to give the film great aesthetical value
Mar 3 2020,negative,one of the worst movies ive ever seen
Mar 1 2020,positive,the last jedi somehow takes what seems like a dead end from the force awakens in my opinion and creates a very good film with incredible action shocking plot twists and unforgettable moments its biggest problem is that it doesnt feel like a sequel to the force awakens
Feb 29 2020,positive,star wars the last jedi gives rey and leia some beautiful scenes along with some epic battles the film is a journey well worth taking amazing visuals as well
Feb 28 2020,negative,awful is all i can say ruined the franchise
Feb 27 2020,positive,for the first time since empire star wars fans get an original and inventive skywalker saga chapter
Feb 27 2020,negative,incredibly lazy and low quality writing forcing political ideas in sf movie couses that poe even thou he did everrhing right is being yeld at all the time by his perfect co officers the admirals ship crash manouver is lazy idea  that leaves grand holes in all future and past space bettle tactics destroying galaxy greatest hero portreid as bitter weak old man even mark h hated the new luke weasting of snoke character ect
Feb 27 2020,positive,brings new life to a franchise that otherwise might be doomed to become eternally selfreferential
Feb 27 2020,negative,the rise of skywalker is just mediocre and boring but id take that any day over something that actively insults and frustrates me this film has no redeeming qualities its cringe fest all the way
Feb 26 2020,negative,nonsensical plotlines unexplained character actions and reactions and universedefying new science make for a sloppy worstyet star wars installment calling this story a bold move is about as generous a description as could possibly be merited the film offers absolutely nothing in the way of character arch and ignores every speck of groundwork laid in the force awakens when stripped of its entertaining visuals and underlying nostalgia this film is nothing short of a complete disaster
Feb 26 2020,positive,the sound came back as a proper character as every star wars movie should be     cinematography and performances are excellent as well be prepared to meet someone special one time again patience you must have lol
Feb 26 2020,positive,i think the last jedi is excellent for me but i dont know why audience give some low score maybe audience saw the film was slow or something lack however the film is still have some imagination moral lesson and emotional feeling upon this film
Feb 26 2020,positive,great movie introduces new elements and characters while still remaining true to the veterans on set didnt enjoy it back in 2017 but i love it now  go in with an open mind and expect to find a great movie
Feb 25 2020,negative,disney abandoned basic storytelling to make garbage cashgrab
Feb 25 2020,positive,while the movie wasnt without fault including the seemingly unnecessary casino plot and an unfortunate waste of potential for the development of finn this is easily one of the most beautiful movies in the saga is built around an incredibly strong theme failure being the greatest teacher and features the best dynamic between light and dark characters in any of the star wars movies
Feb 25 2020,negative,this film was a complete waste of time
Feb 23 2020,negative,garbage a rushed movie that does know nothing about the characters awful jokes
Feb 23 2020,negative,skip it  it gets rightly recanted in the saga finale the worst of all the star wars movies by a large margin made by someone with no love for star wars and that should not have been choose any other star wars movie and you will see a 35 star movie
Feb 22 2020,negative,this was the worst star wars movie by far a position episode ii had previously held for me this movie had the worst plot of any movie brought in useless characters ruined cannon star wars concepts like weaponizing lightspeed and worst of all johnson completely destroyed the character of luke so thankful that abrams sequel undid so much of what this movie tries to ruin
Feb 22 2020,negative,almost at the level of atack of the clones
Feb 21 2020,negative,absolute garbage anyone who would give this 5 stars is not a star wars fan
Feb 21 2020,positive,it was a star wars mpvienot much else to say then that
Feb 20 2020,positive,it was a good film in general but it did more bad than good to the star wars franchise and i didnt mind the character of rose i thought she could have added great character development to finn but no what they did with her was bad apart from the throwing the lightasber off the cliff thing i loved what rian johnson did with luke skywalker watch the film once youve watched episodes 13 then solo then rogue one then 47
Feb 20 2020,negative,crap dont waste time or money or air
Feb 20 2020,negative,it was absolute trash
Feb 19 2020,positive,this is probably the trickiest star wars movie there is most critics love it while most fans despise it in my eyes with no bias or personal feelings this is not a bad movie yet it is severely flawed i think it is a good addition to the saga and a good movie overall with bias and personal feelings however i would say this is my favorite star wars movie
Feb 19 2020,positive,the chemistry between ray and kylo worked for me the casino scene was dragging
Feb 19 2020,negative,repugnant film reylo glorifies abuse i loathe that additionally i despise the character assassination of luke in this film try to avoid seeing this movie at all costs
Feb 18 2020,positive,you have to take the good with the bad  some of the best star wars but also some of the weakest
Feb 17 2020,positive,amazing best movie in the sequels it was filled with secrets and logic and amazing cinematic shots
Feb 17 2020,negative,i dont understand why the actors were bullied but this movie wasnt very good
Feb 17 2020,negative,i was doing a marathon of all the star wars movies and to not be sad i stopped at the return of the jedi this is the absolute worst star wars movie and i know im not the only one whao thinks that way please save yourself some time and dont watch this disney is trying to kill everything that we love
Feb 16 2020,positive,it is the best movie of the new trilogy the storylines the visuals the throne room fight scene
Feb 16 2020,negative,i have nightmares over the fact this piece of trash is canon star wars
Feb 16 2020,negative,i can only assume anyone who liked this movie has never actually seen the original trilogy  its complete shite and rian johnson should never be allowed near a franchise film again  luke wanted to kill his nephew  thats an odd character development for the person who risked their life to redeem his father who was literally the worst person in the universe  and hyperdrive is now a weapon  seems like the whole rebel attack on the death star would have gone a lot better with this bit of knowledge  wtf
Feb 16 2020,negative,this is not a poorly made film technically but it is a poorly thought out chapter to the new trilogy  rian johnson believes that simply subverting expectations of the audience is enough to save star wars and keep it creatively fresh i dont believe people come to see a star wars film to be told nothing matters  no this is a disappointment to the franchise and it sticks out like a sore thumb because tlj does not carry the story laid out in tfa smoothly and consistently  instead johnson decides to throw out everything set up in the previous movie to do nothing with it  yes rian very creative indeed  its just a mess the film just feels like its going nowhere and the handling of some characters people were looking forward to seeing was just heartbreaking  im a big sw fan but the sequel trilogy is more enjoyable without tlj
Feb 15 2020,negative,i have never seen a movie that destroyed a franchise so much  the plot is about the resistancerebels running out of gas and the first order catching up  they somehow managed to ruin the jedi the rules of star wars and didnt offer anything in return
Feb 15 2020,negative,this movie was disappointing it really subverted my expectation that i would enjoy star wars wars
Feb 14 2020,negative,never in my life have i seen a movie hate its audience more
Feb 14 2020,negative,wtf rian johnson it takes skill to make a star wars movie that bad the story was the biggest waste of time you ruined luke skywalkers character the comedy made it seem like an avengers film and the comedy was pretty bad the action was terrible and most of the characters were bad as well why was rose tico there and you killed off admiral ackbar without so much of a second thought and replaced him with some purplehaired lady who no one cared about nice
Feb 14 2020,negative,what can i say about the most divisive star wars movie in history absolutely horrible this movie ruined luke skywalker the new characters were took in an awful direction i hate rose and holdo everything tfa set up  was threw out the window thanks rian johnson
Feb 13 2020,negative,as a fan of the old movies and the next three with anakin i was so disappointed by the way the minions at disney really made this movie saga a joke i dont wanna go into detail but i guess many other hardcore fans will share my view   on the other hand newer fans maybe enjoy it since its clearing up at least something the bright spot was definitely carrie fisher mark hammils appearance was also weird and short
Feb 13 2020,positive,dont listen to the narrowminded haters rian johnson has my full support with this surprising and thrilling in equal measure despite the slow chase through space ha its not as bad as it sounds
Feb 13 2020,positive,the new characters are forgettable but the inclusion of luke skywalker was great  overall this one was much more boring than the previous installment
Feb 13 2020,negative,the worst star wars movie i have ever seen and ive seen all of the star wars movies i would rather watch jar jar binks be an idiot for 10 hours straight than watch this movie
Feb 12 2020,negative,not star wars visually nice
Feb 11 2020,negative,i have been a star wars fan my entire life which is why i will leave a half star that it does not even deserve and walk away before i start an endless rant about this crime against the galaxy
Feb 10 2020,positive,a very good movie the story told is great
Feb 10 2020,negative,a tight race between this an phantom menace for the worst of the series 13rd great with good concepts and could have been a good way to twist the same tired sw story another 13rd that should have been left on the cutting room floor and another 13rd that is the most boring version of the a submarine movie ever produced
Feb 10 2020,negative,this movie is horrible in all senses  it doesnt have continuity at all and destroys its universe all together
Feb 9 2020,negative,honestly the worst movie ive ever seen on release during the first scene of the movie i had to walk out just because of how utterly ridiculous it is and how they throw away all the previously established physics involved in space travel on second attempt i had to stop once i saw someone flying in space thanks to the force finally years later i forced myself to watch it entirely what a damn mess and waste of time this is garbage please actually pay attention to what your making worst direction and choreography ive ever seen alot of the inner character decision making also makes little sense this whole trilogy should honestly be redone properly with a set goal in mind other than to include more woman as it stands this should be lost in history and forgotten
Feb 9 2020,positive,ugh this movie it was so boring with the resistance running away from the first order and that stupid casino planet with those horses  however the parts with rey and luke skywalker were good  so i think this movie was fine  everything ended fine with luke skywalker teleporting a ghost of himself accross the galaxy and then actually still on his island  everything was all going good and then he died  what the heck  he appeared on his island and looked like he was going to die but then he was okay and i was satisfied and then he died for no reason other than the stupid director
Feb 8 2020,negative,it literally ruined everything the force awakens did and had a really weird plot and was just so bizzare i cant see what rian johnson tried to do
Feb 8 2020,positive,so good this movie takes gamble which mostly pay off i loved the portrayal of luke as soured and bittered by the history and failure of the jedi and the choice to make reys parents nobodies excellent movie defiantly the best of the new trilogy and will hopefully be remembered as the empire strikes back of the trilogy
Feb 8 2020,negative,didnt like it  worst since clones
Feb 8 2020,negative,derailed the whole franchise
Feb 7 2020,positive,its a not a good movie its more of a waste of time but thats living up to its purpose due to the fact that its preparing u for the last chapter of the art like action compacted saga
Feb 7 2020,positive,absolutely fantastic such an improvement from force awakens this movie completely captivates luke from the extended universe and truly show the power kylo and rey posses the only bad part was the casino scene it felt a little useless and took longer than it should the crait scene where rose doubles finns speed and hits him from the side is sweet but also kinda made me go im sorry huh
Feb 7 2020,neutral,ill happily take a break from star wars
Feb 7 2020,positive,my favorite star wars movie it was made with passion and respect to the saga
Feb 7 2020,positive,one of the best of the whole saga visually powerful it has some of the best scenes of the st the characters evolution is awesome and feels organic we will always be longing for rey nobody
Feb 7 2020,positive,star wars something the black and red one   i am a proud nerd and a star wars fan and a movie buff and ive already forgotten which number this is     turns out unfortunately that this entry is not a very rewatchable one i remember almost every scene and got no more enjoyment watching it again rian johnson has crafted a movie of scenes and his spirit and very little else this time thats not enough for me its not enough for this franchise     the twist of reys parentage is equisite and equisitely acted and very beautifully simple im praying they dont retcon it in episode the next one     full of pointless scenes and contrivances this is filler that leaves all characters for the worst still it looks great and the battles are nice and it doesnt reek of reshoots like every other blockbusters these days shame this wasnt johnsons spin off instead    its a collection of fantastic ideas and rippling potential eclipsed by muddy execution lack of meaningful plot and character progression and multiple scenes that could have been left on the cutting room floor an accomplished movie but illicits neither deep introspection or fist pumping elation as the credits draw over the experience rian johnson may be a better director than writer choraling together something entertaining but not inspiring and ultimately pointless
Feb 7 2020,positive,entertaining ties up the riddle of reys lineage kyle rens outcome and  the end of the series i dont go to a movie to critique the movie i go because i want to be entertained
Feb 7 2020,positive,its fkg great well written beautiful cinematogry and it has the best acting of the whole saga i think its funny how ryan johnson understands the force better than lucas when he did the prequels he reinvented it and made it interesting plus rose is the most underrated character of star wars shes great and it sucks that she got replaced by some dude and just got 2 minutes of screen time in tros its as good as empire strikes back anyway great movie watch it
Feb 7 2020,negative,plot holes on plot holes leia is now mary poppins and luke drinks alien titty milk rose and snoke are pointless characters worst star wars ever
Feb 6 2020,neutral,it took 3 attempt for me to finish this
Feb 6 2020,negative,while it can be enjoyable at times mainly just seeing luke back its undeniable that this film completely misses the mark on what a star wars film should be the first scene of the film sums the rest of it up with luke chucking the lightsaber over his head which could almost be seen as a metaphor for rian johnson scrapping the story that was set up in the force awakens overall distasteful to say the least as a star wars fan and really fails at capturing anything worthwhile however adam driver as kylo ren is always good 
Feb 6 2020,positive,this movie is good for nostalgia alone but dont expect anything original
Feb 6 2020,negative,did not enjoy it they are ruining the star wars franchise
Feb 5 2020,negative,i cant even tell how much i hate this film and how it ruined everything star wars has established so far without writing an entire bible
Feb 4 2020,positive,see it a second time and itll become one of your favourite films in the entire saga
Feb 4 2020,neutral,the movie at the start was great then it got really boring and you start to wonder what is the point of this star wars movie in the new saga
Feb 4 2020,negative,trash threw luke as a whole away fucked up hyperspeed holdo sucks rose tico sucks better than rise of skywalker
Feb 3 2020,negative,what a waist  took all ll the history backstory and potential and shit on it
Feb 3 2020,positive,the movie fails to be true to what the characteres have represented in the past it is entertaining as an independent movie but it is not a decent piece of such an important saga
Feb 2 2020,negative,i dont know how to feel about this movie its beautifulbut kind of pointless in the overall story of the trilogy every time something interesting is presented to the audience it is almost immediately taken away my expectations were very high going into this movie so i was disappointed
Feb 1 2020,negative,the film was better than the precedent but the movie is the second sw worst of the saga another failure  all the characters was bad but only rey  kylo  are the worsts of all again it was good to see again the old characters before yodas cameos was the best but the movie fail in all ways copypaste again in epis56  the fights of lightsabers was bad and dumb really shame of the saga
Jan 31 2020,negative,almost impressively boring it excels at hating its characters and the audience watching it rian johnson is baffling
Jan 31 2020,positive,why are yall still tryna put this movie down the last jedi gave the trilogy that substance that it needed to survive lukes character actually had depth and meaning while still paying homage to the original series on top of that this has the best cinematography of literally any star wars movie ever almost every shot in this movie could pass as my desktop wallpaper     everyone seems to miss the whole point of the movie theyre mad that luke is a grump they dont like that the good guys didnt win and they dont like that poe and finns plan didnt work the whole point of the movie was that failure is the best teacher as said by yoda himself luke is a sad dude in this movie who later redeemed himself through one of the coolest force abilities ever the resistance badly looses to the first order but still manages to survive in incredibly small numbers     the biggest problem with this movie as well as the other sequels and prequels are the fans they dont know how to accept change even when it is necessary thats the exact reason why george lucas himself sold lucasfilm to disney for an extremely undervalued price of 4b he was burnt out and the catalysts were the fans who harassed him in the streets and online for ruining their childhood whats he supposed to do make the same movies over and over again thats not creative might as well waste your money on something more productive such as i dont know making a new movie with new ideas
Jan 31 2020,negative,a complete and total cinematic catastrophe sure rian johnson had to make a follow up movie to jj abrams soft reboot of the original star wars a new hope this limited him in who is characters were and what their struggles would be but thats what happens when you sign on to write and direct a film in a trilogy its just amazing that kennedy allowed each movie in a multibillion dollar franchise to not be planned out they had no plan this movie sucks so bad
Jan 30 2020,negative,i must say that i was very disappointed by this film it has some good moments in it some funny moments but i have major issues with some of the plot choices made by the writer the overall unevenness of the pacing and lack of internal logic in places    yes there are bold choices made in this film but for me those choices mostly didnt work too many of the established characters were completely wasted in this film as well as some of the new ones and that probably disappointed me the most things also dont add up or make sense if you really think about it its as if the writer was going out of their way to subvert expectations for the sake of subverting expectations i really enjoyed episode 7 despite the welltrodden ground it walked on because it was fun and stayed true to the established characters and lore but in episode 8 things are suddenly so dire and hope is completely lost it undoes some of what was set up in episode 7 seemingly for the sake of being different or played for laughs    i wanted to really enjoy this film but the flaws are just too great for me to do that it will also be the first star wars film that i will not be buying on dvd or bluray
Jan 30 2020,negative,boring and inconsistent schlock
Jan 29 2020,negative,worse than the star wars christmas special
Jan 29 2020,positive,the most well made well written star wars movie of all time
Jan 29 2020,positive,this movie was pretty good entertaining at times but slogs a bit in some parts    overall it didnt feel like much changed in the state of the galaxy  lukes character did seem off to me i can make some sense of it but just some odd stuff
Jan 28 2020,positive,stupendous best star wars film except for maybe the empire strikes back rian johnson is a genius great writerdirector tlj excels at innovation and being bold and fresh taking star wars in a new relevant direction with mature writing not the infantile awful fan service of rise of skywalker great character arcs witty dialoguebanter a story that flowed but didnt contradict the previous installment or episodes 16 but enhanced them to be sure  a great achievement just sad rian didnt finish trilogy or at least kennedyigor let trevorrow continue his masterpiece duel of the fates from where rian left off terrio  abrams are hacks worst directorwriter team for star wars ever please dont let them do anything else no more star trek no more star wars god no indiana jones abrams is a superficial slick action director only who couldnt tell a good story to save his life rian jonson is the master storyteller second only to lawrence kasdan if that love the last jedi the single most complicated mature enriched installment of the saga
Jan 28 2020,negative,this film has few redeeming qualities a moronic joke made by poe at the start of the movie sets the farcical tone carried throughout this failure of a blockbuster the only undeniable success of the last jedi is its ability to completely wreak havoc upon star wars canon i wish i had my time and money back
Jan 28 2020,positive,while i definitely understand what turns people off about this movie i found more than enough good material to compensate things like the lightspeed ram the throne room fight and the yoda cameo i love yoda made this a mustwatch for those who think the bad material is too overwhelming i point you to endgame endgame has tone of flaws with its lack of action character development heart and story for 90 minutes however the fantastic final act compensates for this and makes it a great film that is how i feel about last jedi it is very flawed but also contains some of the best material in star wars history
Jan 28 2020,negative,quite possibly one of the worst written films of all time writerdirector rian johnson wanted the characters and set pieces all to be in specific places and didnt care about getting them into those places humour which destroys the tension of the entire scene and an absolute focus on being unpredictable no matter the damage to the story and world as a whole someone at lucasfilm in future desperately needs to make sure there is an overarching plan in place if they do more trilogies and make sure the director does not have absolute control over the script
Jan 28 2020,negative,if i could give this movie negative stars i would gladly do so what a waste of money long live the eu
Jan 28 2020,positive,this movie was phenomenal in so many ways from the director to the story group the actors to the stunt team a must see
Jan 27 2020,negative,please never let rian johnson touch star wars again what a betrayal to the skywalker saga
Jan 27 2020,positive,personally i think the deviation from the tired old trope we saw beaten to death in the force awakens is a stroke of intelligence and people hating on this movie are quite frankly doing so out of a limited mindset  then again disney declaring all nonmovie plot lines noncanon is also out of a limited mindset so theyre also at fault here  but this is a genuinely good movie that doesnt just relive the glory days like the farce engorges did  good on rian johnson for plunging forth into a brave new world  it definitely made a difference
Jan 26 2020,neutral,hated how they dealt with luke story line story was disjointed and wasnt cohesive  one of the worst star wars movies ever
Jan 26 2020,negative,this movie had no depth and love in it sw8 was just a shallow experience
Jan 26 2020,positive,this movie has a lot of bad stuff but it has a lot of good stuff as wellalthough i like this movie im gonna have to admit that it is flawedcaptain phasma was wasted potentiali dont like that they made general hux a jokei hate the casino planet subplot with finn and rosepoe is kind of dumb in this moviei like kylo ren and rey in this moviethis movie definitely shut down the whole marey sueargumentluke skywalker is definitely the best part of the moviei love his character arc about him rejecting his status as a legendthe cinematography is probably the best in the sagathis movie has equal good and bad which is why this movie is so dividingfor anyone who doesnt like the movie i think you should watch it again with an open mind
Jan 26 2020,negative,worst film in the series
Jan 26 2020,negative,how to ruin star wars i wouldnt say this ruined my childhood like others but this ruined what could have been a good trilogy
Jan 26 2020,positive,when i first watched this movie i hated it but looking back i can appreciate it for what the movie did and brought into the star wars universe  even though it is a bit messy the movie has an important message to tell and exhibits great character growth rian johnson has amazing directing and storytelling skills and while he may say what you dont want to hear it is what you need to know this movie is akin to the empire strikes back which is why it is my second favorite star wars movie of all time
Jan 26 2020,negative,i just saw this movie for the first time because i heard it was bad and wow was everyone right they ruined the franchise and my childhood 
Jan 25 2020,negative,after waiting a lifetime to see my favorite fictional hero of all time return to the theater i was unbelievably disappointed and consider my time as a star wars fan at an end  i will not see the movie that follows this
Jan 25 2020,negative,where to start  when they disrespect the main theme and character of the series how can you expect the movie to be popular  no originality no new ideas everything about these new movies feels rushed  just make more action sequences forget the story nothing new here except the special effects
Jan 25 2020,negative,terrible movie the story made no sense and was completely unbelievable the special effects were excellent but in the end if the story is bad it doesnt matter
Jan 24 2020,positive,i enjoyed the directors vision for this movie
Jan 24 2020,negative,the only thing this movie was great at was aiding in destroying a franchise many have loved for decades
Jan 24 2020,negative,this movie was overhyped from the beginning  that doesnt help i dont have time to rant like i normally would so im going to detail my top gripes in bullet pointform      luke died without ever showcasing the strength of the most powerful jedi   the finn  rose side quest  romance to casinoroyale was pointless   chrom trooper was again a weak character   benicio del toros character was not interesting enough for a 1done appearance   admiral holdo was uncharismatic on screen although allegedly an interesting character if you read starwars novels    leia not only didnt die after being sucked into space but instead mary poppinsed to the nearest spacedoor    snoke seemingly died a pointless death    awesome things about this movie   music   alien puffins   rey  kylo fighting as a team
Jan 24 2020,neutral,fell short but not phantom menace short
Jan 24 2020,negative,so much potential all turned to scraps and jokes disappointing 
Jan 24 2020,negative,jesus christ how the fuck can you even go so wrong with star wars
Jan 23 2020,negative,the last jedi is the worst star wars movie ever with a confusing plot useless characters and scenes and a complete misinterpretation of the things that the jedi the sith luke and the force are
Jan 23 2020,negative,ideas for a great star wars movie 1 let leia fly through space 2 lets make a chase of space ships in slow motion 3 let the hero die of exhaustion what a boring piece of cinema
Jan 23 2020,positive,this was a great movie it did what the forst two in this series failed to do  make it feel like a true star wars film i feelike the 1st 2 couldve been told in one film and this couldve been told in two but all in all it is an excellent film
Jan 23 2020,negative,lack cohesion to the other 2 movies in the series the story is a mess the writing is horrible this is a too lack of plot planning and character development shows a profound lack of understanding in multi movie planning the star wars universe and pacing of events shame on you
Jan 23 2020,negative,pretty terrible in terms of narrative structure and the overall execution of the films attempts to deviate from star wars themes and original canon the acting for a lot of the characters often feels forced cheesy and stale as well as some scenes that were probably meant to be taken seriously i found hilarious and im not even going  to try and go into detail about the various potholes in the movie it was just very all over the place and disorganised its path and i cant say any of the messages it was trying to convey ever really made themselves apparent or made a huge impact on me overall it was just kind of a meh movie and i wouldnt really reccomend it im afraid
Jan 23 2020,negative,star wars really has lost its way since the originals these new disney ones suck
Jan 23 2020,positive,lots of excellent choices were made several that are questionable the movie has stunning visuals and compelling dialogue which is not something that can be said of most star wars films
Jan 23 2020,negative,trash soooooo bad dont watch it
Jan 23 2020,negative,this new trilogy episodes vii viii and ix is completely dispensable and should be ignored as it completely distorts everything that was previously done about star wars in films books games and comics
Jan 23 2020,positive,rian johnson knows how to make a movie tell emotional stories and allows the audience to be a part of the experience best sw sequel
Jan 23 2020,positive,loved this movie  the emotions that came about were very real  the way that luke had cut himself off from the force and didnt know that han was killed in tfa was very raw  my family and i watch this movie all the time
Jan 23 2020,negative,episode 8 was terrible why anyone at disney let this pass ill never know episode 7 was good enough and episode 8 had the chance to really pull me into the characters but seriously fell flat losing han in episode 7 and then luke in 8 was absolutely stupid we knew we had lost carrie fisher at this point so before episode 9 came out we knew we had lost all the original characters pretty pointless to watch the movies at that point
Jan 23 2020,negative,holy hell im 52 and have seen all 8 star wars movies  plus the 2 side movies in the theatre i consider myself to be a huge star wars fan not after this streaming turd unwatchable princess leah dies and floats through space but wait shes not dead um ok a casino why a prison cell  who is the mysterious guy who caresan hour long chase who is chasing whom why are they chasing them who knows who cares its action and exciting why is luke so angry who knows why do rey and the other characters have the personality and charisma of a wet dish rag who green lit this how do i make it stop please god make it stop this is so bad i wont waste my time seeing episode ix this movie officially killed a franchise
Jan 22 2020,positive,finaly a fresh take on the tired star wars formula not everything works and the three main characters could have been utilized a little bit better here and there but overall they all get three very strong arcs probably the first star wars movie since the very first one thats actually true to what it preaches    this would have been a great jumping off point for the finale of the new trilogy or even a new one sadly that didnt happen
Jan 22 2020,positive,im a fan i really think they did a good job in ending luke skywalkers journey it didnt feel rushed the whole movie was fun to watch with some funny parts and also kept you wanting to watch more
Jan 22 2020,positive,my disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined
Jan 22 2020,positive,this movie is a perfect sequel to the force awakens it challenges the characters with unique situations and adds a much needed chemistry not to mention adds iconic scenes to an iconic universe i cant say enough good things about this movie
Jan 21 2020,negative,the entire plot is predicated on the fact that holdo doesnt tell poe the plan thats ridiculous if she tells him what the plan is the entire movie doesnt happen
Jan 21 2020,negative,a destruction of the tenacious character created by george lucas luke skywalkers falling film was a brutal assassination by rian johnson
Jan 21 2020,positive,repeating things that have already been repeated the rebelsupagainstit plot with heroes worn down to the nub of their fighting spirit feels like a rehash of rogue one and the attempts to echo the look and mood and darkening design of the empire strikes back makes clear that the new trilogy is an official monument to nostalgia
Jan 20 2020,positive,this has to be the best star wars film in the 2nd trilogy its unique and the movie is overall beautiful to look at
Jan 20 2020,positive,the best film in the sequel trilogy and my third favorite star wars film rain took risks and they paid off a film that star wars needed 
Jan 20 2020,positive,exciting new series but alot of stuff didnt make sense because of the classic disney of making a character so naturally overpowered and convincing kids that you dont have to work for years and decades in order to be a master at your craft i hate modern disney
Jan 20 2020,positive,the subplot with rose and finn was a tough to watch but better on a second viewing not a perfect film but thena great entry to the franchise i love how they developed the characters of kylo rey and luke in the movie the best lightsaber battle of the new franchise is in this mov some great visuals all around with great ca decent story to back it up again finn and rose are not my favorite but the rest stood out
Jan 20 2020,negative,it changes everything you knew about star wars this movie makes every lasting changes to the star wars universe and contradicts the entire saga it is also filled with so many false endings that you loose touch of the movie by the end rian johnson seams to write in plot twist after plot twist that do nothing but confuse the audience he subverts expectations so much it becomes meaningless it also does not build on the seventh film and does nothing to set up the next one  disney clearly had no strategic plan for the trilogy as a whole  it should be written as one story and the movies are split up into three parts  a very confusing and boring move to watch
Jan 20 2020,negative,worst movie of all the starwars franchise   really didnt want to see episode 9 because of this    they literally threw all of the building up to starwars over lukes shoulder
Jan 20 2020,negative,the last jedi was in context of the star wars saga and the surrounding trilogy of moveis completely inacceptable  the writing is painstakingly convinient and full of contrivances that ignore not only the in universe rules but common sense and yimple logic
Jan 20 2020,positive,i thought it was great and took the right direction for the franchise people seem to find the dumbest things to complain about but honestly the plot and direction was spot on people complained about tfa being to similar to anh but then they complain that this movie didnt stay true to the mythology i think this movie went the absolute right direction  bravo
Jan 20 2020,negative,pointless get ready for a wild ride that leads nowhere
Jan 20 2020,negative,this was roughi mean if you have a movie with three primary story arcs and only one of them goes anywhere just barely than what is even being accomplished there is a whole story arc that ends up having no baring on the plot in anyway and certain character choices left you baffled not in a good way i still havent figured out what the story was supposed to be or what was even accomplished this movie is a pure mess and gets 15 stars on the sheer strength on the impressive visuals and good music albeit recycled music if youre on the fence about seeing this dont
Jan 19 2020,positive,this film is a great example of innovation in star wars a thing that it need it i definitely love it
Jan 19 2020,positive,dives the series into bold and creative directions character arcs have depth and complexity subverts expectations because its specifically not shameless fanservice
Jan 19 2020,negative,i loved the visuals really loved it but i didnt ejoyed the story at all its a shame that jonson didnt get his own trilogy because he is good but writing only this episode ruined the whole trilogy as a whole
Jan 19 2020,negative,just an insult to previous writers directors and fans a huge segment with the casino was worthless characters doing things that make no sense whatsoever breaking the fundamental laws of how things work just for a stab at wow factor i left the theatre feeling confused and unsatisfied
Jan 19 2020,negative,worst film in star wars history and an utter pos
Jan 19 2020,negative,when a trilogy is madeone would assume the three movies would be written together so they flow into each other this movie was confusing erratic and made no sense from the force awakens    the subplots added nothing the casino was ridiculous adding new characters but getting rid of main ones made no sense finn deserved a much better plot and separating the main characters was a terrible idea    also luke skywalker not wanting to help never leaving the island and him not wanting to help was not what luke wouldve done     also rey was never properly trained and there wasnt one lightsaber fight and they didnt even mention the word called it laser sword instead so dumb  the movie was an insult to life long star wars fans
Jan 19 2020,negative,such a bad movie especially the throne room scene that fight made no sense also how did rey become so powerful so strong with the force with zero training
Jan 18 2020,negative,they tried too hard for shock value and ruined a character in the process also the whole poe vs holdo thing was useless plot that ran in circles and wasted time
Jan 18 2020,positive,maybe its because i just really love star wars  this movie was great and a really fun watch  made me feel like a kid again
Jan 18 2020,positive,having watched the entire sw saga this one is my favorite tlj has a distinct form of storytelling and cinematography compared to the others that i absolutely love it brought mark hamills acting abilities to a new level i absolutely adore this movies complex and powerful luke both luke skywalker and ben solo delivered impressive character depth and development that made me love their characters when neither was of interest to me before however the true star of this movie was the force itself we got to learn a lot of what it was and what it can do my only issue with this film is the actress who played rose she was neither good nor bad her bland and angry incorporation of rose was subpar at best nevertheless rj created a beautiful and memorable movie filled with many other intriguing new characters without depending on sw fan nostalgia he did well expanding on the concept of the gray side rather than focus on light vs dark side not to mention all the fight and action scenes are truly phenomenal it is a shame that rj wasnt in charge of last episode i wanted to see his vision for episode ix that reflects and develops what happened in episode viii
Jan 18 2020,negative,this is a great example of how not to do a second act in a trilogy it is also a cautionary tale against capriciously attempting to subvert audience expectations i would rather that the directorwriter would have subverted audience expectations by making the plot a romcom than by having taken the route he took with this comedy of errors it subverted my expectations by not being in the spirit of star wars and that is not a commendable accomplishment no movie has ever drawn my ire to the degree that this dumpster fire did
Jan 18 2020,negative,star wars died and this movie killed
Jan 18 2020,negative,by far the most incoherent and unnecessary star wars film every produced filled with unnecessary political jabs that serve no purpose
Jan 18 2020,positive,i utterly loved it i have never seen another film that carries so much meaning so much emotional depth foreshadowing rich character arcs and development and something that challenges and questions your ideals and indeed the very ideals of star wars while remaining true to the mythology that drives the universe at the core in every single frame gorgeous film
Jan 18 2020,negative,what a way to ruin star wars
Jan 18 2020,negative,awful worst movie of the  entire franchise
Jan 17 2020,positive,intelligent provoking and above all else refreshing the last jedi expects highly of its mature viewers in challenging what we know while brilliantly expanding on the arcs of rey and kylo
Jan 17 2020,positive,easily the best star wars movie since the ot a story that challenges characters while being a visual feast the ending of the movie is a love letter to old school star wars fans looking up to and being inspired by the legends of the heroes of this franchise
Jan 17 2020,negative,horrible movie with no plot development the whole finn and rose plot was so unnecessary and so forced all i could do was cringe i was expecting snoke to be a bigger character than he was but nope wasted character in a matter of minutes
Jan 17 2020,positive,masterpiece presses all the right buttons the series needed after slumbering for too long people will look back at this in the future as absolute masterpiece
Jan 17 2020,negative,i wish i could go lower than 5 stars what was the point of this film zero storyline nothing unique or new to the plot constantly frustrated throughout the entire film
Jan 17 2020,positive,gonna go down as the last great star wars film marred mostly be scam youtubers begging for clicks i know most will say its not flawless but forget that if people want to give it 1 star for treating luke like a human being instead of some eu god who could use the dark and lightside of the force at will i dont need to bother explaining for certain the throne room scene is the greatest in the entire star wars saga
Jan 17 2020,negative,critics obviously didnt watch the same movie i saw 
Jan 16 2020,negative,really took a dump on the fans destroyed lukes character then killed him off finn and rose on some random side quest that really did nothing for the main story line something out of a video game side quest for extra xp
Jan 16 2020,positive,star wars the last jedi is an undervalued and underappreciated gem in the star wars saga its very clear from audience reviews that many people arent very good at allowing their beloved franchise to go in the direction that its creators want instead clinging to their own ideas of what star wars is creating impossible expectations that can never bet met and an outcry which as we saw from the rise of skywalker leads to stagnation and the directors not trying anything new giving us lacklustre and hollow movies    make no mistake about it the last jedi is a fantastic movie both as a star wars movie and as an individual piece of science fiction one just needs to allow the story to unfold and let the events on screen  unfold before their eyes and leave their expectations and predetermined notions of what star wars is at the door
Jan 16 2020,negative,terrible movie with some great moments glad they fixed everything in the rise of skywalker 
Jan 16 2020,positive,the penultimate movie of the long standing skywalker saga delivers a visually stunning film that bridges the gap between the epic force awakens and the inevitable ending of the skywalker saga with episode 9 showcasing how conflicted each character is by not only their surroundings and the ongoing war but also with inner demons and uncertainty the return of luke skywalker showcases a very different version of the character then we are expecting or even used to watching mark hamill portray a man who is disillusioned with his teachings and his religion was a little jarring but allowed for the ending and for reys emergence to mean more this was a roller coaster ride of emotion and action culminating in a fantastic pair of lightsaber battles the fight in snoaks chambers  kylo ren vs luke skywalker ghost definite recommend for any star wars enthusiast and even for casual fans
Jan 16 2020,positive,as a huge star wars fan this movie reminded me of seeing a new hope for the first time adventurous beautifully shot intense reflections inspiring story couldnt wait to see the next chapter
Jan 16 2020,negative,possibly one of the most disappointing movies i have ever seen
Jan 16 2020,negative,wow subverted expectations in a really really really bad way  thanks for destroying star wars disney
Jan 15 2020,negative,unwatchablereally
Jan 15 2020,negative,didnt like second act the cassino  finns arc
Jan 15 2020,negative,meaningless arcs poor written characters and politics filled
Jan 15 2020,positive,this movie makes some unconventional choices but ultimately brings new ideas and strengthens the characters so much in the force awakens rey is lost and tries to find her place rian johnson takes that and makes it the core of the character she is actually no one she wont get any help she needs to define who she is on her own couldnt get more emotionally resonant than that im thankful for this movie especially after watching episode ix
Jan 15 2020,negative,this movie was so bad that i havent gone to see another disney star wars movie since    and i went to see the phantom menace in 3d years after it came out
Jan 15 2020,negative,maybe it looks good but the last jedi has an extremely incompetent script with rian johnson flexing on us with his clever subversion of expectations rather than giving us an actual good story that has the greater good of the franchise in mind
Jan 15 2020,positive,star wars the last jeti is easily unlikable because of its half baked jokes and silly unnecessary scenes of luke skywalker that even mark hamil disliked
Jan 15 2020,positive,this is the most complex best written visually stunning star wars movie
Jan 15 2020,negative,everything wrong in modern film directing a director being given a product and delivering a result skewed to their own political viewpoints while disregarding the lore character history and audience the movie has become so unbearable to watch that i do not even consider it a star wars movie any longer it is an accident that must be hidden from future generations of fans
Jan 15 2020,negative,i really embrace changes reinterpretations and new ideas but its a stupid idea to put them in the middle part of a trilogy johnson should have made one of the spinoffmovies and not episode viii maybe i would even have enjoyed his childish sense of humor or the way he mocks the audience by making everything meaningless or is bringing something totally unrealistic as star wars to the point where its illogical to the max and really forces you to silence even the slowest of your brain cells maybe he should write a new spaceballsmovie he obviously has the right ideas
Jan 15 2020,negative,meh johnson has some fun original ideas but we want to know what happens with the story thats already been set out what would fans think if i took the harry potter characters and put them in a james bond style film it wouldnt really fit
Jan 14 2020,negative,how this movie is so well received by critics is beyond me  rian johnson obviously has no appreciation for what has gone before and wanted to be edgy and different and subvert what we had come to know and love from previous star wars movies the characters act in unbelievable ways  including most famously destroying the idol of our childhood luke skywalker you want to make a point that heroes are fallible fine make your own movie unrelated to what has gone on before dont completely derail the narrative arc established by others others have pointed out the massive plot holes  yes a certain suspension of disbelief s necessary for a star wars movies but this movie asks us to completely check our common sense at the door and ignore the rules that have been established in this universe this is the first star wars movie that i watched once and will never watch again indeed i only saw the rise of skywalker because i had heard it rejected much of this movie
Jan 14 2020,positive,this movie got a bad rap from fanboys who dont want moral ambiguity introduced into their precious canon it ruled and rise of skywalker sucked get at me
Jan 14 2020,negative,absolutely terrible completely ignores major plot points from the previous movie and leaves the next movie with absolutely no direction to go in
Jan 14 2020,negative,a disgrace to all of star wars
Jan 14 2020,negative,ughhh more politics than episode 1 and not even space politics
Jan 14 2020,negative,there was no saving grace to this movie poor angsty acting meandering and boring plot
Jan 14 2020,negative,this movie is a trash ryan johnson make star wars like a stupid clown  imagine you give harry potter a lightsaber thats what happen with this movie
Jan 14 2020,positive,this movie shows the philosophical potential of hollywood and the star wars franchise the dialogues between the three protaginsts kylo ren rey and luke skywalker are thoughtful displaying different points of view on the same topics the old quote from a certain point of view finally makes sense rian johnsons take on the force is more than the boring black and white conflict weve seen more than seven times now as he looks in the gray areas between the extreme positions of the jedi and the sith the characters in this story have small but believable arcs which is a nice contrast to the poetic and nearly surreal action scenes of course there are space battles and lightsaber duels but they never felt so magical and powerful before compared to the previous episode vii this movie offers simple but in second thought meaningful answers to the questions of lineage power and motivations of the antagonists   a downside is the enormous length due to a large subplot and several plot twists some new characters might not meet everyones tastes but they are designed to be unsympathetic on purpose except for luke skywalker the focus of the movie is totally on the new characters which could disappoint some hardcore fans of the original movies
Jan 14 2020,negative,terrible movie dont watch if youre a fan of star wars it will ruin starwars as it did for me
Jan 14 2020,positive,it had very mature undertones most childish sw fans would not understand but it was a beautiful plot
Jan 13 2020,positive,the best studio blockbuster of the 2010s
Jan 13 2020,negative,didnt answer any of the questions set up by the first film felt like they wanted to tell their own story and not build off the previous film a lot of political gesturing in the movie too which sucks overall i didnt like it
Jan 13 2020,positive,i think future generations will be much more gracious towards this film than fans were immediately after its release ive watched the whole sequel trilogy three times now and this is the only one that gets better every time i watch it ill admit after watching the last jedi for the first time i was conflicted it didnt feel star warsy enough for me but now after having just watched the rise of skywalker for the third time im convinced that the last jedi is far and away the best film in the sequel trilogy
Jan 13 2020,negative,it would have been 4 stars if it was a stand alone film but the director didnt seem to care that he was directing the second part of a trilogy only after seeing the rise of skywalker can you realize how disneys lack of planning damaged this trilogy
Jan 13 2020,negative,it reminded me more of a shallow sitcom than of the actual great epic that starwars is  completely broken of immersiveness and a very shallow cast
Jan 13 2020,positive,theres a lot to like about this movie and a lot to dislike i felt like it pandered pretty hard and made some promises it couldnt keep it also failed to set up a great villain which put episode 9 in a bad spot
Jan 12 2020,negative,constant gotcha moments and total disrespect for both the franchise and the other movies in the trilogy nearly killed off the star wars franchise for me    at least the visuals are well done so it has that going for it i guess
Jan 12 2020,negative,the terrible attempt at humor and the character assassination of luke skywalker make this movie nearly unwatchable
Jan 12 2020,negative,by far the worst star wars movie i have ever seen it was so horrible i refused to pay for and watch the 3rd and final movie of the latest trilogy im sorry but disney has officially destroyed this series for me and it will take a miracle to get me to watch another movie
Jan 12 2020,positive,boring and lacks internal cohesion at least there is a script which is more than what can be said for the previous film
Jan 12 2020,negative,the only positive i can say about this movie are its visuals but there lies also a big problem with the writing a lot of style over substance so to say  it seems like theyve tried to keep the audience in aw to gloss over a lackluster script filled with way to many plotholes unnecessary sciences  plotlines and unbelievably overstuffed with bathos   the script seems desperate to reverse the audience expectations in every moment which leaves you with not much but confusion and pretty scenery   the handling of the canon is probably the worst ive ever witnessed in a sequel established characters are completly rewritten and made fools just for a cheap laugh its fine to introduce a new generation but please leave to story you carry on with a little bit of dignity
Jan 12 2020,negative,the worst star wars movie ever  period  even worse than the episode 2
Jan 12 2020,negative,there are some cool scenes but basic logic ruins even the best of them major characters are ruined by completely reversing entire character arcs from the previous films whole scenes feel forced to provide a social message that isnt organic to the overall story the revolutionary message that anyone can be a jedi is not revolutionary decades of star wars storytelling have already established that lineage is far from what makes a jedi the prequels already established that jedi were not found by lineage but rather their innate talent independent of their heritage the story beats look great on paper but are tragically fumbled in execution its a fun watch but far too reminiscent of the prequel trilogys worst moments
Jan 12 2020,negative,wtf was disney thinking
Jan 12 2020,neutral,worst in the whole skywalker saga and yes the phantom menace is a good movie
Jan 12 2020,negative,risky with questionable decisions a little original plot poorly made twists and a lazy script makes the last jedi divide the fans and be several steps less for this new trilogy 
Jan 12 2020,negative,i dont know what they were thinking when doing this movie even episode i is better
Jan 11 2020,negative,a no plot film  you can actually got from force awakens straight to rise of skywalker and not miss any information  at all insulting way to handle lukes moments absolutely slapping the audience with any love for the original trilogy  dont ruin star wars for yourself and skip this nonlogical rule breaking waste of time
Jan 11 2020,positive,dude this movie is everything
Jan 11 2020,neutral,really didnt make a lot of sense jumbled and messy plot lines
Jan 11 2020,neutral,well that movie is a almost complete failure c
Jan 11 2020,negative,at least the plot is not a rip off of the other movies still a mess full of plot holes and unexplained actions and characters
Jan 11 2020,positive,after all the critics its one of the best staelr wars movie
Jan 11 2020,negative,least favorite sw film ruins the st in my opinion
Jan 11 2020,positive,unlike many i enjoyed the fresh take on a four decade old saga often i find fans too bogged down by star wars tradition in my eyes the best things have always been something original and new this is my favorite star wars movie by far i was on my edge of my seat from the moment i saw that iconic blue text up on the screen 9510
Jan 11 2020,positive,a stronger standalone film than most and willing to take risks which is refreshing but far too much soapbox at times
Jan 11 2020,negative,absolute rubbish director should find a new career as clearly this was a wrong choice
Jan 11 2020,negative,absolutely crap totally pointless movie dont bother
Jan 10 2020,negative,the last jedi is a movie that critics loved because they thought it did somethings different than other star wars movies while there are some things that are different what it really does at the heart of the movie is take most critical locales and events in empire strikes back as well as a few from return of the jedi and either mimic or subvert the decision or outcome crait is hoth but salt not snow rebels being chased by an empire are replaced by resistance chased by first order benicio del toros hacker character helps then betrays while lando betrays then helps rey trains as a jedi with a reluctant master while luke trained with a patiently waiting one rey rushes off from her training to confront kylo ren like luke rushed off to confront vader rey lifts stones and luke lifted stones vader to luke no im your father kylo to rey your father is nobody luke is the jedis last hope in empire and rey is the jedis last hope in last jedi luke enters the abandoned rebel base on crait similar to his entrance in jabbas palace on tatooine in return kylo presents rey to snoke similar to how vader presented luke to emperor in return rey watches the fleet battle from the throne room as luke watched the fleet battle from the throne room in return you can call it new or you can say a lot of it was mostly empire flipped on its head force facetime between rey and kylo is interesting but eventually annoying some scifi fans believe the plot of the resistance fleet is borrowed and adapted from the remade battlestar galactica series and they might be right battlestar also had a casino planet which was more interesting and engaging than canto bight the last jedi doesnt even try to be subtle with its messaging with words that ring from screen to reality like kill the past a nod to both letting go of nostalgia and resentment in the fanbase and the old stars as well as the expectations that come with a 40 year old franchise but getting hit over the head with the spark that lights the fire notion so many times leaves audiences to think the writers and director dont entrust them with these critical themes also preaching about the gray areas of war when the series is literally about war while freeing animals but not children dances around the issues and seems a little hypocritical the holdo maneuver was well shot but begs the question why the series doesnt use projectiles fired at light speeds as a weapon more often or why a droid couldnt have piloted the ship instead of holdo why does holdo withhold information from poe but then commend him when speaking to leia a lot of plot doesnt quite make sense and a lot of character development is thrown out in fact last jedi ditches most of the setup that force awakens laid down in order to go its own direction for continuity of fans thats disjarring all in all its an ok movie with a few cool scenes throne room battle but ill take empire and return over this one every time
Jan 10 2020,positive,dont understand the hate this has everything i want out of star wars 
Jan 10 2020,negative,terribly convoluted dribble
Jan 10 2020,positive,the movie dwells more with the spiritual side of the force and strips back the action it is not bad by anymeans it is different but i honestly feel it is a much needed star wars movie
Jan 10 2020,positive,pretty standard sci fi film it was disappointing to see abrams ideas go unanswered or be completely thrown away but despite that we are still left with a pretty good film the cast is great and excels better here than in the force awakens if im being honest the bad parts involve the casino scenes or the parts revolving the animals they were dragged out and really halted the flow of the film overall i thought lukes storyline was good and rey worked well with him the ending with him was sorta a waste but its fine kyle ren is still an inadequate villain and is void of any real personality snoke is wasted but his battle scene in the red room with rey and kylo was phenomenal and showed a section of how amazing film could have been
Jan 10 2020,neutral,why does this get 91 rotten tomatoes but joker gets 69
Jan 10 2020,positive,solid star wars film with the heart of a star wars fan front and center
Jan 10 2020,negative,this movie was not good what they did with luke skywalker was horrible and made a bad taste for the beloved character and the rest of the movie was barley ok although kylo ren was the best part of the movie
Jan 9 2020,positive,decent move with some kinda dumb parts
Jan 9 2020,negative,ghastly should be called the last mary sue turns every character you loved from the original into a clumsy incompetent fool to be outshown by a zany teen lead
Jan 9 2020,negative,this movie makes the phantom menace looking good in comparsion
Jan 9 2020,negative,an insult to star wars and its legacy
Jan 9 2020,positive,i enjoyed the grittier tone and luke skywalkers story arc not so much the daftness of mary poppins in space and the pointless trip to harry potter world trouble is the chase in space part feels more like a drawn out tv episode than a film
Jan 9 2020,negative,worst of the star wars movies actors worked with what the director gave them absolutely nothing 
Jan 9 2020,positive,this film is amazing the last jedi elevates this franchise to a higher level
Jan 9 2020,negative,for a scifi movie its okay but it sucks as a star wars movie it was like rian johnson saw all the previous star wars movies and decided he just wanted to watch them all burn 
Jan 9 2020,positive,is a good reboot of the franchise  explain the context and give to the new characters some identity to expand the sw universe
Jan 9 2020,positive,if this were the first act to the trilogy it would have been really interesting  the problem is it isnt its the second act and rather than expanding on the plot from the force awakens or answer some of the questions we had a lot of the buildups are completely abandoned with new ones being created in its place therefore as a second act it fails to act as a smooth transition to the final film so in the end what we have plotwise is a second act that goes nowhere this is why the rise of skywalker had to do the last jedis job in the opening 3rd of the film  and that is really unfortunate because the rise of skywalker is a good movie and would have been even better if it had a competent second act    with that said however i did enjoy certain aspects of the last jedi the visuals are absolutely stunning the effects department have done a fabulous job mixing practical and digital effects to create an inhabitable world that is believable to the viewer  i also enjoyed the performances yes even the new characters were likable and enjoyable to watch especially poe  but overall what we have is an ineffective second act which really drags down the rating which is why i cant give it any higher than a 35
Jan 9 2020,positive,a great film that only sufffers a bit from the way that humor is pushed on the audience there is also a particular scene in the film that shows a lack of understanding of an integral concept created by lucas this film uses misdirection to toy with the expectations of longtime fans which will get mixed reviews for sure but in the era of game of thrones that felt fun and gave an element of surprise to this film all in all a much better movie that its predecessor which is a tired rewrite of a new hope with a female lead
Jan 9 2020,positive,an interesting new direction that tries to redefine the star wars franchise to meet a modern audience and allow room for growth it blends fun action with some greater meaning themes but be warned this is not your fathers star wars
Jan 9 2020,negative,rian johnsons complete departure from the plot lines and character development of the previous seven star wars movies served to utterly destroy the star wars franchise
Jan 9 2020,positive,just a quick note on this film im not primarily a star wars fan although i do enjoy the story of the star wars saga when i first read and heard fan reviews of the film i thought that it must be a piece of crap and avoided it it took 2 years but i finally watched it so when i see the rise of skywalker i will have the complete story i have to say that i thoroughly enjoyed this movie   yes some of the scenes were a bit campy and cheesy but the action heart and star wars atmosphere were all there and it felt like a strong middle entry for the final trilogy aside from die hard star wars fans which havent liked any star wars film since the return of the jedi i dont see the negativity from audiences i dont understand it the movie was action packed with excellent visuals typically amazing music score and the typical campy star wars comedy that made the last jedi a fun experience im actually excited to see how the saga ends this film was excellent
Jan 9 2020,negative,proof that critics have no idea what they are talking about
Jan 8 2020,negative,incredibly slow first half and questionable narrative direction led to an unsatisfying experience
Jan 8 2020,negative,awful awful movie johnson destroyed character arcs and did nothing to move the plot forward while making the first order ridiculous with cheesy humor it ruined a lot of fans love for star wars and lost the interest of average movie goers the force awakens earned 2 billion the last jedi 13 billion and rise will earn less because of this movie rian johnson lost disney billions of dollars and he is praised for it by critics and disney blows my mind
Jan 8 2020,negative,glossy headache inducing garbage it was like watching a best friend you looked up to admired idolised get burned at the stake
Jan 8 2020,negative,shame how far this series has fallen
Jan 8 2020,negative,probably my least favourite star wars movie feature with its subverting expectations
Jan 8 2020,negative,worst crap i have ever seen period    too bad i couldnt give 0 stars
Jan 8 2020,positive,fun movie with some controversial but brave decisions  the movie risked new ideas and thats definitely a positive thing
Jan 8 2020,negative,ruined everything the previous movies had built fight scenes were ridiculously horribly choreographed answers all of the questions that trailers arose in an unsatisfying manner gave undeserving characters too much power way to quickly and like captain marvel took a shit on everything that built it up for a lousy joke that no one remembered after the film honestly disgusting
Jan 8 2020,positive,the only one of the new trilogy that dared do anything different to the original trilogy its a shame that jj abrams went and undid it all in episode 9
Jan 8 2020,positive,rian johnson delivers on the most ambitious star wars film todate  bold smart rich with story and character depth johnson understands the heart of star wars goes beyond its superficial iconography  while a tad overlong and a bit messy at times though never sloppy the last jedi hits where it counts and features some of the best material this franchise has seen since the empire strikes back
Jan 8 2020,negative,i wish i could give 0 stars    this movie is by far the worst star wars movie ever made it is an insult to the greatest intellectual property in the world it gives the characters created by george lucas and the fans a big fat middle finger while spitting in our face    first things first the character of luke skywalker was totally mishandled to the point that mark hamill voices his concerns to ryan johnson while being ignored the luke skywalker of the last jedi if we can even call him that is totally out of character    admiral holdo withholding information from the rest of the crew was totally unnecessary and was nothing more but lazy writing created to force drama and create a subplot that acted only as a filler in the story     the holdo maneuver creates a giant plot hole for the hole saga if destroying a major target by having a small ship jumper into hyperspace and then crashing with said target is possible in star wars the why did the rebellion bother to fly the trench run and fire the proton torpedos into a small exhaust port when they could have simply have an xwing piloted by droid jump into hyperspace while slicing the death star in halfwhen you create a fictional story you have the liberty to create your own rules for said story even your own laws of physics it is important for you to obey the rules of the story with which youre working    canto bight is well lets just say that if you need a bathroom break now is the time to go although you may enjoy your bathroom break a lot more than the whole movie totally irrelevant to the plot    the list goes on and on ryan johnson succeeded in subverting our expectations we expected a decent star wars movie but instead we got a plate full of hot steamy excrement he was so obsessed in being subverting that he forgot that he was trying to make a good story thankfully the rise of skywalker retconned so many of the insults done by the last jedi that you dont need to watch the last jedi you can go staring from episode vii to ix
Jan 8 2020,positive,no ones ever really gone reys journey continues and the skywalker saga concludes in star wars the rise of skywalker    theres nostalgia bait and references to past movies and other established cannon just a step away from the wink wink nudge nudge did you see what we did there type of references the visuals are amazing and the spectacle is just as amazing daisy ridley and adam driver give their best performances of the series the music is even more amazing courteous of john williams which greatly enhances the movie and highlights how important a soundtrack is for a movie    the rise of skywalker rarely comes close to touching greatness the film tries to fit in so much it threatens to tear apart at the seams but ultimately rises to the impossible occasion to complete the saga 7510        director jj abrams genres action adventure scifi fantasy rating pg13 runtime 142 min starring adam driver andy serkis anthony daniels billie lourd billy dee williams carrie fisher daisy ridley domhnall gleeson dominic monaghan greg grunberg ian mcdiarmid john boyega joonas suotamo kelly marie tran keri russell lupita nyongo mark hamill matt smith naomi ackie oscar isaac richard e grant
Jan 8 2020,negative,up until the last jedi there was always something i liked about a star wars movie even if i didnt like the movie as a whole  i didnt like phantom menace but i did like young obiwan quigon  darth maul and so much more  but the last jedi didnt have anything i liked  luke was a pathetic hermit rose and finn went on some useless quest leia can fly like mary poppins there are horrible jokes and the holdo maneuver makes one wonder why it wasnt used all the time in space warfare  i know the director wanted to subvert expectations and that is okay if you have a stand alone movie but it doesnt work very well in a trilogy
Jan 8 2020,negative,hot trash seems like the director had his own agenda making this feel out of place for a trilogy movie
Jan 8 2020,negative,the worst star wars movie i have ever seen i dont care about nnothing on the new characters they dont have charisma and the director killed the true purpose of luke skywalker who in the original saga he was couraged and positive in this movie he is reduced to be a coward and all the things that he did in the past seems to have no sense this movie killed my intention to see episode 9 and i cannot care less from the characters of rey finn and poe
Jan 7 2020,negative,the new lead character of this generation of star wars movies is really badly thought out it has 0 defects 0 hardships to overcome perfect at everything in comparison the original trilogy was about learning how to lose to improve to thrive in the face of adversity this movie was just rey smashing through everything with ease with almost no training being able to go toe to toe with and even beating characters that devoted their entire life starting from childhood to fighting that is bad writing and keeps nobody glued to their screen its like a superman movie where there is no kryptonite no enemy kryptionians or any powerful aliens just superman versus regular humans
Jan 7 2020,negative,they kill my childhood with this movie they pretend to make more movies of this universe taking the last cent from it just to create merchandise
Jan 7 2020,negative,plot is terrible and they did the original characters wrong
Jan 7 2020,negative,the worlds longest space chase this movie is what happens when you fail to map out the direction youre going to take with a trilogy if you remove luke committing force suicide or we the eff that was  this movie would feel more like a fan film of what could have happened between episode vii and viii instead we get this trash pile that doesnt really serve to advance the trilogys story line  which furthermore paints the direction of the trilogy into a rushed corner for episode ix
Jan 7 2020,negative,the list of problems with this movie is a mile long  rian johnson should stay out of star wars  his understanding of the star wars universe is poor and his decision to use it to push his personal views on a variety of subjects outside the scope of this type of movie is infuriating
Jan 7 2020,negative,horrible in every aspect
Jan 7 2020,positive,2nd best star wars film only lower than empire in my opinion jj abrams and disneys retconning of this film in rise of skywalker is a huge disappointment
Jan 7 2020,negative,pointless generic sf movie with no star wars tone it could have been easily the second installment after spaceballs of a parody saga
Jan 7 2020,positive,loved it gutsy filmmaking compelling performances and exciting visuals exactly what you want in a star wars film the chemistry between ridley and driver is one of the best parts of the movie so many people hate this film because it takes risks and diverges from star wars tradition but that is why i love it so much it pays homage to what has come before whilst forging its own identity
Jan 7 2020,negative,this movie abused of the deus ex machina for me the worst starwars movie
Jan 7 2020,positive,i am very split about this movie when i first watched it i really did not like it and upon rewatching it i could better appreciate what it tried to do but in my opinion it ultimately failed at what it set out to achieve i still respect what was attempted but i probably will not be revisiting this movie again
Jan 7 2020,positive,i dont care what anyone else says this was my favorite one
Jan 7 2020,positive,fresh ideal and new story arcs although it lacks a little bit the oldschool adventure feeling
Jan 7 2020,negative,we needed jj for the director
Jan 7 2020,negative,lets make the answer to every question the worst answer possible and call it subversion
Jan 6 2020,positive,a rollicking good yarn
Jan 6 2020,negative,super bad and boring worst star wars movie ever it ruins a lot of great characters such as luke skywalker
Jan 6 2020,negative,its objectivemoral is failure so the movie is objectively bad why reys goal was to be trained she did resistances goal escape the first order they did and finally finn and roses goal get plans or something i never watched that part after seeing the movie in theaters but they won kind of now my opinion is 79 hate 12 bored 5 liked it and 4 felt nothing but disappointment the canto bite scene i get bored out of my mind lukes death i would like it if 1 i knew how he died he didnt have a obvious cause at least none that was already established in canon 2 how his character was written if you think this movie is a masterpiece you are probably saying but it subverted expectations okay let me get this clear you think subverting expectations  amazing it doesnt also quick side note how come the bombers are so slow there were bombers in previous lore that are better yet obsolete however those bombers arent what i think is wrong with the dreadnought scene the fact the bombs didnt just float like things do in a vacuum of space now some people have said well gravity of the ships or magnets first the gravity defense and why it makes no sense 1 if the ships gravity thing worked the bombers would be pulling the bombs away from the dreadnought and back towards the bombers because of the distance 2   the bombs wouldnt even leave the ship due to them being an inch from the sides of the bomber so the gravity strength is stronger due to mass of objects and distance the second defense magnets this i believe was in a book but even then rian needed an outside source to fill in the gaps of his own movie as well as supporters to come up with reasons that havent been officially made unlike the graphic dictionary books that are canon that is bad story telling ps someone with a small script was telling hux something and one of the only lines that character had summed up the whole plot but then rian thinking subverting expectations  good started making things that made that simple plot unbelievably incoherent
Jan 6 2020,neutral,the force bond between kylo and rey is so interesting but rose is not poor kelly marie tran  its not her fault
Jan 6 2020,positive,while i definitely enjoyed the last jedi more on my second viewing a handful of truly awful moments overshadowed the rest of a beautiful cohesive plot hated when leia carrie fisher floated through the atmosphere just as much as the first time the telepathy shtick seemed to come out of nowhere and the lack of urgency between rose kelly marie tran and finn john boyega directly in front of enemy lines was painful a headscratching moment was how admiral holdo laura dern and leia spoke affectionately of poe oscar isaac who only moments earlier committed an ultimately unsuccessful mutiny onboard the ship lastly it wouldve made way more sense for kylo to order the 100000 laser barrage on luke skywalker after engaging him in handtohand combat however i still raised my ranking a solid 13 points because i appreciated the storyline as whole much more than on my first viewing the visual beauty throughout  the lightspeed suicide the showdown on crait  and the handful of final scenes which i think helped build anticipation for the rise of skywalker
Jan 6 2020,negative,the movie that may have ruined star wars forever  this movie plays out like a bad dream i was a big fan of rian johnsons looper but keep him as far away from the star wars franchise as possible
Jan 6 2020,positive,movie in sense of complexity is good and bit better then force awakensit is good  but its not typical star wars movieit destroys completly view on previous way characters were introduced and loved by fansit has agenda on putting many characters that brings nothing in the movieryan johnson seem to not listen to fans of movie frenchise at all rather picture story of company and not his ownits good movie for one time to see
Jan 6 2020,negative,absolute trash with no respect toward fans of sw
Jan 6 2020,negative,the worst star wars movie ive ever seen
Jan 6 2020,negative,an absolute travesty of a movie the film that destroyed the saga
Jan 6 2020,neutral,it disgraced the story of the loved character luke skywalker it was a horrible script luke deserved better
Jan 6 2020,positive,a bit of a chore to sit through a second time i thought i reviewed this already hmm maybe not anyways after laura dern its a boring snoozefest but it does actually pick up towards the end
Jan 6 2020,negative,the film subverted my expectations for a well thought out film that made sense in the star wars universe what we got was a confusing film that damaged the storyline of the films that preceded it and tarnished sagas legacy
Jan 6 2020,negative,like watching a dog take a shit no one wants to see that
Jan 5 2020,negative,the worst possible movie that could have ever been made for the star wars franchise practically unwatchable
Jan 5 2020,negative,disney continue to ruin a saga sw tlj ifs a joke its a movie full if jokes with no depth no real story no consistency in the  military actions we reach the ridiculous people die stupidly and try to save others stupidly its a horrible joke
Jan 5 2020,negative,terrible movie dont waste your time
Jan 5 2020,positive,tlj is one of the worst star wars film all parts of this movie felt forced and created to make the story ie luke attempting to kill ben solo when he was younger because he may be evil like redeemed darth vader who has killed many people and jedi no way luke attempts to kill kylo    the while side plot with rose and finn was a waste of time and did nothing for the story leia uses the force to save herself from space when shes never trained on screen before     snoke was killed very easily but with no direction how do you expect kylo to be supreme leader he can barely keep up with an untrained rey    the positives were the battle in the throne room and the battle between luke and kylo on the salt plains then we come to realize luke cowered on his planet and then dies waste of an actor and plot     overall this movie is not very good
Jan 5 2020,negative,the critics were on drugs when they reviewed this steaming pile of crap
Jan 5 2020,negative,this film is a horrendous insult to the star wars saga its rian johnsons attempt to obliterate what fans love about star wars so that he can try to impress movie critics
Jan 5 2020,negative,laughably bad every moment is a travesty to the art of story telling
Jan 5 2020,negative,it was worst than plan 9 from outer space
Jan 5 2020,positive,loved the movie with one exception the storyline of finn and rose had a weird and very long sequence which it didnt really need but i loved the bold choices johnson made for some characters
Jan 5 2020,positive,this was a good movie it was super fun and funny and epic there really isnt much more i look for from a star wars movie my only real critique is i wish theyd had more guts to actually kill characters
Jan 5 2020,negative,terrible movie an abomination to the legacy and disrespect to the fanbase the only bad star wars movie
Jan 5 2020,negative,the movie is the worst ever no backsroyes  no nothing  go watch the prequels they are better
Jan 5 2020,negative,the last jedi does exactly what the immediate predecessors do provide nothing but star wars nostalgia than everything else in a movie
Jan 5 2020,negative,absolute disgrace and disappointing a disgrace to star wars with some interesting ideas but no proper cohesion rose is awful the captain is awful ackbar deserved better the casino plot was a stupid waste of time and the main lead is a mary sue
Jan 5 2020,negative,i couldnt get into the movie from the very first scenes seeing general hux who supposedly is the leader of the first order act as a three years old took me out and i couldnt get back in for me star wars is first and foremost a cohesive universe and this movie just threw it out the window
Jan 5 2020,negative,the worst star wars ever made until the 9th come out poor writing and really bad storyline all the great and nasty mood of the saga are here killed by disney
Jan 5 2020,negative,the worst sw ever too long too boring way too many cute animals that will become merchandise even for a sw movie nothing really happens for two hours giant plot holes lasers going down because of gravity fuel restrictions leila comes back from space admiral ackbar dies and no one cares but hey the lightspeed jump that destroys the dreadnought is awesome btw why they didt destroy all death stars in that way why is it necessary to build a death star when you can light speed a cargo into a planet
Jan 4 2020,positive,i have always been a fan of last jedi but as i watch it again it continues to amaze me if you want a star wars film that is just battles and fire fights then maybe this isnt for you but if you really want to dive into star wars and ask yourself bigger questions then yes it is questions on the makings of a hero redemption the cost of war how the actions of the jedi and skywalkers affect the rest of the galaxy we learn that the star wars galaxy is so much larger than we once thought that even jedi have moments of lapsed judgement that those lapses have consequences and that a true hero although the moral journey is bumpy always does the right thing last jedi is the story of failure we all have experienced it and to think these characters have not is be blind to the worlds truths ignore the internet trolls and see this film then think of how far star wars can expand now that its been made
Jan 4 2020,negative,the script the characters and everything
Jan 4 2020,negative,really bad writing and pretty cgi thats the movie folks
Jan 4 2020,negative,it ruined star wars nothing in the movie felt right editing sound design and cinematography were decent though
Jan 4 2020,negative,good production but an unprofessionally visionless story with poor quality jokes writers of this movie had no idea about star wars unless it was their intent to make millions of people quit this franchise
Jan 4 2020,negative,i just watched for the second time this one didnt aged very well the plot is ambicious but badly executed lots of plot holes
Jan 4 2020,negative,absolute garbage movie keep rian far away from star wars watch robot head on youtube he can explain why this movie sucks tldr
Jan 4 2020,negative,two words leila poppins
Jan 4 2020,positive,this is by far the best disney star wars movie even after seeing the rise of skywalker all the fans complaining that tlj is hypocritical or surprising for surprisings sake simply cannot handle the truth that their fictional fan theories were proven wrong tlj is a wonder of storytelling that happens to be based on star wars of course some parts of the movie like the canto byte sequence have no purpose and ruin the pacing but on whole the movie is quite recommendable
Jan 4 2020,positive,i love this movie it is the most original since empire
Jan 4 2020,negative,it gets suffocated in its own plot which feels like one giant improvisation after another resulting in a pointless movie and even more pointless compared to the other sequel movies without a doubt the black sheep from the star wars herd
Jan 4 2020,negative,so many things that just didnt need to happend this movie could have so much better bt its just choices that direction that they went with
Jan 4 2020,negative,by far the worst star wars content ever released including the holiday special
Jan 4 2020,positive,awesome film  easily top two in the sw saga after empire really digs into some philosophy around the jedi that the clone wars and prequels dealt with who is right in war which is the right side and who is profiting when is the right time to step aside or step into the fray    also some of the best fight and light saber battles in the saga    ignore the breathless ranting of angry boys who drag their identity politics into the fandom stinking everything up and i thought tauntauns smelled bad 
Jan 4 2020,neutral,rian johnsons disregard for established lore and character development brings the movie and unfortunately the whole sequel trilogy to a stand still apart from impressive visuals and action scenes this movie this movie offers nothing to the star wars canon
Jan 4 2020,negative,the failure of rian johnsons the last jedi was almost as appalling as seeing the audiencecritic divide in scores and makes me wonder if it isnt entirely politically driven
Jan 4 2020,positive,people always assume that the original movies in any series will be the best but not in this case star wars the last jedi is definitely one of my favourites the acting is outstanding and the story gives me chills because its so amazing absolutely loved this movie
Jan 4 2020,negative,very sad when the critics go for something so unrefinedchoppy and filled with useless extras with horrible sappy lines  needs focus and less glam more heart
Jan 4 2020,negative,this trash doesnt even deserve half a star the worst star wars film yet a d rose is worse than jar jar binks
Jan 4 2020,neutral,full of plotholes and contradictions from previous stories this is starwars written by and for non starwars fans
Jan 4 2020,negative,its a total disgrace truly bad ew
Jan 4 2020,negative,literally just killed a bunch of people and had no effect on the storyline besides disrespecting lukes character
Jan 4 2020,negative,nothing but disappointment with no character development while adding more characters to not develop
Jan 4 2020,positive,the side plots muddled the momentum and leahs superman was ridiculous
Jan 3 2020,negative,wrost star wars ever made
Jan 3 2020,negative,this entire trilogy is nothing more than a money grab by disney     incoherent mess with no flow
Jan 3 2020,negative,luke skywalker is the definition of a new hope he shouldnt be a hermit on an island and he should also see the good in kyle ren at the end they try to make poe seem like a stupid man after trying to save the entire resistance because he didnt know about a secret plan that nobody would tell him finn was about to save everybody and rose stops him unknowing that luke and rey would clean up after her also finn got completely ignored plot goes nowhere the movie starts with them running from the first order and it ends with them running from the first order except this time with like 10 people left in the resistance but they still see it as a victory and a happy ending
Jan 3 2020,negative,worst movie i ever watched in my whole life just one long piece of shit ot worth it to watch at all
Jan 3 2020,negative,this film was the most disappointing film of all time the first film of the new trilogy was a remake the first films and i enjoyed it it was not to be taken too seriously and set up the rest of the series this director then proceeds to do what luke skywalker does with the lightsabre he was handed and throws it away he then seems to stick two fingers up at the core audience of those who were kids when the first trilogy came out or even kids when the second came out and instead of us finally getting to see luke skywalker jedi master we get this grumpy old caricature of god knows who the whole film is just wrong i wont spoil what happens but the franchise ended there and then for me this was a director who did not know his audience and made a film for others but they arent the ones who want to see this rubbish and they wont be back for the next one
Jan 3 2020,positive,i like this movie  its a good action movie but its a poor star wars movie  i rank it as 8 out of the 11 movies  not horrible but does nothing to advance the world
Jan 3 2020,negative,an awe full film using cheap jokes to get people to laugh whilst they waste 2 hours of their life
Jan 3 2020,negative,bad dont buy it wasnt good
Jan 3 2020,positive,the most innovative star wars movie ive ever seen this film has things to say and although it has many flaws its still fun to watch
Jan 3 2020,positive,this is my favorite star wars movie by far i really loved the story it was very surprising and thrilling
Jan 3 2020,positive,despite having some flaws within the story the last jedi succeeds to show a new direction for the franchise with director rian johnson interrogating the values and virtues that made the original trilogy a classic this may be the most controversial star wars movie out there but also the most needed for future movies
Jan 3 2020,positive,rewatched 122919    kyle ren is the millennial bad guy ever
Jan 2 2020,positive,its amazing i love this movie and no one can tell me otherwise i can see some of the mistakes made and why people complain but it still is so awesome and has some of the best scenes in all the saga dont listen to the negative reviews
Jan 2 2020,negative,after seeing rise of skywalker it was even more obvious how absolutely terrible the last jedi was   the last jedi was terrible because it didnt draw you into the story so the horrible plot holes and science mistakes were just sooooo blatant and painful   gravity bombs phone pranks etc in just the first few minutes set the bad tone and it only got worse  you can just skip this one in the series  episode 7 feeds into episode 9 just fine and you just ignore episode 8 completely
Jan 2 2020,negative,this movie is a travesty because rian johnson was so tickled by his own perception of his selfperceived cleverness and drive to subvert expectations for no reason other than just to do it that he forgot that he was creating the 8th movie in a 40 year old saga rather than doing his own oneoff movie    johnson begins the movie by unnecessarily breaking a key component of the star wars universe that unless theres a tracking beacon jumping to lightspeed cannot be tracked for no other reason than to drive a boring and stupid plot his grand idea lets have a slow motion space chase that lasts for almost the entire movie that will be fun for people to watch    the way to turn off this new technology must be procured from a useless side quest with rose and finn which ultimately could and should be excised from the movie without impacting the rest of the story line    johnsons introduced rose tico to give finn some one to go on this side quest with while i think kelly marie tran does fine in terms of acting the material she was given  the material is the problem theres no real reason to add this character    likewise and twice as egregious is admiral holdo playing a part that should have been carried out by admiral ackbar but wasnt for reasons holdos character refuses to share vital information the entire run of the movie just to serve plot points rather than for any discernable motivation for her character her final again starwarsworldbreakingfornopurposeotherthanacoolshot manuveur only serves as a capstone to rians laziness and lack of storytelling finesse    as for luke skywalker rian johnsons luke skywalker is not luke skywalker when mark hamill says to you i disagree with every decision youve made for this character and youre too filled with hubris to take a step back and question whether youre on the right track nothing good will follow without getting in to spoilers on the outside chance anyone is reading this without having seen the movie johnson ignores the entire thread of character development in the original trilogy and disregards the core driving force of lukes belief system  that anyone even his worldkilling childslaughtering wifemurdering father can be brought back to the light  in service of his lame plot    so in summary we have a worldbreaking and simultaneously boring main plot a new character who only exists to keep the plot on the nonsensical tracks rian set out a side plot that advances nothing for the story and a total disregard for arguably the most beloved character in the franchise  all leading up to a lazy repeat of the hoth battle that makes even less sense    i have never left a star wars movie so angry as i left this one and rank it as worse than all others prequels included youre better off reading the synopsis and skipping over this one to go straight to the course correction that is the rise of skywalker
Jan 2 2020,negative,missed opportunity with this one the casino planet plotline alone makes this one a film i do not want to rewatch
Jan 2 2020,negative,a complete garbage professional critics stink
Jan 2 2020,positive,best of the disney star wars movies by far
Jan 2 2020,negative,worst star wars anything ever made  this makes the prequels look fantastic by comparison  prior to this movie i saw every single star wars movie in the theater at least twice  after this movie i havent seen a single star wars movie in a theater  i was going to go see rise of skywalker but rewatched all movies in timeline order before it came out and rewatching last jedi killed my enthuasm again  rian johnson should never have been allowed to make this disaster of a movie and better never be allowed near any star wars produciton in the future
Jan 2 2020,positive,incredible way to delve into the characters of the saga and see beyond the light and the dark into a gray area strong story risks taken but each one pays off this story combined with the other cinematic components keep you invested throughout a new theme for an old franchise
Jan 2 2020,positive,not perfect but johnson takes the reigns on the second entry of the new star wars trilogy and fulfills so much his story is the most clear and original and every character gets great arcs    most importantly this entry into the franchise has some of the best fight scenes ever to grace the screens in the star wars cinematic universe it gives fans everything a star wars movie should have including new planets new and interesting characters and delightful direction     despite what others may say about this film it is simply the best star wars movie since the empire strikes back and thats period
Jan 2 2020,negative,actually the worst star wars film unbelievable in the universe of star wars things happening left and right characters changing their entire moral compass shallow use of new characters while shoehorning others just to ruin basic fundamentals of star wars itself bombers moving slowly to drop bombs in space unshielded ships making villains into a joke hux having luke drink blue milk and toss is lightsaber and have such unbelievable personality changes   to put it simply the reason the new trilogy hasnt done so well  the last jedi
Jan 2 2020,negative,social justice wars this has becomenow matters are worse  master yoda
Jan 2 2020,negative,the last jedi tries too hard to be a top tier and unique film and is painfully obvious for a middle act of a trilogy it damn well almost goes nowhere
Jan 2 2020,negative,the way they treated luke skywalker was disgusting
Jan 1 2020,negative,what rian johnson did was essentially take everything that fans loved about the star wars universe and spit on it the story made no sense at all and appeared to serve the sole purpose of pushing a social message in interviews more than once rian johnson showed he didnt care about star wars or its fans and wanted to do his own thing this is the result the cinematography music and acting was solid but sadly the writing and direction produced one of the greatest insults to a legendary franchise to ever disgrace the screen there are multiple twists that are supposed to subvert expectations but they are so poorly written and blatantly obvious that they mostly just insult the viewer
Jan 1 2020,positive,rian johnson certainly did this series a favour along with everyone else in this movie
Jan 1 2020,positive,i thought it was awesome i would watch it again great acting great special affects and great director you cant go wrong with jj abrams directing the cgi was great if its going to look fake dont use it but they did great here
Jan 1 2020,positive,minus all the canto bight sequences this to me would have been 5 stars people are mainly upset with the arc of luke skywalker that is the divisive tissue of this film rian johnson made a phenomenal star wars film in my opinion and took it in a bold new direction i wish he would have stayed on to write and direct episode 9
Jan 1 2020,negative,this movie was terrible nothing in it feels like it matters and it doesnt make me care about any of the new characters finn is the only character that could have been good and they wasted all potential with him all the characters from the original trilogy dont fit up with how their characters should act whatsoever terrible movie
Jan 1 2020,neutral,doesnt deserve the amount of hate that it gets i respect the idea of trying to take the franchise in a new direction but it just didnt work for me some of the character treatment felt out of place overall as a star wars movie its disappointing but as a film its decent
Jan 1 2020,positive,episode 8 is better than episode 9
Jan 1 2020,positive,a very good movie with good special effects a good sound and a very interesting story that shows that it tries to continue the new trilogy 
Jan 1 2020,negative,luke tries to kill ben admiral akbar killed off screen meandering scenes that go on way to long rian johnson destroyed luke skywalkers character the worst star wars movie by far 
Jan 1 2020,negative,amazing visuals terrible story
Jan 1 2020,negative,rian johnson and kathleen kennedy did their best to kill star wars with this installment from cranky murderous luke to leias mary poppins impression in space to hyperspeed as a weapon not to mention the travesty of the wasted half hour on the casino planet to start the film if you are a true star wars fan then you will or at least should hate this movie this is the first time ive been heartbroken by a movie but man rian did his best to ruin a big part of my childhood if they ever let rian johnson near another star wars film i will revolt haha do yourself a favor and pretend this movie doesnt exist
Jan 1 2020,negative,messy stupid plot boring characters cringy moments
Dec 31 2019,positive,good stuff luke is good including his jokes lukes perfect jedilike duel with kylo yodas cameo kylo and rey vs the guards is great    bad stuff the casino planet too many jokes snokes random death rey is too powerful poe is just an ahole hot head that learns nothing leias force crap scene rose sucks theres no politics and no first order backstory
Dec 31 2019,negative,this movie is horrible if youre a star wars fan filled with moments that rival the introduction of midichlorians all space combat rendered pointless due to the ability to weaponize light speed luke attempting to kill his nephew because he showed some dark side in him he believed he could turn his mass murderer father from the dark side but cant help his sisters son who has done nothing wrong canto bight was the lowest point in all of star wars how this story was thought to be a good idea is beyond me the plot is a car chase in space at the speed of the steamroller moment in austin powers as a star wars fan all my life i couldnt find any moments in this film that were at least interesting to watch the prequels were terrible but we got incredible moments in them such as pod racing light saber fights space combat etc etc there are no moments in this film that were even fan service
Dec 31 2019,negative,really just not a star wars movie
Dec 31 2019,negative,arguably one of the worst star wars movies ever made the acting is mediocre except for adam drivers and the ot cast the script is atrocious and the scenes with rose and finn are easily the worst
Dec 31 2019,positive,a better movie than any of the other star wars movies and this review is being written after seeing episode ix the only star wars movie that solidly expresses its theme as a sequel it succeeds by expanding on the world and intentionally rejecting the same old tropes regurgitated by the previous movies especially episode vii the only reason it isnt getting 5 stars from me is because of the opening bomber scene which doesnt make any sense at all
Dec 31 2019,negative,the best word to describe the movie is spacetrash
Dec 31 2019,positive,amazing i love this film 3
Dec 31 2019,neutral,lot of dumb humor a lot of changes to the star wars universe and what we thought jedis and force is capable of dissatisfying sequel to force awakens
Dec 31 2019,positive,so many weird choices stopped this from being a great movie i thought the luke disillusionment the grey force and whatnot all couldve been interesting but nothing is developed properly or committed to as we see after episode 9 the lack of lasting conflict here made the trilogy it wouldve been new and interesting had ray joined kylo or if finn actually did sacrifice himself to save his new friends but all drama is hinted at then backed away from also the humour felt very cringe and marvel and i held expected finn or poe to look at the camera with a goofie smile after a zinger
Dec 31 2019,negative,not good  as a stand alone movie with no established lore or rules it may be okay  but thats not the case here  there are established star wars lore and rules  this movie sought to break and undo all of them seemingly wanting to toss aside 7 previous films over 40 years to do its own thing  again perhaps fine as a standalone but not as a numbered sequel  sorry  i saw this opening night at the theater and was so disappointed  because of this movie i will not be seeing the rise of skywalker in the theater the first time in the history of star wars i havent gone to the theater to see one  saw ep iv in 1977 in the theater and every one since
Dec 31 2019,negative,by far the worst one the way they portrayed luke in this really hurt
Dec 31 2019,negative,chocking us with idiology not becsuse someone took risk its equals to good
Dec 31 2019,negative,basically space balls 2 rightfully making fun of the previous movie ep 7 the way it destroys everything that the previous film has established warms my heart as there was nothing to be sad about technically it does to ep 7 exactly what ep 7 did to sw franchise but as a movie its as much a failure as its predecessor on every level
Dec 31 2019,negative,probably my least favorite star wars movie as the middle part of the trilogy i was disappointed that many of the aspects i was excited to see more of knights of ren snoke luke were completely ignored or worse driver steals the show completely this episode sadly my favorite characters from episode 7 poe and finn were also butchered the insane power creep in the star wars universe is also on full display
Dec 31 2019,neutral,the plot of this movie really messed up so hard that it cause many people not to like it the characters of this movie were also ruined only good thing about this movie are the visual effects and the musics
Dec 31 2019,positive,having now watched rise of skywalker i like this movie less between this movie and that one you will probably only like one or the other this movie is a little slower and is more characterfocused while rise of skywalker is faster and actionoriented this one plays like a disney movie or a romance where theres a moral and a happy ending while rise of skywalker is more actionadventure and i guess more open to interpretation try not to let political drama sway your opinion on either theyre both very good but its weird that theyre in the same saga while being written for people who have decided that theyre so different  the first one was great though pretty much everybody agrees on that
Dec 31 2019,negative,2 years later and it still doesnt get better with time rian johnson failed at star wars
Dec 31 2019,positive, decent but not up to the standard of the best star wars episodes daisy ridley does an excellent job and adam driver matches but the rest of the cast is just ok plot resolves the saga in a satisfactory manner but overall the storyline seemed contrived and disneyfied as was the last episode not sure whats next for rey
Dec 31 2019,negative,the good the actors were great as per usual the score was terrific and the movie ended thankfully   the bad the plot was subpar too many characters were poorly written no development for anybodys story expectations were definitely subverted and not in a good way
Dec 31 2019,negative,i hope i could give zero this movie is garbage do yourself a favour and avoid it at all cost
Dec 31 2019,positive,100100 the best movie of all timeby a country mile
Dec 31 2019,negative,rey luke and kylo are amazing and drives the plot forward while everything else is completely tasteless 34 of the movie is basically the first order fleet chasing the resistence fleet in space in the slowest pace ever nothing on canto bight sequence makes sense finn and rose go looking for some guy then ends up freeing animals holdo doesnt tell poe the plan for no reason only to cause further internal conflict hyperspace into enemy ships is now a thing finn could have sacrificed himself to save his friends yet rose had to save him oh and luke dies on a rock great progressive ideas great visuals great character development in terms of our force sensitive heroes i even love the yoda sequence and controversial general leia part other than that no one does anything cool
Dec 31 2019,positive,this movie is not a scifi action adventure it is a series of mediations on lose and male weakness very beautifully made and interesting i dont mind at all the subversion though it got a little old after the 5th time captures the dark feel of tesb a great achievement
Dec 31 2019,positive,one of the best film of the saga  masterful writing with suprising twists innovative film within the saga as esb 5 was johnson is a master
Dec 31 2019,negative,there was so much wrong with the space battles and just the timing of events in the movie  just silliness  running out of gas and hyperspace attack  these were never things before  just awful
Dec 31 2019,positive,love it so much such beautiful visuals story arcs such an original story that sticks to the timeline and pacing is beautiful
Dec 31 2019,negative,in a brush or individualism andor progressive intention rian johnson either blatanly disregards or proceeds in utter ignorance of the wealth and consistency of star wars film that precede him an entertaining film if it exists in a vacuum a tragedy of disrespect and missed opportunity as a piece of the star wars continuum
Dec 30 2019,negative,this movie is nothing more than a money grab  character assassination of luke skywalker trying to clear away the old actors so disney can make new films luke skywalker the man who could see good in darth vader would not try to assassinate his student
Dec 30 2019,negative,so uncomfortable and completely against what the saga is all about
Dec 30 2019,positive,reys story in this movie was exceptional finns story was pointless but all in all id say this movie might be better than the force awakens not sure theyre about the same in love neither is amazing but the last jedi has some luke so theres that
Dec 30 2019,negative,do i even need to write anything
Dec 30 2019,negative,this movie did not do anything for me at first when i left the theater 2 years ago i did not know what to think i thought the graphics was good then i watched it again watched youtube videos about how bad this movie was and it all made sense why this movie is one of the worst pile of shit i have ever seen in my entire life i would rather watch the room on repeat for 3 days before i watch this movie ever again if i watch the sequel trilogy again which probably wont happen cause f this trilogy i want to know how any one enjoyed this movie and what the critics were thinking giving this movie better then a 90 when this movie started i knew i was in for a long run when luke through the lightsaber was so dumb it pains me ever seeing it again also how he wanted to kill kylo ren even before he did anything bad was some of the worst crap i have ever seen do not get me started on the stupid sub plot about rose and finn rose is one of the worst characters ever created also how she saves finn at the end she should have died it would have redeemed her character a little bit also how leia flew in space was dumb as well nothing in this movie is worth watching again the graphics were the only good thing which they should be as they spent so much money on these films i dont give half 1 or zero so i give it my lowest score a 1 and it is rotten to the core and you should never see this star wars movie once
Dec 30 2019,positive,one of the best in the series takes it in new directions while still fitting in which is the right thing to do if youre going to make more of an old beloved series instead of just trying to copy the originals
Dec 30 2019,negative,what a mess of a movie so incoherent that there are more plot holes than actual plot should have been called burial of star wars disney really need a unified show runner to manage the whole universe
Dec 30 2019,positive,an original vision that almost tells a perfect story of failure teachers and redemption
Dec 30 2019,negative,this movie trashed the skywalker saga and set up the following for failure
Dec 30 2019,negative,not only the worst star wars film but one of the worst films i have ever seen  i am finished with disney star wars
Dec 30 2019,positive,ignore the haters johnson tried to give sw a much needed injection of fresh blood whilst also drawing in elements of the sadly sidelined legends aspect of the extended universe whilst there are flaws with the film the canto bight subplot couldve been cut wayyyy down without hurting del toros role the tepid coursecorrecting fanfearing rise of skywalker shows just how dull it can be to cling so closely to past episodes tlj justly takes its place alongside empire and rogue one as series highlights
Dec 30 2019,positive,amazing this is the best film of the whole three
Dec 30 2019,negative,very poor story that deviates from the central plotlines of star wars a waste of a movie in series
Dec 30 2019,positive,i thought it was a really good movie
Dec 30 2019,negative,the worst movie of the saga what the f ryan
Dec 30 2019,negative,trash horrible writing and characters evidently a goal was to ruin the character of luke skywalker shameful pos
Dec 30 2019,positive,one of the most original and refreshing plots in recent star wars history and a well executed film by rian johnson it was amazing throughout except for a few places and the plot twist was too good definitely deserves a watch
Dec 30 2019,positive,probably the best out of the new trilogy if only disney had let rian johnson direct episode ix we may have gotten something better than the train wreck that jj abrams directed with the rise of skywalker a film i plan to never watch again and will hopefully forget even exist
Dec 30 2019,neutral,unfortunately despite the strong acting of the lead stars as well as the supporting cast the poor storytelling and lack of vison makes this the worst entry in the sequel trilogy rian johnson wanted to subvert and throw expectations and fan theories but he also threw a new track in plot with having snoke killed and having rey written as a nobody may we never see johnsons involvement in the star wars franchise ever again
Dec 30 2019,negative,if you have seen it  no comment needed
Dec 30 2019,negative,terrible pile of bad movie why would you do this to people trying to have a good time
Dec 30 2019,negative,unless you want to be angered by stupid choices that make half of the problems seem pointless then dont watch it
Dec 30 2019,negative,i found this movie unwatchable boring and bogged down in a lot of stuff no one really cared about   i tried watching again at home and couldnt keep watching long time star wars fan
Dec 30 2019,negative,i wish i never saw this abomination watch it at your own risk everything you hold dear from the old trilogy is pissed on it takes a great deal of effort to ruin an awesome franchise like star wars but rian johnson did i hope you realize you created the worst imaginable rendition of a star wars film imaginable thanks for ruining childhood memories and luke skywalkers characteter who who wanted to see him milk a space alien instead of using his force and saber skills please find me that person oh wait thats ryan johnson you should be ashamed of yourself 
Dec 30 2019,negative,really a slow speed chase  that is what i paid money to see i dont think so terrible side story with canto casino it had no bearing on the plot and didnt grow the characters involved destroyed the luke character the one who saw good in darth vader by having him turn his back on everything  finn rey and poe should have had some character building together but i guess rian johnson just wanted to tear down the characters we loved let the past die nope without the past we have no present and definitely no future the only good scenes are visually the throne room fight and holdos kamikaze plan  just dont watch this if you love star wars it is definitely the worst thought out plot and is hostile towards existing fans without attracting new fans
Dec 30 2019,negative,this movie ruined luke skywalker luke was the one who had hope he was the new hope he didnt give up to turn darth vader his father to the light side and at the end he did but he totally gives up on ben and her just goes to the dark side bad mistake
Dec 30 2019,negative,star wars holiday special  the last jedi
Dec 30 2019,positive,loved it excellent movie 
Dec 30 2019,negative,storyline was horrible visually nice but terrible writing
Dec 30 2019,negative,not a star wars movie completely ruined the trilogy could be completely cut out of the trilogy and it would be better for it being contrarian does not a good star wars movie make rose was the clingiest most annoying and useless character of all time they killed admiral ackbar off screenthats a sin ill never forgive rian for this complete disrespect and desecration of my most beloved series since childhood stick to comedic mystery thrillers my guy
Dec 30 2019,negative,it never ceases to amaze me how critics will praise terrible movies if they exist within franchises they are fond of the biggest problem here is that last jedi is just plain boring it isnt just a bad star wars movie its an incomprehensible piece of junk we jump from one boring story thread to another and are expected to believe its all unfolding in a fraction of the time that it would reasonably take to do this stuff do yourself a favour and go to wikkipedia to read the plot details at least youll save yourself 2 hours
Dec 30 2019,negative,come on dudes luke skywalker is a hero he is the hope of the galaxy not a grumpy old man the whole casino stuff was dumb princess  general leia is awesome but not a floating statue weird and a trilogy doesnt mean three unrelated stories with the same characters no build poe is cool rose is corny
Dec 29 2019,negative,this was the first star wars movie that i was extremely frustrated with since the prequels the prequels had jar jar and little ani the last jedi has equally irritating characters with admiral holdo and rose tico and benicio del toros character his constant lip smacking is like nails scraping a chalkboard jar jar and ani were just annoying but the cumulative function of these three in the narrative is to make finn and poe look like idiots why take characters that we have just come to know and like from the force awakens and then turn them into fools many of the characters make very frustrating choices for reasons that dont add up gen leia is supposed to be a revolutionary who never lost her fiery passion to fight the empire but in this shes depicted as very cautious and more determined to maintain order than fighting the new order aggressively tlj changes lukes character but in a way that made more sense given all that is supposed to have gone wrong for him after the fall of the empire even so for this to work we need to see a lot more of lukes failure to train ben solo in flashback that should have been the first third of the movie both plots of the mutiny and the scheme to get a hacker from the casino world should have been cut out entirely this movie was an opportunity wasted and it left nowhere to go for the final film in the trilogy the conclusion of tlj is a narrative dead end and that is a fatal blow for a trilogy rian johnson should have been put in charge of a standalone star wars story like solo he couldnt have done any worse
Dec 29 2019,negative,not a bad movie but not a good star wars move and a terrible ep8 considering it was supposed to lead to a solid conclusion but bought more questions than answers
Dec 29 2019,negative,i dont get the critics opinion of how great the film is it is pretty bad the biggest flaw in my opinion is that they broke the concept of hyperspace by doing this kamikaze thing visually the film was okay
Dec 29 2019,positive,this is easily the best of the new trilogy and only entry id label an actual film where the others feel like extended commercialfree tv this is an intriguing chapter that wasnt given much to build upon but shows a much more professional grasp of dialogue character arcs and editing than the two films which bookend it
Dec 29 2019,negative,visually stunning rj should stay a dp or 1st ad leave the writing to others aside from the bad character choices and being completely tone deaf at its core its just bad storytelling there were a few cool moments but i wish jj did this one too at least it would have been his complete story this is the worst of the skywalker saga movies i pray lucasfilm never lets rian johnson touch anything else in the universe
Dec 29 2019,negative,the worst piece of star wars media to ever exist i guess it did subvert my expectations because i expected something good
Dec 29 2019,negative,no fans will not love it looks at the score here
Dec 29 2019,negative,it was pretty terrible
Dec 29 2019,positive,in hindsight this was a great movie 
Dec 29 2019,negative,i got an idea lets write a story about one big ass ship slowly out running another big ass ship and call it star wars nice job      worst star wars movie ever
Dec 29 2019,negative,unwatchable cringeworthy utterly useless
Dec 29 2019,negative,the movie was just a really bad star wars movie with really boring storylines and undeveloped characters that i didnt feel invested in at all
Dec 29 2019,positive,a fresh original take on star wars thats filled with heart and takes the characters of the force awakens to new places challenging the actors and the audience to react to what they think they know  not being true
Dec 29 2019,positive,those who gave poor ratings on this site for the last jedi should give this one another chance  i didnt see this movie until after i saw the hot mess dumpster fire that is rise of skywalker  however this movie far surpassed my expectations that were based on the reviews on this site  the last jedi is by far the best movie in the new star wars trilogy  yes it had some ridiculous scenes like leia flying through space and ren killing off snoke yet again saving rey who is always trying to kill him  but there was also a plot to follow and story the viewer could believe in  it was very easy to get on the good side and root for luke to cast away his grumpiness and use his powers to help the rebellion  it had feeling and some nostalgia  there was a darkness to it that really captures the hopelessness of the fight and when you feel all is lost there is luke using his powers to give our new heros a chance to escape and regroup  it also has rey playing a minor role in the movie which definitely helps  its always great when the absolute worst star wars character in the franchise isnt around too much to ruin a solid story  unlike to episode vii and ix this one feels like a star wars movie  and despite its flaws its good and worth multiple future viewings
Dec 29 2019,negative,contrary to what many critics said the last jedi is not only a bad star wars its a bad movie for the bad star wars part rian jonhson abandoned almost all the avenues proposed by jj abrams in the force awakens and spit on star wars fandom without any purpose also he didnt seem to know what to do with both new and original characters and forced in new characters for whom he created no attachment at all although some critics praised the boldness of the film i was astonished to see that he literally copied scenes from empire and return of the jedi which made me laugh at the theater for de bad movie part the film feels more like  a miniseries in which the plot is either implausible or useless perhaps johnson could have made a decent star wars standalone movie but it seems to me that he was clueless for taking part in a trilogy that again j j abrams had to rise from ashes as best as he could the star and a half goes for some good action sequences a few surprises great special effects as usual and music as usual
Dec 29 2019,negative,i have nothing to say besides good luck to the next director to fix this screw up of a movie
Dec 29 2019,negative,i will never watch a rian johnson movie ever again this movie is pure disrespect to the star wars franchise
Dec 29 2019,negative,the last jedi doesnt deserve to be part of the star wars franchise it shouldnt even be a movie the entire movie is full of unnecessary action that doesnt make sense plot holes that need illogical outside help and stupid characters that have literally no positive constructive development at all im pretty sure if you just figured out that the resistance gets annihilated and that theres a stupid new character named rose who seems to care more about finn than what her sister gave her life fighting for get to that later youd be all set to watch the third movie the tone despite the destruction of all of the resources that the resistance had and the deaths of nearly everyone is exactly the same sure they blew up the dreadnought and snoke is dead but snoke wasnt going to live long anyway and we never even heard of a dreadnought before the last jedi this is just an awful attempt to milk out millions of dollars out of an amazing saga and when i say milking i mean it luke literally milks a space cow in this movie adding to the long list of crazy things i saw in this movie  and then rian johnson decides that anyone who doesnt like this garbage movie is sexist what okay before people start attacking me by saying theres a ton of people who liked it i have to point out that only 46 actually did and then people point to the money this film made i dont think you can point to that the 54 who didnt like the film still had to pay right or is there some new thing where i get refunds if i dont like it even mark hamill didnt like it  the beginning of the movie begins with the resistance trying to escape the evil first order who has somehow found the location of their secret base i dont understand the whole first order vs resistance thing the entire thing makes zero sense whatsoever  if the quote on quote good guys are in charge for a change how does this rehash of the empire come back if this happens every single time the good guys are in control why are they even in control why not let the bad guys be in charge for once all of a sudden theres these bad guys and theres also child abuse slavery child labor and cruelty of animals under the good guys control so why dont we try letting the first order be in charge but anyway then theres some your mom jokes which by the way makes zero sense to me because in the expanded universe hux doesnt have a mother i dont want to spoil some star wars rebels eu but that joke was a sad attempt to be marvel the entire movie is full of attempts to be marvel even in scenes that should be serious like the time luke chucks the lightsaber off a cliff jj abrams built up this amazing cliffhanger that i thought was sure to make a good second movie rian johnson decided to just make the entire movie full of bad jokes that ruin the movie and make longtime fans like me by the way ive been a fan since i saw the first film force awakens was the first film id ever fully seen in a theater and i loved it cringe but i went a little too off topic then after a ton of explosions they send in some bombers to destroy the dreadnought these bombers are literally bwings that look like they cant fly but then that pilot of that i think resistance awing made a bad decision and said bombers keep that tight formation next thing you know half of a nonfunctioning tiefighter takes out 3 of them because of that stupid decision to keep them tight together but okay thats not the stupidest character choice we see in this movie ill get to this one later in fact its far from it because right after the destruction of the dreadnought scene luke tosses what should be one of his most sacred items off a cliff  okay more in depth about that scene disney flat out does not understand luke this is portrayed in the first two minutes of the film where they show him as a crabby old man who thinks the jedi should die i know mark hamill you tried to warn us but none of us listened the luke skywalker that we know and love had hope and even though his father was the most evil person in the galaxy he tried to save him now he lost one person and hes some crabby hopeless old man thats not what luke should be like luke should be trying to save kylo ren rather than just wasting away on an island the idea that luke would do something like this is completely crazy lukes character is just plain misunderstood by rian johnson same guy who called everyone manbabies luke should be working for the resistance or struggling through his failures not sitting on an island sobbing about his life story btw does anyone else realize how weird it is that rey is able to fluently speak wookie with no lessons that adds to the long list of things she can do without any training challenge or struggle in the film and before you call me sexist im not against the idea shes female im against the idea shes a perfect mary sue disney has consistently advertised this movie as having a strong female character not even mentioning the 50 million others that came before it but technically rey isnt a strong female character nothing she ever tries is ever hard and so she never struggles through anything so technically she isnt strong because everything is just handed to her  the scene then switches back to finn who wakes up wearing a bacta suit and runs around the ship it is possibly one of the weirdest things ive ever seen in a movie ever and then he runs over to poe and they do another imitation of marvel okay so really quickly they need to stop trying to be marvel in marvel we already know that the idea of two guys in costumes is already really unrealistic so either they can try a semiserious film or they can just be make a ton of bad jokes but in star wars we want to feel like its real not like its stupid so their attempts to be marvel are not needed nor necessary anyway he asks where rey is and poe tells him i forget this movie is too forgetable anyway anyway after that we see that all of a sudden you can be tracked through hyperspace and pretty much all of the first order arrives the first order launches some tiefighters but not all of them which makes no sense at all and then they blow up the bridge leia was on it which means she dies right but no now with no training whatsoever she can fly that made me scratch my head in wonder at how badly rian johnson was going to trash this movie but dont worry it gets worse  so skipping ahead rose finn and bb8 go to find the master codebreaker nobody else could supposedly break the empires secret code except some wierdo is capable of doing the exact same thing that made little sense to me at all they infiltrate the ship but somehow the first order knew they were coming maybe shouldnt have trusted the weirdo finn next rey heads to snokes throne room some stuff happens and then we arrive on holdo one of the worst characters ever in my opinion she is current commander since leias in a coma and makes a bafflingly idiotic decision to have a secret plan she didnt tell anyone about even when poe threatens mutiny her reaction is not much i can do about that guess your in charge now no all she had to do was say lets sit down and talk about my secret plan i mean how hard was that what is the moral blindly follow orders of course then we get to the praetorian guard fight scene which is one of the worst fight scenes ever just look it up and watch it again in slow motion   then holdo makes that jump to lightspeed sure it was a cool scene and all but rian johnson shouldnt have done this now if there is ever an epic space battle all the resistance has to do to win is to launch a onemannedfighter at the opponent and then we will just start launching missiles with hyperspace at one another it ruins space battles it ruins the movies it ruins star wars  finally we get to rehashjustwithsalthothalsoknownascrait the action all leads up to this but it just happens to be one of the worst scenes in the movie first to start this scene up the resistance literally copies the rebels with the binoculars the atats the snowspeeders the people filling the trenches all straight out of empire real creative rian then kylo ren and the first order have this battering ram thingy that will blow up the blastdoor and in my seat i was thinking to myself okay aside from the fact that they are literally copying empire strikes back this has some potential to be a great action sequence no to make a long story short it did but rian johnson goofed up and didnt include any of it first off you have the completely awful decision by leia to put all those soldiers out in front of the blast doors to shoot down the tiefighters what are they going to do out there nothing it would make sense to put them all behind the possibletobebreached blast door and snipe of the snowtroopers when they walk through the door then kylo ren goes ahead and says the entire resistance is behind that door no theyre all out in those trenches oh he means leia give yourself up woman next you have the falcon scene with rey aarrgh that scene makes me so angry first off they try to get rey to do an impersonation of han and luke when they shoot down those tie fighters in a new hope not even going to mention how unusual it is that rey can shoot down three at once without any training but in new hope they have just escaped with their lives in last jedi reys killing people and watching other people she knows and loves die and the impersonation is her saying wahoo i like this yeah she most likely would shes not just a mary sue now shes a psychopath but this isnt the worst part of the battle next hux calls for all of the tie fighters to follow the millenium falcon i get some of the fighters but all of them not a good battle decision hux leia made a bad decision and you wasted your chance to take advantage of it and then poe says they hate that ship i just find it weird that they knew which one it was after that finn is going to sacrifice himself for the resistance at that moment in the theater i thought man rian johnson has some guts this would fit finns character because he has been debating fighting the first order since force awakens but in the back of my head i knew what had happened before and i thought its just a trick rian johnson doesnt have these guts and then wham rose comes out of nowhere and head on nails him regardless of the fact how far back she was and how she perfectly hit him why she makes some quote its not about destroying what we hate its about saving what we love what the heck okay remember that roses sister gave her life for the resistance but then shes like loves better and so she dooms the resistance by letting the battering ram destroy the blast door for what love that doesnt fit her character i have to be honest i wasnt a big fan of rose to begin with but this finalized it rian johnson ruined a character next when we look at the trenches again all the soldiers are gone we never see them again somehow they disappeared without us knowing unusual right finally theres the stupid end of movie scene all the resistance died right but theyre all smiling patting each other on the back and celebrating i just wanted to scream stop smiling stop celebrating youre all dead  so what do we learn from the last jedi rian johnson cannot be trusted to write a good notstolen star wars film if you want a good film i do not recommend it at all
Dec 29 2019,negative,the good parts are really good but are ultimately overshadowed by flawed characterisations and outofplace humour
Dec 29 2019,positive,while general fans may not like it because it doesnt respect the originals and it treads its own path it has the best cinematography direction and character arcs in any star wars film
Dec 29 2019,negative,the problem i have with the last jedi is with the many different plots happening especially with the canto bight scenes all the characters were poorly written and i didnt care any of them the stuff that was built up from the force awakens was discarded and questions from it were ignored while the visual effects and music were good the plot characters and dialogue were awful
Dec 29 2019,positive,this movie does not deserve the hate it receives while the cantobite scene was a little out of place the rest of the movie was fresh and unpredictable this movie offers a fresh alternative to the toxic and overwhelming family romance themes of living up to your parents legacy and finding your inner power instead it offers valuable ideas such as the idea that greatness can come from anywhere an idea that is important in our society as we see an increase in divorce rates and broken homes unfortunately the rise of skywalker  undoes everything this film did well and offers a dismal end to the skywalker saga
Dec 29 2019,negative,worst of the 9 core better than solo id watch the christmas special 100 times before watching this again that said knives out is great so just keep rian johnson away from star wars and good things happen
Dec 29 2019,negative,really really bad  disneywhat have you done to my beloved star wars
Dec 29 2019,negative,not good it was not star wars
Dec 29 2019,negative,this doesnt deserve to be in the star wars franchise it makes no sense and the sub plots bring nothing but political bias to the unimaginative story i tried to watch it again but made me cringe even more rip star wars
Dec 29 2019,positive,daring and inventive if not always succeeding at it the ideas here make me wish that disney had laid out more of a plan from the start still enjoyable on its own anyway
Dec 29 2019,positive,of the skywalker saga the last jedi is my favorite it really did breath fresh air into star wars for me it was different it was character driven it set up the potential for something so much more than what the rise of skywalker was i was excited to see a movie wherein the legend of luke skywalker was the spark to lit the fire that would be the resistance a heartfelt story of how the force united a galaxy to come together in its darkest hour thats the story the last jedi set up and it set it up very well i enjoyed lukes character in tlj hes human like the rest of us i was discouraged to hear mark hamills thoughts on luke in tlj here i am having thoroughly enjoyed the movie and all i can read about is the actors distancing themselves from their own movie apparently i think more highly of tlj than its own actors i am disappointed we didnt get to see a payoff to rian johnsons tee up maybe if were patient in 30 years disney will make another sequel trilogy and well get a proper sequel to tlj although i fear the emperor will somehow still be aliveagainfor no apparent reason anyway long story short the last jedi was a great movie
Dec 29 2019,negative,the last jedi is just a parody guys its not cannon thats atleast what im telling my self
Dec 28 2019,negative,im sad that you cant rate a movie 0 stars terrible movie that throws away every plot thread created by tfa only good thing is the graphics and parts of the crait battle
Dec 28 2019,negative,almost destroyed star wars
Dec 28 2019,positive,you can see that the last jedi was an attempt to say greatness can come from anywhere it is unfortunately a message that is undone when you watch the utter pooh show that was episode 9 that proclaims no the greatest heroes only come from royalty and aristocracy  the rest of us are just spectators
Dec 28 2019,negative,tldr the most cinematically beautiful star wars train wreck ever made with repercussions so critical that it derailed the entire trilogy and perhaps the end of the 9 movie saga      rian johnson and the lucasfilm execs screwed up the entire trilogy with this one the core problem here is that the trilogy has no structural plan even the prequels had a structural plan across the 3 movies each movie was handed off like a relay race where the runner could go wherever they wanted and its never been more apparent than in the last jedi did this movie have beautiful artistic shots and some twists interesting or upsetting yes did it make sense as the 2nd to last movie in a trilogy trying to wrap up the skywalker saga absolutely not i have a long list of issues with this movie but i think it comes down to these things   trying to be different by butchering the luke skywalker character as though he had learned nothing from the originals   canto bight was so boring and contributed nothing to the story or series except some weird outofleftfield anticapitalist message even if you think its character development for finn this was the most round and uninteresting way to do it with so many legendary characters to explore more of leia rey poe ect why did they need rose i would have much rather them spent more time with leiaothers and whats shes been up to   too many loose threads knights of ren absent setting up meaningful story progression to wrap up all of the star wars movies the rebels end up pretty much where they started minus some of the favorite characters who died i could go on   the core plot of a slow space chase was the most boring central plot for a star wars movie i could think of i mean really of all the cool things they could have done in the star wars universe
Dec 28 2019,negative,nostalgia but none of the romance or the original trilogy  this is nothing more than a blockbuster
Dec 28 2019,negative,this movie disrespects the old saga characters completely
Dec 28 2019,positive,an innovative thoughtful original take on star wars  took the setup from episode 7 and took it is a new unexpected direction bravo to rian johnson for taking some risks in my opinion the 2nd best of all the star wars movies only behind empire
Dec 28 2019,negative,complete trash destroyed established lorr and characters for nothing  this is not star wars
Dec 28 2019,positive,the last jedi brings a real humanity to the star wars saga with great twists and fresh new ideas star wars reaches new heights
Dec 28 2019,negative,i walked out of the theater mad and got even more mad over time tfa was not good but this movie seems to have been made by someone when never watched the original trilogy or the prequels and just wanted to go their own way with no regard for canon
Dec 28 2019,negative,anti twists for the sake of it lukes character motivations are paradoxical and canto bite was a waste of time terrible film and concept shrouded by good acting
Dec 28 2019,positive,the themes are amazing redemption learning from past failures and the evils of capitalism its the best star wars movie probably some of the best scifi ever made
Dec 28 2019,negative,worst of any star wars movie
Dec 28 2019,negative,ruined star wars for millions of long time and young fans
Dec 28 2019,positive,if you have ever been curious about what the full potential of the force could be this satisfies that curiosity tenfold im not sure how much better you could have made this movie it buttonsup a lot of plot points from even return of the jedi and then comes full force with some of the most epic sequences ive ever seen in movie history and im comparing to deathly hallows part ii     i left the theatre fulfilled and excited which is what i want from a scifi action saga like the one i grew up watching it was epic
Dec 28 2019,negative,lol that sums it up just writing for the minimum words
Dec 28 2019,positive,people are going to hate me but i thought this was a master piece kinda brought that sad destruction feel that we get from so many other movies that the star wars saga lacks a lot had so much action and beautiful scenes rey seems to battle who she is great movie
Dec 28 2019,positive,my favorite star wars film outside of empire strikes back  some of the best dialogue character development and by far the best shot movie in all of star wars  kudos to rian johnson
Dec 28 2019,negative,star wars is high fantasy in high fantasy you create a world with its own rules but once those rules are set the same story telling 101 rules apply for instance a mcguffin or deus ex powers for the convenience of the plot are not good story telling unless established in the canon johnson is a good story teller so i really dont know what happened here     a black stain on one of the greatest myths of our time
Dec 28 2019,negative,absolutely horrible plot decisions rian johnson and company sacrifices the integrity of star wars to make an admittedly very entertaining movie but at too high a cost
Dec 28 2019,negative,i have been and always shall be a star wars fan but i truly hated the last jedi the production had a social agenda instead of simply trying to make a coherent and exciting star wars film this agenda tried to muddle and ruin the entire new trilogy rise of skywalker had to undo the rubbish that was the last jedi simply to close out the new trilogy on a positive note and save the spirit that was in the force awakens and the original trilogy i watched trash the last jedi twice and that is all i will ever watch it i immediately saw rise of skywalker three times opening week and will watch it many many times forward the last jedi is in the bottom three of star wars films it is miserable 
Dec 28 2019,positive,this particular film in the star wars saga is a disappointing one just like episode 2 attack of the clones i can agree with some fans that the action is amazing however its not one id personally reccomend when someone asks
Dec 28 2019,negative,garbage  nearly nothing to do with star wars  abandoned luke skywalker story  snokes is confusing bunch of dumpster fire garbage  rian johnson should never be allowed to write and direct anything ever again  this movie needs a doover
Dec 27 2019,negative,there is little good to say about this film as others have said the raykylo arc is interesting and the only thing that forwards the story within the trilogy we have fins side story that spans almost the whole movie and finishes with exactly 0 effect to the plot something you learn very early as a storywriter not to do also there is the forced love story between him and rose a mechanic we have no sympathy with poes narrative of an apparent plot against the rebellion from within the higher ranks that ultimately ends in yeah we had a plan all along but decided not to tell anyone is beyond unbelievable then there is the cartoonish overarching plot of two very slow space ships that chase each other its like a pixars movie scene with a snail race that is played out ironically slow  but this is star wars a movie about war in space then there is a flying leia superwoman and a totally obvious rip off of the battle of hoth from empire strikes back so obvious in fact that one character needed to clarify that it is  in fact  salt not snow what we see there and last but not least the slapstick humor if you are looking for laurel and hardy in space this is for you from the first scene i knew i would not enjoy this film and i was right every single scene every shot needed a joke the only thing missing was a couch and a laugh track and we would have ourselves a sitcom    this is all very hard critique but dont just take it from me go watch the rise of skywalker and see how j j abrams himself tries his best to right the wrongs of rian johnson how he tries to erase every mistake that has been put in the last jedi and gives fans a dignified end of this star wars saga    johnson made me lose hope for this franchise which has been restored today two years later    ps i created this account only to write my critique for this film
Dec 27 2019,negative,i dont know where to begin imagine a person who has never watched star wars being told to write  direct a new star wars movie now imagine this same person decided to destroy your childhood love of star wars by making the most catastrophic mistakes with main characters synopsis luke skywalker is a crazy winy old man with no respect for the force princess leia now has superman type abilities a all knowing sith lord who just popped up out of nowhere dies a predictable death irrelevant characters are made to seem very important while main characters are shown to be very weak end of summary the movie is unwatchable filth and should be removed from the entire star wars cannon
Dec 27 2019,negative,okay in parts though i felt insulted walking out of the cinema the plot script and acting just didnt mesh over the entire movie
Dec 27 2019,negative,worst star wars ever this happens when somebody who do not carre about scifi or even star wars is an wheel of the production
Dec 27 2019,negative,dont waste your time with this terrible movie which was in my opinion the worst by far in the saga it disrespects the original trilogy and the prequels which created the fantastic franchise which is star wars
Dec 27 2019,positive,the moments i enjoyed the most were with adam driver and daisy ridley there were some things i didnt care for in the movie but dont think it deserves the hate it gets
Dec 27 2019,negative,how are the critics so in love with this abomination of a film  over powered characters  dont you miss the good old days when you have to actually be trained and proven jedi to wield the light saber but just about anyone can do it   young ray beat the bad guy once so why even bother with the pointless training   amazing graphics and all but just doesnt keep the integrity of a star wars movie
Dec 27 2019,negative,awful awful star wars movie and ruined the new trilogy this movie reaches from beyond the grave and ruins rise of sky walker
Dec 27 2019,negative,rey and kylo rens arcs were the only good part of the movie its rotten but its at least better than both of jjs dumb focus group rehashes
Dec 27 2019,negative,this movie was terriblefull of plot holes and has usless side quests it had few fantasticly choreographed fights
Dec 27 2019,negative,pure junk is impressive as director believes he is revolutionizing the franchise through his ridiculous plot twists a movie that looks more like a filler episode
Dec 27 2019,positive,i actually enjoyed this movie apart from some dumb stuff that sticks out on repeat viewings the plot has some major issues but is still an enjoyable time the theme of failure and learning from it is treated well although it does overpermeate the movie in my opinion i was ok with the plot twists and daring story choices even if they werent my favorite and i may have preferred something different overall i didnt love it but i cant bring myself to hate it like half of the internet
Dec 27 2019,negative,i had diarrhea after watching this
Dec 27 2019,negative,worst starwars movie ever made ever it is horrible it might only be worth it if you have never seen any other movie at all
Dec 27 2019,positive,amazing scenes and environments i love how the main characters evolve psychologically there is a lot of things that can bother people but for me it was really good and as a bonus it made me appreciate a lot more the episode 7 so its a big plus
Dec 27 2019,negative,the tone was too jokey for its own good and half the movie the fuel storyline got more absurd by each scene i liked the characters even some like rose that got some hate i thought she was great i just wish they were placed in a better movie
Dec 27 2019,positive,i loved this movie probably a lot more than a lot of people and thats ok i thought it was masterfully done everything was beautiful and you got a lot more twists and turns than you normally would
Dec 27 2019,negative,while it has a few moments i liked the poor use of characters and really disappointing plot made this movie probably my least favorite of all the star wars movies the connection between rey and kylo up to and including the scenes in the throne room make this movie bearable to rewatch but thats about it bad choices for and surrounding poe finn and lukes characters killed this movie for me
Dec 27 2019,negative,its  infuriating and a shame for the franchise that this crap is called  star wars
Dec 27 2019,positive,its star wars  just enjoy this fantastic tale
Dec 27 2019,positive,i love this movie definitely not perfect but great characters and they do wonderful things with the force and the legacy of the jedi
Dec 27 2019,negative,this is the worst film of the series
Dec 27 2019,negative,production quality of course is high on this film but the directing and writing was awful i wouldnt pay to see the movie when you have so many good prospects on disneynetflix hulu and amazon prime video
Dec 27 2019,negative,a complete slap in the face to anyone that genuinely loves or cares about these characters how dare you brian never work again please
Dec 27 2019,negative,long drawn out incoherent to the plot of the movie before it and filled with meaningless plot devices in a vague attempt to create analogies between the sw universe and ours  all of which flopped the story while containing some gems was simply poorly written and executed additionally the writers  directors sacrificed their integrity through the addition of many characters with no other purpose in the story other than romancedrama these 1dimensional characters usually were either dynamic characters from the previous movie or poorly generated new personalities
Dec 27 2019,negative,some okay moments but the main plot is an insult to everything that made star wars a beloved franchise
Dec 27 2019,negative,this movie is so bad i accidentally watched it twice because i thought i had yet to see it
Dec 27 2019,positive,an odd star wars movie that is entertaining but falls flat with its contradictory plot and miss placed humor
Dec 27 2019,negative,ruined completely a whole saga filling the movie with politically correctness instead of developing the plot from ep 7    good job
Dec 27 2019,negative,it ruined the whole saga
Dec 27 2019,neutral,its not as bad as people say but its not good it deserves credit for trying a new story instead of rehashing the same plot like the force awakens did but sometimes trying something new doesnt work and this one really doesnt its better than the worst of the prequels though so theres that
Dec 27 2019,negative,this movie sucks the ending sucks the new characters suck everything in this movie sucks
Dec 27 2019,positive,thelastjedi  is a great movie because rian johnson didnt listen to either of fans  second best ever star wars after theempirestrikesback  tlj artistically is gorgeous and i love luke why is human 
Dec 27 2019,positive,this movie was not perfect but it was the one film that carried the spirit of star wars most in the new trilogy these movies have always been about hope and tlj reinforces that feeling many times over its refreshing to see such complex and relatable characters in a setting that we love but forging their own paths rey is a beautifully crafted character made even more so by her constant struggle between the light and the dark her struggle to define who is right and who is wrong and her struggle againstwith kyloben even as she tries to find her place in the skywalker story whats more her lack of a familial legacy in this universe made her that much more of a hero that we wanted to support additionally the evolution of kyloben from start to finish of this film was so well crafted and evoked such emotion through the performance alone rian johnson really gave us something to hope and look forward to with these characters
Dec 27 2019,negative,its like rj did his best to destroy the skywalker saga what a terrible movie at least the phantom menace doesnt have the worst star wars movie ever title anymore
Dec 27 2019,negative,the mythos of the force ancestors and their decedents and finally all of the relationships that bound us to this story are treated as irrelevant in this film
Dec 27 2019,negative,the critics where not very good at what they dothey rarely ever are    this movie subverted my expectations to the point where i stopped caring about any characters actionswhat does it matter if theres some potential ex machina right around any corner    movies messages are morally ambiguous and their execution makes me want to go enslave animals punch women in power and never have someone fall in love with me    the tone of the movie isridiculous action suspense scenes are comedic dramatic exposition is also undercut by comedy was this a live animated cartoon dusts shoulder off
Dec 27 2019,negative,a nonsensical plot which didnt follow the previous roadmap from tfa with tons of holes jokes that snap you back to reality and make you remember that youre not in a galaxy far far away rian johnson set out to destroy star wars and he about did it
Dec 27 2019,positive,despite what quote unquote fans say about this movie this film dares to defy tradition and do something new and it works finally theres a writer and director whos willing to go out of the comfort zone of a traditional star wars movie this film has been subject to almost universal disgust by fans but the fans are the ones who are disgusting the constant threats and bullying towards the director are sickening the bullying of cast members off twitter is vile im glad there was someone who finally did something different and spit in the face of tradition this movie isnt perfect or a masterpiece but damn it it goes its own way i commend the hell out of it for doing it
Dec 27 2019,negative,awful in every way the philosophy of killing the past is strong here and it stinks
Dec 27 2019,positive,superb one of the best star wars 
Dec 27 2019,negative,just terrible critics are useless look at the difference between the fans and critics and you can see what bs the critics review are this movie is garbage  luke is a miserable old wretch on an island and the evaporates at the end  what a waste of 40 years of waiting for luke to bring back the jedi  so many things about this movie are terrible the fans will never watch this movie again
Dec 27 2019,negative,with no doubt in my mind the absolute worst star wars any movie ever  not even worth the time to explain why  to me this movie does not even exists    geezus made me cry like legit questions my life choices in being a star wars fan
Dec 27 2019,negative,the director clearly did not understand star wars the jokes absolutely ruined the film and the way luke was treated was a crime
Dec 27 2019,positive,go watch it again i feel like people hate on this movie for no reason it felt incomplete without rise of skywalker but now that the trilogy is done this movie fits into the other two quite well rian johnson did well with this one i notice a trend people either hate this or love it theres no like i love it it reminds me of empire strikes back as luke no longer wants to train jedi like yoda didnt and a force ghost has to appear and convince them to help hell luke is a better helper in this than yoda was in the ot his death was honorable and wise too
Dec 27 2019,negative,this movie is absurd
Dec 27 2019,negative,a goofy mess with uninteresting characters and storylines
Dec 27 2019,neutral,if there is something that critics simply will never understand about star wars is that it is a fantasy series that never had the ambition to receive critical acclaim rian johnsons lack of continuity and complete diversion of the central themes left the majority of us lifelong fans somewhat crestfallen luke was written to be something closer to a stranger than the beloved hero we all anticipated to see this attempt at breaking the mold even though it is a saga based on a mythlike theme of self fulfilling prophecy and fighting identity you are born with versus who you chose to be was confusing not justifiable in retrospect considering sw fans return for familiarity rian only stands out to me because he destroyed an opportunity to enchant us the word hubris is said so much in the film i can only associate it to everyone who allowed this story to take such a pitfall after such a strong start with episode 7 i didnt appreciate that finn became an insignificant side character nor that poe was all of a sudden an explosion crazed hotheaded pilot as opposed to the person he was in episode 7 there was an amazing cast of female leads yet they single handedly destroyed their own rebellion star fleet that seems a bit patronizing doesnt it and not to mention every side quest involving new character served no purpose not even character building i may be a fan but i can be critical and this movie doesnt live up to its score on the critics end of things it is by far the worst of all the star wars films the 25 stars are for adam driver and every other superb actor casted in this film who managed to hold their own even with terrible direction reminiscent of george lucass in the prequels
Dec 27 2019,negative,this was a terrible movie for the simple fact that ruin johnson the director completely changed the tone and feel of star wars   people will think that people hated tlj because of the details of the scriptbut thats a small part larger issue was the complete change in tone
Dec 27 2019,negative,horrible addition to the star wars saga
Dec 27 2019,positive,imaginative and fun  what a fantasy movie set in space should be
Dec 27 2019,negative,the original star wars trilogy had a coherent cosmic message  the force was a revered and binary entity  to hate evil doers ironically was to turn to the dark side and become evil  the force could be employed to move inanimate objects to enlighten or to anticipate present and future events   now it seems the force has dissolved into a metaphysical mystery wrapped in a cosmic enigma   with the loss of an coherence the force is attributed to well just about anything  dead people infuse living people from millions of miles away  live people make dead people alive and then die for some unknown reason   anyway forceconfuson  makes for a lot of confusing and unexplained scenes that leave one nodding their head in a knowing sort of way not because they know what is actually happening am not sure the director even knows but bc claiming to understand that which is not understandable is so very chic
Dec 27 2019,positive,amazing innovative film that finally moves the franchise forward rather than remake past films in the new trilogy
Dec 26 2019,negative,its very sad that theres no way of taking everything that this movie ruined back pretentious incoherent selfindulgent and with zero understanding of the established universe and characters this movie had all the potential to be the finest of them all but somehow rj decided that it should wrap up all previous story efforts in favor of a tbd narrative 
Dec 26 2019,positive,i really loved it the casino sequence was unnecessary and there were some questionable choice but the scenes with rey and kylo ren were truly amazing adam driver and daisy ridley have a lot of chemistry
Dec 26 2019,negative,to much cgi not enough character
Dec 26 2019,negative,the storytelling in this movie doesnt make sense for star wars rian johnson ruined the franchise
Dec 26 2019,positive,so the last jedi i dont think id be wrong in saying that this is probably the most divisive installment in the star wars franchise however for me as someone who likes star wars but doesnt have a special affinity for it i really like this film let me explain    lets start with the elephant in the room luke skywalkers arc  ive seen a lot of people complaining about this and honestly i dont get it this is actually my favorite character arc in the film instead of making luke an overpowered badass which i wouldve been ok with he is made into a complex character by having real struggles and complexities his pov is really well explored through the excellent use of flashbacks and and his teachings to rey for me this was a really interesting place to take the character and really kept me intrigued    second the filmmaking  this is by far the best looking star wars movie to date closely followed by rogue one a lot of attention has been given to the shot structure and framing as well as the lighting and use of color i thought that the forcebridge sequences in particular were a real highlight    third the themes  i have been let down by a lot of recent star wars films because of a lack of meaningful themes which disconnected me from them so i was pleasantly surprised to discover some very well explored and relatable themes in this film especially the themes about failure and moving on from the past struck a cord with me    theres a lot more things i liked but i dont feel like discussing them all so let me sum them up instead     the reveal of reys parents being nobodys     poe damerons character arc     production design     kylo ren adam driver steals the freaking show     yoda and lukes studentteacher conversation     the force is mystical again     luke and leias reunion scene     luke vs kylo ren     lukes death    the only real criticism i have is that the canto bight subplot isnt always as engaging as it could be but besides that i think its a really great and wellmade film not without its flaws but a very rewarding viewing experience for those looking for one
Dec 26 2019,negative,terrible movie it is not cohesive at all with the plot lines laid out in the force awakens rian johnsons vision was clearly different from that of jj abrams and it was a mistake to switch directors mid trilogy
Dec 26 2019,negative,20 minutes scene against capitalism that doesnt even fit the story a bunch of crap on all fronts
Dec 26 2019,positive,i love what rian johnson did with the characters    the emotional connection is strong with this film    the first hourandahalf is oddly paced the film is long overall but the last hour    almost perfect contains some of my favorite movie moments in movie history    theres a change i wont watch this trilogy again i will still watch tlj on its own i love it that much
Dec 26 2019,negative,this was an attempt to bring got style subverting expectations into the star wars franchise while trying to embed world views on socioeconomic issues none of these things add value to the movie and it automatically will ruin the next one
Dec 26 2019,positive,coming back to this after watching the next movie in the franchise and i still dont understand why people hate it so much its incredibly daring for a star wars movie focuses hard on the characters development instead of fetishizing lightsabers droids and other things that can be made into merchandise has striking visuals and wonderfully choreographed fight scenes it also asks questions about gray morality and responsibility in a way that no other movie from the franchise had before its a shame that it was retconned later on and rian johnson forever has my respect
Dec 26 2019,neutral,too much time with new characters ignoring the fun we had with finn rey and poe in the force awakens a couple of great scenes but too little too late
Dec 26 2019,positive,even if some mistakes have been made in this movie the last jedi show us beautiful scenes and was much better than the force awakens
Dec 26 2019,positive,great story acting effects and ending  who is a critic anyway  thankyoujjabrams
Dec 26 2019,negative,absolutely awful ruins several characters  breaks the star wars universe it is obvious the people directing and producing do not care about star wars  the side plot is useless i feel bad for the actors they did not sign up to be part of such an awful trilogy
Dec 26 2019,negative,hate it gutted to say i hated it slightly less than rise of skywalker force awakens rendered pointless
Dec 26 2019,positive,what a beautiful movie character growth and depth deep emotion absolutely hopeful message has that very star wars feeljust really like it and could watch it over and over adam driver and daisy ridley were amazing in this
Dec 26 2019,negative,good effects and combat completely incoherent story that made no sense or seemed irrelevant at best
Dec 26 2019,positive,one of the best star wars movies
Dec 26 2019,negative,the rise of skywalker made me realize how much this movie screwed up in the sequel trilogy from making luke look weak to a not so great plot the only thing interesting about this movie was rey and kylos connection
Dec 26 2019,positive,saw this film last night finally and i really enjoyed the last jedi little bit more then force awaken and better then rise of skywalker  need to catch up on the other films from the beginning but the disney trilogy was pretty great loved it so exciting to watch and ready to see the other films
Dec 26 2019,positive,a fresh take on a decades old tale one that doesnt rely on patriarchal blood lines to tell a good story adam driver and daisy ridley have amazing chemistry and the fight scene with reykylo taking on the guards is one of my favorite cinematic moments
Dec 26 2019,positive,i really love rians vision on the sw universe
Dec 26 2019,negative,terrible movie it broke several laws of the star wars universe and the characters were uninteresting and their stories could have been much better
Dec 26 2019,negative,just awful worst movie of the entire saga
Dec 26 2019,negative,very little plot development punctuated by several big moments this movie turned all of the men into flawed weak characters while making all of the women into the embodiment of perfection what is wrong with having both strong women and brave and courageous men the purple haired lady was the single most pointless character in all of star wars this movie was a huge disappointment
Dec 26 2019,negative,ok i cant stand the critics reviews of movies that they have not seen the movie or may i say had to be paid to say it was good because this was a train wreck from start to finish  with the bombers that somehow can drop bombs in space to the ridiculous side plot about going to a casino planet made this movie not only bad but cringey to even watch critics gave this movie a 94  when the fans who payed to see this trash gave it a 40 so you tell me who is honest stay away from this pile of space poop
Dec 26 2019,negative,this movie was absolutely terrible
Dec 26 2019,positive,fantastic cinema powerful scenes moving work all around a great film to watch
Dec 26 2019,negative,the last jedi is easily the worst movie in the entire franchise yes its worse than the attack of the clones at least the prequels dont destroy established characters like this movie
Dec 26 2019,negative,it ruins luke character and makes rey an even more powerful mary sue for no reason finn  the most interesting character of this trilogy is put with rose just to justify her and all they do in this movie is useless they ocupy more than half of the movie why rey have to find luke to train her if leia is awesome with the force without explanation  it may work as a nonstarwars movie but ignoring star wars legacy make this film really bad
Dec 26 2019,positive,i loved it beautiful symbolism and imagery interesting storylines and theme i like that they explore elements and dive deeper into the world of star wars building upon the force awakens and developing the characters lots of good messages from the story too about hope and selfworth like everyone else after tfa i was trying to figure out who rey was related to but after initially being surprised by the direction chosen for reys backstory i actually prefer it what a great message that you dont have to be related to someone famous or important for you to be powerful yourself to have worth to matter a bold innovative take on the star wars universe that remains true to its core themes of hope and redemption
Dec 26 2019,negative,again  star wars is crushing my childhood dreams  this movie was worse than all the others together  there literally is no story any more  none maaaaan so sad 
Dec 26 2019,negative,recycled and not very original at all and the only ideas they had were damaging to this once great franchise as an avid fan since the 80s i was really disappointed
Dec 26 2019,positive,star wars masterpiece
Dec 26 2019,negative,an ok scifi movie not a star wars
Dec 26 2019,negative,movie was terrible and critics dont know good movies from bad movies directors direction in the movie was terrible you brought luke back to just do little to nothing and die thats worthless
Dec 26 2019,negative,he tried to push the marvel formula    sins are      bwings couldve been used instead of the slowass star fortress having bwings overwhelmed instead of star fortress picked out one by one wouldve been better it would also show just how outnumbered and out gunned the rebellion was better        things anyone knows is a bad idea that proves to be a bad idea the first order guy that sold them out        yo mama jokes        giving characters that shouldve been side notes like wedge and porkins more screen time poe and rose        the whole subplot of holdo vs poe        yo momma jokes by poe        hux        canto bight        they celebrate instead of mourn after crait mourning wouldve fit the tone
Dec 26 2019,positive,it will be unsuitable to say that its bad or rotten because its a good movie from a critical point of view the movie had all features so that it could be called a good movie but it is understandable from a fans point of view that it had some problems especially with lukes character but i would say whatever they did it was justifiable the acting was pretty good throughout the story was good but felt extended and had missed a good enough ending it gives you the feeling that it will end now but it keeps on going with some good moments but a comparatively bad ending the sense of humour sometimes or much everytime feels unnecessary the character development like most of the star wars movies was good with all the things happening the score was brilliant screenplay was great as well the movie however you felt about it kept you invested there were a lot of plotholes the villain especially the supreme leader tries to be intimidating or scary like its predecessors but couldnt do so sometimes major points of the movie were predictable which kills the essence of the movie but somehow i felt satisfied watching the movie the first time all in all i rate the movie a healthy 455 90
Dec 26 2019,negative,this movie broke star wars lore
Dec 26 2019,negative,subverted my expectations i expected a decent movie this was unsatisfying from the start till the end
Dec 26 2019,negative,its well made unlike the final chapter but boring characters unexplained levels of power the worst fall of a hero ever weak enemies all make this movie sad and pointless rey strolls to victory and never feels under pressure a continuation fromthe last 15 mins of the previous movie the film that almost destroyed star wars not because it was badly put together or edited but because it feels like it is trying to annoy fans of the originals rather than keep them on board while bringing younger people on too  should be re edited with extra shots of rey training with luke not a total loser
Dec 26 2019,negative,the film misses a great opportunity to drive the story forward in a meaningful direction instead it relies on unnecessarily subverting expectations as a gimmick the emotional moments dont land because they are immediately nullified by cheap jokes and the jokes themselves arent funny because they throw you out of the movie not fitting at all into the context    besides the film also changes character motivation just for the sake of plot betraying what could have been interesting character arcs the different plot meanwhile seem like quests out of a video game making the star wars universe feel generic and for the first time actually really small and boring
Dec 26 2019,negative,it just doesnt feel like a star wars movie so out of touch with the rest of the universe that was established before it
Dec 26 2019,negative,the movie contradicted its moral and emotional themes and did a disservice to the skywalker saga
Dec 26 2019,negative,after watching the rise of skywalker it became crystal clear to me that even jj abrams  saw the last jedi as an abomination to the star wars franchise  half of the last jedi was pointless  the story line was weak with major flaws in basic logic  most of the characters were reduced to onedimensional caricatures with no soul  it basically said whatever you think about star wars and the force throw it out and start all over  it was easily the most disappointing movie i have ever seen
Dec 26 2019,positive,rian beautifully inspires us on a journey of self reflection that challenges us to learn from our failures and to look inside ourselves for our belonging  the message of hope in realizing that anybody can make a significant impact no matter where you come from and that the living force does not care about a patriarchal bloodline  that we must not win by fighting what we hate but rather by saving what we love  that no one is ever really gone and that there always hope for redemption and belonging  its what star wars was always supposed to really represent  he uses beautiful imagery to convey the characters growth and journey unlike any other director  my favourite star wars movie since the empire strikes back
Dec 26 2019,negative,rose tico is the worst character ever rian johnson should not have directed
Dec 26 2019,negative,was this even a star wars movie
Dec 26 2019,negative,all the other questionable scenes aside this movie broke star wars by having that hyperspace crash scene
Dec 26 2019,negative,new worldsor reboots of worlds interesting cinematography story was slow uses characters not communicating to create suspense and tension new physics are introduced into the star wars universe being dead as a force user doesnt mean you cannot interact with the alive world some elements built up in previous film are abandoned
Dec 26 2019,negative,da hell was this sht
Dec 26 2019,negative,this movie is so bad since the first scene it is just bad and when you finally see luke skywalker after 30 years you get dissapointed i didnt see a single good moment in this movie just watch ivan ortegas reedit it is the only watchable version
Dec 26 2019,negative,worst movie i have seen in a long time so many errors bad acting terrible story  soooo much hipe
Dec 26 2019,negative,wish i could give a zero my friends made me watch it   nothing makes sence wtf
Dec 26 2019,negative,compete rehash of empire strikes back
Dec 26 2019,negative,the worst of the last three  the story line made no sense  seriously what a shiteshow
Dec 26 2019,negative,thanks for completely disregarding the first movie rian you ruined star wars with this piece of trash movie jj abrahams didnt even get a chance to make a good movie for the third one because of how bad the last jedi was
Dec 26 2019,negative,rian johnson should stay away from star wars he has ruined star wars brand dislike the film
Dec 26 2019,negative,it may be a good movie but i was very dissapointed with this boring and depressed luke
Dec 26 2019,negative,please be more original
Dec 26 2019,negative,most disappointing movie in the saga
Dec 25 2019,negative,terrible star wars the only thing that was ok in this movie was kylo ren
Dec 25 2019,positive,really messy directing and choreographing
Dec 25 2019,positive,needed some work but its star wars as someone who saw the original first star wars when it first came out i will always have a soft spot for this series
Dec 25 2019,negative,is it possible to give a film this horrendous less stars
Dec 25 2019,negative,we were picking a star wars for movie night and my 10 and 8 year old told me the last jedi is their least favorite and they dont want to watch it again  i think its just bad storytelling
Dec 25 2019,negative,critics are idiots for liking last jedi i imagine they do because of social commentary but as a narrative that makes any sense it sucked when a director and writer want to leave their mark more than they want to be true to a narrative look out
Dec 25 2019,negative,bad just really bad
Dec 25 2019,positive,deep and complex going way beyond the good vs evil old plot and joyously overturning cliches fresh and new and at the same time star wars
Dec 25 2019,positive,this movie was great interesting and amazing visuals with the planets and you can feel a connection with the characters and the fight scenes and you can connect with kyle ren who is played amazingly this movie gets to much hate and it was a good sequel to number 7
Dec 25 2019,positive,i thought it was great
Dec 25 2019,negative,the story is told in the worst possible way disjointed nonlinear and confusing with too much filler the choices werent necessarily bad but their execution was terrible
Dec 25 2019,negative,i agree with others that while there was some good moments the movie as a whole was a mess
Dec 25 2019,negative,trash characters trash plot trash everything
Dec 25 2019,positive,rian johnson had the guts to write a good piece of work that would entertain peope by showing them something new and heartfelt instead of letting himself get owned by old school fans and failing as a creative director
Dec 25 2019,positive,some of the character development choices were terrible and finn and roses mission was a useless story arc but the story overall was well thought out and i mostly enjoyed it
Dec 25 2019,negative,this movie is garbage this isnt star wars anymore its a blatant cash grab that mirrors the weaknesses that plague the marvel franchise
Dec 25 2019,negative,the absolute worst star wars movie ive ever seen little to no character growth insane plot holes complete disregard and disrespect for everything that came before it rian johnson should never touch star wars again
Dec 25 2019,positive,took things in different direction from force awakens just like empire strikes back did from new hope classic everything goes wrong middle chapter but with some clever rian johnson twists
Dec 25 2019,positive,a long movie but i enjoyed 
Dec 25 2019,negative,complete trash wish i could rate it lower turns out the old characters were useless rubbish and we didnt know it but rey is the bestest evarrrr the force awakens was really bad and this was much worse
Dec 25 2019,positive,it gets better with time the finn  rose stuff is shockingly bad but if you ignore that 30 minutes the rest is pretty good
Dec 25 2019,positive,it has problems but i dont think it deserves all the hate
Dec 25 2019,negative,i disliked this movie so much it felt like a terrible hodgepodge of ideas that didnt work at all im not sure was the so called critics were smoking when they said this was the greatest star wars movie ever
Dec 25 2019,negative,worst star wars film out of all 9 movies ill try to give it some points decent battle scenes funny anecdotes but it lacks all the quality things a star wars movie posses epic storytelling good plot twists and rich character development  honesty you could skip this movie entirely and watch the 9th and be happy
Dec 25 2019,negative,picks right up with the disrespect the last movie shows all of our classic characters leave it to disney to ruin a classic series
Dec 25 2019,negative,this move is easily the worst in the entire series it ignores and destroys every single plot point set up before it i would have rather watched jarjar binks for 3 hours than this
Dec 25 2019,positive,the most wellwritten episode out of the sequel trilogy beautiful storytelling complex and emotional character archs stunning simbolic and visual narrative powerful message and a breath of fresh air for the timeless cosmic story with deep understanding of the mythology thats in the core of it thank you rian johnson
Dec 25 2019,negative,just plain awful in regards of every metric except visuals  story from 7 is not really continued and everything that happens just seems dumbed down and meaningless i mean a star wars fan will watch out of curiosity but i figure you cant make too many of this kind of movies without ruining everything we now about star wars
Dec 25 2019,negative,really bland and boring missing the spark that the first sequel movie had is like a parody of the ot and prequels nothing to really interesting to see with the same 1 dimensional characters
Dec 25 2019,positive,original emotionant and underrated tlj offer new roads to star wars saga and expanded the universe in the awesome way
Dec 25 2019,negative,the original and prequel trilogy had their flaws but were each original in both concepts and technology experimenting and exploring the strangeness of new worlds was of importance for george lucas and something he wanted a fresh look at for each trilogy  the sequels meanwhile bring nothing new to the table theyre shallow action movies set in a rehash of the original setting with nonsensical and character breaking arcs and plots
Dec 25 2019,negative,you all ready know if the critics love it then it will be a horrible movie
Dec 25 2019,negative,the worst movie i have ever seen in my life its upsetting i was angry after watching this rian johnson the director literally spit on all our faces making this movie its filled with awful surprises that make no sense whatsoever worst movie ever i would give it 5 stars if allowed
Dec 25 2019,positive,my opinion of the last jedi has improved a bit now that ive seen the rise of skywalker its still not the best star wars movie ever as it has some scenes that really turned me off but it is better than the force awakens luke is awesome in this movie both on the island and later on it really caps off his experience in the star wars saga and caps off the saga as a whole even the prequels in a satisfying way the way that this movie ties up loose ends and puts the prequels and original trilogy into context make it worth watching even with its many flaws
Dec 25 2019,negative,not the star wars i grew up with a very well made film but a terribly made star wars film takes very little consideration of established lore and in my opinion nearly ruins the character of luke skywalker i write this after watching the rise of skywalker however and i am happy to say it fixes a lot of what i disliked in this film
Dec 25 2019,positive,the best of the saga
Dec 25 2019,negative,movie critics need to rethink their impression of this movie in that it deviates from the original formula of the george lucas saga  credit should be given to the fans who voted it in the 40s  the critics may rate it high but in the end the fans bring in the profit and ultimate support
Dec 25 2019,negative,so disappointed force awakens was pretty good but this movie
Dec 25 2019,positive,im alsolutelly sure now it was the best sw movie ever done
Dec 25 2019,positive,really liked this movie  it took risks and gave luke a arc
Dec 25 2019,positive,awesome movie not perfect roses character is bad but the rest is great
Dec 25 2019,negative,it was literally the worst movie i have ever seen
Dec 25 2019,negative,has the writer ever seen star wars
Dec 24 2019,positive,one of the best star wars movie tries to get out of the same old star wars tropes best star wars of the new trilogy 
Dec 24 2019,negative,this movie was horrible
Dec 24 2019,positive,i love this film i loved the action i loved the editing i loved the effects and the story and the acting and that lightsaber battleits the best lightsaber battle in the entire star wars sagaand that includes episode ix we didnt deserve rian johnson
Dec 24 2019,positive,people expect too much from a series that has always been based on pulp tropes its supposed to be kind of goofy and imperfect the japanese call that wabisabi the italians call it sprezzatura the best parts of this entry must be included with the very best parts of the series no exaggeration i loved it
Dec 24 2019,negative,this movie was terrible    the last jedi is an excellent case study on why subverting expectations at every possible turn without stopping to consider what the impact of that might be makes for an awful movie    the force awakens had its problems and an unkind interpretation of the film would simply brand it as a new hope 2 but what it did manage to do was lay interesting groundwork for a new trilogy of star wars films  rian johnson instead of exploring any of the interesting story threads that were introduced in episode 7 chose to completely ignore everything that had happened in the previous film to such an extent that it felt deliberately malicious     this movie just feels like the type of star wars film that someone who actively dislikes star wars would make  old characters seem like complete strangers in their behavior and views  the villain is killed off unceremoniously in the middle of the film  both new and old characters are given deus ex machina force abilities whenever the plot calls for it which would have probably been fine if we were given some sort of indication that any meaningful training or development was happening for them      almost every decision made for this movie lowers the stakes and leaves the audience less invested  it is bad enough for this film on its own but when you consider that this is supposed to be the second film in a trilogy you start to wonder who allowed any of these choices to be made      the big bad evil guy  killed off in the middle of the film  theres no one to replace him by the way  kylo isnt strong enough of an antagonist at the end of this film to stand in as the big evil  there are no other candidates  jj had to bring back an old character to fill the void which i have no qualms with      the epic climax that was foreshadowed earlier in the film  ruined with outofplace attempts at humor most of the humor in this film felt somewhat out of place  even if we forgive that all of the tension and excitement that was built up for this part of the film is instantly dissipated when we find out that luke isnt actually there  it felt like johnson thought this would be a cool reveal but instead it retroactively made everything that just happened feel completely hollow  and then for seemingly no reason at all extreme exertion i suppose luke dies  just like that  he didnt even do anything  he never left his selfimposed exile    the entire casino planet events were uninteresting and ultimately pointless  had no one gone to the casino planet nothing would have changed      hyperspace rules were rewritten another deus ex machina in the middle of the film  honestly the visuals of this scene were stunning  it also introduced major plot holes for every other star wars film      honestly even if we pretend this wasnt a star wars film the movie was awful  characters make arbitrarily stupid decisions that arent particularly in character the humor mostly misses the plot is arbitrary and uninteresting and the new characters are boring and unchanged throughout the film  there is hardly anything redeeming about this besides the visuals      i genuinely left the theater upset after having seen this film  it is hard to imagine it being worse than what it ended up being  it is insane to me that the socalled critics have given this film a favorable score
Dec 24 2019,positive,it was a somewhat refreshing take on star wars but the movie goes nowhere exciting and leaves the audience wondering what the point was that being said it was a better film than the rise of skywalker
Dec 24 2019,positive,almost perfect johnson really put his stamp on star wars with a tightly woven narrative and unexpected turns it feels good to be surprised by star wars again there are only three flaws with this story canto bight drags the scene with leia flying through space like marry poppins is truly awkward and rose destroying finns sacrifice one more run at the script to fix these moments and this film would be on par with empire
Dec 24 2019,negative,a canonical abomination in the then longest film in the saga where little is accomplished for the new cast and the memory of the old is firmly stomped on with worldbreaking logic dull performances low energy and an overall narrative that is neither justified or engaging at all by far the slowest two and a half hours in star wars
Dec 24 2019,negative,this is an overpowered movie done wrong rey has no weaknesses and has no risk of ever being beaten the movie focuses too much on nostalgia from the more successful original trilogy
Dec 24 2019,negative,the movie which killed star wars i would rate zero if i could horrible
Dec 24 2019,positive,rain johnson manages to honour everything star wars is whilst adding even more depth to the characters and their relationships a welcome change from the usual formula
Dec 24 2019,negative,just ruined everyting we know about the traditional lore
Dec 24 2019,negative,this movie has some great ideas but fails to execute them
Dec 24 2019,negative,this film was not only bad it completely ruined the sequel trilogy
Dec 24 2019,positive,this is a breath of fresh air in the star wars franchise in the 21st century even though it can do without a certain storyline that wasnt completely necessary or as interesting as the main one
Dec 24 2019,negative,the worst star wars ever  subvert expectation    i didnt expect that it was so bad
Dec 24 2019,negative,wow are the critics out of touch  the humour is lackluster the chase scenes far too cgi based the characters out of character
Dec 24 2019,positive,the smartest most deeply felt star wars film ever made challenging audiences emotions and basic thoughts and feelings respects the symbolism and myth of the genre innovative fresh caring and clever each character and plot point carefully thought out and clearly planned reinvigorated my love of star wars and made me so proud to be among the fandom
Dec 24 2019,positive,i like star wars a lot and dont mind this trilogy in fact i really like episode 7 this movie was very cheesy at times however for the most part i did not mind that because to me a star wars movie is a bit cheesy it also did not seem like it fit well with how the first movie in this trilogy set up the series to go there were weird decisions that were made that did not benefit the plot as well as questions that fans were asking from the first one episode 7 that were not answered hopefully this will be fixed when episode 9 comes out
Dec 24 2019,positive,the theme of learning from ones failures and rising above them persists throughout the whole film its a mythic tale about being true to yourself and a cautionary tale about living in the past our heros come out of this movie knowing that there is hope and that selflessness is stronger than anything its also one of the strongest entrys in the star wars cannon on a visual level the fandoms dialogue around this movie truly cloud its merits which is a shame but understandable considering everyone personal expectations built up for their favorite characters beforehand
Dec 24 2019,negative,this movie ruined star wars for me
Dec 24 2019,positive,i actually enjoyed this movie sure there are some stupid scenes were they went for laughs such as when luke threw the lightsaber and the casino scene but other then that i enjoyed it the movie had many cool scenes such as the throne room and the part were finn fights phasma overall i had a fun time watching this movie
Dec 24 2019,negative,as a star wars fan from the beginning i thought the plot was lacking direction and especially didnt like the characterization the depiction of luke skywalker was not accurate to the franchise the ultimate hero who was going to sacrifice himself to save his father now has a momentary contemplation of killing his nephew
Dec 24 2019,positive,rian johnsons brilliance revives this franchise for me this movie truly made me love star wars with every fiber of my being visually stunning and intimate this movie made me feel like a true star wars movie should hopeful and like i was a part of something bigger than myself packed full with symbolism and parallels indepth character development and a moral to this story that resonates with people of all walks of life anyone can be a hero   i cant say enough about this film every time i watch it i find something new that i didnt notice before that enhances the story its tragic that some fans dont appreciate this movie for the creative genius it is
Dec 24 2019,negative,not just a bad star wars movie its a bad movie period the plot was terrible and all over the place most of the movie felt like a pointless money grab by disney this whole film is a major plot hole
Dec 24 2019,negative,hated everything about this movie almost single handedly killed my love of star wars
Dec 24 2019,negative,as a stand alone movie its boring with some exciting scenes when looked at as a part of the star wars saga its complete garbage its clear that rian johnson is not a star wars fan and his only goal was subverting expectations
Dec 24 2019,negative,this movie had horrible writing and ruined the potential of the overall story of the sequel trilogy
Dec 24 2019,positive,brilliant follow up to force awakens although key characters like finn and chewbacca feel somewhat sidelined
Dec 24 2019,positive,the best movie of the trilogy ryan johnson showed us kylo crumbling soul rays devotion beautiful carrie fisher the relationship between rey and kylo becomes deeper more complex more attractive he showed us raylo and the chance that ray could save kylos soul would bring him back to the light 9th killed all
Dec 24 2019,negative,this is a alright movie at best but a horrible star wars movie at its worse it lacks respect for rules and characters essential to telling a star wars story it may be time for a change in this predictable format but it should not have been done like this
Dec 24 2019,positive,the last jedi is a fantastic film i loved him with all my heart thanks rian johnson
Dec 24 2019,negative,it was as if the director didnt know anything about the characters luke skywalker never would have thrown the lightsaber over his shoulder and he sure as hell would not have given up on ben solo that easily the horrible character development it was as if the director didnt even read anything about what was built up until this point you can skip this movie and the skywalker saga increases ten fold its not about catering to fans its about the director not knowing anything about this universe
Dec 24 2019,positive,this was beautiful   bold and fresh ideas that mightve repelled the conservative part of sw auditory but im sure about 10 years later itll be recognized as an iconic star wars film on the same level as empire strikes back
Dec 24 2019,negative,total mess do not watch it
Dec 24 2019,negative,awful interpretation of the universe with pointless plots unreal characters and a message that was meant to tell the viewer that everything you love about star wars means nothing absolute trash as a story
Dec 24 2019,positive,the only bad thing about this movie is that it made me think the rest of the trilogy would be good
Dec 24 2019,negative,i remember leaving the theater absolutely disgusted by this abomination i have never been more insulted than that day its a giant f you to star wars fans that grew up with luke skywalker only its wrapped in the prettiest paper ever so it doesnt seem that way im sure rian johnson could make a great and original movie but this is a sequel trilogy the story has already been laid out for youi get his idea of not giving audiences what they want and critics loved it than you completely miss the point of star wars
Dec 24 2019,negative,still the worst star wars movie this is some weird bizarro version of that every 30 min battlestar episode which is infinitely better there are some great ideas here but they dont land with the errol flynnkurosawaman with no name heroes journey  space fantasy loving original star wars fan base and for good reason having said that the direction is good the visuals are stunning  the score is amazing and the cast and acting are phenomenal its the story the story is weak the pacing is bizarre the message is overly heavy handed and final which makes no sense because this is supposed to be a middle chapter not an ending this movie set up every problem in the next one but at least the next one managed to be fun to watch while the nonsense unfolds nonsense that is the inevitable direct  result of the choices made in writing this poorly thought out link in a chain i have no problem with the people who love it for its own sake it has some things in it that are fun and decent ideas it just doesnt do it for me as a star wars you can make a great electric minivan but dont sell it to me as the next mustang
Dec 24 2019,negative,world breaking and full of plot holes
Dec 24 2019,negative,my expectations that this would be a good movie were subverted
Dec 24 2019,negative,worst movie in the franchise by far
Dec 24 2019,negative,tlj is definitely ambitiousjust in the wrong ways this movie failed to make any of the villains a serious threat if not ignored or killed off the casino planet was a complete waste of time and del toros character completely useless i like some of the stuff with luke luke fighting the false perception the galaxy has of him hate the saber throw and hate the fact he was killed off in the second film
Dec 24 2019,negative,only rivaled in its poor execution by spiderman 3 both of which i have only watched once because to me they are both such selfish diversions by their creators that there is just no room for a fan  to me its as if the creators sought to remove the formula and to drive away from the direction of the overarching story to create their own with their own rules  which is why rian should never touch another property make your own next time
Dec 24 2019,positive,pretty great i look forward to more rian johnson sw f the rj haters
Dec 24 2019,positive,while there are scenes and characters in this movie that made little to no sense the code breaker definitely rose and holdo to an extent there are still many great moments in this film that are visually stunning and add more depth to the star wars cannon the performances are great all around and the rey luke and kylo scenes are well done this film takes risks that backfire but some of them stick a perfect landing
Dec 24 2019,negative,did the director ever watch a star wars movie before making this mess
Dec 24 2019,positive,i have mixed feelings about this movie my first reaction was oh wow what a movie but then i saw many reviews from some reviewers and i changed my opinion but i think it is a good movie not the best one of the saga of course but yeah go watch it if you want to
Dec 24 2019,neutral,a divisive film for me at parts i feel it laughs at the unoriginality of episode vii and attempts to distance itself from it with curve balls such as snokes fate other times it seems to be intent on copying episode v like how vii copied iv such as again having similar locations and themes to v the film has some intense action scenes and great humour which gives it great moments but this is offset by by a slow space chase weird forcesensitive leia and a pointless coup detait that really goes nowhere the film is an infusion of brilliance and sheer incredulity but it is undoubtedly the best in the awful sequel trilogy
Dec 24 2019,positive,a character development a beautiful story and walked out of the theater feeling hopeful like anyone could be special
Dec 24 2019,positive,it is my least favorite of all star wars movies
Dec 24 2019,negative,a complete mess  movies are supposed to be consistent with their established universes and this movie is not  key plot points and the style of this movie do not work within the star wars universe  illogically changing an established character luke did not work  dropping the loose ends from the first part of the trilogy and leaving nothing for the third part were bold decisions that again did not work    this movie has no redeeming value as part of the skywalker saga and minimal value as a standalone film
Dec 24 2019,positive,brave to expand the universe misunderstood for having a complex script with a lot of symbology
Dec 24 2019,negative,trash from start to finish
Dec 24 2019,negative,trash unpredictable does not make it a good movie it was a slap to the face of every true star wars fans
Dec 24 2019,negative,its just not star wars and made it hard for its sequel to succeed it also has a negative affect on solo if you thought the prequels were bad this is just a whole new level of bad the comedy makes jar jar look good if only jj abrams did the whole trilogy imagine what it could have become
Dec 24 2019,negative,ruins much of the story the previous movie set out to tell
Dec 24 2019,positive,i absolutely lived it i feel like people are review bombing this film and review bombing is bs this film amazing and a great conclusion to the saga
Dec 23 2019,positive,well put together challenging i loved the most surprising reveal in the film i loved how it setup the characters to go beyond what star wars has been before
Dec 23 2019,positive,an almost perfect star wars film that is only second best to empire and rotj due to its deep understanding of the lessons of not only those films but the prequels as well
Dec 23 2019,negative,no coherent plot at all random characters made no sense in the universe it was set it jumbled story line might have been worse than the happening
Dec 23 2019,neutral,now that rise of skywalker is out its even worse than before
Dec 23 2019,negative,it ranks dead last on my list of star wars movies its visually impressive and has some fun parts but the story and characters didnt fit the star wars universe
Dec 23 2019,neutral,in real time there were scenes and storylines that were very cringe worthy but i tried to ignore the more i saw the film the more obvious those scenes stood out as huge mistakes and really too away from the film the movie looked great but sorry was lacking
Dec 23 2019,positive,now that the newest and final story is out i have a newfound respect and love for this film it is the only film in the newest trilogy with new stories and ideas which could have ushered in a great and meaningful story end with actual growth the political slight against the last jedi by the rise of skywalker is one of the most blatant cases of apologetic fan service by a major corporation to the nerd opiate instead of letting the franchise like many before finish with the honor of making hard choices good or bad
Dec 23 2019,positive,this is a star wars film with something to say at times its perhaps a bit too much to say like the lessons on war profiteers that feel out of place in the film but generally the message it has about the nature of the force and balance is a nice addition to the mythos of the star wars franchise
Dec 23 2019,positive,hindsight is 2020 having now seen the epic conclusion to the skywalker saga i can safety say that this film is alright  its beautifully shot and well acted but ros wouldnt have its problems if it didnt have to fix all the wrong doings of this film serviceable narrative nothing more
Dec 23 2019,negative,defies everything you know about star wars and disrespects its legacy worst star wars movie such a travesty this movie even got made
Dec 23 2019,negative,i dont know what happened with this one
Dec 23 2019,negative,the worst film ive ever seen ever dont listen to the shitty critics who call this their job avoid it and pretend it never happened and isnt part of of the sw universe
Dec 23 2019,positive,best of the new trilogy and one of the best star wars movies all time
Dec 23 2019,negative,a disgrace to all of star wars
Dec 23 2019,negative,the force awakens creates potential with interesting characters lore and mystery but rian johnson took over with the last jedi and it falls flat there is no substance to this movie its boring and dumb
Dec 23 2019,negative,absolutely terrible
Dec 23 2019,negative,this fucking awful mess broke canon had a plot that made no sense angered fans yet has a 91 from critics  seems like payola
Dec 23 2019,negative,honestly the worst film created it insults the fans and the creators its a bad take on what should of been a great film does it have its okay moments yes but as a whole the movie flops
Dec 23 2019,negative,it had everything to be great but they dropped it    edit this movie has a lot of people rating as a great movie due mainly to its themes a great movie is not only themes and the themes showed here were poorly executed it is a beatiful movie and thats it it is a superficial movie star wars deserved more at least this movie helped me to stop caring about star wars rise of skywalker was the last thing i watched with care tried to watch mandalorian couldnt pass the second episode and just gave up
Dec 23 2019,positive,this movie is a masterpiece period
Dec 23 2019,negative,i can say a lot of it was well made i loved the set up of the connection between rey and kylo and the fight in snokes chamber was awesome the planet at the end was cool luke was ruined finn went from a character i really liked to an annoying character to me because he was so tied to rose who is the absolute worst character in star wars everything she does literally leads to failure and she is treated as a moral superior character who is always right the entire plot line of roses arc is dumb they are able to fly off the ship undetected wait why dont they just fly people off one at a time in that exact same way they happen to go to a planet and their plot is foiled by a parking ticket they happen to run into a different guy who just also happens to be skilled enough to accomplish this task in prison and that guy happens to be able to escape prison at any time he just coincidentally waited for them to be there she has that god awful line where finn says at least its all been worth it cause they freed the horse things and she goes no reaches up and undoes the saddle of the last animal and says now it was worth it the hacker they get betrays them and gets a ton of resistance member killed failure in a movie is awesome but not placing any blame on rose was awful then she is suddenly one of the top members of the resistance and a pilot and crashes into finn nearly killing them both in order to say her line about winning by protecting what we love not destroying what we hate and then surprise kissing finn absolutely terrible character poe has a really cool arc of being a hot head and needing to learn that there is a time to wait and be patient and its executed awesomely by having him send off a mission that leads to deaths and failure but the reason he fails is cause the people in charge wont tell him there plan for absolutely no reason is awful and then in the situation where the resistance is about to be wiped out he decides that is the moment not to put it all on the line terrible killing off snoke with no explanation of who he was and also saying rey was a nobody was kinda cool and good to not follow the same sorts of reveals that are in empire but what jj does in 9 is much better then there is the issue of this being the middle of a trilogy that is supposed to set up an episode 9 finale it discards all of 7s ideas but sure i could go with that but it also leaves the most bare of set ups you can imagine so episode 9 has to spend half the movie setting up the finale in order to execute the finale if not for solo and maybe episode 2 this would be the absolute worst movie in the star wars universe even though it is better made than all the prequels because its storyline is a mess i love rian johnson and looper was absolutely awesome this was bad
Dec 23 2019,positive,perfection i loved it
Dec 23 2019,negative,horrible continuity bad characterisation highly wouldnt recommend
Dec 23 2019,negative,does not hold true to the star wars story and world that mixed in with all the poor character arcs pathetic story line made tlj one of the biggest missed opportunities of all time
Dec 23 2019,negative,so i recently went back to watch it today actually as we are doing a family marathon to get ready for rise of skywalker  this film is so much worse than i had remembered and thats saying something  worst in the franchise  worse than the 1978 holiday special
Dec 23 2019,negative,this is the most dumpster fire of a star wars film as we have ever gotten this films abysmal performance as the middle child of the new trilogy goes out of its way to ruin star wars as a whole   from start to finish  a complete failure
Dec 23 2019,negative,too many subplots and needless characters  lacks the allure of the original 3 movies  whatever happened to less is more
Dec 23 2019,negative,at least twice as worse as the force awakens  it deviates too much from from the original trilogy
Dec 23 2019,negative,great action movie terrible star wars movie
Dec 23 2019,negative,literally nothing good in or around this movie total waste of time and money
Dec 23 2019,negative,every other star wars movie and show has added lore and story line last jedi failed at doing that instead johnson sought to tear down what star wars has always been about and disregard lore and canon in many cases and most importantly this film barely advanced the story of the sequel trilogy
Dec 23 2019,positive,really fun its controls the pace well its funny and action packed i liked it a lot
Dec 23 2019,positive,i am here to correct the injustice of the 43 score its ridiculous there are so many great things about this movie just see it
Dec 23 2019,negative,it was a terribly done movie the plot of the movie was disjointed it had too many characters with not enough time to make us care about them it had meaningless scenes for what i can only imagine was to increase the length of the movie because it did little to nothing to add to the story it made massive and controversial decisions to an established universe with rules and laws for what i can only assume was the sake of something fresh and new    overall it had poor pacing a boring storyline scrapped the story of the intro movie added too many characters and explained nothing about them it was like the writingdirection of this movie was focused on hating star wars and then blaming the fans when it sucked
Dec 23 2019,positive,i generally enjoy all star wars i took this with a grain of salt and found it to be a decent movie
Dec 23 2019,negative,if i could give this film 0 stars i would i didnt truly realize how terrible of a movie this is until i saw the rise of skywalker having to correct all of its mistakes 91 is nonsense
Dec 23 2019,negative,so much of this movie goes against what star wars is admiral holdo shouldve been admiral ackbar and her whole i wont tell you the plan because uhhhhh deal simply did not make sense i was a stagnant and frankly boring set of scenes that had so many holes in the plot you have a ship half the size of the death star and you only send 3 tie fighters at these frigates who have no fuelcmon the writing for luke absolutely goes against all that he stood for and honestly it renders the original trilogy pointless dont even get me started on roseshes a fun character but the canto bight lines are about as good as anakin skywalker talking about how much he hates sand all in all not a good watch and not a good movie rian johnson does not understand the lore of star wars and is simply helping disney push a commercial driven agenda
Dec 23 2019,negative,im a huge fan of star wars unfortunately this is probably the worse of the series this has been such a waste of my time and money please save yourself and wait until it comes out on netflox or just dont watch it
Dec 23 2019,negative,this is the kind of movie you get when the person in charge doesnt understand the brand of star wars  this movie will be ignored by the fan base as a random spin off
Dec 23 2019,positive,this movie was amazing i know theres a small vocal group of fans that dont like this because of the choices that were made in the movie but i personally really enjoyed all the decisions that were made especially when it comes to fan favorite luke skywalker the writing for this movie is absolutely superb the amount of depth and symbolism in almost all of the scenes is absolutely revolutionary in terms of a star wars flick theres one scene that seems a little superflous but i still enjoyed it i think rian johnson has set up a film that i inspires hope and kind of cleans the slate allowing room for more than just legacy characters to be strong force users and main players in the galaxy
Dec 23 2019,negative,this movie was brutal and im still trying to erase this from my head so many things brokenwrong with it i think a solo movie of jar jar binks would rate as low as this one
Dec 23 2019,negative,this movie is not an star wars movie the director wanted to make something new and revolutionary but the lack  talent to get there will make this movie just something i want to forget
Dec 23 2019,positive,easily the best star wars movie the story is rich with many rememberable characters there are a million twists in the movie which make you wonder how it still stays on the same topic but magically it does the twists are all also so surprising that its crazy eventful and edge of your seat cheering
Dec 23 2019,negative,this is the biggest middle finger to the legendary stories and heroes of sw it feels purposely made to destroy everything that made us care about sw cant say enough bad things about this movie as theres so much said already but it should be even lower on the rotten score
Dec 23 2019,negative,just a total swing and a miss didnt like the direction this film took the series and i didnt care for the new characters
Dec 23 2019,positive,a mixed bag rey kylo and luke are great but everything with rose is terrible although i think in the end it works pretty well
Dec 23 2019,negative,this was the worst movie i have ever seen in my life
Dec 23 2019,negative,it was terrible it completely ruined star wars worst movie ive ever seen
Dec 23 2019,negative,this has tremendous potential and just ignored the plot lines of the previous movies its like the director has his own agenda and failed miserably
Dec 23 2019,positive,the last jedi opts to drop everything star wars to let the past die it is entertaining and visually stunning but fails to connect with the feel of star wars  everything from the slaphappy humor to lukes treatment felt unnatural the last jedi also toys with new powers and maneuvers in a way that seem great but these ultimately setup future star wars installments for failure the most important being the holdo maneuver this act was visually stunning and left me in awe but it breaks precedent set down before  rey and kylos connection is ultimately my favorite part of the last jedi the two are like the opposite sides of a coin different in many ways but still one still connected  the last jedi is fun but i left feeling unfulfilled and questioning many of the goofy moments maybe this is due to my lacking of that blue milk luke enjoys so much
Dec 23 2019,neutral,slow and then the light speed killer move that just ruins all of star wars
Dec 23 2019,negative,absolutely terrible movie by far the worst star wars movie including solo the director took all the character development and star wars canon and simply flushed it all down the drain such a sad outcome for a highly cherished and well developed franchise
Dec 23 2019,positive,say what you want about star wars episode 8 but this is one of the best star wars movies ever since the original i know there are some scenes like the canto casino side mission that should have been removed not to mention the new characters like amilyn holdo were a pain to watch as for rose tico she was ok but she could have been written better for her the good parts of this movie was the musical score the visual effects yodas reappearance and the emotional death of luke skywalker overall the last jedi upholds the sequel trilogy into new heights
Dec 23 2019,negative,the way last jedi treated luke was very disappointing   plus the whole casino planet reys parents not mattering hyperspace suicide bomber not sharing escape plan etc made for a very weak plot
Dec 23 2019,negative,terrible luke skywalker story arc  half the movie seemed liked filler and was unecessary and all the build up from episode 7 was for not
Dec 23 2019,negative,i dont really recomend it kylo ren was amazing though he gets 5 stars i get critics confliction i saw it out of desire to finish the saga in cinemas for two hours i was bored but the last 1020 minutes were ok whoever did that part  good job but it doesnt redeem wanting to walk out from boredom earlier i loved the prequels tv shows  games etc not a huge fan of the new series but i remember people not liking the prequels and how that annoyed me so of you enjoyed the new stuff ie last jedigo see it if not spend your life time more wisely  maybe im the wrong era now to be interested in star wars   if you liked the last jediyou will enjoy it
Dec 23 2019,negative,incoherent bad script bad jokes
Dec 23 2019,negative,never explained why the general doesnt explain the plan and only gets this man stars because of an ok ending
Dec 23 2019,negative,if i had rated this movie two years ago i wouldve given it 3 stars after tros this movie has no place to stand in the sequel trilogy
Dec 23 2019,negative,this movie takes a huge dump on luke skywalker and years of established lore
Dec 23 2019,negative,there were many things wrong with the movie but it mainly comes down to a bad story this installment may have killed the trilogy the main issue is that the bad guysforce are not scary at all they are either having emotional swings or the butt end of jokes this is not the empire of old
Dec 23 2019,positive,good movie because the relationship between rey and ben is amazing
Dec 23 2019,negative,the main space saga of cinema has always been a work of rather conservative  all episodes are more or less sustained in the same manner so it was before the release of ryan johnsons picture the eighth episode is a look at the canon through the prism of postmodern so to speak star wars for millennials  with a ton of inappropriate humor undisguised fanservice brazen play on nostalgia disgustingly prescribed characters and dull narrative  and all this because of the unsuccessful plot because the production here is beautiful the visual is juicy and the actors work at the limit of their capabilities a few of the pros and break into pieces about the horrible script of the backbone forcing us to count down the minutes until the end most would have ended this mess
Dec 23 2019,negative,the worst star wars movie ever made  plot was terrible and boring  so many twists that just come out of nowhere and for really no reason there isnt enough time for me to explain everything i hated about this movie  i heard rian johnson will do another trilogy and i will pass on seeing that  i hope disney comes to its senses and gets rid of rj  this movie is just so bad  everything
Dec 23 2019,negative,3 rly bad stroy lines
Dec 23 2019,neutral,it has extremely good moments but it cannot get through bad plot choices annoying characters and the general feeling that this movie had all the ingredients for being extremely good and failed spectacularly in the cooking
Dec 23 2019,neutral,so boring and disappointing
Dec 23 2019,negative,it is awful ending of jedi saga  loss of time
Dec 23 2019,negative,boring long subplot that ends up being completely pointless too damn many stupid jokes even during serious moments new unnecessary characters in place of old beloved ones artificial drama to extend the running time utter destruction of what was supposed to be one of the strongest characters in the sw universe killing off of the main villain without ever explaining what he was all about and leia flying through space perfect example of why no one should listen to movie critics
Dec 23 2019,negative,a disappointing setback in the star wars sequels
Dec 23 2019,negative,most probably the worst film of star wars
Dec 23 2019,negative,horrible movie  plot didnt make any sense dialog was lacking no explanation of anything  how and why did disney release this as is  and now the director is getting 3 more movies  no thank you  this movie is the reason we will not pay to see these movies in the theater anymore
Dec 23 2019,positive,its not great its not horrible
Dec 23 2019,positive,this was a lit ass movie  what all star wars movies wish to be
Dec 23 2019,negative,a hideous steaming pile of youknowwhat rian johnson nearly destroyed the legacy of star wars it was so sloppy and poorly conceived i am beside myself with disappointment and bewilderment at the critical acclaim this terrible movie received i wil likely boycott johnson from now on for his reckless destruction of a rich set of stories spanning 4 decades his attempts to subvert expectations are neither clever nor well crafted
Dec 23 2019,negative,i couldnt go below half a star by far the worst movie in the the star wars universe rian johnson should never have been given the opportunity to touch a star wars movie jj abrams gave him so much to work with from the force awakens and rian hardly used any of it and what he did use he screwed it up in the worst possible way sad that disney allowed such a poorly written story
Dec 23 2019,negative,this movie was garbage  it was a complete betrayal to the characters and fans  the pacing was messed up  all of the scenes fell short in excitement and exposition  shame on disney for allowing this movie to be released
Dec 23 2019,negative,the worst movie i had ever seen no plot completely disregards all the movies before it and all star wars lore if you want to see this movie wait for it to come out on vcr
Dec 23 2019,negative,can i leave zero stars this movie is a disgrace such a shame johnson made knives out which i really enjoyed this was a train wreck 
Dec 23 2019,negative,if you like a slow moving horribly paced space ship chase this film is for you unfortunately thats not the star wars i think many fans were looking for so many of the choices made in this film were just poor  from lukes character choices finn and roses pointless subplot flying leia to completely dismantling the story arch started by jj abrams this film completely missed the mark
Dec 23 2019,negative,with tros in we can see more clearly how tlj really ruined the whole trilogy    this movie destroys every lead from tfa ruins both the old characters as the new one and complicate things to an absurd level for ep9 which is miraculously somewhat saved at the last moment    tlj works ok as a standalone movie but not as the middle act of a trilogy let alone as part of the saga
Dec 23 2019,negative,why did you do that to luke
Dec 23 2019,positive,a triumph in both spectacle and characterdriven story telling this film succeeds in what disney is all about the downtrodden the unnoticed the nobody and the spark that can exist in anyone who confronts their fears to achieve something extraordinary
Dec 23 2019,negative,thought this movie was awful when it came out  humor was more appropriate for spaceballs than star wars  the overarching plot was awful  the bombing raid jumped the shark which is hard to do because in the end star wars is a kids filmcomic bookspace opera not grounded in science or reality  rose the character not the actress was horribly developed and the chemistry between her and fin was worse than between anakin and padme in the prequels  in contrast finn and rey had a great chemistry together in tfa      watched last jedi the week before release of ros and had to stop watching it was so dreadful  but then i watched it again after watching ros  played it for the kids but fast forwarded through anything not involving the jedi or the force as well as lukes milk scene and low and behold i really liked it  the scenes involving luke rey snoke ren and yoda were all really interesting  was it how i would have portrayed it  no  but it was really interesting  it added a depth to the overall story  even the lea poppins scene became more bearable in the context of establishing the skywalkers are really strong in the force      cut out an hour of this film remove the pointless space battles and chase  and the canto scenes and there is a really interesting movie in there that advances the overarching skywalker saga in an unexpected but intriguing way    those force related scenes in last jedi really work in light of what ros does    rian did some really interesting things in this film  but then he did some really brutally bad showgirlscats level misfires  he like lucas before him would have benefited from a strong editing team    there is a really good movie in last jedi disney  give it to filoni to sort out in a special edition version
Dec 23 2019,negative,the cast did the best they could with a garbage script that ignores the star wars universes logic for the sake of shock value nobody has ever run out of fuel in the history of star wars until its needed to show the resistance is in a bad way truly sad for mark hamill not having a chance to really show us the luke skywalker we all know he would have actually been this would have been a fine movie as a stand alone in a universe rian johnson created but killing the past of star wars to try to show the strength of these new heroes isnt good screenwriting its just lazy and shocking for the sake of shocking as far as i am concerned the star wars universe ended after the return of the jedi which is sad because i thought the force awakens was good a nice little lovenote to the old series even if a bit redundant
Dec 23 2019,positive,i loved this movie  i know it gets a lot of flak but honestly i think its pretty unjust  this movie even works well standalone
Dec 23 2019,negative,this is a bullshit about luke skywalker or  i called him jake
Dec 23 2019,negative,what did i just see terrible movie deviates from force awaken way too much and okay visuals terrible story too did leia just fly through space using the force even with cgi she looked like she was on a wire or casper the ghost one alright saber fight and the rest can be forgotten
Dec 23 2019,negative,the acting was good and the cinematography phenomenal but i just cant believe this script got the pass the last jedi is an absolute train wreck and pretty much derailed the whole disney trilogy and almost any chance of the story coming to a satisfying conclusion     throughout watching this it became clear that disney had no through line for their trilogy and were basically passing around the episodes like a mad gab how could they not have outlined the entire trilogy before filming any of them seems like a massive mistake which im sure theyre kicking themselves now for filmmakers and studios please learn from this disaster if youre going to finish a saga and be the 8th film in a 9 film epic you do have to think about all that came before and plan appropriately     it seemed like rian johnson just totally went his own way and ignored all the potential setups offered by the force awakens which could work for a one off but not something this tied to a story this big with so much source material and to have luke skywalker in a film after all these years and not even participate in a real lightsaber battle is unforgivable i understand the interesting choice to have him become a bitter hermit but he does change by the end and seeing him kick butt in real was such a missed opportunity     overall this is not a terrible movie but i believe it is a terrible movie for this saga and doesnt seem to fit at all with the others the last jedi made me not care about what happens next and being a life long star wars fan that is a huge feat
Dec 23 2019,negative,sorry no history why rose
Dec 23 2019,positive,with the abundance of bad choices the movie offers from its characters the movie makes up for them with the mythos of the force and the chemistry between rey and luke as well as good acting from mark hamill though this installment is a little disjointed between many parts the chemistry music action and performances still offer some reasons to see this installment
Dec 23 2019,positive,dont listen to the fanboys who cant believe someone would dare to do something different with their precious mythology  tlj is probably the best of the new trilogy although ill have to watch tros again after it has sunk in  the disillusionment of luke makes so much sense and is handled well  his epic ending worthy of his legacy  and the muchmaligned leia moment is a cool reminder that she is after all a skywalker  beyond that i loved the development of the relationship between rey and kylo which serves as a foundation for what ultimately comes in tros  great stuff  since the force awakens had to be almost a reboot as much as a new movie the trilogy really needed a movie to establish itself as a work unto itself and tlj delivers
Dec 23 2019,negative,worst star wars movie ever made unimaginative terrible plot beloved characters from prior movies were completely destroyed in this movie disney goofed big time in switching directors midseries absolutely nonsensical decision that will have negative ramifications for star wars movies for years to come
Dec 23 2019,positive,i would have loved to have seen more of this in episode 3 but we dont get nice things
Dec 23 2019,negative,just terrible nothing but insulting legacy characters and cheap fan service
Dec 23 2019,positive,great job developing the characters  kylo ren  rae and the plot thickened      this was a great movie great plotstory excitement imagery  fantastic characters great actors wonderful plot
Dec 23 2019,positive,over hated but not worth the 91 rotten tomatoes
Dec 23 2019,positive,masterpiece thank you rian johnson
Dec 22 2019,negative,quite possibly the most disappointing movie in history      this movie would have been great as a standaloneyou cant disrespect the plot points of a franchise that the fans have clearly emotionally invested in and have made clear they hold dear    you also dont accuse a fan base of some sort of cultural bias because they dont enjoy your film
Dec 22 2019,negative,so much crap shit and other ugly things that rian johnson did to star wars
Dec 22 2019,negative,garbage worse every time that ive watched
Dec 22 2019,negative,just a bad film way to long and story was not evey there  chi was good but who cares
Dec 22 2019,negative,this flick was a cash grab of a train wreck almost as bad as the prequels but terrible enough to warrant not wanting to see and skipping out on solo still on the fence whether to even bother with ros tlj really cemented the tarnishing of this franchises legacy what a garbage dump of a throw away flick and such a wasted opportunity there was potential for this trilogy to have been a masterpiece even with a directorwriters lack of creativity and imagination there was such a wealth of material to pool from that any hollywood hack should have been able to come up with something decent the plots in fan made youtube videos are better oh well at least we have the rare fluke that is rogue one star wars is dead
Dec 22 2019,negative,johnson ruined this trilogy thankfully jj was able to save some of our beloved characters in ros
Dec 22 2019,positive,i was fine with most of the stuff johnson did that most found controversial loved the movie besides a few moments
Dec 22 2019,negative,now that the saga is complete tlj is clearly the worst movie in the trilogy  it suffers from a devotion not to fanservice but intentional fan disservice  the abandoning of relationships and continuity elements from the first movie plus blatant character assassination and negligence around real world events effect on the films carrie fishers passing make this movie feel like a hole in the series  it feels like a side story and not a main plot aspect of the trilogy
Dec 22 2019,negative,subverting expectations just to do it doesnt mean its a good story or a groundbreaking way to make a popcorn see i can do it too
Dec 22 2019,neutral,it could have been a great movie if rian johnson just didnt try to redefine luke so much seriously force awakens hes on a journey then just becomes a hermit made no sense whatsoever  the casuals ie critics dont get it
Dec 22 2019,negative,worst movie in the saga
Dec 22 2019,negative,rians attempt to turn the essence of a star wars movie on its head and then quickly turn tail at the end and make it a star wars movie after all has failed and miserably what a waste they should have had jj abrams continue with is epic star wars saga than give it to this other brick of a director not recommended
Dec 22 2019,negative,the disrespect to the character of luke skywalker is unforgivable i will never watch this movie ever again disney star wars is not real star wars
Dec 22 2019,negative, it didnt have to be like this none of it so many weird choices watch the documentary the director and the jedi its in the bonus features when you buy it its better than the movie its beautifully shot and paints a picture of a director that wasnt ready i feel bad for rain johnson but he should have had help being a big fan of the series and a director wasnt enough
Dec 22 2019,negative,complete waste of my time continuously let down
Dec 22 2019,positive,2nd only to empire strikes back wonderfully acted and character driven
Dec 22 2019,negative,the last jedi was derailed by the directors extremely disrespectful depiction of luke skywalker this movie should not be looked at as part of the star wars canon
Dec 22 2019,negative,beyond horrible  ruined star wars
Dec 22 2019,negative,rian johnson actually killed star wars like how do you manage to kill a franchise like star wars
Dec 22 2019,negative,the absolute murder of the caracter luke skywalker also this movie destoys the world
Dec 22 2019,negative,completely ruined star wars
Dec 22 2019,negative,79 series are total rubbish
Dec 22 2019,negative,too many pointless side plots and locations that didnt lead anywhere
Dec 22 2019,negative,there is no victory to be had in this joyless adventure   the best bit was the addition of the adorable little porgs which i can safely say were the only element to bring a smile to my face in this clunker
Dec 22 2019,neutral,a few strong scenes but a lot more pointless ones tried to subvert expectations for its own sake with no real plan blecch
Dec 22 2019,negative,i have no clue how this could be rated so high on the tomatometer  what a nightmare  watch it on netflixdisney etc but oh goodness 
Dec 22 2019,negative,awful plot terrible story the most predictable movie ive ever seen from the opening titles you can already tell the whole movie and let me tell you youll be 100 right about that story all the way through
Dec 22 2019,negative,embarassing plot set pieces and chatacters i am baffled that this movie came out
Dec 22 2019,negative,worst pile of nonsense i have ever seen as a star wars movie it broke my heart did not stay true to the luke skywalker character at all as a movie alone it was the longest slowest chase scene running on fumes in a galaxy that uses hyperspace casually people even leave the chase to go to a casino in another system and come back before the chase is over so lame almost felt like the director hated star wars and was mocking it for his own sad spiteful entertainment took weeks to recover my disappointment and luke will never get the story arc he deserves
Dec 22 2019,negative,it was fucking terrible
Dec 22 2019,positive,takes many creative risks which makes the movie interesting not all the risks pan out well but the ones that do are successfully interesting
Dec 22 2019,negative,this movie is so terrible that ros had to spend time correcting the mistakes made in this movie
Dec 22 2019,negative,complete trash that completely disregards the previous 7 films for trying to be unexpected
Dec 22 2019,negative,wtf did i just watch
Dec 22 2019,negative,rian johnsons entry in the sequel trilogy is so tonally offbase and throws away so much of what was set up both in the force awakens and the previous 6 movies  the comedy in this movie is so jarring and the story premise is so odd fuel has never been an issue in the star wars universe but suddenly it is  the movie contains pointless story lines canto bight throws away important characters admiral akbar introduces unnecessary new ones to drive conflict admiral holdo and illogically makes luke skywalker a whiny hermit instead of the everhopeful jedi he was in the original trilogy
Dec 22 2019,negative,destroyed old and new characters by not planning an overall story arc
Dec 22 2019,negative,the movie that ruined star wars if you want to know how to ruin the plot and characters already established in previous movie watch this movie it should also be called how to ruin a character that got popular i the previous movie and how to make a movie where 90 is pointless you can literally cut out 90 of this movie and get everything important  this is without a doubt the worst movie in the series
Dec 22 2019,negative,this movie is an insult to itself to the force awakens and the freaking prequels from boring story telling to bland characters and ridicules plot twists that will make you curse the ending of the previous movie and probably the whole existence of its sequel     congrats you killed star wars
Dec 22 2019,positive,wraps up the saga  gathers all the pieces and puts them in place a little corny but at least nothing is left hanging
Dec 22 2019,negative,this star wars movie is a joke there are so many bad moments and dialogue   adam driver and daisy ridley are doing a fine job but it cant save the movie  i am disappointed that rian johnson can man such a boring movie
Dec 22 2019,positive,pretty decent character building but not much of a storyline to go on
Dec 22 2019,negative,if you like movies that run your favorite characters in the ground this is the one for you
Dec 22 2019,negative,there were some good scenes but the bad scenes were so distracting that it ruined the movie overall rian johnsons decision to kill so many of jj abrams interesting plot details was a terrible decision reminiscent of a petulant child
Dec 22 2019,negative,this movie sucked point blank
Dec 22 2019,negative,rian johnson nearly ruins the star wars franchise with what will easily be remembered as the worst stat wars movie of alltime flying leia this movie is a bigger joke than the plot twist of luke skywalker being a dead beat on a deserted planet
Dec 22 2019,positive,the best movie in the sequel trilogy
Dec 22 2019,negative,the worst sw movie  so much to hate in it  the fans are right the critics dont love star wars  i just watched it again looking for any redeeming value there is none
Dec 22 2019,positive,i dont really get all the hate against the movie its fine a good time passer with enough memorable moments to keep you thirsty for more  its good
Dec 22 2019,positive,very very good first time i watched it wasnt the best the 8th time i watched it
Dec 22 2019,negative,i liked the first order version of bb8
Dec 22 2019,negative,never watch this film its genuinely terrible disney has killed star wars and make it a soulless entity for milking  only the first 6 movies are epic
Dec 22 2019,positive,this movie has definitely won the title of favourite star wars film for me the bold choices made by rian take you on a journey which leaves you gasping and on the edge of your seat the cinematography is absolutely beautifully done i love that the story shows you dont have to be someone to be able to make a difference you just need courage compassion and hope maybe leia was wrong when she said to obi wan that he was their only hope hope lives in everyone who dares to stand up to injustice we are the spark that will ignite the fire that will burn the first order down it only takes a spark and we can all be that spark   kelly marie trans portrayal of rose tico shows us this beautifully and by saving what we love we can build a better universe   this film gives me goosebumps everytime fueled by a fantastic score and camera work which just shines like only a johnson film could its damn near perfect   the critics are right its a gorgeous film to immerse yourself in
Dec 22 2019,positive,i thing its something new and give a heroic to an iconic hero
Dec 22 2019,positive,an amazing film that deepens the lore of the force and what star wars stands for
Dec 22 2019,negative,terrible  whyd they put in rian johnson to direct   side plots were useless  story was slow  character development lacking
Dec 22 2019,negative,worst star wars movie that was made lightsaber fight was really good other than that the movie was terrible never would watch it again
Dec 22 2019,negative,as an avid star wars fan  i strongly dislike this film  the last jedi shuts down narrative threads that were introduced in the force awakens in an attempt to subvert our expectations however  what it shouldve done is further establish said narrative threads instead of totally deviating from it it wouldve resulted in a much more compelling plot and in turn  a better movie
Dec 22 2019,negative,terrible in many ways this movie completely ruined what couldve been a great trilogy tfa was a good start and the tlj couldve built upon it but it fails in every single aspect
Dec 22 2019,negative,first time i ever came out of a star wars movie thinking i never want to see that again seemed to largely ignore the e7 plot long periods of the movie seemed utterly pointless and indulgent not sure what the critics saw in it but the fans have certainly spoken an abomination they have a massive repair job to do a lot of damage has been done
Dec 22 2019,positive,perfect movie i really love it mark hamill is perfect on this movie
Dec 22 2019,negative,the only redeeming factor of this movie is the amount of money disney pumped into it
Dec 22 2019,negative,bad bad movie killed most beloved character in star wars
Dec 22 2019,neutral,initially i liked it there are certain plotpoints that are very problematic though
Dec 22 2019,positive,refreshing change to star wars i wish that rian johnsons had directed this entire trilogy
Dec 22 2019,negative,the last jedi made no sense whatsoever because it absolutely trashed everything that jj set up in the force awakens storyline had no organization whatsoever i saw this in theater two years ago and i can see why people hated the film
Dec 22 2019,negative,possibly the worst movie ive ever seen luke skywalker is made a joke the opening scene is just plain dumb the ending is just plain dumb the movie is dumb i swear i have a better vocabulary than this but dumb is the perfect word to describe this movie
Dec 22 2019,negative,terrible movie terrible casting terrible side quests isolated characters sad that it exists
Dec 22 2019,negative,this movie was an inexcusable mess for the amount of source material it had to draw on and its ridiculous budget casting dialogue and story were incredibly ridiculous the casting proves itself a mistake twice over ive read more nuanced intelligent and cohesive stories and characters from 16yearold fanfiction writers please stop its dead
Dec 22 2019,negative,such a bad movie  they didnt get anything from the previous movies   it is hard to watch
Dec 22 2019,positive,great surprises fantastic story loved it
Dec 22 2019,positive,last jedi is a fantastic film  and one of the absolute best star wars entries  dont listen to everyone who picks on it they are wrong      im a lifelong star wars fan i saw the first film at age 9 more than five times in theaters then waited hours for empire and rotj when they came out  and the fans who rail on last jedi are overfocused on complex canon and insider stories they miss whats great about last jedi and why its a superb part of the series       in particular  1 luke and reys character development is perfect  lukes humanity and flaws make him a more believable compelling character hes no deity  he needs to overcome his fear and challenge and in lj he does   and reys parentage spoiler your parents were nobodies emphasizes that its her spirit and heart that distinguish her not her birth    2 the film is the most clever and wellconstructed of the star wars films the force isnt about floating rocks   everything you just said is wrong  its funny cute and filled with amazing suspenseful moments that explode with excitement    3 visually  its a masterpiece  white salt on red stone  this is gorgeous metaphorically appropriate the appearance of blood  and even better plays a key function in the storytelling device  footprints    theres even more that makes this movie great  porgs the music accents etc    run dont walk to watch and enjoy this one
Dec 22 2019,positive,plenty of problems for sure but the things this movie does right it does so right makes up for the slow canto bight section in my opinion
Dec 22 2019,negative,if i were to rank this on a list of star wars movies i would rank it last behind star wars the clone wars animated movie the show is great just the movie it doesnt even feel like a star wars movie disney needs to model star wars movies for the hardcore fans not for general audiences marvel has proven that if you cater to the hardcore people the general audience will jump on the bandwagon
Dec 22 2019,negative,despite the title and money disney has dumped into lucas arts this is unfortunately not a star wars movie it shows no love or value of any past movies stepping on everything we once held close it seems they forgot star wars is a shared universe and there were two trilogies leading up to this movie characters feel out of place gaining no real emotional attachment with the audience the amount of twists will leave you motion sick half way through nothing will surprise you because nothing is what it seems and their attampt a subverting our expectations feels like they blindfolded themselves and threw darts on a wall with a million plots
Dec 22 2019,positive,democratized the force
Dec 22 2019,negative,not very good for fans
Dec 22 2019,negative,rian johnson takes everything that was interesting about the force awakens and throws it out the window this movie is a disaster of epic proportions someone somewhere should have stopped it jj abrams does his best to repair the damage in the rise of skywalker but johnsons failure is an anchor that drags this whole trilogy down  its beyond frustrating that it got made
Dec 22 2019,positive,i actually feel kind of sorry for people who dont enjoy this movie guess they just need to let the past die kill it if you have to    joking aside this is easily the best star wars film since empire every other star wars film post empire tries too hard to please its rabid fans and instead of leaning into that like past creators rian johnson actually sets out to tell a cohesive and nuanced characterdriven story of course this franchise is meant for children so theres a fair bit of slapstick humor and product placement for disney to make moneybut the story itself is excellent im excited to see what johnson will do with his future star wars trilogy where his vision will be less hampered by the the chapters preceding and following it looking at you tfa and tros yikes
Dec 22 2019,negative,by far the worst star wars film ruins everything set up in force awakens
Dec 22 2019,negative,this movie can be skipped in the trilogy in my opinion r johnson completely destroyed this franchise
Dec 22 2019,positive,i can see some of the criticisms but the overall movie was great and set up the next one brilliantly
Dec 22 2019,positive,fantastic if you love star wars you will love this
Dec 22 2019,negative,not the real star wars story
Dec 22 2019,negative,this was a poor remake of star trek generations nothing original and done poorly
Dec 22 2019,negative,its my least favorite star wars movie after rogue one it was disappointing because rogue one is only passed by empire strikes back imo i really felt rogue one showed disney knew what they were doing i enjoyed the force awakens too and solo but tlj just crapped over everything i was expecting and hoping for rian johnson cared too much about subverting expectations than to give a story that made sense and would please the fans it seems like he wanted it to be shocking like empire but he failed
Dec 22 2019,negative,the last jedi while providing spectacular visuals that distract from a nonsensical plot fails at the single most important aspect a sequel should do treat its characters with respect
Dec 22 2019,positive,a flawed but overall great film that actually delivers a meaningful message to the viewer while actually being original  the hatred for this film is completely unwarranted  just about every nitpick people like to point out against the film could also be applied to the original trilogy
Dec 22 2019,negative,almost all of the dialogue is used to foreshadow the expectations of subsequent scenes in other words all dialogue progresses the plot exclusively instead of providing character depth and backstory or proving character development the first 45 minutes are a jumble of action scenes and missed humor or good childish kicks i understand that we are making movies to be accessible to kids too but i feel like that bottlenecks the potential depth and subtext of scenes that appeal to older audiences all in all star wars is dead to me my children will love it but i dont
Dec 22 2019,negative,worst star wars movie why they let this director ruin this amazing saga so disappointed and frustrated 
Dec 22 2019,positive,controversy aside this is a beautifully filmed and very original star wars film i am a bit irked by what they did to lukes character
Dec 22 2019,negative,do i really need to explain why this movie was awful
Dec 22 2019,positive,i enjoyed this onelot of action and a good story 
Dec 22 2019,positive,whenever someone on the internet talks about the last jedi 60 of the time they say negative things about it from the movie has no plot to they ruined luke skywalker i for one think the movie is good especially the final act the poetry of the concept of we will always learn from our pupils that is the true burden of a master is truly beautiful those little force conversations between rey and kylo ren taught luke how to project himself across the galaxy luke died a beautiful and powerful death
Dec 22 2019,positive,this film particularly does not have a correct rating people say you either love it or hate it however for me it withholds both elements which balance it out for me to just say it is a good movie when i first saw this movie i was a little disappointed however i left feeling shocked and a feeling i hadnt really felt after watching any other movie in theaters this movie is unique has its really high highs but also pretty low lows the biggest complaint i have is the subplot that takes up too much screen time and is a very painful segment of the movie however looking at this movie as a whole i enjoyed it and am at peace with it
Dec 22 2019,positive,a refreshingly new take on the series at least he tried something as opposed to jj who just remade a new hope
Dec 22 2019,negative,did nothing to progress the overall story arc detrimental to existing story threads
Dec 22 2019,positive,well then the last jedi is a very divided movie but i cam see both the positive and the negative stuff about it for me this is probably the best looking star wars film i really like the rebels planet at the end of the film when people steps on the salt and it turns red its pretty cool i love the throne room battle involving rey and kylo it is choreographed very will i dont mind the whole situation featuring luke i like to see a different take on this classic hero john williams music is still very good throughout but like pretty much every star wars fan i dont really care about the casino plot it really does fall out of place with the rest of the film the chases inside this storyline is forgettable and bland the humour lands 50 while the other half doesnt there are lots of plot holes in the film quite few unanswered questions the storyline involving poe doesnt make sense the more you watch it it just gets more confusing each time some characters were wasted some new characters were abit pointless i think rian johnson is a great writer and director but his style of filmmaking doesnt match up to a franchise like star wars i can rewatch this i dont have massive problems that is forcing me to stay away from it got some visual stunning moments but a story with some plot points some questionable decisions and humour that lands half of the time i think this is still a very good film
Dec 22 2019,positive,i truly do not understand the absurd amount of hatred for the film as a massive fan of the whole franchise i can safely say this is my favorite film of the trilogy
Dec 22 2019,negative,no caracter building no explanation about the story or the villain this movie is just a mess storywise
Dec 21 2019,negative,there are at least two fundamental mistakes to my opinion which make no sense spoilers ahead    first of all if force ghosts were really able to physically interact with the living world now yoda uses the force to cause a thunderbolt then there would be no star wars bunch of jedi force ghosts would be enough to eliminate imperial army vice versa for sith end of story    secondly if smaller ships were able to eliminate huge imperial ships with a hyperspace jump as holdo did then actually it would be enough to just build cheap suicide ships to take out imperial fleet    other than that it wouldnt really hurt creative writing if the beloved characters would come together just once to make the old fans nostalgic and happy this is not just another movie    i understand what the director tried and it was possibly the right way to go but the story should have made sense
Dec 21 2019,negative,unfortunately i have to give half a star apparently you cant give 0 stars
Dec 21 2019,negative,this single movie ruins the whole saga
Dec 21 2019,negative,complete trash should be scrubbed from cannon
Dec 21 2019,positive,great movie fantastic effects loved where the director took this movie hope to see more star wars movies from him
Dec 21 2019,positive,amazing  gritty and dark ignore the fanboys sleeping in their chewbacca pjs crying about their heroes being badmouthed lukes ending was beautiful simply beautiful
Dec 21 2019,negative,this movie was the worst did rian even see star wars before filming this awful
Dec 21 2019,positive,absolutely the best star wars movie different directing and story line to the rest of the saga great movie 1010 would watch a thousand times again rather than the latest tros movie
Dec 21 2019,positive,i wont deny it but its amazing the newest star wars movies are by far the best and this one is great my second favorite star wars film
Dec 21 2019,negative,it is the worst star wars film ever the director made it so bad that we could barely watch it
Dec 21 2019,positive,this movie had me gripped from beginning to end  it took all the characters introduced in force awakens and gave them so much more depth as well as consistent growth throughout the movie  not to mention the presence of actual suspense throughout that made watching this movie a truly gripping experience  definitely my favorite star wars movie to date
Dec 21 2019,neutral,im all for subverting expectations game of thrones did it all the time the difference is their subversions usually made sense this film is filled with spite and resistance of the wrong kind the toxic fans are one thing but there are legitimate issues with how luke and our new trio of heroes expand their stories in this film especially the utter lack of respect for luke and who hes grown to be i think rian is a fine director but thumbing the eyes of fans who have followed a story for 40 years shows very little admiration or respect for the material youve been given the honor to be a part of 
Dec 21 2019,negative,the footprint of disney is too much many scenes are so ridiculous it does nothing to continue the story of the saga it is a great pity episode 8 had great opportunities to change the evolution of it but nothing
Dec 21 2019,negative,the fact anyone finds anything to like about this movie is astonishing i never thought there would be a star wars movie i not only hated but found insulting the best way to watch the sequel movies is to start with the force awakens and end with the rise of skywalker
Dec 21 2019,positive,rian johnson is a superb writerdirector the themes in this film stay with you keeps you thinking the cinematography is the best of the entire sequel trilogy
Dec 21 2019,positive,i liked the swerves the force should not be a lineage this movie was not perfect but the originality of the ideas presented in the plot steered the sequel trilogy back towards interesting waters
Dec 21 2019,positive,i enjoyed it because it was different and i did like the different take on lukes character and how he faced something much more difficult than lightsaber combat i do understand its not for everyone but it worked for me theres a couple of things that couldve been better so not a full five stars i guess i feel lucky it did work for me
Dec 21 2019,negative,total garbage made by person who obviously doesnt understand star wars at all jokes just dont fit into the film nor franchise slap into the face of any star wars fan characters from original trilogy are trated as a piece of garbage i fell like the force awakens set some direction for the trilogy then rian johnson comes to totally destroy that and then in the rise of skywalker jj has to clean all the mess that rian has made
Dec 21 2019,negative,worst movie ive ever seen somehow managed to ruin the greatest sci fi series of all time
Dec 21 2019,negative,it was a steaming pile of mess luke was once the hope the most optimistic that he was able to turn darth vader who had literally annihilated the whole jedi back from the darkside rian johnson turned him into the hopeless and bitter now jj has to do damage control
Dec 21 2019,negative,an insult to star wars heroes instead of character building this movie simply resorts to destroying the memory of past characters
Dec 21 2019,negative,i wanted this movie to be good and parts of it were really cool but everything important sucked
Dec 21 2019,positive,amazing satisfying perfect end to a series i grew up loving couldnt imagine it any better
Dec 21 2019,positive,this movie is fantastic i think the reason people hated it is because it wasnt a nostalgia filled entry but i think that makes it even better it is a strong story matched with developed characters and a great score and scenery it broke the mold of every other star wars movie and the movie is all the better for it unfortunately thats why fans didnt like it
Dec 21 2019,positive,feels dark and gritty like the empire strikes back and is super inventive glcreating a great hase for future star wars stories this a challenging film in that it truly forces long time fans to question what they believe they know about star wars so close to dethroning empire as the best in the saga
Dec 21 2019,positive,really good movie not perfect by far but enjoyable  star wars trolls whine to much lol
Dec 21 2019,negative,terrible choices to catch you offguard instead of entertain you with a movie worth watching over and over
Dec 21 2019,positive,when i first saw it i hated it even though i hated it i could tell that it was without a doubt the most well shot star wars movie rian and his team have great eyes for cinematic framing man oh man then i watched it a second time many many many months later after getting over my visceral emotional reaction and paid closer attention to the dialogue setups etc and it became one of my favorite star wars films so much depth so much to unpack at first i was afraid that the last jedi has ruined star wars and so the next film wouldnt be able to be any good i was half right the last jedi has so much depth and is so well layered even if you hate those layers that the next film probably will end up seeming flatter even if it gives fans everything they want and they are ultimately satisfied by it
Dec 21 2019,negative,watched the last jedi for the last time before the the finale came out horrible the fact this got such high reviews from the critics is puzzling
Dec 21 2019,negative,this unoriginal and uninspiring movie was the coup de grace to the star wars story reduced to a mindnumbing cgi rollercoaster with terrible acting and performances
Dec 21 2019,negative,the worst star wars ever madeand a huge slap to the face for true fans of the franchise
Dec 21 2019,negative,beautiful special effects and well choreographed action sequences dont make up for a script that breaks all the basic rules of good writing and cobbles together a plot that is both nonsensical and incoherent
Dec 21 2019,negative,this is not a star wars movie
Dec 21 2019,positive,this movie hits all the right emotional beats for me has the epic feel that a star wars film should much like the force awakens was able to recreate a lot of the feeling of the original star wars any rehashes many plot points this movie nails the melancholy tone and dark themes introduced in the empire strikes back without just stealing its plot takes the characters new places is inventive with the plot but stays true to the series unlike rise of skywalker
Dec 21 2019,positive,a bold step for a star wars pushing the sequel trilogy in a new and exciting place pushing some beloved characters in different ways  took bold and different steps which i feel pay off     very much enjoyed
Dec 21 2019,negative,worst of the star wars series the force awakens sets the stage beautifully for this movie and this movie completely destroys everything that was built not really sure what they were thinking all for taking chances but little made sense the franchise built a lot of strong characters and this movie just wanted to break them down
Dec 21 2019,positive,layered story with well developed characters it expands the mythology of the originals the message is hopeful the lines poignant the cinematography gorgeous
Dec 21 2019,negative,really bruh im certain that the critics scores are so high because they werent really paying attention im sure that any that rewatched it were deeply regretful of their ratings
Dec 21 2019,neutral,even though i am a huge star wars fan i didnt feel like being in a star wars movie the plot is horrendous  mostly boring
Dec 21 2019,negative,a slap in the face to the original trilogy and its characters
Dec 21 2019,negative,poor plot slow character progression a self destructive luke and main characters that couldnt build off of the force awakens left me incredibly disappointed
Dec 21 2019,positive,an amazing fresh take on how to make a star wars film
Dec 21 2019,negative,in my opinion this isnt canon lets just pretend that it didnt happen
Dec 21 2019,negative,a sw movie that breaks its own cannon visually very beautiful it is a pretty film butthats about it the characters from 7 all regress back to the beginning of episode 7 its like the director hit the reset button of all character development for those that even had any there are some neat new force powers introduced the director was looking to subvert expectationswell i will compare it this way i went to a sushi restaurant and i ordered the sushi mystery special so the waiter brought me a burrito topped with oatmeal
Dec 21 2019,positive,the best star wars episode
Dec 21 2019,negative,this movie is nothing but a a front to fans rain johnson perverted expectations not subverted  do your self a favor and find and watch the christmas special its a better star wars experience in comparison
Dec 21 2019,negative,ouch this one hurt ruined 40 years worth of work
Dec 21 2019,negative,interesting ideas but does not work as a star wars movie
Dec 21 2019,negative,worst movie of the franchise
Dec 21 2019,positive,its unnecessary long but offers some of the most epic battles and character interactions in the saga main plot is a unique combat situation not seen before in the saga though it was damaged by some poor dialogues and useless parallel stories that were not even attractive silly sometimes but brave and sharp in some others distances from the infamous enormous galaxy led by a small royalty family it invites a broader audience to embrace a fairy tale that used to be only for geeks
Dec 21 2019,negative,under whelming story arc and it feels bad to watch
Dec 21 2019,positive,this movie from start to finish is an experiment to see what a star wars movie would look like if it followed the structure of a indie movie
Dec 21 2019,negative,bad script  boring movie  supposedly a star wars fanjohnson seemed more concerned with making luke a flawed character than a noble onethis was missed opportunitythere were a couple of good scenes in this moviebut i felt nothing at the end of the this movienot enough action and very little suspensemade me wonder if he has actually seen a star wars movie
Dec 21 2019,negative,some good bits but mostly bad rian j completely ruined all the characters set up nicely in the force awakens and previous films by far the worst star wars film
Dec 21 2019,negative,spends too much time on side characters we dont care about kills all the setups created in the force awakens leaves the franchise with nowhere to go
Dec 21 2019,negative,the worst star wars movie and an insult to the legacy of star wars
Dec 21 2019,positive,it was definitely different from the other films in the franchise but i think thats what makes it so amazing
Dec 21 2019,negative,an utterly nonsensical disrespectful screenplay riddled with infantile humour plot holes and continuity errors apart from the cinematography and the rey and ren interactions this is selfindulgent bilge of the lowest quality
Dec 21 2019,positive,really love this film left me with a massive smile on my face from start to finish so good that i would even say it tops empire with luke rey keyloleia snoke and hux being particular highlights
Dec 21 2019,negative,betrayed everything that was good and right in the star wars universe  a movie that was made for the critics and not for the fans  a movie where rian johnson gives the middle finger to the fandom  shame on you
Dec 21 2019,negative,story was horrible no real plot run johnson threw everything feat out the window luke didnt act anything like he did in any other movie i think rianbiohnson ruined it put a bad taste in my mouth
Dec 21 2019,negative,an unspeakably disastrous film that somehow manages to undermine both the trilogy that it was purposed with building upon and the original trilogy i shant even bother to address the treatment of luke skywalker or should i say the character masquerading as some bizarroworld luke skywalker irredeemable from start to finish
Dec 21 2019,negative,utter garbage way to go almost ruining star wars ryan johnson
Dec 21 2019,negative,why  why  why    disney kill the franchise
Dec 21 2019,negative,a poorly written film that is filled with bad characters pointless plot lines and countless gags that metaphorically spits on the face of the star wars saga by violating many of the franchises unspoken rules
Dec 21 2019,negative,this movie takes well established characters and either underutilized or destroyed them the characters introduced in the sequel trilogy receive next to no development or are reduced to comic relief there are noteworthy inconsistencies within the story itself it also performs stunts that fly in the face of established lore
Dec 21 2019,negative,i thought it was a joke childish and confusing way to go now back to writing childrens books
Dec 21 2019,negative,ruined star wars forever subverted expectations by running a beloved franchise into the ground with one movie
Dec 21 2019,positive,this movie is beautiful and awesome and amazing and wonderful and
Dec 21 2019,negative,piece of pretentious and pseudointellectual metacinema in the franchise that is supposed to be ultimate popcorn entertainment
Dec 21 2019,negative,thats not at all how i imagined lukes future
Dec 21 2019,positive,its the best star wars movie accepting failure changing the view of force and many more i do not like only the flight od leia but i can forgive that
Dec 21 2019,negative,i really wanted to like it it makes all the time i spent watching the previous movies the clone wars and rebels really feel aimless and a waste of time for luke to kind of be a chump in the end i actively had to reimmerse myself several times into the movie as so many moments forced me out of watching and enjoying to say huh
Dec 21 2019,negative,worst movie ever did disney really do this
Dec 21 2019,negative,very bad movie with a star wars skin
Dec 21 2019,negative,this is not star wars
Dec 21 2019,positive,this is the best star wars movie
Dec 21 2019,negative,star wars fan since a kid this movie made me sad cause it missed all of the star wars magic humour was out of place scenes made no sense weird characters it did not make the trilogy go any further
Dec 21 2019,negative,pointless main story with even more pointless sub stories lets run off and find this guy weve never met before and not have him break the code we need and bla bla bla why not get fuel for the ships this movie is why i am not giving money to see the next one
Dec 21 2019,negative,horrible rian johnson doesnt understand the characters from the original trilogy  i am pretty sure he didnt watch the force awakens
Dec 21 2019,positive,thoroughly enjoyed it too much unnecessary hate for this film
Dec 21 2019,negative,hands down the worst star wars movie whatever rian johnson was thinking when he made this movie is beyond disturbing he needs a few lessons in common sense of how space works bombing runs straight out of ww2 movies but in space theres no gravity in space blaster cannons affected by gravity in space absolutely terrible    the whole casino planet remove that from the movie and you lose nothing importing to do with the plot you can literally cut 80 of the scenes out of this movie and still lose no plot important scenes    if rian johnson is ever allowed to touch star wars again itll be disney biggest mistake since not bringing george lucas in when they started making the trilogy
Dec 21 2019,negative,this movie tries very hard to take sw in a different direction and i credit it for that new ideas new themes new visuals etc i have two issues with it   1 rian uses subversion as the theme instead of a storytelling tool so much time is spent subverting episode 7 that so little happens in terms of the sagas plot there is the idea that the old ways must die ie jedisithgoodbadlightdark etc the idea that the jedi are the sole users of the force its a bold fresh and interesting idea but at the end of the movie rian returns to the same old sw rey chooses the jedigoodlight and kylo chooses the opposite the jedi texts werent really destroyed like we thought so rey will eventually start a new jedi temple after saying the jedi should end luke then tells kylo that he wont be the last jedi as the movies title says so its hard to look on the bright side of this subversion when even the director abandons at the end of his own movie  2 because the movie focuses on theme which it abandons at the end rather than story a slow ship chase in space the trilogys story remains stagnant rey is still the might jedi from ep 7 kylo is still torn between the darklight like in ep 7 general hux 2nd in command and villain heirapparent is portrayed as a joky character that isnt intimidating snoke main villain and luke main hero are both dead the resistances victory and advantage in ep 7 has been neutralized we still dont know much about the first order their strength as compared to the resistancerepublic 2 different entities its not satisfying story wise and leaves the writer of ep 9 in a very difficult position  verdict i like the ideas they are excellent but the execution was terrible and it left the trilogy in a bad place
Dec 21 2019,negative,i have never been that angry after a mavie than after this one why whow could they allow this
Dec 21 2019,negative,they made luke skywalker look like a loser they ruined his character and made him go out so lame the leia scene in space makes no sense the plot is horrible
Dec 21 2019,positive,subversive bold rian johnson is the man
Dec 21 2019,positive,a great addition to the new star wars trilogy very good character development even if people dont agree with the direction the film decided to go into visually fantastic otherwise and some main characters couldve gotten more in depth backstory or progression as a person 
Dec 21 2019,negative,this movie is a joke it trashed previously established characters lore and beyond that this is just bad story telling from the forced characters to the useless side plot rian johnson showed the world just how little he knows about the star wars saga and the fans that have kept it going
Dec 21 2019,neutral,ok i see interesting ideas here but it is muddled in a cliched scattered and nonsensical plot this movies is ultimately about characters choosing a side but this is just an instance of snake eating its own tail they already had a side you messed it up in the beginning and came full circle back most people confuse that this movie is about killing the past no its not its about correcting your past but also respecting it the thing is rian johnson we dont need a whole damn movie for that i see the themes of militarism and corporate interest of weapons besides disasters from poe damarin and kantobite subplots all in all i think the film is ambitious but also incredibly dumb its not a hot garbage but an interesting mess    note to blockbuster filmmakers please stop with the intercuts it doesnt add tension it is annoying
Dec 21 2019,negative,the worst movie ive ever seen
Dec 21 2019,positive,a couple of missteps isnt enough to sabotage the rest of the great stuff in this movie mark hamill adam driver and daisy ridley are the definite highlights the casino planet not so much
Dec 21 2019,positive,great but a bit out of place in the star wars saga
Dec 21 2019,negative,if you took the star wars franchising off of this film it is probably a decent film considering its suppose to be canon material in said franchise it does a complete disservice to the characters and world building that took place prior     ive revisited this movie multiple times before writing this review because i wanted to believe it would bring purpose in the final film     after seeing the complete saga its clear this was a directorial misstep i dont blame rian johnson i blame disney for putting such a heavily sized project on a director that didnt have the history to validate him on this project     overall the tone and use of characters was poor and the world building even worse the final nail in the coffin was the plot that didnt grow customers over its run time by the end of the movie almost all characters are emotional and physically in the same place they were in the beginning of the film
Dec 21 2019,negative,no respect for luke skywalker and star wars
Dec 21 2019,positive,i liked in episode 8 that ryan wanted to do balance he wanted to bring everything to a logical conclusion he liked the idea of  grayness
Dec 21 2019,negative,absolutely does not belong in this saga jj shouldve directed this and it shouldve had nothing to do with rian johnson
Dec 21 2019,negative,atrocious cant be unseen but will never be seen anymore
Dec 21 2019,positive,good fight scenes thats about it the storyline tried to portray the skywalkers not important to this star wars storyline when they are at the center of it not to mention the ridiculously dumb space floating scene of leia the lets just run through space until we run out of gas scenes and the waste of time code breaker search scenes there was so much this film could have done and it wasted every effort to try and focus on rian johnsons own trilogy goal
Dec 21 2019,negative,not just the worst starwars it is the worst movie ever
Dec 21 2019,neutral,theres parts i love with this movie such as kylo rey and lukes scenes every single one of them and occasionally leia as well then theres the other 50 of this movie that left me feeling meh every single time i watch it i hated how much attention was put in finn and rose on canto bight and poe leia and holdo and their whole situation i felt like these were great characters that needed something better to do but instead it was boring the whole time because of this i just cant ignore how much this movie is hard to watch without skipping a bunch of scenes
Dec 21 2019,negative,worst star wars movie ever     but the visual effects were nice ツ
Dec 21 2019,negative,tlj fans hijacked the star wars fandom in an effort to undermine the theme of hope with gritty reality this is where the skywalker saga died from the lack of a roadmap for disneys sequel trilogy
Dec 21 2019,positive,fantastic film carves a new place for star wars in our world today innovative interesting there is a theme of failure that no star wars film grapples with as deeply what do we do when everything goes wrong
Dec 21 2019,negative,worst in the saga by far
Dec 21 2019,positive,totally outrageous and creative
Dec 21 2019,negative,the last jedi had high expectations after its predecessors but it failed to meet these standards through bad storytelling and all that disney dialogue
Dec 21 2019,negative,while it may be enjoyable for those who dont know anything about star wars or for those who only knew a bit about star wars it was a bloody mess for those who know stuff about star wars rian jhonson fucked it badly its like it isnt even a star wars movie
Dec 21 2019,negative,i really had high expectations for this film it was more concerned with not following the previous canon than being a good money you had hundreds of books to pick and choose source material from but instead they just made up whatever would be compelling to critics who view movies as work rather than fun throw it in the pile with the prequel movies
Dec 21 2019,negative,luke was handled poorly holdo replaced ackbar boo rey is overpowered with no good explanation reys heritage was dismissed finrose storyline is boring dj has a lisp why snoke dies and isnt very impressive etc just a few thoughts
Dec 21 2019,negative,the movie seemed like it was trying to do everything a star wars fan would hate it also suffered greatly from no time jump between it and the last movie by the end youre practically where you left off at the end of episode 7 except your favorite hero is dead
Dec 21 2019,positive,an absolute masterpiece a great bridge between putting the past behind you and moving forward with new and exciting characters the unexpected twists and turns did such a good service to the overall direction of the new trilogy has the best shots and scenes of any star wars movie ever that will wow and dazzle you 
Dec 21 2019,positive,it may stir away from the star wars the audience and fans are used to though to watch the film as a scfi film instead you appreciate the direction rian johnson was heading
Dec 21 2019,negative,beautifully shot film but didnt feel like star wars  it also didnt do much to develop new characters and legacy characters seemed unfamiliar
Dec 21 2019,negative,this whole movie and sequel trilogy is a dumpster fire
Dec 21 2019,positive,a great star wars movie tons of action  a lot packed into one movie but lots of fun
Dec 21 2019,negative,luke would never have acted like this
Dec 21 2019,negative,it was not rian johnsons fault kathleen kennedy was the one whoo has chosen him   he was acting as he is a good director not for star wars   it is like if i would like to put messi or cristiano ronaldo training dribbling with a ball in the movie some peopleas crazy as it may seem who love football would like it but it wouldnt be good because star wars is not the place for them to appear   you can innovate the mood of a narrative you create but you should not take your friends to a bad sorrowful poetry show just because you like it and want to prank them
Dec 21 2019,negative,the way they portray luke skywalker is absolutely the worst thing i could have imagined as a fan  stroy was terrible and made me not want to see the next movie  i was a very disappointed fan
Dec 21 2019,negative,worst star wars movie isnt he franchise from a story perspective it took me a few days to digest just how much this movie sucked 
Dec 21 2019,positive,one of the first star wars movie ive seen since the beginning and it is a very well made chapter of the saga and i dont care what people say about this movie
Dec 21 2019,neutral,the last jedi is a jumbled mess of excellent story telling and tragically bad story telling all blended together into a middling sloppy almost great whole first things first mark hamill steals the show luke skywalker is borderlineperfect in this film and i personally feel that people who think luke should never have turned out cynical and old need to reexamine the way they look at their stories characters change this is a reasonable change in fact the entire lukereykylo third of this story is top notch the problems start to arise with the other major pieces of the story the holdopoe storyline and the rosefinn storyline enough has been said already about the pacing issues of the casino planet in every review ive ever seen but there are bigger problems at play here there is a difference between the theme of failure and the theme of pointlessness finn and roses adventure is pointless it is a string of barely acceptable coincidences in which they get thrown in prison hire a random hacker despite having been told only one man can do the job the random guy they found works just fine sneak aboard the enemy ship get captured by the enemy miraculously survive the explosion of a huge chunk of the ship caused by holdos sacrifice and somehow escape to reconvene with their friends on crait along the way they free some imprisoned animals in a cheesy scene straight out of free willie and maybe somehow fall in love i think the movie wants them to have a better relationship than what shows up on screen kelly marie tran does the best with the role given to her but her character isnt quite interesting enough to really pull you in the holdopoe storyline is the bigger problem with holdos decision not to tell any of her troops her relatively good plan even after they stage a coup coming across as a bit nonsensical especially rewatching the movie but not presented as a character flaw or poor decision on her part this all culminates in an act of selfsacrifice on her part which breaks the known laws of space combat and leaves the audience wondering why isnt all of space combat peopling strapping warp drives to rocks and flinging them at big ships the movies climax is redemptive with the final battle between luke and kylo working quite well and the scene involving rose and finn working relatively well the earlier fight scene featuring rey and kylo along with snoke and his guards is quite fun and the big reveal regarding reys parents is wonderfully executed unfortunately its not just plot holes and poor pacing that drag this movie down you also have inconsistent themes is this a movie about blindly trusting authority poe should have trusted holdo despite having little reason to do so but this is literally a series about rebelling against an authoritarian fascist government so blindly following orders feels like an odd theme is this is a movie about saving your friends instead of making noble sacrifices rose saves finn and claims that this is how they win the war and holdos plan seems to boil down to saving as many people as possible and running rather than fighting yet some of the biggest moments in this movie are selfless sacrifices holdo flies into an enemy ship why dont they have autopilot and luke dies after exerting all his energy to save the day and captain phasma is just as disappointing in this movie as the last one i was hoping theyd have learned from the disappointment of boba fett my last talking point is rey and a thematic issue i have with her character development i dont feel like she really has flaws luke wasnt the most dynamic character in the original series he didnt have a ton of flaws either but that doesnt mean we cant hope for better if you compare a crucial scene from last jedi with one in empire you can see a storytelling problem in empire luke decides to abandon his training with yoda due to his attachment to his friends this decision leads to ruin and a lost arm he eventually must learn to overcome his connections to loved ones flipping over to tlj reys only flaw seems to be her obsession with finding or at least identifying her parents sure she has delusions about who her parents are and who she is but what does this character flaw amount to what is the cost of this flaw she leaves the island confronts kylo ren breaks her lightsaber and saves her friends even inspiring luke to get involved along the way but even the breaking of lukes old saber isnt really presented as a major loss one last thing this movie is about letting go of the past but remembering it forgive but dont forget its a good theme for star wars luke learns that the legacy of the jedi is a legacy of failure and problematic beliefs so why renege on that in the final confrontation with kylo why not say that the jedi are dead but anybody has the capacity to use the force for good that rey is her own person and has the capacity for goodness and greatness separate from the problematic history of the jedi its not a big deal but it feels like a missed opportunity and of course i have to talk about the soundtrack williamss scores may be a staple of the series but this soundtrack is lazy and uninspired theres one new original song the casino planet and one new motif roses theme and thats it the rest of the movie is uninspired remixes all the performances in this movie are good to great and i really like rey as the series protagonist in particular this movie just needed a cleaner script and a little more character work to really tie it together and maybe a mega fan or two with working knowledge of star wars lore and mechanics
Dec 21 2019,negative,this was the worst star wars movie
Dec 21 2019,positive,some serious holes not withstanding this is the best of the third trilogy lots of ambitious ideas with a few big misses some great character work and an interesting new world plus excellent visuals make this movie solid movie would be even better in a vacuum some continuity errors with the rest of the sw universe
Dec 21 2019,neutral,just not a fan of the direction they took the story or characters but i do have to recognize the superior special effects and beautiful cinematography rian johnson is a talented director but i think the best choice for a star wars director he is not 
Dec 21 2019,negative,dumpster fire of a movie luke skywalker was totally out of character it didnt feel like a star wars movie at all
Dec 21 2019,negative,this movie should be wiped from the annals of history and remade by somebody more competent congratulations on singlehandedly destroying the star wars franchise
Dec 21 2019,negative,its a terrible knockoff of the empire strikes back without any of the love and passion that went into episode 5
Dec 21 2019,positive,honestly my rating for this movie just went up tremendously after having seen rise of skywalker tlj makes some character moves that are bold and ultimately the arcs are slightly frustrating but the story and characters feel real and envisioned and like its actually trying to say something sadly this is the last star wars movie to actually feel like a coherently made film in the saga 
Dec 21 2019,neutral,i decent movie with spectacular special effects poor script and character development and failed to contribute the the overarching star wars saga
Dec 21 2019,negative,almost made me never want to watch another sw movie
Dec 21 2019,negative,hugely disappointing the characters are inconsistent the plot makes no sense scenes are dull cliche uninspired and dragging there is a lot of disrespect for the characters the lore and the fan base
Dec 21 2019,negative,i give this one one while star just for the fact that it is a star wars movie and it had carrie fisher and mark hamill  i get that directors want to put their own stamp on a franchise and think it is an accomplishment to go in a different direction but this move did not feel like a star wars movie characterization plot and pacing were all off  such a disappointment and what a horrible way to treat a cinematic legacy
Dec 21 2019,negative,how do you mess up having mark hamill back as luke skywalker disney can try to sell this as some out of the box thinking but no just no walked out of there thinking wtf was that not because of what a wonderful unexpected journey never thought id see a star wars movie with mark hamill in it suck not because of you mark you tried to warn us
Dec 21 2019,negative,this movie seems to create holes in the skywalker story and star wars as a whole though after watching episode 9 jj abrams saved the story when doing a trilogy should be the same writer and director rian johnson tried to change the coarse with his view and did not consider the previous films or the fans
Dec 21 2019,positive,rather disappointing an opportunity wasted they ruined lukes character  get rid of rose
Dec 21 2019,negative,i felt like i was watching a disney princess movie not star wars
Dec 21 2019,positive,this movie is the kick in the butt this franchise needed  it brings fresh ideas and direction
Dec 21 2019,positive,i was surprised how good it was
Dec 21 2019,positive,not a popular view but i put this up there with the empire strikes back why  because it was the dark film fans asked for and it left questions unanswered with no clear direction  not dissimilar  the critics hate it when they change something and complain its predictable when they dont 
Dec 21 2019,positive,kinda good could watch it again
Dec 21 2019,negative,great scifi movie but a horrible star wars movies
Dec 21 2019,negative,an absolute spectacular train wreck of a film that subverted expectations into a void rian took a wrecking ball to the trilogys foundation and framework and left jj abrams with nothing to build off for the finale
Dec 21 2019,negative,rubbish boring stretched out not a fitting second movie didnt develop the new trilogy at all put a stall to it treatment of luke was terrible not only put me off star wars put my kids off they really hated it thats saying something
Dec 21 2019,negative,i cant for the life of me understand how critics and some fans loved this movie and claimed that it took the franchise in bold and new directions the story and plot are all over the place and when you ask why are these characters acting like this johnsons answer is shhh because the plot wills it so we go from 1 poe and the resistance to 2 kylo and rey to 3 rey and luke 4 finn and rose and back again those 2025 mins spent on canto bight shouldve been spent on the growing dynamic between kylo  rey and the mentoring process going on with luke and rey time spent on achto and the force link between kylo and rey was the most interesting part of this movie everything else from the god awful marvelesque style humor to the social talking points spoon fed to us by the new characters and blatant decharacterization on one of cinemas most iconic characters ie luke skywalker is why i cannot love or even like tlj as a star wars movie in a vacuum its borderline great but knowing that it is the 8th film in a 40 year old franchise with tons of lore and set rules tlj holds the last place out of all the star wars films
Dec 21 2019,negative,after a good start with the force awakens this film ruined expectations for the disney trilogy by attempting to subvert expectations with an abundance of sudden plot twists which just became boring and frustrating probably the worst star wars movie yet including the worst of the prequel films
Dec 20 2019,positive,one of the best star wars movie
Dec 20 2019,negative,rian johnson sure ruined everything about our childhood hope his trilogy never makes it to the big screen 
Dec 20 2019,negative,as a big star wars fan i can never give a star movies just 1 star but i can understand why many would give just 1 star this movie has maybe around 4 solid moments and 1 good act which is the first but that is all when watching the film you can instantly know there is political influence which creates uncomfortable moments multiple of our main characters have little to nothing to do in the movie while some characters just introduced have a crazy amount of time but it is not entertaining the plot of the movie is very messy with at times made me wonder why it was there the first act of the movie might be the best because of the typical star wars battle that everyone likes to see finn leia and poe have nothing to do and some moments where emotion is about to be created is instantly taken away by another character the way they handle supreme leader snoke is horrible but i can see their vision of kylo ren general hux and captain phasma are worthless in this film which is unfortunate because they created fear in the force awakens overall disappointed in the ending where it feels like potential was just left out the soundtrack of the film is what gives this an entire star because john williams is a master
Dec 20 2019,negative,i will have to start by saying that this was the biggest disappointment ive seen from the star wars franchise in a long time     as a longtime fan ive made sure to watch every one of the releases to do my service of doing so but this is one that i literally cannot force myself to sit through again i first watched this film at the time of its release and found it to be moderately entertaining if not a way to spend time but after attempting to watch it again more recently with the upcoming release of the rise of skywalker ive been reminded of the painful details id forgotten    to be clear i dont believe that every good star wars movie has to be an actual good movie as long as it does a service of satisfying fans with the next instalments of the saga as in the case of episodes 1 through 3 but not only can i say that the last jedi is a bad movie i can also say honestly that it is a bad star wars movie which already lowers the bar for what we should expect    this movie is constantly hopping from one useless plot point to another introducing meaningless deus ex machina type characters to resolve their issues and manages to throw away literally every story and character arc that the force awakens had set up for this new trilogy this movie changes rules in universe which contradict the previous movies in the universe and spends an enormous amount of time on characters that literally mean nothing to the plot characters like admiral holdo and rose are examples of corny attempts of humourous and intriguing characters in this universe and these characters make it feel like the director was literally pushing to change the very essence of how characters work in the universe    i very much disliked lukes character arc throughout this movie instead of a yodalike mentor we were given a lazy old man who hates himself and then dies at the end    we see absolutely no buildup in rey and kylo rens relationship and characters like poe and finn seem inconsequential to the entire plot     i personally dislike the way that they handled leias character in this movie i was hoping that they would give her character a peaceful meaningful disembarkment form the saga as carrie fisher had passed away before its release but instead they continued to slash character arcs and bend rules with her character as they had with everyone elses    i would say that the most questionable part of this movie would have to be snokes death the anticlimactic ending of this part of the plot was perhaps the most disappointing part of this entire film whoever came up with the idea to kill the main villain off when there is a whole other movie coming afterwards deserves the backlash that theyve got from that decision its perhaps the most backwards decision that ive seen in any serious film to date    ive seen some people praising this movie lately on social media but i have almost no words about this film that i could even begin to describe as praise i considered the force awakens to be a lessthangreat start to this new trilogy but sadly its sequel makes it seem like a welcome addition to the saga or at least an addition that along with the rise of skywalker can overt peoples eyes from this cinematic failiure
Dec 20 2019,negative,there is no room for reenvisioning a nine part saga in its penultimate episode both the force awakens and the rise of skywalker manage to beautifully and elegantly show us within the narrative that female characters and poc characters have agency and statusthis boring bumbling heap of worldbreaking only tells us about it crudely and with little effect placing characters in silly situations that only serve to provide ammunition to naysayers and hatemongerers very poor showing
Dec 20 2019,positive,i thought this movie gets better with time
Dec 20 2019,positive,great film i highly recommend
Dec 20 2019,negative,i watched this when it originally came out i wanted to wait until episode 9 came out to try and give this movie a chance i thought maybe disney can salvage this movie however that is not the case i think that cinematically this is an amazing film the visuals and way that the movie is shot is incredible however the story is bogged down this film breaks so many aspects of the starwars lore that it is sad there are a lot of cheesy and uncalled for moments at one point leah starts to breathe in the vacuum of space for some odd reason i could go into more but i digress
Dec 20 2019,negative,the force awakes was no masterpiece but it was a respectable foundation upon which to build the new disney trilogy it gave us characters and a plot that were intrinsically interesting while remaining tonally consistent and universecompliant with existing star wars media and canon despite this rian johnson went out of his way to jarringly write himself out of the expectations audiences audiences had been given and into a new direction entirely a direction that does not workneither as a follow up to the fore awakens as a work within the star wars continuity nor as a competently wrought film in its own right the humor is tonedeaf and flippant the characters are confused the universe is unrecognizable the cinematic language is foreign and inconsistent with the history of the series my honest opinion is that rian johnson was neither fluent enough in star wars nor experienced enough a writerdirector to be trusted with such an important franchise i dont think he is a bad person or that he in any way meant to deliver a disappointment but that is what we got
Dec 20 2019,positive,not a good and not a bad movie the movie alone was good but it does not fit into the story well i think
Dec 20 2019,negative,at an end your rule is and not short enought it was
Dec 20 2019,negative,and this is why nobody should listen to critics
Dec 20 2019,negative,cant escape from the fact that the story is absolutely terrible
Dec 20 2019,negative,i liked the cinematography i disliked a lot of else for all the things that happen in this movie maybe it makes it a better film but not a better star wars film
Dec 20 2019,negative,the first time i watched this movie i couldnt believe that i hated it so i paid to see it a second time and hated it even worse starts off with a scene thats supposed to make you nervous and afraid and turns it into a joke turned luke into a joke turned snoke into a joke left the story with no direction a useless casino scene i can go on and on about how bad this movie is im shocked its ratings are this high to be honest rian stole a star wars movie from us  that we will never get back
Dec 20 2019,negative,it tried but was just ok i would still recommend that someone see the movie  if for nothing else  closure
Dec 20 2019,negative,insults fans of the original trilogy of the prequel trilogy and of george lucas give us the real sequels as george lucas dreamt them four decades ago not this recycled nihilistic trash makegeorgessequels
Dec 20 2019,positive,this movie erases a bunch of questions we wanted answered but its under rated and is entertaining
Dec 20 2019,negative,a combination of worldbreaking elements written by someone who seemingly has no interest in the star wars universe  and lecturing boring joykilling postmodernism  this movie made me hate my own beloved childhood
Dec 20 2019,negative,the problem with this movie isnt the changes that johnson implements its the lack of response from the characters to the events and the world around them if the rules in the universe change if leia can fly through space now that should be exciting instead no character even mentions or reacts to witnessing any of these force miracles making them feel unremarkable or just a frustrating rebuke of the established world that the characters exists in
Dec 20 2019,positive,easily the best of the skywalker saga
Dec 20 2019,positive,a few plot holes but overall a refreshing surprising installment in a franchise that was due for a new point of view
Dec 20 2019,negative,this movie is praised for reasons i cannot understand poor writing and arcs that lead to nothing in order to surprise the viewer makes a terrible star wars movie
Dec 20 2019,negative,my least favorite film of the saga so many inconsistencies plot holes character assassinations and general cannon problems subverting expectations and giving fans what they want do not have to be mutually exclusive
Dec 20 2019,positive,somepeople can say this movie ignore the rest of star wars saga however sw was always maked with this inovation that rian johnson bring in this movie too
Dec 20 2019,negative,terrible movie and im a huge star wars fan  leía flying her dead body in space and the rebel fleet chase scenes until they run out of fuel is sooooooooo dumb  empire ships ever think of light speed to the other side where the ships are heading to then cut them off  i mean come on dumbest so called challenge to the fans from director rain johnson i have ever seen   please disney let this director go to another studio he is awful
Dec 20 2019,negative,yeah i didnt like this movie one viewing was good enough for me have never seen it more than once
Dec 20 2019,negative,hire writers andor directors who actually want to make a star wars film not those who want to subvert expectations aka disappoint fans
Dec 20 2019,negative,while the film had some beautiful shots a fantastic duel and moments of cool nostalgia puppet yoda it just fell flat with a slowspeed chase poorly timed jokes and a subpar side mission with poorly developed characters it will make a less than fine addition to my collection
Dec 20 2019,negative,bad story telling random events that went nowhere i cant even say it was weak character development it was more like bipolar characters campy dialog really didnt give this cast much to work with as well
Dec 20 2019,negative,rian killed any resemblance of a coherent plot had some good moments but really shat on luke character
Dec 20 2019,negative,a movie that tries to take star wars in  a new direction but fails miserably
Dec 20 2019,positive,hands down the most visually stunning star wars movie ever made i particularly appreciated johnsons decision to push back against the monomyth and attempt to break new ground bold and audacious it was a joy to watch on imax
Dec 20 2019,positive,i was very excited to see this movie continue the exploration of the new characters that were set up marvelously by the force awakens but i found myself sorely disappointed rian johnson actually tried to make a good movie he wrote a pretty good script that clearly laid out his own vision for a star wars film but it just so happens that his vision almost completely contradicted everything that the force awakens set up leaving me very disappointed and kind of confused johnson clearly had a script already set up for a star wars movie and it was his own original story and he didnt hate the last movie so it makes no sense as to why he directed a film in this skywalker saga he couldve done something like rogue one or solo instead where his new storyline and subplots wouldnt have mattered as much i liked reys past being ambiguous i liked finn choosing for himself who he wants to really be and i loved the conflict that kylo ren felt within himself but that all kind of doesnt matter anymore even lukes surprise cameo at the end felt like it was changed from the original idea i loved seeing mark hamill back giving possibly the greatest performance of his career his character just didnt feel like luke anymore they changed him too much adam driver was amazing kylo ren is still the best new character and we get several flashbacks containing information of his past and i loved seeing it three different times each time getting more and more filled it so good i also really liked him without a mask we can actually see his emotions and it is heartbreaking to see him continue down the path of darkness i was so emotionally attached to him he is a great character i also loved the reylo connection that is built throughout this film it makes both of their characters emotions more impactful and the force visions or whatever they are called where they can see and have a conversation with each other from two different areas is some really good stuff it could be used to greater effect in another movie and i think that we should see more of it carrie fisher wasnt great here she is just too old to be doing this anymore i didnt think that she really had a place in this movie oscar isaac is also back but he doesnt do anything at all his great character with potential is wasted and feels very lifeless daisy ridley is still not great to me as a star wars character she is too childlike and assertive for my liking i did like seeing her pull to the dark side though domnahall gleeson is once again brilliant here he gives a very commanding performance that makes him mentally threatening though his screaming yelling can get somewhat irritating at times snoke was a complete throwaway they didnt explain anything about him at all and they just killed him i was so frustrated by that the character of rose tico annoyed the hell out of me she is just a whiny little brat who wants everybody to be her friend she really pissed me off with creating a love triangle between her finn and rey i hate the idea of her and finn being together benicio del toro also had a terrible character he just made me mad every time he was on screen and his whole character is just a very convenient plot point to help out the resistance and i hated it he had no real substance and that will never work for any character the entire subplot of finn and rose going to a casino to find a master codebreaker is so long and boring and i hate rose so much it makes the movie drag way to much and it turns out that they did all of it for nothing so you can be perfectly fine with skipping that whole half an hour of monotony captain phasma was talked up about having a bigger role in this film but she had a smaller role and she presumably dies so her really cool female character was completely wasted after she had a good set up in the last movie this movie makes so many turns in the path that jj abrams laid out for this trilogy johnson basically said i know this is a sequel but were making it my way this is a movie that tells you the answers to the questions in the force awakens dont matter at all and it asks its own questions as well it felt like a reboot that was highly unnecessary i feel like i hate this movie but it was well made with a decently written script pretty good action sequences great development for kylo ren and the visual effects are second to none but narratively it made choices that were just wrong on so many levels of star wars fandom and mythology this movie wouldve been better if it was part of its own series the story betrays the old characters especially luke and also what was set up for the new characters i feel very conflicted about this film at least it feels like a star wars movie and it tries to tell a compelling story and there are so many plot twists that make this story feel unique and different than the other films but most of them feel completely out of left field and unnecessary this movie had the potential of tightening already planted storylines but instead tried too hard to be different and risky and while i admire risky filmmaking it just didnt always work for me here the craft on display here is very good but it couldve been better than it was rian johnson made a good movie but it is not a great star wars movie
Dec 20 2019,positive,johnson created a number of interesting and wellconsidered arcs for a group of characters that could have been played very flat
Dec 20 2019,positive,smart take on franchise film that subverts expectations
Dec 20 2019,negative,great cinematography
Dec 20 2019,neutral,interesting ideas but overall kind of dull and not fun to watch
Dec 20 2019,negative,and i thought the force awakens was the worst one
Dec 20 2019,negative,watch 7 skip this movie youll thank me later watch 9 good to see yoda and luke but you can probably see that on youtube
Dec 20 2019,positive,this is the best movie of this disney era trilogy
Dec 20 2019,positive,tlj is different and thats a good thing this was a refreshing take on the star wars formula rian johnson took big risks and it paid off
Dec 20 2019,negative,it took what was great about tfa ruined all that took what we wanted to see of luke and did our boy wrong it was half boring half divert expectations for the worse second worse star wars film next to attack of the clones
Dec 20 2019,positive,far better quality and nuance than a typical blockbuster  this movie will stand the test of time and is possibly the best in the series
Dec 20 2019,negative,after the force awakens brought me back to a galaxy far far away and made me feel like a kid again i was beyond excited for this movie what i got was a sense of sadness in the movie theater the handling of luke who was the symbol of hope and optimism was an insult to all star wars fans just to circumvent expectations doing something for shock factor does not make it good the entire plot of the movie was pointless if general holdo had used some basic management skills and communicated the plan to the staff so many issues could have been resolved and a lot of lives could have been saved what a mess of a movie
Dec 20 2019,negative,this is what you get when you hire directors who are not familiar with the genre to direct a multimillion franchise pure trash
Dec 20 2019,negative,this movie was nothing but a bunch of fancy lights good cgi and decent acting i want to start by saying i really enjoy star wars movies i do really but this movie was such a disappointment as far as story goes i would only recommend this movie to someone who wanted to see a pretty movie because it did hit that mark but again the story was so upsetting to melet me explain   one of the major rules of story telling is never add anything to the story that doesnt progress the story forward this is a huge rule and the last jedi broke that rule with finn and rose who go on a major adventure to find a code breaker and break their way onto snokes ship and disable their tracking ability however what we get instead is rose showing finn the corruption of the wealthy abuse of animals and the double dealing of arms dealers during war they find a different weirder code breaker who then takes them aboard snokes ship as promised and then quickly betrays them to the first order who promptly arrest them and then lose them after a ship rips through snokes ship but dont worry they steal a ship and return back to their friends like nothing ever happened having not a single person other than poe dameron even realize that they left 40 minutes of movie wasted on nothing
Dec 20 2019,negative,this movie is garbage rian johnson murdered star wars its as if the director had never seen a single episode
Dec 20 2019,negative,rian johnson ruin everything bleee
Dec 20 2019,positive,i have to review this after seeing its predecessor tros if you are a fan of luke skywalker and the prequels lightsaber battles and forms there will be a few disappointments with the sequel trilogy done it feels that you need to watch the sequel trilogy as a whole     the only thing that i would like to be in the story is the 3rd lesson and a few seconds  of screentime for luke skywalker and kylo ren it will take a sort of acceptance to the storyflow or decisions of luke skywalker in this movie
Dec 20 2019,negative,johnson did not know how to make a star wars film
Dec 20 2019,positive,meh it was fun loved it before more then now
Dec 20 2019,positive,spoiler alert    review will contain spoilers    things to hate about this movie   the bad guys arent so bad  theyre pathetic theyre not imposing theyre just really incompetent it really beckons how they became that powerful to begin with   the master code breaker mcguffin think casino planet the side quest that really achieved nothing except reveal that good and evil arent so clearcut if you take this mcguffin out the outcome wont change   i thought finn liked rey whats he doing with rose rose is annoying period she offers nothing in the movie if you took her out the movie might actually improve because    finn might actually go sacrifice himself and save his friends see why harrison ford thought han solo should have died in empire strikes back   the battle of krayt pretty stupid they went into a fortress only to mount a david v goliath battle   the space battle so very boring fuel shortage and a secret escape plan that leads to a mutiny which then leads to a lesson   hyperspace kamikaze how stupid does everyone have to be in the star wars universe not to just build a bunch of xwings and let a bunch of droids kamikaze the death star and star killer base why should a big space ship or any space ship be intimidating   jedi ghost yoda can still manipulate the physical world through the force but that means    obiwan and yoda are jerks death star 1 and 2 could have used help luke  darth duel in empire strikes back just saying   leia flying with indignity through space how does anyone forget that maybe she should have died in space like everyone else in that ships bridge   captain phasma the trilogys equivalent to boba fett  coolest masked figure of all time like boba fett meets a pretty pathetic death unlike boba fett though she didnt achieve anything in her appearances     things i loved about this movie   luke is a quirky hermit like yoda and probably obiwan got teal milk  cheesy yet i like it   lukes first force lesson to rey funny yet insightful i seriously dont know why people dont like this    lukes sacrifice   yoda still teaching luke about the force   throne room fight   reys origins nothing supposedly   kylo ren usurping snoke    kylo rens internal struggles dark side of the force family snoke adam driver ftw    meh   porgs   reys journey into the dark side cave im too stupid to understand this someone please explain it to me
Dec 20 2019,positive,bold story absolutely beautiful cinematography great themes probably the best of the sequel trilogy
Dec 20 2019,negative,there were many problems in the last jedi eg deaths of people we really dont care about the snoke throne scene is a direct copy from a classic return of the jedi and luke sending a force projection of himself halfway across the galaxy to confuse kylo like what etc but i think its safe to say that the critics on this movie are full of sht
Dec 20 2019,positive,subversive showing that star wars can be more than a nostalgiabased saga
Dec 20 2019,negative,this is the worst of the series even worse than attack of the clones one of those rare movies you wonder how it got made everything about it is wrong and feels forced no fun to be had here johnson would be a better star trek director maybe cause he doesnt understand star wars
Dec 20 2019,positive,amazing film this is one where the critics are right and the fandom are wrong it challenges a lot of the sw culture in a good way  godlike hero worship significance of lineage  which obviously makes some stringent fans mad i personally loved it
Dec 20 2019,negative,this movie is visually stunning and uses a great mix of cgi and practical effects unfortunately thats the only thing it has going for it the plot is stupid characters act out of character plot holes continuity errors and head scratching dumb moments are rampant what really aggravates me about this film is that disney and rian johnson had every opportunity to make an awesome star wars film and simply chose not to
Dec 20 2019,negative,wasting of time as a star wars fan this is very bad boring plot to many bad jokes no momentum in movies plot goal less plot wasting of time
Dec 20 2019,negative,needed to be written and directed by someone who understands star wars  felt like a parody
Dec 20 2019,negative,even if it was not star wars the effort to create a movie is a catastrophic blunder we are talking cutthroat island level of bust the only answer to all the questions you are left with which is all of them is if ryan johnson has ever seen a movie or read a book there is no hyperbole in honestly questioning the limitation of johnsons grasp on cinematic technique and art it is truly baffling how a movie was produced that contained limited to no development in any character arc does not have a plot ignores major protagonists contains no theme is slowly paced destroys previous character arcs lacks any sense of its audience and finishes by sticking it to all level of fans you walk out of the theater amid a bunch of booing and or the silence of disbelief
Dec 20 2019,positive,not the perfect movie but innovative and intriguing with brilliant acting music and cinematography exactly what a sequel should be
Dec 20 2019,positive,a beautiful humanist film that takes what we know of the franchise and finds ways to give it new meaning the small quibbles i may have are all outshone by all the things about it i love
Dec 20 2019,positive,talented brilliant incredible amazing show stopping spectacular never the same co totally unique
Dec 20 2019,negative,a rare movie in a series that not only is completely rotten it ruined itself the previous films and it left future films in the franchise to struggle shame on you rian
Dec 20 2019,negative,this movie is trash could not be worse mary poppins leia to the casino scene everything was horrible
Dec 20 2019,negative,after the great work done in tfa to setup this film it was a complete let disaster leia floating in space flying back into the ship and magically defying all common sense and coming back to life was the most absurd moment in the history of star wars zero character development for rey back peddling on kylo completely pointless story line for finn ruining luke i could go on and on horrible
Dec 20 2019,negative,i love star wars but this is the worst in the series
Dec 20 2019,negative,this movie was not star wars just subverting expectations and for me it did not work in this universe
Dec 20 2019,negative,i left the movie theater very upset and disappointed is a very bad bad bad star wars movie rotten tomatoes should add a zero star rating
Dec 20 2019,negative,where to start beginning with a grouchy mark hamill just tossing away a family heirloom felt like a big screw you to the star wars franchise director rian johnsons approach to luke was terrible he is the symbol of hope in the rebellion jedi also find a way past barriersissues so it seemed quite out of character to let rian do this to this beloved character luke training rey scenes were good but the movie is just plagued by bad decisions afterwards the characters felt quite out of place the whole time kylo ren and rey were again doing a lot of weird staring with odd pauses and looks i get he was trying to direct confusion in those scenes but rey is just gasping alot looking like a fish and kylo ends up shirtless for some reason and emotionless in total this film was just plain bad riddled with mistakes that any die hard star wars fan will pick up on the director doesnt understand how the force light speed and force ghosts work of course disney is just accepting new things the directors bring to the table so we end up with our star wars canon being expanded in a direction the fans dont like
Dec 20 2019,negative,just plain horrible  entirely not enough bathos in this film i gotta have more bathos
Dec 20 2019,positive,as far as star wars movies go this is a great one its full of twists stunning visuals and epic battles definitely a lot left to be answered but its only part 2 of 3
Dec 20 2019,positive,this is the star wars movie we didnt know we needed but we did a breath of fresh air in an otherwise uninspiring trilogy
Dec 20 2019,negative,destroyed the series
Dec 20 2019,negative,truly painful to watch i could go on and on but i will just leave with one word painful
Dec 20 2019,negative,i give it a half star for yodas appearance rian johnson has destroyed our childhood memories
Dec 20 2019,negative,shit fill that throws so much away like lukes saber that move luke would never have done he knows he should respect a jedis weapon
Dec 20 2019,negative,you get a half star for porgs
Dec 20 2019,positive,mark hamill gives a performance of a lifetime in an entirely human but still larger than life luke  one of lifes greatest lessons is failure and these characters are challenged over and over again  the beauty is that they still get back up
Dec 20 2019,negative,this was not a star wars film too much comedy and the plot did not follow up on the storyline from the force awakens luke completely abandoned all his jedi values this is something he never would have done horrible film
Dec 20 2019,negative,possibly one of the worst movies i have seen in regards to story in some time the acting is passable the music and effects were spot on but not enough to save this trash fire it is clear that johnson pretty much tossed abrams script in the garbage and lit it on fire
Dec 20 2019,negative,worst star wars film ever 
Dec 20 2019,positive,smart emotional brought depth and new ideas to the sw films maybe too good for some of its fan base
Dec 20 2019,positive,amazing storytelling and cinematography there are also exploration of themes left me feeling emotional and excited
Dec 20 2019,negative,it felt like rian johnson made this film to please critics rather than fans thats where he and jj differ the fans have kept this franchise alive for 42 years  they deserve to be given something jj should have done all 3  simple as that the last jedi still has some visually awesome scenes and i love the tension building between rey and ren but everything else just seemed a bit pointless and to completely assassinate lukes character is unforgivable
Dec 20 2019,positive,this movie is super smart and got me out of my seat to cheer three times lots of very unexpected moves
Dec 20 2019,positive,making bold decisions and introducing interesting plot points and character developments i loved this film really opened up what the future of star wars could be loved it
Dec 20 2019,positive,aside from the canto bight side storyquest this was a solid installment in the skywalker saga
Dec 20 2019,positive,one of the three most exciting star wars films ive ever seen and truly the most daring and reverent of them i dont know that anyone has made a star wars film since a new hope who has loved this world more than rion johnson and the throne room scene has the greatest fight scene in all of star wars
Dec 20 2019,negative,why just why this film is a mess its almost like the person who wrote it didnt understand the universe he was writing in nor its characters should have stuck with jj
Dec 20 2019,negative,this is not star wars shockingly bad film avoid
Dec 20 2019,positive,plotwise it sucks  cinematically absolutelly amazing
Dec 20 2019,negative,this movie took everything that was being set up in episode 7 and threw it away a lot attempts of humor were out of place and made no sense from the opening scene the first order should have just blasted poe instead of the comedy bit luke tossing the lightsaber i could go on there was no character development too many new characters that werent needed instead we went on missions that didnt matter the movie was not only terrible as a stand alone but terrible as part of a series
Dec 20 2019,positive,interesting and disturbing but after seeing the rise of skywalker i can say the last jedi is a good movie
Dec 20 2019,negative,was a complete waste of time plot went nowhere and absolutely destroyed everything the force awakens set up theres no reason to watch this movie
Dec 20 2019,negative,some good action sequences and fight coordination dont prevent this film from falling on its face the plot is thin and an entire side story proves to be uneventful and unnecessary the characters you know and love seem to make decisions are completely out of character
Dec 20 2019,neutral,the last jedi had so much to build off of from its predecessor the force awakens however it is so focused on subverting expectations that it completely forgets about everything the force awakens set up and after the rise of skywalker it is basically irrelevant to the sequel trilogy it takes the character of luke skywalker and transforms him into something that the luke fans knew from the original trilogy could never be episode viii is an amazing film to anybody watching as a casual viewer and it certainly has its moments but as a star wars film it destroys everything that came before it and ruins what has to follow it
Dec 20 2019,negative,the only good thing about this film is the space battles and how well its shot this film is a slap in the face to all star wars fans
Dec 20 2019,negative,they killed luke skywalker please make this noncanon please
Dec 20 2019,positive,i dont get all this bad reviews for its was a good movieit brings a lot more new to the star wars
Dec 20 2019,positive,the last jedi suffered due to lack of direction as well as the mistreatment of some of the classic charctors but besides these flaws i find it to be very visually enjoyable and love mark hamils performance as luke
Dec 20 2019,negative,it does not surprise me that the most renown critics missed the point on this one even as a stand alone film it was poor it took out the crucial elements that all star wars have come to love about this universe i am gobsmacked with how many different arcs and questions they ruined and answered poorly im even more gobsmacked at the positive reviews
Dec 20 2019,negative,this was just bad and the director was so immature when it came to taking criticism from the fans the movie was horrid but it looks good its like the fake food in commercials it looks good but itd probably kill you
Dec 20 2019,positive,fantastic movie that i love so very much after 2 years amazing arcs and i love how this movie was driven by characters not mindless space battles and we could see a conflict in kylo ren and adam driver is just phenomenal
Dec 20 2019,negative,a garbage movie that is dishonest to the star wars cannon
Dec 20 2019,positive,loved how all characters were deepend developed and challenged to have agency and discover themselves more and more
Dec 20 2019,negative,would rather watch the pod racing scene from the phantom menace on loop for 3 hours than this
Dec 20 2019,negative,amazingly bad and stupid story where only about 30min of the movie is worthwhile to watch nothing makes sense and all of the characters are just awful in every sense and the worst of all this movie has no star wars feeling at all this is just stupid
Dec 20 2019,positive,this movie might be the most personal and artistic of all the star wars franchise mixing in rian johnsons signature directorial style with the bombastic action the franchise is known for johnson manages to capture what made the original trilogy work while also recontextualizing it for a new generation rather than be slavishly stuck in what fans want he decides to challenge the audience with twists and turns that could not be guessed rather than a nostalgic movie it is one that goes its own direction a franchise high m
Dec 20 2019,positive,this movie made me love star wars like no other movie in this franchise has rian johnson has put so much thought into the imagery of this film so that every detail adds to the themes of the balance of the force with light and dark coexisting as necessary compatriots rather then binary opposites
Dec 20 2019,negative,it takes a special kind of horrible to destroy something that people love and moc them while your doing it
Dec 20 2019,negative,stupid waste of time
Dec 20 2019,negative,sucked so hard  the milk seen wtf
Dec 20 2019,negative,visually beautiful movie but the choices rian makes with the story arent good
Dec 20 2019,negative,you subvert expectations by taking a story in new and unexpected directions not by having established characters act like entirely different characters or just randomly abandoning every single possible plot point thats not subversion thats a piece of shit story
Dec 20 2019,positive,it was aight kinda boring
Dec 20 2019,negative,it violates the established star wars canon in many ways and fundamentaly fails to handle the character of luke skywalker in an appropriate way in my opinion it is not even rian johnsons fault it is the fault of kathleen kennedy and those people who should ensure that the new star wars films do not violate the ot characters and do dumb stuff with the star wars laws the action and some twist are great though hate it or love it
Dec 20 2019,negative,worst star wars movie i have ever seen rian disrespected the fans and luke while also creating new ways to use the force that made zero sense jj set up everything in the force awakens and rian johnson took everything and threw it out the window because of this movie i dont care about the rest of the trilogy and like none of the characters remaining
Dec 20 2019,negative,visually spectacular but thats about it not just lacking in substance but the victim of an intentional deconstruction wherein the plot was tortuously twisted around subversion rather than subversion being used for the plot
Dec 20 2019,negative,the deliberate dismissal of the core themes that surround and underly star wars caused this film to crumble from the heroic sacrifices to the galactic car chases the action did not disguise the poor execution of the skywalker story
Dec 20 2019,neutral,some good parts that i liked only because i love star wars other than that rian johnson massacred the characters and lore ruined storylines in a pitiful attempt to subvert expectations and jeopardized the whole trilogy
Dec 20 2019,negative,thankfully jj abrams has wiped this pathetic movie from the face of the galaxy riseofskywalker
Dec 20 2019,positive,a great star wars film doesnt deserve the hate it gets from a certain section of the fan base 
Dec 20 2019,negative,wait so let me get this straight they were running low on fuel giant space ships chasing after one another because they were running low on fuel
Dec 20 2019,negative,visually appealing but completely forgot about the vacuum of space even for a space odyssey this is nonsense  least favorite scene was leahs impression of mary poppins  i think rian made a lot of bad decisions with this film
Dec 20 2019,negative,although a good movie it is a bad sequel and an even worse middle chapter of a trilogy there is nothing that moves the story forward it should have been the deatlhy hallows part i so audiences knew what the stakes were on ep 9 i i love the  character rose but the pointless journey she and finn go on is infuriating the humor of the movie is for first watch upon second viewing its cringeworthy i have spoken
Dec 20 2019,positive,first watch enjoyed it then i started to hate it then learned about cinema filmmaking and writing that combined with my vast sw knowledge i loved it as a movie i just see 2 flaws the way it handles its politics and the fact that it is not as easy to digest as other sw movies
Dec 20 2019,positive,it was the best star wars movie ever a lot of reylo a lot of pleasant sensations romance nostalgia i was flying for days after the movie i was in love true love rian johnson and all the actors gave us a fairy tale in the spirit of old episodes really compassionate full of empathy cozy emotions story was really alive
Dec 20 2019,positive,dont believe the haters this film is a masterpiece 
Dec 20 2019,negative,awful in every regard
Dec 20 2019,positive,the most nuanced star wars movie ever made
Dec 20 2019,negative,what a mess it was a mistake to forgo georges vision for those films
Dec 20 2019,positive,good movie doesnt deserve the hate it gets
Dec 20 2019,negative,dont care about whatever happened in the previous 7 movies i want to do something new rian johnson
Dec 20 2019,negative,what is this bs passed threw my mind multiple times watching this movie the character of luke was butchered many times throw out this socalled sw movie
Dec 20 2019,negative,shit its shit dont even waste your time absolutely useless to the plot of the skywalker saga
Dec 20 2019,positive,rian johnson made the best star wars ever this movie has so many layers and is absolutly stunning
Dec 20 2019,positive,so much better in retrospect than i gave it credit for
Dec 20 2019,positive,the last jedi is a challenging film  its not just empire strikes back again yet it is  rian johnson decided not to just have a i am your father moment rather he opted to make the entire film one big plot twist   this film is something star wars desperately needed it challenges not only what a star wars film is and should be but why it shows us why our obsession with mythical figures like luke skywalker is harmful and also hopeful and it reminds us that good and evil are the same coin    its also very very bloated its simply too long for not good enough reasons the entire canto bight sequence though filmed beautifully is awkward and does not contribute enough to actual plot even if it does so for the theme and characters     bottom line this movie is fantastic but its also complicated casual fans will fall in love hardcore fans might need a week to process what happened
Dec 20 2019,positive,the best directing and cinematography in all of star wars history
Dec 20 2019,negative,there are some amazing things about this movie but where it lacks it lacks hard  the last jedi waste most of the movie talking about fuel which separate all of the main characters this movie is very unsatisfactory
Dec 20 2019,positive,the best star wars movie of the new trilogy great acting and character development along with some awesome plot twists and story direction that make you question the force
Dec 20 2019,positive,as a star wars film it falls apart with its destruction of luke skywalker but as a film on its own it works incredibly well holdo and rose hold the film down but kylo and rey have excellent arcs in this movie
Dec 20 2019,negative,this movie ruined  star wars
Dec 20 2019,positive,its the best out of the sequel trilogy and it takes the most risks the visuals are fantastic
Dec 20 2019,negative,almost ruined my childhood director was terrible
Dec 20 2019,negative,piece of shit star wars are now transformers
Dec 20 2019,negative,it was done as if the writer director didnt understand the concept of star wars and even basic character concepts it would have been more satisfying if luke went to the dark side rather than becoming a fearful hermit that literally goes against everything the character stood for and because he had a moment of doubt critics seemed to love the artistic direction in this but also forgot to critique the very concept of story flow and narrative as well this story may have worked in another movie but in one filled with space knights and space wizards going back and forth in battle between light and dark with such a rich history to it it was not a good movie to tell it in at least the rise of skywalker made up for the damage done to a cohesive narrative from this film
Dec 20 2019,negative,i didnt think the new trilogy could get any worse buthere we are characters are still lacking in personality even though episode 7 reused a story it was far better than this movies story
Dec 20 2019,positive,the last jedi is a bold star wars movie important to keep the saga fresh for generations to come there are significant plot holes but the emotional payoff surely takes over and makes for an overall nice story
Dec 20 2019,negative,rian should never be near a classic franchise
Dec 20 2019,negative,does not fit the star wars saga at all stand alone great movie deserves the 90 in the saga worst movie
Dec 20 2019,positive,its one of the best films in the franchise with some of the greatest plot twists since episode v
Dec 20 2019,negative,rian johnson  how dare you
Dec 20 2019,negative,worst star wars ever the slapstick of hux getting thrown around and poe facing off in a tiny ship against an immeasurable one reminded me of watching space balls depressing
Dec 20 2019,negative,it felt like something you love decided to break up with you  empire strikes back was my favourite movie all time until this movie took that away
Dec 20 2019,negative,there has been enough reviews and youtube videos explaining thoroughly why this is not only a terrible star wars movie but a terrible movie in general the audience score speaks for itself
Dec 20 2019,negative,everything built up in the force awakens was quickly destroyed in this one movie along with 40 years of star wars movie history
Dec 20 2019,positive,an excellent installment with beautiful visuals action and story its not my favorite in the franchise but a great watch that expands the lore
Dec 20 2019,negative,rian johnson is a very talented director but his ability to write a good story is nonexistent maybe he should stick with directing and leave the writing up to someone else
Dec 20 2019,positive,had some rough patches but overall a great film
Dec 20 2019,negative,completely destroys beloved ot characters to satisfy the directors primordial urge to destroy anything fans hold dear
Dec 20 2019,positive,first impression was bad i watched it again before seeing episode 9 and enjoyed it much more the 2nd time
Dec 20 2019,negative,very boring with no climax at all just sad
Dec 20 2019,positive,went to see this film in 2017 and i still dont have a thing to say about this film i was speechless i was surprised and most of all i did not know what to think about this film i wouldnt say its bad because its not but after thinking two years later about it i have to say there were some bold decisions in this movie that i was not expecting at all but it was a little underwhelming because it did not have a light saber duel or something that would make this feel like star wars i know we are not going to get that but the charm of the originals is missing in these recent movies i feel like they tried please the critics instead of the audiences when it came to telling a compelling story about star wars and not make a rian johnson film
Dec 20 2019,negative,johnson should be very ashamed the damage done to the series is irreparable
Dec 20 2019,negative,horrible worst movie i have ever seen
Dec 20 2019,negative,a wellmeaning but failed attempt to do something different with the license visually spectacular with quality performances which are completely ruined by a long boring chase sequence and a completely unbelievable backstory the fringe terrorist radicals somehow take over the entire world over night which ironically retread the underdog rebel cliches of the classic trilogy     spoilers    the film introduced some interesting characters like holdo dj and particularly rose and then had them behave in bizarre and illogical ways refusing to brief your top pilot on the plan falling in love with finn in a day and trying to save him by forcing him into a highspeed collision maybe the latter was just a feeble backpeddle by disney because they were too afraid to commit to finn and po being the only worthwhile romantic subplot and killing the primary villain halfway through without bothering to explain anything about him was completely bizarre ultimately the films worst failure was that it left the third film in what was always supposed to be a trilogy with absolutely nothing to work with and it certainly showed that and it was so dull that people i saw it with fell asleep halfway through in spite of being lifelong star wars fans    but seriously if youre planning from the start to make a trilogy maybe write the entire story out first and make the directors stick to it instead of making it up as they go along
Dec 20 2019,negative,this may be the worst star wars film ever made besides maybe episode ii riddled with plot holes edgy and packed with narrative twists just for the sake of being unexpected character arcs veer off the rails the writing in this film is truly objectively awful and a disservice to the star wars legacy maybe if johnson wouldve had original characters to work with and not wedged this mess in the middle of a trilogy it couldve worked out better positive critic reviews for this film must be written merely to spite the fandom because even the most pretentious contrarian critic shouldnt be able to stomach this turd in good faith
Dec 20 2019,positive,this is a fine example of how subverting audience expectations can backfire while i respect what rian johnson was going for some of these changes make no sense but on the bright side his film becomes bold unpredictable and is gorgeously shot if not for the canto bite sub plot i wouldve appreciated it a bit more b
Dec 20 2019,negative,wow what a way to destroy star wars rian johnson you have destroyed luke skywalker as a character no real continuity of the story from episode 7 story was not fulfilling
Dec 20 2019,negative,star wars is a sf adventure serial that is supposed to be dumb fun rian johnson had the attitude that star wars tropes were boring and beneath him so he tried to make a depressing arthouse film completely fell flat and almost ruined the franchise
Dec 20 2019,negative,rian johnson may as well have spat in the face of star wars fans full of absolute character assassination and worthless side plots that do nothing to enhance the narrative this film shows a clear lack of respect for fans with the central message of kill the past seeming to forget the entire defining concepts of star wars
Dec 20 2019,positive,the last jedi is a masterpiece of cinema and one of the greatest star wars films of all time up there with the empire strikes back props to rian johnson for weaving such a finely crafted cinematic experience
Dec 20 2019,negative,the worst star wars by far
Dec 20 2019,negative,so many of the plot lines made no sense at all and were just boring especially that slow chase of the armada vs the one ship couldnt one or two of the armada just hyperspace in front of the ship  so many small things didnt make any sense in the star wars universe leah floating harmlessly through the vacuum of space how one little ship can destroy a huge one simply by going into hyperspace into it  no one ever thought of that before  so many things were pointless luke dying dead yoda destroying that cool jedi library milking a whale  it was simply a terrible terrible movie  i found that i neither knew nor cared how the characters  plot fit in with all thats gone before  i have seen all of the other episodes of star wars multiple times  i have zero interest in ever seeing this one again  i cant imagine how the last of the series could possibly get back on track  i have scant hope that it willbut im going to see it anyhow
Dec 20 2019,negative,well here they decide against copying episode 5  and someone had to use original thoughtswrong guy  didnt workout
Dec 20 2019,negative,the movie was trash rey is a nobody might as well kill snokes off screen with the way he died luke dying was trash rey out dueling luke was ridiculous that lightspeed ramming scene was garbage the casino scenes were cringy the whole chase scene was dumb and useless
Dec 20 2019,negative,garbage dont watch it if youre a fan of characters and good story
Dec 20 2019,negative,awful ruined star wars for me and i loved the original trilogy the whole snoke plot line makes no sense rey randomly has powers and the whole rose stuff is just stupid i feel like the movie was made for 7 year olds
Dec 20 2019,positive,the most original film talking about the plot with characters that develop in an unconventional way but in a very exciting way with very emotional performances and memorable moments the only problem is the comedy
Dec 20 2019,positive,rian johnson has a voice that honors the spirit of the force and the rebellion at the heart and soul of george lucass core as a human jedi artist and a filmmaker
Dec 20 2019,positive,honest confession this one doesnt deserve all the hate the story isnt great but it provides an awesome twist that really brings the saga into a new direction
Dec 20 2019,negative,unbelievably rude treatment of the legacy characters  ill never watch this mess again
Dec 20 2019,negative,the entire plot of the film made no sense i was brought to laughter at some scenes that were meant to be serious and emotional because the writing was so absurd i dont know how with all the money and resources available to disney that they were able to turn out such an awful finished product
Dec 19 2019,negative,without a doubt the worst star wars movie most of the movie is an uncreative slow motion chase sequence of a ship that is running out of fuel the rest is a terrible hoth ripoff and a completely pointless mission on a space casino not to mention that rian johnson destroyed luke skywalker as a character and put in a plot twist every 2 minutes without providing any background or context after
Dec 19 2019,positive,if youre an original star wars fan like i am you know that theres pretty tough criteria for a good star wars movie does this pass 100 id say i might even like it more than empire strikes back the adam driver scenes are always so dramatic and fitting the awkwardness really somehow adds to the plot
Dec 19 2019,negative,bruh this movie is what ruined star wars   this just ruined the skywalker saga
Dec 19 2019,positive,the most lucasesque movie of the st and my favorite of disney star wars by far
Dec 19 2019,positive,while not my favorite star wars and some werid plot holes i enjoyed the fight scenes and space fights
Dec 19 2019,negative,resaw this before rise of skywalker and holy cow its atrocious
Dec 19 2019,negative,so disappointing im not sure if i can keep giving these movies a chance so many plot holes it gave me a headache by the time the final fight got started i just didnt care anymore this franchise needs to spread out more get away from the jedi and the dark side get us emotionally attached to characters through great story telling then throw in the occasional light saber or force user it makes a heavier impression on the audience and adds to the legend rather than take away
Dec 19 2019,positive,a little complexbut greatnot a starwars movie for everyone who has many expectation for the saga but soon theyll remember the last jedi as one of the starwars excellent storyline like episode v
Dec 19 2019,negative,worst movie in the franchise and i have no idea how it got a high rating must be a fix
Dec 19 2019,positive,the dynamic of kylo ren and rey is amazing and a new story to star wars i found rose and finns storyline boring and it dragged on though i did appreciate finns character development by the end the fight scene in the throne room is a huge highlight  i found it visually stunning  as well
Dec 19 2019,negative,the last season of game of thrones but star wars
Dec 19 2019,negative,although the only sequel movie to try anything new within the star wars universe it obliterate any plot points  villains laid out in force awakens thus making it and the prior movie both irrelevant
Dec 19 2019,negative,star wars has come to mean bad movies and this is the worst of the lot
Dec 19 2019,positive,a must in the star wars saga
Dec 19 2019,negative,look how they massacred my boy george lucas
Dec 19 2019,negative,storyline makes little sense internally and no sense in the larger star wars universe
Dec 19 2019,negative,rian johnson should have edited the canto bight scene out any first year film student can see that i could have done a better job
Dec 19 2019,negative,this movie broke my heart and star wars
Dec 19 2019,positive,i loved it full of unexpected plot twists and diversity between characters great cgi and action scenes i also dont think it deserves all the hate

Dec 19 2019,positive,decent film but had too many flaws that could have been easily fixed
Dec 19 2019,negative,this movie ruined one of my personal favorite characters of all time i left the theater so disappointed that i wont go to see the next movie in the theater
Dec 19 2019,negative,complete bs they ruined it completely
Dec 19 2019,positive,too many questions unanswered or answered in the worst kind of way too many political messages too many humans not enough alien races that we know useless new characters and the spaceship crash scene destroys the original trilogy  original characters who are not themselves anymore too many unfunny jokes that ruins the movie
Dec 19 2019,positive,one of the best star wars movies
Dec 19 2019,negative,i have no desire to see rise due to this movie so sad star wars has become such a joke
Dec 19 2019,positive,worst star wars movie scene ever is liea flying thru some  but the battle scenes and lukes negative attitude were fantastic
Dec 19 2019,negative,this movie doesnt have the star wars spirit completely out of context the destruction of lukes character is an offense to the fans
Dec 19 2019,negative,dont bother with this trash  great visuals tho
Dec 19 2019,negative,it was very poor  they ruined the franchise  i cannot believe i used to love this
Dec 19 2019,negative,terrible storyline could barley keep me entertained and there is fcking  lightsaber battles should give away what a shifty movie this is
Dec 19 2019,negative,biggest disappointment of 2017 disgrace to original trilogy
Dec 19 2019,negative,rian johnson simply destroyed star wars given the lifetime opportunity to engrave his name in one of the most valuable cultural treasure of humanity and took a dump in it  the force the jedi order luke skywalker yoda  nothing survived his will to show himself as a think different by crushing georges lucas lifetime work
Dec 19 2019,negative,is very bad i want my money back  im just sad about how they damage this saga btw critics give 90 what a joke this not even deserve 110
Dec 19 2019,negative,really  luke  its so bad movie  
Dec 19 2019,negative,i am a huge star wars fan and i have never been so disappointed after seeing a movie
Dec 19 2019,negative,the last jedi where to begin i wrote over 20000 words dissecting this convoluted mess of a film already but let me sum it up here quickly  visually the film is stunning but unfortunately this is all just filmmaking magic and it lacks storytelling magic i dont understand why people say this film subverts expectations i got exactly what i predicted was going to happen they blended elements from episode v and vi together and made a new messy film i predicted every single one of the supposed plot twists and found the execution utterly pointless and boring worst of all the film not only ignores but actively tries to coutneract every storystrand set up in the previous film and even sets up red herrings throughout the story that would have been actually interesting if they were allowed to play out only to not dare to go there that does not subvert my expectations it just makes for bad writing this is further illustrated not only with a lack of understanding and love for the source material butchering established characters but also with a lack of coherence in the logic of the film itself not only does it contradict previous films in the saga it contradicts itself in several scenes most viewers may not have noticed this but space ships act like aeroplanes in all scenes there is no depressurisation in one scene then it appears then it is lacking again in another make up your mind the hyperspace ram was spectacular but completely devoid of logic so were all battle tactics on all sides and most actions of all characters the characters cant even make up their minds on whether or not they are the resistance or the rebel alliance all of this was so we could have multiple convoluted storythreads between which we switch at a nauseating pace while not moving the main story forward by even an inch that all end in a finale that once more sends us back to where we were in 1977 boring more of the same been there done that with one message failure failure is the greatest teacher well lets hope lucasfilm learns from this catastrophic failure
Dec 19 2019,positive,moments of brilliance overshadowed by moments of utter stupidity this film had so much potential and whilst ultimately a fun watch couldve been so much more
Dec 19 2019,negative,throws away all the fundamentals of star wars too much suicide for a kids movie
Dec 19 2019,negative,a very effective attempt to destroy everything that made the originals successful
Dec 19 2019,negative,it is an abomination
Dec 19 2019,negative,this is a tedious and unpleasant movie     the way they handled lukes character was really dumb
Dec 19 2019,negative,the only thing i loved about this was adam drivers character kylo ren is tearing himself apart over his internal conflict and driver does a great way of portraying it  otherwise there is not a whole lot to love some interesting concepts are touched upon but it feels rather superficial characters are acting dumb the reason for some kinds of internal conflict are dumb there are some plotholes but most of them can be excused in my opinion johnsons whole shtick about not caring about the the franchise up until now its established rules and plot set up by abrams ranges from making me feel condescended to to headshaking confusion especially after watching ep 9 you notice that this is the movie that turns the trilogy into a clusterf  i dont believe history will be kind to this movie
Dec 19 2019,negative,poor plot if any  irrelevant plot lines like star wars first parking ticket violation ever  bollywood like sword fight dance scenes in snokes palace  completely random unimportant key figures like snoke rose finn and the broom guy at the end  that had a start but just ran out of importance into irrelevance the second after
Dec 19 2019,positive,it was a fun ride a decent movie to see once if you dont think too hard about it
Dec 19 2019,negative,this is not star wars
Dec 19 2019,negative,so many character choices that just dont make sense
Dec 19 2019,negative,terrible i love star wars but this was horrible
Dec 19 2019,positive,seriously the best star wars movie ive ever seen sorry it got bombed by whiny fanboys
Dec 19 2019,negative,this movie makes a mockery of everything that is star wars rian johnson trys to play it off like hes trying subvert our expectations but what he actually did was prove that he knows nothing about what makes a star wars movie jj did a great job at laying a foundation that made us want to come back and see all of our questions answered that doesnt happen he kills luke off in the most disrespectful way imaginable all of the questions that we had were played as meaningless but these questions are why the film did so well in the first place people wanted answers to all the questions raised in jjs film even hishe did a better job at telling this story it also put jj in the awkward position of trying to pick up the pieces for the final installment in the trilogy which was also terrible you cant even call it a trilogy because the two directors didnt even try and work with one another to try and make the best possible product now were left with three movies that all feel very different
Dec 19 2019,negative,in a trilogy built on nostalgia this movie draws in people due to the old characters but due to the poorly integrated progressive themes and the old characters acting nothing like themselves this movie hardly deserves the star wars name nor association with luke skywalker    if this wasnt bad enough characters like finn get hardly as much development as they should and get cheated out of a heros death which wouldve at the very least made the movie have an impactful ending    the only thing to say about this movie is it looks good but its not that surprising considering the budget
Dec 19 2019,negative,terribly movie fails on every level either script filming actin terrible terrible terrible would give a negative score
Dec 19 2019,negative,this movie was a complete waste of money and time please send all this new trilogy to the trash and start all over with the people making the mandalorian in charge
Dec 19 2019,negative,worst star wars film there is completely ruins the saga with only 1 or 2 decent scenes should have let jj direct it
Dec 19 2019,negative,i enjoyed this movie when i first watched it and even tried defending it from its ardent detractors however i quickly came to realize that saiddetractors were actually right all along the last jedi may be bold and subversive but its a mess too the films characters motivations and behaviors erratically change whenever the story desires its admittedly intriguing deconstruction of the balance in the force is confusing and contradictory and the disregard it has for its predecessors makes this installment all the more frustrating and unlikable the constantly shifting tone nonsensical plotting such as holdo refusing to reveal her plan to her crew and pointless subplots and characters dont help
Dec 19 2019,negative,the worst film of the saga you fan really tell that rian johnson hates star wars
Dec 19 2019,positive,the best installment to date great directing and writing by rian johnson unforgettable visuals reminiscent of all time cinema classics it took the saga to unexpected new places and i just wish rian came back for epix as well
Dec 19 2019,negative,the worst movie of all time
Dec 19 2019,negative,just awfull an insult to the star wars saga
Dec 19 2019,negative,just no you cant a save a trilogy from two inconsistent movies by overloading the third with plot twists and lore to plug the gaps
Dec 19 2019,negative,ive seen the movie 3 times now mostly because i wanted to give it a second chance and then my fiance wanted to see it i have come to the firm conclusion that this is a shame to the star wars name and a completely awful story that proves rian johnson have zero talent
Dec 19 2019,negative,this movie broke star wars you dont destroy your main character in a franchise and make him a coward
Dec 19 2019,negative,im sorry to see what this universe has turned into  darth vader forgive us
Dec 19 2019,negative,not worth your money rian johnson ruined the movie
Dec 19 2019,negative,ruined everything that is saga and left many unanswered questions 
Dec 19 2019,negative,imagine paying to watch this filth  ha ha ha  that shit is hella rotten
Dec 19 2019,negative,this is not who luke is its possible but not probable
Dec 19 2019,negative,disgrace to the franchise
Dec 19 2019,negative,this movie was not star wars if there was an option to give it zero stars i would i think that rian johnson tried to make this movie more like a marvel movie by adding all of that humor but it doesnt work in star wars like it does in marvel movies they also ruined lukes character by making super whiny and just not like he was in the original movies luke was meant to be a wise jedi master not an unreasonable uncle who tried to kill his nephew in his sleep there were also so many unanswered questions in this movie i get that rian johnson tried to make star wars different but as the saying goes if it aint broke dont fix it
Dec 19 2019,negative,worst star wars film of all time ive never seen a movie made that actively hates its fans
Dec 19 2019,negative,absolute rubbish breaks the law and way too wanky
Dec 19 2019,negative,this movie was so bad that i almost walked out of the theater but instead i held on for dear life hoping the movie would end quickly this movie is the result of pandering to people who dont care about good character development and storytelling if your only goal for a movie is to push an agenda then make a documentary this movies was trash with an added pile of dog s on top of it
Dec 19 2019,negative,this movie should never had been shown there is only one reason for it and that is to honor the late carrie fisher and that sadly made it impossible to redo this movie kills all questions and plots from the first movie in a very disrespectful manner shame on you disney to allow such crap to be presented to the star wars audience
Dec 19 2019,negative,this is not a star wars movie  this one is big pile of shit
Dec 19 2019,negative,what a stinker of a movie i am so depressed everything good from star wars was casually thrown out to make way for such a jumbled collection of poorly written characters and absurd running around to find nothing the action scenes were terrible  the throne room fights was the poorest chirography ever and wtf with those red salts racers the biggest problem was how it threw away any consistency with the story built up in the previous 7 movies and left the next one hanging in the make it up as you go wilderness
Dec 19 2019,negative,just rewatched in preparation of rise of skywalker and it is still the worst star wars ever made everything set up in force awakens is thrown out the window just for the sake of subverting expectations unlikeable characters few and terrible action sequences a lot of sitting around waiting for fuel to run out and the dumbest side quest to canto bight that goes nowhere the worst part is the betrayal of lukes character we are supposed to believe that the same luke who was willing to die in order to bring his father back from the dark side would now be so quick to murder another family member merely for the possibility that he might be influenced by snoke rian johnson obviously is not a star wars fan and should stay far far away from this galaxy the mandalorian stands in stark contrast to this abomination and feels like the true star wars we all know and love
Dec 19 2019,negative,the rise of skywalker saves this film from being a total miss
Dec 19 2019,negative,all around bad film that is not enjoyable to watch convoluting plot line wasted characters disappointing buildups just to begin
Dec 19 2019,positive,who are these critics how can they be so wrong i dont get it
Dec 19 2019,negative,absolute trash rian johnson essentially has ruined both the new and old star wars stories
Dec 19 2019,positive,breath of fresh air in the skywalker saga the changes are nice and its not a copy of empire strikes back new characters new lore new planets are a nice welcome for future spin offs light comedy and not forced old characters touch on looking forward form your own opinions dont follow trends
Dec 19 2019,negative,zero character development  by the end of the 2nd installment of these movies i still cant recall 5 main characters original trilogy members excluded by name  there is no background story for any new character in these movies except for adam drivers character  i dont care or identify with any of them  the entire premise of the movie is essentially a car chase where the faster car rebel ship might run out of gas and get caught by the bigger slower car first order ship  and the bizarre side story with the casino felt like a different movie that didnt belong  lazy writing
Dec 19 2019,negative,good effects and a few laughs thats where the positive end for me in its efforts to push social addenda instead of story telling it destroyed the skywalker storyline and make a rather uninteresting and fragmented movie two hours of my life ill never get back
Dec 19 2019,negative,no no noooo any creative for rian johnson leia poppins rose and finn terrible
Dec 19 2019,negative,really bad movie  ruined the legacy of the original three movies
Dec 19 2019,positive,most mature star wars movie with deep story twists and emotional impact
Dec 19 2019,neutral,the movie passed the time but lacked imagination and creativity
Dec 19 2019,positive,after the rise of skywalker it is evident that the last jedi is one of the best star wars film ever
Dec 19 2019,negative, just empty nothing interesting plotline doesnt match holes and well just a real pile of garbage
Dec 19 2019,positive,this movie have some of the best scene and visual that i have ever seen in starwars but when i watch the movie some other scene where not working for me the rhythm of the movie was cut because of them princess leah flying some slow motion fake suspense did not do it for me rian j is a great director but was not for me surrounded properly to help him in the decision department
Dec 19 2019,negative,a terribly stupid movie that destroyed our favorite characters and their story
Dec 19 2019,negative,absolute garbage poor writing and they completely threw out what jj abrams did for the first movie in the new trilogy
Dec 19 2019,negative,this movie was bad the choreography was terrible only second to the characters lines ships stopped moving from lack of fuel in space no new characters like smoke were actually explained or given any backstory episode 7 set up a good clean slate for episode 8 and they just ruined it this movie was to be simply put terrible
Dec 18 2019,negative,disappointing left theatres feeling empty unsatisfied and not much excited for the next instalment the plot lacks direction and the pace of the film is a mess the humour feels out of placeforced no pun intended and is basically silly at times to the detriment of the characters it does have some surprises but unfortunately theyre only their for the purpose of subverting expectations and these decisions overall hurt the larger narrative in conclusion its mostly a disappointment because of the potential unrealised here and the lack of either understanding or respect for the source material
Dec 18 2019,negative,when i saw this movie i cried the star wars have died in a heaping pile of steam this movie was hard to follow and i threw up a few times in my mouth please sell it all back to lucas
Dec 18 2019,negative,just a cinamitic disaster nothing in this film makes sense
Dec 18 2019,neutral,of all the star wars feature films this is the only one that has truly left me feeling let down  it seemed to be in galaxy far far away from previous movies in the franchise i left the theater so confused after watching it several times i decided it is ok but not good
Dec 18 2019,negative,supremely disappointing  mission accomplished rj my expectations were wildly subverted
Dec 18 2019,negative,piece of garbage 2 years ago and even today still garbage
Dec 18 2019,negative,im only giving this movie 12 a star because they wont let me give it zero  easily the worst movie in the franchise thus far
Dec 18 2019,negative,the story of star wars is aniken the chosen one will bring balance to the forces and peace in the galaxy but he actually ends up becoming a sith lord and the balance is way off because of him but eventually luke gets him to turn back to the light side of the force and he does bring peace to the galaxy after all and the prophecy was right buy making this movie it ruins the first 6 movies and the stories they told at least the force awakens was decent even tho it was just basically a movie of re visiting the original 3 movies the last jedi had to be the worst movie i have ever seen in my life just pure crap i cant believe this is actually a movie and somehow got released
Dec 18 2019,positive,i do not hate the last jedi as much as most people do but it is still kind of crappy it is better than phantom menace and attack of the clones for sure but it ruins so many beloved characters they demolished luke and the new characters and snoke is so under used
Dec 18 2019,negative,ruined everything that came before it including  episode vii  the force awakens  what ever i  type can already be found on other reviews from the story characters current political ideology shoe horned in  wont be going to the see the last one of this saga
Dec 18 2019,positive,if youre not an entitled fanboy that thinks every movie should cave to your demands then youre going to enjoy this
Dec 18 2019,negative,inconsistent lazy idiotic
Dec 18 2019,positive,while the last jedi certainly had its flaws boring fuel driven plot and canto byte sequence its still a fundamentally good movie luke and leias reunion might be one of the best scenes in all of star wars
Dec 18 2019,negative,ryan johnson tried his best to ruin star wars with his let the past die them  this movie could have been great if it wasnt almost everything he did  from luke throwing away his fathers lightsaber to the 2hour ship chase oh and the casino scene that leads to nowhere  then the worst part killing luke skywalker  i wish disney would delete this movie from the franchise and remake it
Dec 18 2019,negative,bad writing bad acting bad plot stupid sub plots terrible character development on characters you were supposed to care about mary poppins general organa plot holes galore killing off some of the mystery of characters such as snoke one of the worst of the franchise
Dec 18 2019,negative,long story short rey is a mary sue character fin is a mary sue character or whatever the male version of that is luke dies for no reason at all snoke dies without getting explained there are a ton of plotholes from the last movie     only reason i didnt give it a lower rating is because the visuals are pretty cool and the lightspeed into the dreadnought was a pretty cool scene      i watched this movie but its so forgettable i barely remember any of the characters
Dec 18 2019,positive,one of the best star wars movies evah
Dec 18 2019,negative,they should have had writers and directors that know star wars lore the mandalorian thankfully has saved star wars
Dec 18 2019,negative,you probably noticed that the movies entire plot gets thrown out of the window with the literal kamikaze bombing that takes place at the end i wish disney had kept their money hungry hands off this franchise
Dec 18 2019,positive,episode 8 gets stagnant at times and doesnt answer many of the looming questions i was hoping to get answers from in episode 7 nonetheless its another fun action packed film with snokes throne room scenes being my favorite
Dec 18 2019,negative,seriously how much does disney pay these professional reviewers  91 did you accidentally walk into the joker and somehow thought you were watching episode 9 this was a muddled ball of derp visually stunning of course but as idioticif not more than the last save your money wait for it to drop on d in a few monthsand at that time you can wish that star wars had not gone out like game of thrones did
Dec 18 2019,negative,atrocious the movie has major tonal problems and is more concerned with adverting your expectations than creating a good story honestly a disaster and a mess
Dec 18 2019,negative,this movie would have been better off with a director that understands the lore and respects the material  ryan johnson clearly forgot how to make a a decent movie and disrespected luke for fun
Dec 18 2019,negative,saw this movie on deployment with four buddiesmy four buddies fell asleep half way through while i stayed awake watching leia superman her way through space
Dec 18 2019,negative,still remember how i felt 2 years ago i felt insulted at the humor i felt how they insulted every old fan of the franchise good thing i wasnt a fan poor lightsaber fights and 1 hour of the movie was filler watched it again recently and it feels worse not worth your time
Dec 18 2019,negative,worst star wars movie ever    the worst scene was when they killed the entire first order fleet with a hyperspeedramming manouver  i literally thought about leaving the theatre
Dec 18 2019,negative,not a good movie at all hard to watch
Dec 18 2019,negative,terrible terrible movie completely screws over luke skywalker and what the force awakens was trying to set up
Dec 18 2019,negative,ruins everything 
Dec 18 2019,negative,this movie is messy with very childish dialogue and nonsensical character decisions i have no idea what the critics saw in it
Dec 18 2019,neutral,like most of the new star wars films do this film feels like a cash grab personally i dont think disney understand star wars thought the sequel trilogy theyve wasted characters with plenty of potential such as finn fn2187 who originally i thought was going to be the jedi of the trilogy i think in the past couple star wars films theyve overused female leads    while this film was fun to watch in cinema the more i look back on it the more i see the floors for example the throne room scene in the scene weapons appear out of no where and they guards do unnecessary twirls and moves and dont forget the scene when princess leia uses force powers to return back to her ship    i love star wars and it has became part of our culture the floors of this film is all down to bad directing and writing choices rather than the acting 
Dec 18 2019,negative,it was a technically good movie maybe the best star wars movie productionwise in my opinion but the memories i have of this movie are mostly in the realm of god i still cant believe that happened not really in a good way i do appreciate the gambling with the story but i dont think star wars is the place to do it the plots other than the main plot did absolutely nothing for me and i found uninteresting and although i know star wars is not a very grounded fantasy series it still took me out of the story to see leia suddenly using jedi unseen powers and luke as well i had much hope in luke as a bitter old man i liked it as a twist at the beginning but it feels like the movie did nothing with it like the whole jedi order meant nothing the whole time it was a good movie but in my opinion a very bad star wars movie that took me out of the plot so much and so many times that it did nothing emotionally for me and thats what i watch movies for
Dec 18 2019,positive,where to begin the last jedi makes a valiant effort to break the mould to be different to be a fresh original instalment in disneys trilogy in that respect rian johnsons star wars debut is an undeniable success the film has dazzling special effects the action sequences are fantastic and the relationship between rey and kylo ren is tantalising however in every other respect the last jedi fails miserably johnson spends its entire running time trying earnestly to butcher the much loved luke skywalker he breaks decades old star wars lore and it wont surprise me if the film becomes antonymous with fan service overall a brave effort but jj abrams has been left with a herculean task to try and rescue the trilogy you should see it but rewatching may send you round the bend
Dec 18 2019,positive,best episode of whole 9 films
Dec 18 2019,negative,worst star wars movie to date the most disappointing movie of the decade
Dec 18 2019,positive,is a good film  good direction
Dec 18 2019,negative,forced social politics and a plot that makes no sense this movie degrades all of the core star wars characters especially luke skywalker this movie is boring full of villains that are no real threat and a hero in rrey that has no weaknesses no struggle no training a mary sue other than bashing men this movie has no purpose
Dec 18 2019,negative,boring and lot of scenes which were not required for the main theme
Dec 18 2019,positive,saw this 4 times in theaters still one of my favorites of all the sw movies top 3 for sure rian johnson knows how to make movies and he nailed it on this one cant wait to see where he takes star wars next
Dec 18 2019,negative,so disappointing what a turd makes little sense and the twists undermine past films
Dec 18 2019,positive,theres a lot of hate around this movie from star wars fans im a star wars fun not a super fan who can name even the characters who have been on screen for one second but i know a decent amount of lore and such there is plenty this movie does horrible but theres also a lot of fun to this movie seeing luke again is fun even if hes not the same luke from episode 6 watching kylo attempt to step out of vaders shadow was great then theres the entire casino section poorly paced bad acting bad story the ending with rose isnt great either i dont think this movie deserves the hate it gets but i also dont think its a masterpiece
Dec 18 2019,negative,i could have enjoyed the dumb jokes if they werent always undercutting serious moments  i could have enjoyed the bland characters if they werent always alternating between chaotic stupid and lawful stupid  i could have enjoyed the the villains if they posed any real threat  i could have enjoyed the heroes if they had any real character development  i could have enjoyed this movie if it wasnt just a subversive poorlyplanned nihilistic mess it honestly would have been better as an episode of venture bros than star wars because at least then the themes of failure stupidity and cheesy dialogue wouldnt have been so jarringly out of place
Dec 18 2019,negative,a wrongheaded deconstruction of one of films legendary iconic heroes rian johnson decides that he know better than everyone else and makes a movie which is titled star wars but in reality has nothing to do with george lucas creation and vision its the only star wars movie ive watched just one timeand honestlythat was one time too many
Dec 18 2019,positive,was great to see luke yoda etc it expanded jedi powers and asked more questions than answered it is a mixed bag
Dec 18 2019,negative,this is lesson one on how to kill a great franchise the pc crowd and the agenda driven have no idea how to make a good story
Dec 18 2019,negative,just sooooooooo boring personal opinion
Dec 18 2019,negative,it does not hold true to the spirit of the star wars universe to much agenda dialogue and virtue signaling from the directors beating us over the head  not enough storytelling hopefully disney has learned its lesson if it wishes to continue to make money via the franchise
Dec 18 2019,negative,absolute trash this is not a star wars film
Dec 18 2019,positive,finally a creative and bold star wars
Dec 18 2019,negative,rian johnson wrote this script in three days and took a nap and then made it into a movie absolutely no character development at all huge plot holes
Dec 18 2019,negative,this film is not a star war film i rather see alec balwin chasing sean connery thats more thrilling than the last jedi rian johnson messed it up
Dec 18 2019,positive,incredibly daring my second favorite 
Dec 18 2019,negative,the new director is tone deaf to the nature of epic science fiction for example with bits of humor that are inconsistent with the genre  hes not the only offenderas well as disney has handled marvel ip its handled star wars as poorly  the attempt to go off into another thematic direction is inconsistent with a skywalker saga that purports to encompass all three trilogies  the key word is attempt because as much as the director would like to take star wars in a different directioneg with muddling the good versus evil struggle in the form of suggesting some alliance between rey and kylothat never reaches escape velocity  this film delights critics for taking chances and growing the franchise in a different direction but its inorganic and not all growth is good like cancer
Dec 18 2019,negative,indisputably the worst nonanimated star wars movie of all time or was when it came out  this movie fails on virtually every level  not only does the plot appear to have been written by a 5year old but it also makes the audience hate many highranking characters for being so stupid  the story also drags during the scenes with rey and skywalker    spoilers below  a large premise of the movie involves a super long chase scene a day or two in sublight speeds with the entire first order armada and the resistance  the resistance sends a ship out to get help and then warp back  this is one of the major plot holes in the movie as why couldnt the first order just send half their armada ahead and cut them off  the entire concept of the bombers is bad  the entire concept of their best fighter pilot being such a loose cannon that hes useless makes you wonder why he still even has a job  the admiral refusing to tell literally anyone her plan even though theres no possible harm in telling people and telling people the plan would give them hope and prevent them from making rash decisions was an idiotic story bit that should never have existed  the idea that hyperdrive engines could be used as a superweapon breaks the entire universe as droidmanned kamikaze ships would absolutely be a thing if that was as easy as this movie makes it  when someone is about to sacrifice themselves id4style to save the entire resistance you let them do it  luke skywalkers death was pointless and left me screaming but why did that kill him
Dec 18 2019,negative,this movie is a pile of steaming sht
Dec 18 2019,negative,simply horrible  all the time waiting for a duel between luke  and kylo and in the end it was that shame  nothing in the movie is good
Dec 18 2019,negative,the last jedi throws away everything that makes star wars star wars the director tries to be different for the sake of being different and puts the greatest movie series in disarray
Dec 18 2019,positive,a very good rian johnson movie but not the best star wars movie johnson succeeds on so many levels but there are areas that do not fit at all as a sequel to the force awakens the last jedi tries a lot of new things some work but some completely mishandle story set up by jj abrams  it fails to set things up for a grand finale instead ending on a mediocre note that doesnt leave much room for buildup a couple of tweaks could have made this a great movie it needed some discussion with abrams to better connect the stories in the end youre left with a pretty average star wars tale
Dec 18 2019,negative,this is my least favorite star wars film by a mile     while it is no doubt well filmed the choices that rian johnson made for the characters were horrible and the decision to throw away much of what the force awakens set up is unforgivable if the rise of skywalker fails to conclude the sage it is this movies fault     the three main characters poe finn and rey do not have any bonding moments during this film and poe and rey dont even meet for the first time until the very end of it whoever mark hamill was forced to play in this film was not luke skywalker rian and his team made the dumb choice to leave leia alive at the end of the film even though carrie fisher had passed away i mean if paramount is willing to spend months of time and tens of millions of dollars to fix sonic the hedgehogs face just to make fans happy i think disney could have took some time and paid whatever it cost to reshoot some scenes so that jj or whoever was slated to direct episode 9 at the time wouldnt have to solve the problem     in all this film destroyed the disney trilogy and nearly the whole franchise of star wars and rian johnson should never be forgiven for that though he is a fine filmmaker and i would suggest watching his newest film knives out if you have not already    my review d
Dec 18 2019,negative,rian johnson should probably quit making sci fi movies
Dec 18 2019,positive,star wars is evolving and we have rian johnson to thank for it
Dec 18 2019,positive,massively underrated highly enjoyable and best of new trilogy films so far
Dec 18 2019,negative,terrible movie absolutely disrespects the franchise and its fans one has to question if johnson has enough imagination to make a movie of this sort please do not give him another opportunity
Dec 18 2019,negative,this movie destroyed the following   the point of the throne room scene in the ot   all deathstar battles from the ot   luke   the force   all future space battles   my interest in any new star wars movies or products   great job disney and rian johnson in particular i didnt know it was possible to mess things up this badly while trying not to
Dec 18 2019,negative,visually pleasing but i find it to by a logical disaster seeing it in the theaters was unbearable for me nothing feels natural not a whole lot happens in the movie
Dec 18 2019,negative,watch robot head on youtube and you will my know the point
Dec 18 2019,negative,this movie ruined the franchise imo it was terrible disney had the money but they didnt have a plan or the talent to make a good trilogy
Dec 18 2019,negative,what disney has done to the star wars story and the characters is disgraceful getting a 40 year old story and destroying it is something disney and kathleen kennedy should be ashamed off
Dec 18 2019,positive,not sure why the audience seemed to like the cliche force awakens better anyhow i found this movie to be much better than force awakens it wasnt completely a spinoff of the originals and i felt there was more unique concepts in this movie than force awakens not the best movie but definitely a step up from force awakens
Dec 18 2019,negative,absolutely terrible in every way pointless plot ruined characters pointless characters can watch the force awakens then the rise and skip this movie and it wouldnt matter
Dec 18 2019,positive,epic as hell saw in the theater wile on my usa holiday absolutely truly epic as hell
Dec 18 2019,positive,the end was meh waste of 2 12 hours but it was a good follow through for the next movie
Dec 18 2019,neutral,star warsy enough that im glad it was made whole 30min arc that went nowhere that was started by questionable decisions by a brand new character luke goes from redeeming darth vader to trying to kill his nephew and leaving to die alone and hopeless
Dec 18 2019,negative,the worst film in the whole saga
Dec 18 2019,negative,horrible why perfect something and subvert expectations when the originals 3 are better than every way like i really tried but if me a guy who thought terminator 3 was good you know you fucked up
Dec 17 2019,negative,was happy and excited to see it the movie turned out to be a huge mistake now im pretending this monstrosity never happened
Dec 17 2019,negative,this movie is what star wars looks like in the wrong hands trash utter trash
Dec 17 2019,negative,hot garbage the reason i am no longer spending money on disney starwars
Dec 17 2019,negative,if you think that making decisions that make no sense is a good way to tell a story then youll love this movie
Dec 17 2019,negative,this is the worst star wars movie of them all not just because it takes a massive crap on the franchise but it has plot holes timing issues and is a carbon copy of the empire strikes back   watch it to see how far the franchise has fallen and see how big of a middle finger rian johnson gave to lucas
Dec 17 2019,negative,thematically conflicting nightmare character arcs were literally pointless and undid themselves in the third act the film shat on the established physics and lore of the star wars universe only redeeming factor was the film explored the nature of the force more
Dec 17 2019,negative,garbage no respect at all
Dec 17 2019,negative,only die hard super star wars fans would even think this movie is someone enjoyable by far the worst star wars movie in the entire saga on many different levels disney has now destroyed the star wars franchise with this piece
Dec 17 2019,negative,incoherent plot with bland characters no struggle for rey no respect for previous cannon or characters past it completely rewrites the personality of characters like luke without context or reason it is like rian never even watched the previous movies before making this one
Dec 17 2019,negative,unbelievably bad writing and direction no meaningful story arc every plot point is nonsense every scene in in some way defies reasoning no character development no relatablity no continuity  ignores everything we already understand about this universe some decent acting and special effects as expected with a movie with this budget the rest is a steaming pile of hot postmodern garbage
Dec 17 2019,negative,garbage totally disrespectful of everything that came before it
Dec 17 2019,negative,rian johnson spat on the series with his misinterpretation of the simple characteristics that makes star wars so special while episode 7 was a love letter to the series episode 8 was a mockery of it
Dec 17 2019,negative,what have they done to stay wars  cant believe the critic reviews either
Dec 17 2019,negative,the reason i gave this movie any stars is because the visuals are great and the actors did a good job especially mark hamill who went against everything luke skywalker stands for
Dec 17 2019,negative,probably the worst star wars film to date did not advance the plot of the force awakens poor character development bad writing
Dec 17 2019,negative,any true star wars fan cannot get through 5 minutes of this movie without thinking to themselves why did they do this from start to finish it is a complete mess with no depth and its only savinggrace comes from talented acting of mark and other returning characters despite a garbage script overall this is easily the worst star wars movie ever and completely ruins the plotlines the first movie had developed even worse it robs you of the excitement for the next movie
Dec 17 2019,negative,they are ruining the franchise
Dec 17 2019,negative,while visually stunning and wellacted this is more like a hipster spoof of star wars than an actual star wars film  the problems with the plot story elements and characterizations in tlj are legion and have been muchdiscussed over the past two years since its release  but the most glaring failure and the most unforgivable in the eyes of many star wars fans was the portrayal of luke as a misanthropic selfexiled recluse and the hopelessly unlukelike rationalization given for his ostensible fall from grace  i doubt this film wouldve still ended up with a 43 audience score if his character had been handled in a more thoughtful and respectful manner  as mindboggling as it sounds the director obviously underestimated just how much the audience cared about the main characters from the original trilogy  the result was a film that drained all the wonder and excitement from star wars for the foreseeable future  to put that into perspective the three prequels werent very good films but they were still recognizably star wars and managed to carry its torch into the 21st century  tlj is a wellproduced film but unrecognizable as star wars and may have irrecoverably damaged the franchise for years to come
Dec 17 2019,positive,absolutely good film complete story arcs and takes the story where it needs to grow most of the people that dont like it barely even remember what happens in it they think rey is is some sort of mary sue   luke and anakin are more marysue than she is
Dec 17 2019,negative,even if it wasnt a star wars movie it would still be terrible but because its technically a star wars movie it makes it so much worse
Dec 17 2019,positive,sure it had some flaws here and there star wars the last jedi is not that bad of a star wars movie with complete honest
Dec 17 2019,negative,star wars has gone downhill the mains characters of this series have been pushed aside not worth seeing
Dec 17 2019,positive,star wars the last jedi was 10x better then the empire strikes back
Dec 17 2019,negative,this film gets points for being well crafted on a technical level  visually it looks pretty not beautiful but pretty  unfortunately the poor jokes and flaccid dialogue ruins any tension it tries to build    what really destroys the film for me however is that it doesnt advance the plot anywhere  most of the film is spent on a starship and the rest is spent doing nothing meaningful on the ground  theres no active role for the characters caught up in those moments  they simply talk and nothing more  at its core it mirrors empire strikes back but with esb the characters play an active role in moving around echo base dodging star destroyers and tie fighters and walking around cloud city until getting capture  meanwhile the jedi in training rushes back to save the day only to fail    the dialogue advances the plot rather than serving as filler  new things are learned different character traits are added together and plenty of twists occur  thats an adventure right there and thats how character development is created    this film lacks the same ingredients as its predecessor  thats why it can mirror esb but not capture any of its magic  essentially a skilled chef can only do so much with a 10 steak
Dec 17 2019,negative,technically good but the story the main thing you go for it was the worst no even didnt continue with the things poorly established on the force awakens if not destroy them
Dec 17 2019,negative,by far the worst star wars movie ive seen i never wanted to walk out of a theater more
Dec 17 2019,negative,the pacing in this movie is beyond bad they also forgo the seriousness you see in all other entrys even the bad ones for cheap laughs episode 1 is better than this
Dec 17 2019,positive,it was decent could have been better
Dec 17 2019,negative,honestly a beautiful movie it looks amazing sadly to enjoy that you must throw away all sense of storytelling and character development the movie tried new things for the star wars universe such as having an entire movie with no character development they also tried this thing where they set up an emotionally impactful scene and then do a 180 on it in the end the only thing to be gained from this movie is a newfound understanding of how much hollywood thinks its viewers are morons
Dec 16 2019,negative,disney has successfully ruined a beloved and iconic franchise plot lines going nowhere character arcs destroyed and plot holes galore the new characters are not interesting and the old ones have been disrespected or neglected 
Dec 16 2019,negative,letdown compared to the other trilogies felt like the movie was made to subvert expectations rather than continue the story from force awakens and overall so much of the movie just didnt make sense how is a space chase happening for 2 hours
Dec 16 2019,positive,brilliant middle chapter for the sequel trilogy
Dec 16 2019,negative,might have been a good sensible movie if its standalone and is using new characters with little character development established previously   however what it turns out is a spit on you and your star wars franchise loving face by taking loved and established characters through cringeworthy story arcs and completely subverting what they represented to make you scratch your head in confusion and revulsion by the end of the movie   with regards to placement in a trilogy it does little to connect and flesh out the different arcs characters established in the first movie worse it leaves you bereft with any interest in final trilogy movie   still i hope you enjoy it as it would mean your personal star wars experience would remain untainted but sure was slightly ruined for me i am going to wait for the non spoilers reviews for the rise of skywalker before buying my ticket
Dec 16 2019,negative,movie definitely seemed more of a cash grab or film piece to win critics over  any fan of star wars films will find it doesnt flow with the others  it takes established characters off into directions they would never realistically go on if you have seen their personalities in other films
Dec 16 2019,positive,this one turned into my second favorite star wars movie near masterpiece
Dec 16 2019,negative,this movie is a slap in the face to the most loyal fandom in cinematic history shame on kathleen kennedy for allowing this to happen
Dec 16 2019,negative,rian johnson ruined star wars it ruined my my childhood favourite franchise and their is no redeeming this unless episode 9 literally writes everything that happened in episode 8 out of existence
Dec 16 2019,negative,i hated this movie and everything about it felt bad for the actors that were in it especially mark hamill and john boyega this is what happens when you get so cynical and deconstruct everything there is nothing positive left to root for     that said i have so much invested in my decades of star wars fandom that i will see rise of skywalker anyway yes it helps that rian johnson isnt involved
Dec 16 2019,negative,okay as a standalone movie but that doesnt make up for the fact it destroyed the star wars franchise and my love of the star wars universe   i use to love all the  characters from old but the way rian j desecrates lukes legacy makes us all hate any reference to skywalker or the characters of  old      i dont connect with  any of the new rebels or badarses  i found snoke interesting but he is gone as well   i guess the star war saga isnt being produced for the scifi fans anymore
Dec 16 2019,negative,as a life long star wars fan ive never hated a movie more than tlj
Dec 16 2019,negative,an unfocused mess that breaks star wars lore
Dec 16 2019,negative,terrible nonsensical writing lotta plot points didnt make sense and didnt align with the universe poorly developed characters pretty sad that this is canon the only good thing i could say about the movie is the effects but should be expected from a movie with this budget
Dec 16 2019,positive,felt like a good old star wars movie to me a perfect sequel to the first movie that answered a lot of questions with great plot progression and im sure the final film will have us just as satisfied if not more so
Dec 16 2019,positive,is this a perfect film no literally no perfect films exist this was a wonderful experience when i watched it the cinemas it is truly heartbreaking to see what this film has done to the fanbase i loved this film i think its characters were amazing the effects were amazing the score was amazing this film was a truly exhilarating experience
Dec 16 2019,negative,terrible the overall story arc doesnt connect at all and the character development is thrown into a trash can its not telling us a story its trying to make a point about something thats relevant to this day its literally just trying to milk as much money as possible it makes me sick and disappointed i really hoped that the new star wars trilogy would bring something new to the table but its basically just a modern version of the original trilogy sigh
Dec 16 2019,positive,love this movie   i understand the flaws people are saying but i love the new cast of characters and think the movies are so fun so im able to overlook the flaws also this is the middle movie its bound to be unpopular and cursed rey and kylo are amazing to watch i cheered with the whole audience during this movie when it first came out
Dec 16 2019,negative,such a good trama with finn at the at episode vii now it just dead like luke
Dec 15 2019,positive,best star wars movie
Dec 15 2019,negative,hot diarrhea shit in movie form
Dec 15 2019,positive,dont believe the hate this is a great film
Dec 15 2019,negative,i really didnt like this film saw it in theaters twice and i came out of it the first time mixed when i saw it a second time i really didnt like it the jokes were off and out of universe at time ie yo mama jokes i just didnt like what rian johnson did with luke i dont mind the diversity of this film or the sequel trilogy as a whole but its really hard to look the other way when benicio del toro gets as much screen time as if not more than mark hamill and r2d2 is just an after thought the direction of kylo didnt convey to me any serious direction taken in the character rey and luke really training together is a crime we could have seen some real philosophical aspects of the force but canto bight had to absorb much of the films run time for that not putting finn and poe in more scenes together was a crime by the time luke and kylo face off i was drained the movie tries to fill in 2 movies worth of information with out the discovery luke dying was just the worst it didnt even feel like it was worth the sacrifice i will not watch any sw films in the future with johnson at the directors chair i have hope in jj and its a real travesty that solo a star wars story which was a really fun and exciting movie will probably never get a sequel because of the unnecessary risks taken in this film keep johnson the hell away from the mandalorian
Dec 15 2019,negative,doesnt makes sense breaks all of star wars history rian johnson shouldnt be allowed to write movies
Dec 15 2019,negative,very very disappointed but it isnt worst than phantom manace and attack of the clones
Dec 15 2019,positive,the last jedi is an uneven and surprising approach to the eight star wars film yet it doesnt disappoint when it comes to the visuals uneven to the star wars legacy of the saga
Dec 15 2019,negative,complete misunderstanding of what makes a compelling story  the most incredible aspect of this movie is how swiftly it undoes all goodwill of a multidecade loved franchise  garbage
Dec 15 2019,negative,the movie had many flaws the one that stands out the most is its treatment of the character of luke skywalker its as if all the previous films were ignored and no continuum was taken into account when it came to presenting the most recent incarnation of luke trying to imagine luke as a hopeless jaded character seemed very out of place  a wise old yoda like character would have made more sense  even darth vader had a moment of redemption in the original three
Dec 15 2019,negative,doesnt even feel like a star wars movie pacing is awful also
Dec 15 2019,negative,far and away the worst sw ever
Dec 15 2019,negative,this is the worst star wars movie ever made blatantly pays zero hommage to the lore they just make things up and contradict hard truths from every other movie and show made in star wars previously honestly kathleen kennedy and rian johnson made this movie feel like a bland 1990s low budget space movie rather than a star wars movie they didnt even have a moment where luke and leia meet and rejoice
Dec 15 2019,positive,tonal issues here and there humour is sometimes inappropriate and canto bight subplot had a nice idea changing finns character motivation but was unfortunately executed quite poorly nevertheless rest of the movie is filled with memorable moments we see amazing performances from both mark hamill and adam driver cinematography is breathtakingly beautiful and story takes unexpected turns thanks to rjs daring attitude towards it solid 80 good movie but definitely not flawless
Dec 15 2019,negative,one of the worst movies ive ever seen 
Dec 15 2019,negative,this is the worst star wars installment no one in the accomplishes anything it definitely lacks in story pacing and theme it basically killed the franchise johnson does like whodoneits and so he murdered star wars i do not recommend this movie
Dec 15 2019,positive,slow at times and beyond 3 key moments a solid star wars film without any massive spoilers a key cgaracter is killed but you will have no way of knowing unless you payed close attention in addition a largely built up character is killed off when he should be in the end otherwise the film is decent luke has given up on the jedi order and believes it should die a good amount of the story revolves around he kylo ren and rey as luke continues to train rey why showing her why he believes it should end kylo attemps through the force to show rey why she should join the dark side and throughout multiple points in the film rey is tempted meanwhile a sideplot is created with new chatacter rose and finn in which they go on various missions for the resistance it leads them from an emperial controlled las vegas style track snd casino to kylo ren and surpreme leader snokes flagship in the end various characters meet their fate at least 3 recognizable faces die but overall a decent star wars entry
Dec 15 2019,negative,only better than solo in all of the star wars universe i would rather jar jar binks make a come back
Dec 14 2019,negative,rian johnson does not understand star wars he has his script completed before ever seeing force awakens he is on record to have written the last jedi with only jjs completed script of the force awakens he made many bad choices in this film he should stick to independent projects as he doesnt respect the work of those who paved the way before him
Dec 14 2019,negative,it was very weak when compared to the first 6 masterpieces of the franchise
Dec 14 2019,negative,this was from my google review  i just watched the force awakens and the last jedi in preparation for the rise of skywalker i cant believe just how bad this movie is as a star wars film as an action film writingwise and storytelling on these levels its awful just awful i actually liked force awakens its humor reminded me of men in black the action was great visually the film is beautiful it set up so many potentials for a great sequel sadly the last jedi is not a great good or even fair sequel it killed any and all potential for this new trilogy rip star wars you will be loved remembered and cherished forever
Dec 14 2019,negative,wheres the war part
Dec 14 2019,negative,its disappointing and basically just a cash grab
Dec 14 2019,negative,was extremly excited for this film and saw it on opening night not only did i leave the theater confused but the film killed my excitement for any future star wars films aesthetically the film looks great but the rest of the film is full of logic holes and characters that make absolutely no sense and the overly politisized plot and subversion plot didnt do it for me
Dec 14 2019,negative,pretty bad spoilers for the first few minutes made the heroes lame made the villians unimportant made far too many barely hidden political commentary the opening scene where they expect us to believe that poe wouldnt just be shot almost immediately because the rebels are more than capable of calling the first order from their other ships then expects us to believe he could destroy every gun on the ship by himself then replace the ywing bombers present in both prior trilogies with big slow shuttle busses for thermal detonators these terrible inconsistent scenes and uninspired story continues throughout these are just problems with the first 10 minutes
Dec 13 2019,positive,definitely a good movie to watch for me
Dec 13 2019,negative,the worst movie of the saga
Dec 13 2019,negative,so they can light speed to vegas and back and yet somehow the bad guys cant catch up with them or surround them using light speed the main plot point was not well explained
Dec 13 2019,positive,its really amazing it pulls me in and its definitely in my top 3 star wars movies to rewatch
Dec 13 2019,negative,terrible movie rian johnson should be ashamed of this film  rian clearly has no knowledge about star wars what so ever how the hell did he get the luke skywalker character so wrong luke never gave up on his father and he will never give up on his nephew  i am just so speechless at how bad this movie is rian johnson must be banned from all future star wars project  and dont get me started on kathleen kennedy
Dec 13 2019,negative,this movie was just plain bad and so many scenes did not make sense or were just bizarre the most notable one is leia surviving in space for several minutes because reasons it felt like a bad fan fiction and just made rey unlikable it made the characters completely useless and it felt like finns story made no sense and added characters that were completely useless i think the formula was there just the director could not handle it
Dec 13 2019,negative,hamfisted poorly written poorly executed
Dec 13 2019,negative,do i really need to explain they killed lukes personality marey sue we win by saving what we love the universe bends so that the main characters dont die snoke the movie is a complete mess i didnt even know luke died until about a week after i watched the movie because i got out of the cinema before the end because i couldnt handle it
Dec 13 2019,negative,this movie is going to live on this site as a testament to the fact that professional critics can either through incompetence or nepotism be so devoid from the preferences of the everyday moviegoer
Dec 13 2019,negative,this film is rotten to the very core it doesnt address any of the issues the original film presented reys force powers without training ability to fight etc but being gifted alone is forgiveable as it is a kids movie this movie strikes a far worse blow to the star wars universe there are numerous examples here is one before refute this movie presents these new bombers mg100 starfortress it uses ww2 style bombing tactics which is silly by itself but lets assume we ignore that for the cool factor the real offense is that they have a hyperdrive and in this movie as we clearly see the frigate glass transport carrier which we are told is not capable of fighting use a hyperdrive to smash into one of the largest star destroyer destroying it and several adjacent full size star destroyer ships which just shows you the scale of the large one this film therefore would suggest that the mg100 starfortress could simply be used as a fireable payload since it too has a hyperdrive it could simply be show at ships to similar effect
Dec 13 2019,negative,full of plot holes dismantles  does not build on  the force awakens ruins luke skywalker and miswrites other preestablished characters pushes political ideology revolves around the central theme of letting go of the good vs evil norms that the series is known for but then chickens out and reverts back to good vs evil at the end of the film leaves the story in a why should i care what comes next situation i walked out of the theater in shock this movie is a mess and will be known as the film that made star wars episodes just another movie at least it was fun to watch simply for the spectacle of the original trilogy being disrespected to such a degree
Dec 12 2019,negative,it was a pretty bad movie
Dec 12 2019,negative,sw fan since 86 i even enjoyed the prequels which was a rarity among my generation     i cant believe sw has been so horribly mismanaged by kathleen kennedy and lucasfilm tlj was just a terrible clunky film all round and absolutely nothing was achieved by the end of it     i will not watch the new ros film and refuse to accept the disney trilogy as canon theyre doing a lot better with the mandalorian so i await with baited breath as to the future of a franchise that i cherished so dearly for 3 decades and now can barely stand to watch it anymore
Dec 12 2019,negative,hope episode 9 will end with luke having a bad dream and wake up after the celebration on endor with a hangover
Dec 12 2019,negative,the last jedi was a big disappointment bad storytelling and not inspiring at all
Dec 12 2019,negative,story plot was all over the place what was up with princess leigh this was just a very awkward movie all around
Dec 12 2019,negative,ryan johnson succeeded in dividing the fan base  he succeeded in ruining the story ruining the original and new characters and ruining the lore  making changes just to make changes is not the way to make a film  too much politics and not enough plot
Dec 12 2019,negative,by far the worst film ive ever seen  not just the worst star wars filmthe worst film
Dec 12 2019,negative,the critics say that fanatics and devoted fans will love it but they dont i havent talked to anybody who didnt think that the characters were not acting like themselves the humor was out of place should have kept his shirt on and the epic scenes were goofy superman leia virtual luke it never felt like a star wars movie and i have no idea what the critics saw in this i dont think rian johnson has ever heard of star wars and he left a mess to clean up
Dec 12 2019,negative,this movie disrespectfully ruined star wars please stop with the political agendas
Dec 12 2019,negative,there were parts of the movie that i liked and it was well made the reason i am rating this so low is i also feel like they did a disservice to the franchise ben solo says let the past die kill it if you have to that was him channeling rian johnson if you kill the past star wars has no future
Dec 12 2019,negative,he just threw away all the good jj did snoke reys parents i mean it was a big disappointment
Dec 12 2019,negative,rian johnson peed in the star wars pool  this installment went out of its way to undermine the previous films by destroying plot lines character arcs and even the basic mechanics of the star wars universe  johnson also takes a hard left turn by using the film as a giant virtue signal against income inequality and the patriarchy introducing new characters with no depth of character that appear solely for the purpose of making the film woke  it is a huge departure from the escapism offered by the previous installments of the franchise  this film has left the trilogy in perilous straights and will take some impressive craftsmanship from the next director to right the ship
Dec 12 2019,negative,this movie ruined pretty much all the good will of many star wars fans  absolute trash story overshadows the decent cinematography and john williams score  more than likely it ruined the entire disney trilogy and it seriously hurt the franchise as a whole
Dec 12 2019,negative,the visuals and the performance of some of the actors are about the only positive things about the movie which seems to try really really hard to subvert the audience expectations to the point where it collapses under its unnecessary long screentime and illogical decisions
Dec 12 2019,positive,this movie isnt bad nor legendary yes it packs some plot twists but it has plot holes it was also fun but kinda boring the rise of skywalker was better than this
Dec 12 2019,negative,i hated what they did with the characters the story was boring and didnt make a whole lot of sense rey is a mary sue the whole canto bight section of the movie could be eliminated without any effect on the rest of the movie just terrible ive tried to give it more chances but i cant even make it through the movie when i try and give it a second third and fourth chance
Dec 12 2019,negative,total garbage absolutley dissapointing star wars isnt comedy
Dec 12 2019,negative,literally one of the worst movies ive ever seen
Dec 12 2019,negative,a complete cashgrab this movie does not care to be a star wars movie it does not care to preserve the coherency of the star wars universe they have established in the previous work it was really frustrating to watch plus every time a scene starts to be a little serious the authors felt obligated to break the tension with some random wannabecomical sht this is just absurd and completely breaks the flow of the story this movie is truly rotten to the core
Dec 12 2019,negative,while a wellmade film with some interesting plot points and characters the sharp departure from the setup of the last film and legacy of the original trilogy may sour star wars fans enjoyment as well as this more subjective complaint the actions of some characters are not well explained there are plot points that lead nowhere and an extremely forced romance sub plot at many points satisfying conclusions to set ups are trade in for the shock value of a bait and switch on a more lore based level the expansion of force powers within the film brings up questions about earlier films as well one specific thing later in the film that has never before been alluded to and seemed only to crop up as a resulted of a desired end point moving back to more subjective issues the treatment of legacy characters like admiral akbar and luke may leave a bad taste in the mouth of those who were attached to them with akbar being killed off with no pomp or circumstance early in the film finally the themes of this movie seem largely incongruous with that of prior films where early placed emphasis on the importance of high risk high reward actions and cooperation this film actively punishes those who do such things finally to expand on issues of the character changes in luke the character goes from optimism and strong family bonds to a grouchy isolated uncaring and withdrawn pessimist adequate reason is never given as to why luke has left and let the first order advance as it has or abandoned his nephew despite the clear need for his influence and the parallels to one can draw to plot lines with vader despite determination to save his father an objectively further gone character who luke had less of a connection to the hero of the rebellion seemed content to let his nephew fall to the dark side and excuses given in the script fall short of justifying such action in conclusion if you can enjoy this film hats great and encourage you to do so however i and many others were dissatisfied with the treatment of legacy characters established themes and the abandonment of plot lines established in the force awakens
Dec 12 2019,negative,its horrible a total waste of time and money that makes me sad and desilusioned with life as a whole
Dec 12 2019,positive,this is my all time favorite star wars movie everything  about it makes me so happy and the deeper meanings shown throughout the film are really eye opening and really gets you thinking i feel like this story is a breath of fresh air for the star wars universe it makes me sad that people didnt understand and disliked the scenes we got in this film i really feel as though it is not as bad as people make it out to be and feel like if you really look at the imagery and ideas put forth in the film you can learn to love it god bless arian johnson
Dec 12 2019,negative,the star wars saga has been recognized as one of the most influential compelling stories released in history however this movie changed it all with gaping plot holes no character development unnecessary plot twists and horrible choreography it leaves the fans wondering what happened to this once respected series the force is not with series anymore unless the rise of skywalker has something to offer
Dec 12 2019,positive,my favorite star wars film after a new hope beautiful with a clear message thats filled with the optimism that makes these stories special
Dec 12 2019,negative,major spoiler warnings     this movie really is just a big shiny centerpiece in the middle of disneys grand buffet with some absolutely beautiful scenes such as the destruction of the supremacy and the gorgeous high contrast of white and red during the battle on crait i really wanted to be able to at least enjoy this movie trilogy as if it were its own entity and not an entry in the star wars universe however it quickly became clear that i would not be given that satisfaction     now going into my gripes about the movie the audience knows from episode 7 that rey seems to not really know her parents and clings onto any older male character han solo in episode 7 and luke skywalker in episode 8 as if they were the father figure she so lacked as a child the audience was genuinely interested about who her parents were whether that be jedi sith or any other fan theory out there however we are never given even the slightest amount of information on them which is a massive lost opportunity to explain exactly why she has such a strong connection to the force and to luke    supreme leader snoke had a very strong presence in episode 7 as well and the community in general was excited to see where this supposedly all powerful bad guy would be going in terms of story telling did we get anything on that no not a word about him it seems like his whole role in the series is purely to provide an antagonist during the first two films before he is unceremoniously killed in the matter of a minute or two after our main protagonist meets him he has no backstory no easily distinguishable motive besides hes evil and after he is killed seemingly no impact on the story going forward    luke skywalker is my biggest gripe when it comes to this movie however luke was an almost universally loved character in the original trilogy and rightly so in my opinion his story arc followed the heros journey style of storytelling and character development to a t which isnt necessarily a bad thing mind you however when you take all the lessons learned and character development and completely toss it away just to get a shaky plotline out of him its just lazy writing at that point    i wont say much on flinns character because i genuinely like him i only dont like that the one main character who isnt white just happens to be the butt of all the slapstick humor in the movies and i think thats a major injustice to mr boyega    overall i think this would have been a perfectly mediocre movie if it just didnt have the star wars branding on it i really want to like rey flinn and kylo ren but we still know so little of any of them with a slight exception for kylo that i find it extraordinarily difficult to connect with any of them and truly enjoy their characters no matter how good the acting is
Dec 12 2019,negative,if i were an enemy of george lucas and was able to buy star wars only to destroy the franchise this is exactly the movie id ask rian johnson to make its so utterly terrible that it has to have been on purpose     the number of idiotic choices this movie made is a giant slap in the face of any star wars fan did you like luke skywalkers sense of hope and optimism did you want to know why rey is so strong in the force and perfect or who her parents are did you want to know more about snoke did you want to see the knights of ren did you want to make sure real world politics and social issues stayed out of a fictional universe well thats too bad none of those things happen    its a two hour long space chase that ultimately ends in luke betraying himself the actual dead actor living on while the living actor dies finn gets his character arc destroyed by the most awkward kiss in cinematic history the big bad omniscient guy dies from someone using the force right next to him they weaponized hyper speedmaking us wonder why there was even a plan to kill the first two death stars besides sending a droid through it    its sloppy poorly written fraught with leftist propaganda the characters dont act according to their character the plot is boring an entire scene takes place on a casino planet instead of training reythe list goes on this is a dumpster fire but at least its a pretty one right    go destroy your own legacies with your subverting expectations rian
Dec 12 2019,negative,clear and objective plot holes rey taking snokes ship off screen all ships travel at the same speed bombs based on gravity in outer space revision and disruptive elements breaking the universe ghostyoda interacting in reality hyperspace weaponization and the absolute betrayal of lukes original story arc made this movie the worst in the franchise the prequels were bad and poorly written but at least they did not go out of their way to trample on the original material the force awakens did this to an extent as well but tlj has destroyed this skywalker saga for me to accept this movie as canon would make our enjoyment and acceptance of lukes passion for his fathers good seem trite and naive in the original trilogy  it isnt just that this is a poorly conceived movie with unforced errors admiral akbar dies offscreen snoke doesnt even fight it made the other movies worse by tacking on a dismal conclusion to their plots imagine if jk rowling came out with a new novel in which harry has become a pedophile that is the treatment this movie gave luke
Dec 11 2019,negative,this movie sucked and disney should feel bad
Dec 11 2019,negative,shit the prequels were better than this
Dec 11 2019,negative,im not a huge fan of the prequels this is still my least favorite star wars movie i could not stand the gambling planet low speed space chase rays parents they blamed the low audience rating on trolls but i dont know a single person irl that liked this movie making the movie surprising bad is not a twist
Dec 11 2019,negative,the writers tried to hide uninteresting characters behind a gaudy mask of inch deep feminist bravado  this is not how to write strong female characters  the excellent cast did as well as they could with this dumpster fire of a script  hoping the franchise can be redeemed
Dec 11 2019,positive,i love the character development and story of the last jedi i do have problems with it the canto bite sequence is really bad but overall people give this movie too much hate its worth the time
Dec 11 2019,negative,a trainwreck of a movie that pushes a beloved franchise off a cliff and into an erupting volcano there are too many narratives happening at the same time too many plot twists and too much nonsensical behavior from characters with little to no evolution several cinematic and choreographic blunders can also be spotted in the film
Dec 11 2019,positive,the film introduces different concepts and comes so close to taking risks that truly make a major impact on the saga yet it is too concerned with playing it safe the pacing is all over the place which makes it feel too long and causes watch checking
Dec 11 2019,negative,goddammit i can make a full book on the amounts i have cringed felt like this movie suck and felt disappointed      this is coming from a star wars fan
Dec 11 2019,negative,i dont know how you make a film full of nothing but plot twists without an actual plot but congratulations r j you did it 
Dec 11 2019,negative,the movie has to many plot wholes to count  doesnt even feel like a sequel to the  force awakens
Dec 11 2019,negative,after loving the character of luke skywalker for over 40 years this movie destroyed so many good childhood memories it was a good looking decently actedpoorly thought out travesty this is how not to keep fans
Dec 11 2019,negative,terrible movie too many flaws and plot holes disney has ruin star wars
Dec 11 2019,positive,it was a great film the best film ever and it does not deserve any hate whatsoever
Dec 10 2019,negative,the prequels disappointed episode 7 was excellent but lacked originality episode 8 put the franchise on life support can jj abrams resurrect it
Dec 10 2019,negative,rian johnsons terrible twists basically put another stake into the grave of this trilogy seeing princess leia mary poppins her way into a ship was hilarious and a little sad
Dec 10 2019,negative,kid  so called director was given the keys to a huge budget and huge legacy in cinema history then killed all the characters plots and history like the masked kid characters that keeps having temper tantrums
Dec 10 2019,negative,really poor story arc and directing   poor luke is a shell of himself  bombers in space   slow motion space chase   13 of the movie is a pointless tangent   suicide is ok if you are a strong female character but when finn tries to do the same he is saved by rose   and sudden she loves him after less than a day with him   oh and they teleport back to the rebels somehow faster than the first order   this movie is completely bad on all fronts  dont even get me started on the leia force grab in space   did anyone even edit this movie or say no to an idea during the story boarding   wow  worst star wars movie hands down and that includes the jar jar debacle
Dec 10 2019,negative,steaming pile of garbage  would give it 0 stars if i could
Dec 10 2019,negative,this movie was total garbage ive been a star wars fan my whole life they pretty much ruined the franchise with this movie
Dec 10 2019,positive,episode 8 was not good and theirs no other way to put it they diminished the fans of this universe by ruining characters and leaving way to many plot holes  rey is a horribly written character and the story is underwhelming and unbelievable  the story and writing is really what suffers here and even great visuals cant replace that  this movie is an example of why there should have never been a sequel trilogy
Dec 10 2019,negative,the wrost in the star wars franchise an one of the worst movies in years
Dec 10 2019,positive,the worst movie in star wars saga
Dec 10 2019,negative,movie was so boring and terrible that i went to go pee during the lukekylo fight and was met with a line of people at the concessions asking for their money back 91 disney lies
Dec 10 2019,negative,these characters have failed they seem like a bunch of  dorks who belong to a high school star wars club finn is so unlikable the plot did not explain things and had holes in it conservatives need to make another saga  this is garbage
Dec 10 2019,negative,this movie is an insult to whole series they messed up with power levels among characters during the movie you may ask yourself that what the hell are they doing in that planet or place motivation of characters are sometimes inconsistent even lightsaber scenes were under its potential
Dec 10 2019,positive,it was good but not so great as the old ones a lot of mistakes and meaningless things you can see a lot of choreography errors in lightsaber fights and some unexplained events that make no sense but the lukes fight scene was perfect ill admit it
Dec 10 2019,negative,im really confused what was rian johnson thinking this movie gives off a weird vibe and i do not like it it feels as if all the lead ups from the previous movie were ditched i hated seeing luke become this
Dec 10 2019,negative,awful awful awful disney please stop pushing rian johnson on us or and fire kathleen kennedy of course this review is late ive only seen the film once and this is the only star wars films i dont own there is a reason i dont own it it sucks i hate they flying princess leia and how luke is just a shell of who he once was burn every copy of this film its such a waste of time one thing we do prior to upcoming star wars films is watch them all in chronological order not the order in which they were made im not looking forward to rewatching this piece of garbage sand getting everywhere and jar jar binks are both better than this piece of space trash 
Dec 10 2019,negative,too many plot inconsistencies the plot doesnt make sense the movie didnt honor original characters new characters are boring and stupid
Dec 10 2019,positive,i can see how many dont like this movie but i love it
Dec 9 2019,negative,the new main characters are soulless and nonsensical acquiring skills they shouldnt have out of nowhere and beating in fights characters who are supposed to have way better training and preparation than them just because they are the good guys and they must win destroying all the focus on training provided in the first 6 movies and thats bad enough but they managed to tear apart old characters such as luke leia and han oh my god luke look how they massacred my boy   an aspect of the movie that gets progressively old besides the never ending puns that would make a 4 year old cringe is the excessive use of plot twists apparently used to make an unpredictable movie as a result of the directors confusion between the words unpredictable and good a consequence of this idiotic goal of being unpredictable at any cost we get characters build up as absolutely crucial to the story like reys parents and snook but end up being irrelevant to the plot and remain unexplained and unidimensional giving the audience a general sense of improvisation and lack of direction   im not giving it half a star because of the movie itself being absolute crap because its not if you isolate the movie as an individual piece you can enjoy it if you ignore the irrelevant characters and plot holes specially considering the great visuals but sadly its part of a franchise of movies and its not all about the shinny fireworks for an audience thats not completely composed of childs and people who are watching star wars for the first time so if you are a person who has watched the first 6 movies shares the idea of continuity and is not impressed only with good visuals you will see that episode 7 and 8 are not aligned with the star wars general essence and has serious plot holes irrelevant characters and incoherences     if you are a kid or you have never watched star wars before and you just wanna hang out and kill some time go watch it you got  nothing to loose except some money but i warn you that you are not gonna find your favorite movie today   if you actually like star wars hardcore fan or casual you go watch it anyways if you can download it even better its star wars after all apparently but keep in mind that this movie will basically break all the rules and character development the previous 6 movies set up and that might kinda ruin a beloved franchise for you   warning the puns and plot twists might drive you to suicide xoxo   pd mickey if you read this please make director rian johnson go away he is not good for the franchise and that means its not good for your pockets
Dec 9 2019,negative,definitely the worst star wars movie ever    its full of idiotic plot holes and retcons left and right    avoid it at all costs and watch the prequels or the original trilogy again instead
Dec 9 2019,negative,to create a new trilogy they had to literally kill the previous one  well they killed it  but the new trilogy is not worth the hard drive space it occupies so they killed the old trilogy in vain
Dec 9 2019,negative,ruined the storyline the force awakens set up ruined luke skywalkers character
Dec 9 2019,positive,an interesting movie that explores themes of failure and heroism has some fat in the script that bogs it down but is saved by character moments and stunning visuals
Dec 9 2019,negative,another total crap shoot in the cash grab that is disney milking the star wars franchise for every penny they can before they kill it completely the whole story line if like was a disgrace to the character lucas had originally portrayed in the original films all in all its 2 hours of my life ill never have back and cements the fact that ill definitely not be seeing episode 9
Dec 9 2019,negative,its mediocre at best i dont know why so many critics like this crappy film
Dec 9 2019,negative,who wrote the dumb space battle scenes
Dec 9 2019,negative,pros   visually great   good soundtrack   kylo hesitating to kill leia   rey and kylo communicating through the force   fight scene was cool   lukes projection was cool   force sensitive kid was cool    cons   chase act is convoluted and boring   leias force abilities showcase was poorly done   holdo is a boring character that i find difficult to like she almost seems to be presented as an antagonist   rose is a boring character that i find difficult to like her lines and existence in general feel forced   casino act is convoluted and boring   lukes character is butchered and made into a joke luke doesnt care that han died  this is horrible   phasma is killed off without any development   snoke is killed off without any development   feel as though nothing is at stake makes it difficult to get invested in any character      all around very disappointing  the whole subverting expectations strategy heavily backfired
Dec 9 2019,negative,the worst star wars movie i have seen and possible one of the worst movies i have seen in general sure the effects are decent and the acting is acceptable but its the overuse of childish humor the nonsensical hole filled plot and the apparent disregard for many previously establish and treasured franchise elements that puts me off this will be the only star wars movie i dont enjoy watching let alone finishing
Dec 9 2019,negative,inane side plots that lead no where characters with no motivation and physics breaking key plot points
Dec 9 2019,negative,so incredibly awfully broken of a movie that ignores the entire history of star wars and just takes a dump on the fans
Dec 9 2019,negative,half a star is still far too many this movie from its visuals to its writting is shit terrible story terrible preformance terrible character develoupment no arcs and worst of all no soul cant even call this a proper star wars movie thats how bad it is this is how you kill a billiondollar franchise off like a dinosaur disney shoudnt have bought lucasfilm period the movie would have been way better even better than the modern star wars films
Dec 8 2019,negative,i watched the entire star wars series for the first time and it is truly incredible up until this movie i just wish they stuck to the storyline instead of adding so much unnecessary content and excessive plot twists it was actually annoying and difficult to finish the best part of   the film would have been the original characters but the writers found a way to absolutely destroy them what they did to luke skywalker was shameful watching this was similar to watching the last episode of game of throwns  unsettling and disappointing i wish i never watched it
Dec 8 2019,negative,when i first experienced how unimaginably atrocious this film truly was i found myself confused on what had just happen after finally digesting the unfortunate reality of this movie i wrestled with the question of how someone could create something so blatantly horrendous i grew up loving star wars how could something so disgraceful be allowed i didnt believe it was possible this then led me to believe that it must have been done this way deliberately and not just deliberately but it seemed as if great time and care was taken to destroy every aspect of the star wars universe piece by piece along with everything its fans love  the story its characters its excitement the inspiration its lessons etc just a few examples of this are the senseless and almost comical death of snoke one of the few intriguing characters of the film the complete butchering of luke skywalkers character who was of course once a powerful and honorable jedi the awkward and unbearable joke attempts and the fact that this so called star wars movie did not contain a light saber battle yes its true no light saber battle in the entire movie the list unfortunately goes on and on and on with scenes so baffling that it made me wonder why i was ever a star wars fan in the first place its no wonder ive never actually talked to anyone who didnt strongly dislike the movie which makes one wonder how the ridiculous critic reviews were so suspiciously high but thats another story overall in the end i just had to remind myself to not let 1 movie dismantle what i and so many fans have come to love its just this film the best i can do is act as if the movie never existed and the universe of star wars may live on
Dec 8 2019,negative,got pretty dang disneyfied many of the plot points set up from the last movie were ignored it subverted expectations in a bad way where i didnt care about the characters
Dec 8 2019,neutral,im old guard i grew up watching star wars over n over again these modern ones are not star wars they had potential but were disappointments if your a long time fan at 25 stars i was being generous plot holes and many bad decisions the ideologies injected are such a turn off  imo have zero rewatch valueb
Dec 8 2019,negative,i love star wars and this is the worst movie ive ever seen how could you do that to luke for shame
Dec 8 2019,negative,this was a great movie applies clown makeup
Dec 8 2019,negative,no plot disney ruined star wars
Dec 8 2019,negative,its a travesty what they did to luke all you had to do was dress him in black give him a green light saber and a few moments of glory preferably with leia and han what disney did was a disgrace
Dec 8 2019,negative,this was the worst star wars movie to date the force awakens was okay 3 stars but i couldnt even enjoy this movie the story ruined the entire thing i hope episode 9 can repair this trainwreck of a movie
Dec 8 2019,positive,i seriously dont understand why so many people hate this movie i think that last jedi is an amazing star wars film that takes bold new steps that havent been seen before in the franchise
Dec 8 2019,negative,not just a bad star wars movie but literally maybe the worst movie in history absolutely horrible this is the only stars wars movie i havent watched more than once the others ive watched hundreds of times ill probably never spend money on a new star wars movie again after this garbage
Dec 8 2019,negative,i hated every single thing about that movie i wish it was never made and i will never watch it again unless someones life depended on it
Dec 8 2019,negative,this film is a torture to me now i hate disney 
Dec 7 2019,negative,terrible  no plot  no story telling  not a str wars movie
Dec 7 2019,negative,oof that was rotten
Dec 7 2019,negative,shameful  no future for star wars  good night sweet prince
Dec 7 2019,positive,one if the best films i have ever seen
Dec 7 2019,negative,just the whole serit has no story arc af any character terrible movie terrible actors and beyond all terrible writing rey and kylo were good casting rest was crap
Dec 7 2019,negative,beautiful movie  just really really really really bad story and not at all worthy as being a part of a star wars trilogy
Dec 7 2019,negative,horrible insults your intelligence in just about every scene  gravity in spacein space  wind resistance in spacewth    but the biggest fu by disney is the disgrace done to luke  luke lost his hand learning you cannot see the future using the force    yethe doeswhat caused him to lose his handto read kylos mind    just stupid writing
Dec 7 2019,negative,real fans of star wars know that this is just a repackaging of nostalgia only for the purpose of making money
Dec 7 2019,negative,just realized i never reviewed this movie i saw it with my brother and my wife and we walked out with my brother immediately hating it and me unsure but trying to defend it as time as gone i found myself hating nearly every aspect of this movie from start to finish     im sure all one needs to do is google last jedi criticism and the list would be endless if it was just the bad humor the porgs and the las vegas  planet i had a problem with i could probably find some redeemable qualities of the movie but the treatment of luke was so painfully awful its hard to even give this movie one star    this movie made me question my love for the force awakens and jj abrams has such an impossible task if redeeming star wars again i dont think it can happen
Dec 7 2019,negative,this movie missed its opportunity to tell the story of what happened to the galaxy after luke took down the empire it needed to explore the relationship between luke and kylo and show why kylo joined the dark side despite lukes best efforts and why he decided that a dictatorship would be best for the galaxy instead we are given a movie that has no clear plot no character development no stars vibe no message and is an hour and 30 minutes longer than it should be the movies attitude is you have to like it since it is the new star wars walked in the theatre with no exceptions and left disappointed
Dec 7 2019,negative,just watched this for first time since seeing it opening night just as bad if not worse the second time what rian johnson did to luke skywalker and star wars is unreal
Dec 7 2019,positive,mark hamill made me thirsty for milk again
Dec 7 2019,negative,rian johnson made a mockery of star wars and ruined luke skywalkers legacy for the fans to put it in rotten tomatoes words this movie was rotten
Dec 6 2019,positive,my favorite star wars movie since empire fresh ideas amazing character development and a script that makes you consider the larger picture beyond the trials of the central characters it reminds us that even our greatest heroes are still flawed and that is okay watching them learn from their failures and rise above them has always been been one of my favorite tropes of the star wars films lastly the film challenges some of our binary ideas of light and dark in a galaxy far far awaypaving the way for more exciting development in the final film of the skywalker saga
Dec 6 2019,negative,terrible writing 30 minute side quest with side characters that means nothing in the end like why include it big plot holes with the purple hair lady send off leia turns into superman think its its own movie despite being part of a trilogy hope jj can can save the trilogy with 9
Dec 6 2019,negative,it was meh i didnt love it i didnt hate it it was just an ok sifi movie it just didnt feel like star wars
Dec 6 2019,negative,i just cant understand why they destroying this great story with these horrendous new movies
Dec 6 2019,positive,i think it was very good not the best movie ive seen but definitely the best star wars movie of them all its well written the characters all well developed and the story pays off its normal that it angries a lot of fans specially the nostalgic ones but all and all and leaving personal wants aside it is a solid movie that a lot of people will enjoy in the future
Dec 6 2019,negative,this movie was terrible it lacked respect for the amazing adventure that george lucas inspired there is no proper plot development and a reduction of lukes relevance in the story f
Dec 6 2019,positive,i thought this was far better than the force awakens and did a good job of balancing quality and diversity with all the powerful female characters the pacing is good the effects are good the characters become more dense and relatable than in the first and in the general the movie gives the series a nice direction and poise now rather excited for the third where as force awakens left me with low excitement and exceptions for the last jedi
Dec 6 2019,negative,this is by far the worst star wars ever made worse than attack of the clones even congrats rian johnson successfully ruined star wars
Dec 6 2019,negative,crap disney should have followed the eu
Dec 6 2019,negative,worst out of every star wars movie by a long shot it tried to be funny and failed miserably and there was too much plot convenience in this movie it made me cringe 210 would not watch again
Dec 6 2019,negative,destroyed star wars extremely poor planning from this movie
Dec 6 2019,negative,absolute dogshit ruined the legacy of the movies the only person who could act was adam driver
Dec 6 2019,negative,it just created a wealth of plot holes and misunderstood material the movie showed little to no regard for the ground work laid some scenes shake the value and point of star wars at its core such as holdos suicide mission
Dec 6 2019,negative,basically soul crushing  terrible characters  terrible writing  i only give it 15 stars because its star wars and i love star wars
Dec 6 2019,negative,worst one yet a disappointment i feel sorry for the actors in this film
Dec 6 2019,negative,part two in a trilogy that completely derailed all of the major plot elements from part one and completely closed the book on any reason someone would want to see a sequel  really lazy and politically motivated storytelling  character motivations make no sense in the context of the larger plot
Dec 6 2019,negative,destroyed star wars for me
Dec 5 2019,negative,an unfortunate treatment of the original characters with a complete abandonment of the previous movies course  as well as a mess rian johnson made that the next movie with attempt to recover from clearly altering whatever direction they had planned on originally  whats worse is the side movies like solo which was a very enjoyable film with the feel of star wars receive poor accreditation and sales performance because of this film further tarnishing the legacy of star wars and limiting the boldness in new projects by disney
Dec 5 2019,positive,lives this this is my second favourite star wars movie second to empire strikes back rian johnson did something original with the franchise and expanded the jedi lore i cant wait to see the final chapter in the skywalker saga
Dec 5 2019,negative,a complete mediocre movie that destroys the story that george lucas created by completely disregarding everything stated from episode 1 to episode 6 without any meaningful and logical explanation the characters are poorly writen and the plot is just confusing
Dec 5 2019,negative,as a star wars fan i really wish i could give a good review but from the beginning of the movie to the end it was chocked full of horrible decisions that made me angry and  kept me angry as there was no chance to recover its a bad parody of a star wars movie made by people who have no idea what fans would like to see i hate to say it but one of the worst movies i have ever seen
Dec 5 2019,negative,can we stop giving rian johnson work at this point
Dec 5 2019,negative,it has absolutely nothing to do with all the philosophy of star wars previous universe   they definitely destroyed the character of the most iconic jedi luke skywalker and with him the new trilogy
Dec 5 2019,negative,this is not star wars pure and simple     this movie has force ghosts shoot lightning why not just send your dead jedi to fight your wars    why not just send an xwing to fly in hyperspace right at star killer ahem i mean not another death star    god this disney stuff is crap hopefully the mandalorian and the obiwan kinobe series can manage to mop up this mess as long as the first order is never mentioned     this sequel trilogy needs to be completely forgotten
Dec 5 2019,negative,horrible video not even good enough to call a movie enough said
Dec 5 2019,negative,couldnt even bring myself to finish this absolute dumpster fire attempt at a star wars movie not sure why it is rated highly by critics
Dec 5 2019,negative,breaks the rules that the original universe set up the plot was garbage ryan wilson was not a good choice
Dec 5 2019,negative,should have been so much better
Dec 5 2019,positive,honestly besides going against all of lukes character traits the movie is good in my opinion e8 has one of the most visually appealing fights in the franchise the movie is a bit too long there are certain times when theres really nothing happening for like 10 minutes but the last 30 minutes of the movie are filled with hardcore goosebumps  i dont think they should have made rey as strong as she is luke felt insane powers from kylo and rey while training them   but kylo was actually trained   really kind of an ass pull for rey to be able to win but i guess this is episode 7s fault    looking at my review i can honestly say the movie has it flaws for sure  but god damn did those last 30 minutes and especially the final scene get me hyped up
Dec 5 2019,positive,i loved how truly unexpected it was i dont think its perfect but its definitely worth seeing
Dec 4 2019,negative,should have followed the books disney ruined star wars
Dec 4 2019,negative,this film should be a case study on how to kill a billion dollar franchise
Dec 4 2019,positive,when one puts aside some of the possible logical flaws that many try to use to point fingers at the plot there is a great time to be had star wars has never tried to be a technical realistic spaceopera setting and has always leaned more towards the fantasy aspects with this in mind the story that plays out in this film and many of the moments with our main characters resonate very strongly the largest flaw that brings this movie down a peg is the pacing issue when jumping between the three main stories being told this does not pose enough of an issue to detract from the films many powerful moments several of which were quite literally jawdropping
Dec 4 2019,negative,its worst star wars movie ever made is it even a star wars
Dec 4 2019,positive,loved it  one the best epidodes of the saga i am very exited to see the rise of skywalker
Dec 4 2019,negative,it was just so so bad i mean talk about ruinnung character arcs and taking away all tat is fun and lovabal about star wars lukes arc was a mess and i just wated to scream at the screen the moment he threw away the light sabel an wat was up with rey just beeing like perfcet but in a bad way i dont like people who are just perfect and do everything right i mean show me some flaws man by fare the worst star wars move worse than solo even
Dec 4 2019,negative,a mediocre movie and a terrible star wars broken rythm very bad writing poor dialogs and characters there is simply so little to save from it its a complete mess and it hurts the saga as a whole
Dec 4 2019,neutral,as a star wars fan this would rank in the prequels line of bad but probably a bit worse itd been best if abrams stayed on so at the very least the story wouldnt be butchered
Dec 4 2019,negative,horrible sin linea y coherencia
Dec 4 2019,positive,its simply great because its different and unexpected something star wars hasnt done in a long time the acting pacing cinematography and score is superb it wasnt the normal star wars formula which has led to a lot of hate from many fans the best of the film includes exploring of the ethos of the force while further developing the characters especially rey kylo and luke
Dec 4 2019,negative,absolutely murdered the series
Dec 4 2019,negative,boring characters which are played by boring perfect looking actors it has not got any deeper meaning and it does not send any deeper message to audience it shows a big disrespect to previous movies and it does not take us anywhere it shows us some big contradictions and its colored by sjw politics honestly just a movie for 12 years old kids
Dec 4 2019,positive,i want to thank with all my heart the impeccable work of rian jonhson as director and writer of this film for the simple fact of innovating without fear of the consequences   unlike the force awakens the last jedi is a bold movie that risks and takes unexpectedly majestic paths   i have only one complaint the movie could only have been 2 hours long
Dec 3 2019,negative,it was a ok movie but for star wars it sucked ruined the childhood heros story lines and was way to force woke with far left ideas disney screwed it up makes you miss the prequels
Dec 3 2019,negative,this is the most disappointing movie i have seen i would compare the quality of this film to a brendan fraser or stephen baldwin movie either of those actors would have actually fit right in with this film and it is a shame neither was included if you like brendan fraser or stephen baldwin films you should probably check this movie out worstepisodeever
Dec 3 2019,negative,the worst movie ive ever seen i really mean that
Dec 3 2019,negative,absolute plot hole filled garbage if hyperspace could be harnessed as a weapon the empire would have forewent starkiller bases and the death stars to create empty heavy ships with a hyperdrive to careen in to planets or other ships also the movie makes leia an obscenely powerful force user with little or no training speaking of such rey rea rae rue mary sue is also an incredible force user pilot lightsaber duelist and strategist and has no back story as to how this happened these also break all the rules that have been created in all the other star wars filmsbooks canon or not     in addition bombers such as the ones used in the first scenes are by far inferior to ywings and have no strategic value for anyone during a space battle what rian forgets is that space battles are non linear and have multiple axis of combat what is up in space is relative so the bombers are badly thought out     will go to the next movie just to see how abrams attempts to fix the trainwreck which is this film
Dec 3 2019,negative,absolute waste of time and money the most garbage movie ive ever seen
Dec 3 2019,negative,the worst star wars movie rian totally ruined luke character
Dec 3 2019,negative,this abomination is a film riddled with plot holes and nonsensical actions yes even within the bounds of a fantasy in vain desperation to defy expectation rian johnson has essential characters act in inexplicable ways as if they are suffering from a variety of psychoses this is a hollow sterile shell devoid of magic where style and theme are used as bludgeons against substance with full awareness of the cringeinducing flaws of the prequels i say that this film is an embarrassment to the franchise
Dec 3 2019,negative,it was trash and a disgrace 010
Dec 3 2019,negative,complete betrayal of every character in star wars to subvert expectations for pure shock value shame that charismatic performances were in service to a god awful script keep rian johnson away from star wars like the plague
Dec 3 2019,positive,a nice departure from the retread of the force awakens into new territory with an amazing score as per usual amazing choreography amazing cinematography and an amazing cast among other things mark hamill daisy ridley and adam driver give standout performances the subplot with finn rose and the new shifty character dj leave a bit to be desired but an amazing star wars entry none the less
Dec 3 2019,negative,the worst movie i ever seen
Dec 3 2019,negative,awful way of leading into the next part of the story not needed at all 
Dec 3 2019,negative,a humiliation to the star wars name a complete dumpster fire of a movie
Dec 3 2019,negative,perhaps the most disappointing movie of all time the movie has a sjw agenda that leaves a bad taste in the mouth as it systematically undermines the characters and ethics of the original trilogy the filmmakers attempts to subvert expectations end up hurting the film as they write themselves into a corner that they cant get out of why throw princess leia out into space only to marry poppins her back to safety too many focus groups or lack of direction
Dec 3 2019,negative,pure betrayal to the star wars fans and mythos
Dec 3 2019,negative,just an abysmal movie nothing made sense everything was trash
Dec 3 2019,negative,they jump to hyperdrive and cut a battle station in half if it was that easy then theyd have done it with the death star the entire film didnt work its just awful
Dec 2 2019,negative,joined rotten tomatoes just to give this piece of crap half a star    where do i begin first of all i am not a toxic fan i think most toxic fans actually really wanted to love this movie i really liked tfa and rouge one was definitely my favourite star wars of the disneys i would have liked nothing more than to leave the cinema feeling like i watched a movie as brilliant as tfa or rouge one i didnt on rotten tomatoes a 40 audience score reveals one of two things either a the fans are nasty and want to throw a tantrum at something that was actually brilliant or b the movie was terrible and disappointed the fans i know what my money is on    do not let the good critic score fool you because the critics do not understand star wars they may analyse its direction visual effects or cinematography all of which i loved but there is a star wars magic that was nonexistent in this film by star wars magic i mean anything that resembled a strong story or likeable characters i was expecting as film that carried on the legacy of lucass films this film took dump on them rian johnsons writing was amateurish the story was weak also im going to have to say it jar jar binks had a bigger character arc than rey i personally loved poe in tfa but he looked like a winey brat in this movie couldnt stand holdo rose or even luke not even the people that like this film like the canto bight scenes     but since i am trying to make this review as balanced as possible i will tell you everything i liked about the film the throne scene was good on first watch however on second watch it was abysmally choreographed and a disgrace to all star wars fight scenes john williams score was fantastic as usual driver and ridley acted very well umm thats it     rian johnson was not the man for the job here heck even the prequels are looking attractive now i really wanted to love this film i hated it and im not alone but hey why give the fans a good movie when our expectations have been averted
Dec 2 2019,negative,when someone told me there is going to be a worse movie the phantom menace 20 years ago  i wouldnt belived himher but if you think you reached the bottom there is always someone who digs deeper
Dec 2 2019,negative,very similar to prequels derailed this trilogy by not having a clear protagonist offputting attempts at humor extremely corny background characters and settings that seemed more fitting for a space balls sequel much of the script did not fit with previously made star wars films  almost as if the writer had only heard about star wars films but had not seen them
Dec 2 2019,negative,they ruined a series
Dec 2 2019,negative,visuals were good writing was out of this world bad made the prequels look like a masterpiece hollywood is dying this movie was a freaking lay upi cant imagine that this team of people will ever get to touch star wars again waiting for these 3 movies to end so we can pretend like they ever happened to begin with    my god insultingly bad
Dec 2 2019,negative,total waste of time destroy previous movies
Dec 2 2019,positive,a very nice star wars movie fresh and very good story and script dynamic beat between the scenes full of action and emotional moments solid characters developing following the heros journey monomyth of joseph campbell like george lucas did before in the original trilogy excellent visual effects with amazing worlds the last jedi has everything you want to see from star wars movie
Dec 2 2019,negative,rian johnson dropped the ball on this one while jj did a good job setting up rey with plenty of unanswered questions about her past and her beyond belief abilities to manipulate the force despite being a complete rookie rian johnson just failed to answer any of the questions the fans had   theres a reason why the jedi believe training in the ways of the force is absolutely necessary a botched training would almost guarantee that the padawan will fall to the dark side yet all we see is rey doing even more unbelievably hard things effortlessly she is immuned to the rules of star wars almost as if their need for a strong female character meant they had to bend the rules to her will which makes her unrelatable and unrealistic bad character development is unforgivable
Dec 2 2019,neutral,what is this audience and critic percentage difference im just pointing that out because it really surprised me that critics actually liked the last jedi but audience hate it isnt it suppose to be opposite anyway this film grade is b its highly hated for reasons
Dec 2 2019,negative,ruined the whole series 
Dec 2 2019,negative,with the mandalorian getting high marks on rotten tomatoes and elsewhere it made me go back and check what that wreck of a movie the last jedi was given 91 can i say wtf on here    take the ridiculous premise of speed except set in space so it makes even less sense with jj abrams mystery box writing essential bits of information withheld for no blasted reason other than taking the absolute laziest most incompetent route to a plot point while making the characters look like subhuman idiots in the process and that is the first half of what makes the movie terrible     this movie goes to lengths to deconstruct all the hot shot oneinamillion cowboy gambles laudable goal not very star wars but laudable this is further highlighted with the cowboys being brash jumpy and mostly male and their counterpart being a composed female leader however the hot shots are only taking those gambles because the sage leader has withheld information for this is where i would otherwise wave my hand and say reasons but the film doesnt even bother at pretense when the cowboys are finally privy to information that should have been readily shared long beforehand they essentially bow to their wise leader with a so sorry we should have trusted your leadership instead of why the bleep didnt say so as anyone would rightly say in such a circumstance     the other half of what makes this movie awful is all the lineage it wastes instead of having leah take a meaningful role in the resistance they create a new meaningless leader out of thin air instead of leah who by all accounts should be essentially equal to luke in the force take on the role teacher for the new young female jedi that jedi has to go off and find luke who doesnt want to be found and doesnt want to teach also why exactly is she going off for training since she basically already equalled the highly talented highly trained sith lord with zero training or preparation on her part    the result is that a movie which while trying to be prowoman 1 creates a female leader with the worst most stereotyped male behaviors 2 praises that woman for her decidedly asinine leadership 3 gives the new female jedi all the power for zero work previous film but still 4 still sends her off to a man for training for some reason 5 takes an established female character with extensive military and political experience on top of being one of the most powerful force users and relegates her to a shadow and her force abilities to parlor tricks that dont meaningfully figure into the plot and 6 all the while being too oblivious to realize the counterproductive harm it does as the strawman punching bag the likes of which sexists can only dream     im a dude disclaimer but a pretty committed egalitarian and i can only cringe at how bad and useless it is making women look and cringe a again for thinking it is doing the opposite the 80s films with their princess in need of rescuing still managed to have a stronger and better female character mores the pity because that character is ostensibly in this movie as well     then again the male characters are pretty awful unlikable and or useless if not quite to the same degree and there is the  nonsense rube goldberg plot with heinous dialogue so may it is just awhat do you call it  oh yeah a bad movie    also 44 audience score  that i can believe but these are mostly fan boys and girls that are willing to bend over backwards and forgive a lot so that should skew high making the critic score even more untenable      so 91 no i can think of no explanation for this that doesnt involve a conspiracy  regardless of the reason this is far from the first befuddling discrepancy as rt is inches continually closer to completely loosing its credibility
Dec 2 2019,negative,my god this was not just an embarrassment for star wars fans i am a casual fan but a self important dreary fan film this movie is like a film students first draft immediately breaking previous character development and replacing it with nothing of worth other than subversion why in the world did that casino scene get past writing directing and editing this is an ugly mesh of incompetent film student skill and corporate mishandling i liked lopper and knives out looks interesting this was a major misstep for a rising film maker and a devastating  blow to star wars fans investment in future films
Dec 2 2019,negative,a pile of decomposing excrement has a more compelling plot than this sack of tropeish trash
Dec 2 2019,positive,one of the best sw movies to date i love that it smashes expectations and delves into themes of misdirection and multiple perspective obfuscation  it delivers an emotionally satisfying middle chapter that eclipses the scattershot remix that was ep 7
Dec 2 2019,negative,star wars the last jedi is a cinematic failure in nearly every measurable quantification    the characterization is completely illogical and contradictory as well as inconsistent with preestablished character norms the overall narrative drags and sacrifices coherent plot progression for hamfisted subversion of expectations and blows massive holes in established canon purely for illadvised spectacle    the movie even forces avengersstyle gags that have a beloved place in the marvel cinematic universe but have no rational place anywhere near a star wars film     rian johnson has taken everything about star wars that made it special and thrown it out the window this film is empirically awful and falls apart under any scrutiny makes no sense on its own and certainly is a mess in relation to the previous and following films    one of the worst films ever made
Dec 1 2019,negative,went to see the movie with my father who grew up with the original trilogy and me the prequels we were both significantly alienated by the incoherent story line wish rj had done a better job oh well at least we can appreciate the simple yet focused story telling of the mandalorian ps please stay away from star wars rj 
Dec 1 2019,negative,terrible movie lazy writing
Dec 1 2019,negative,cheesy so many mistakesbad decisions the worst ever star wars movie
Dec 1 2019,negative,missing the good old starwars feeling
Dec 1 2019,negative,terrible just a movie more worried about the artistic then the bigger universe its like the writer has never seen a star wars movie or book ever in his life and just read the cliff notes the plot seems to twist in a forceful arrogant way as a child does the opposite his parents say
Dec 1 2019,negative,this movie literally killed star wars for me right after force awakens revived it
Dec 1 2019,neutral,to me the movie was lackluster first it was 2 ships following each other until the others gas went out leia wasnt even used that much luke wasnt luke he was like obi wan here is a man who brought his father darth freaking vader back to the light only to kill his nephew where was the love at and holdo didnt make any sense i didnt care if she died because i didnt know anything about her but i did like rose but in all the movie was disappointing and hope that episode 9 is better
Dec 1 2019,negative,besides some amazing visuals and a lightsaber battle that was actually pretty cool this movie was a pretty big let down   i wont recycle mass complaints here my thoughts are that tried and true character arcs exist for a reason these characters are not going anywhere and the arcs and growth from characters in the original trilogy have been thrown out the window   trying to keep up with marvel humor and sell merchandise the movie for all its fuzzy creatures and somebodys weird nanny star wars alien fantasy felt very present in a galaxy we know all too well  tlj failed to learn the lesson of the prequels and the remastered nonsense ruining the original trilogy compelling characters and the struggle between the dark and the light are what make the far far away galaxy so beloved not the other way around
Dec 1 2019,negative,a lackluster story pretty much just one big chase scene with a multitude of plot holes unnecessary subplots bad characterisation particularly luke and terrible writing easily the worst star wars movie since episode 2
Dec 1 2019,negative,badvery very badno more rian johnson please
Dec 1 2019,negative,this movie is the worst movie ever it makes me so mad how rian johnson subverted expectations just dumblazy writing from someone who doesnt get star wars ive honestly tried to give this movie a chance im not going to see the rise of skywalker
Dec 1 2019,positive,this is a genuinely good movie that has received far too much hate  it is brilliantly shot and it is not afraid to take chances especially with beloved characters  these bold moves have caused much controversy but they are why i find this movie to be so refreshing it is not afraid to do what other star wars movies have been afraid to do  kylo ren is also a very intriguing villain and rey is very easy to root for i would definitely recommend that everyone watch this movie
Nov 30 2019,negative,this movie was a cinematic failure i cant believe they replaced jj abrams with rian johnson they ruined george lucas legacy
Nov 30 2019,negative,was very disappointed with the ripoff new hope the force awakens but decided to give it another chance and this one was even worse next star wars will be the first i will not see in the theaters sad how amateurs ruin such an important franchise
Nov 30 2019,negative,doesnt even follow the original star wars universe storyline even mark hammil doesnt like this movie terrible movie 
Nov 30 2019,negative,easily the worst movie in the disney wars portfolio
Nov 30 2019,negative,terrible a disgrace to the franchise
Nov 30 2019,negative,what a steaming heap of bantha dung guess i shouldnt have expected too much director cant spell ryan correctly i was a wild failure 
Nov 30 2019,negative,the worst in the series definitely sjw plot points throughout bad guys are all white men star destroyer called the supremacy men are buffoons or previous heroes killed off if the writing was half decent it could have at least been entertaining propaganda
Nov 30 2019,negative,this is the worst star wars movie ever
Nov 30 2019,negative,the movie drags way too much the fight scenes were not memorable except that poorly choreographed dual why did luke drink that milk how did that further the plot i was left with more questions than answers what a mess
Nov 30 2019,negative,i have never seen so many stupid ideas implemented in a single movie ever so many plot holes  so many things that didnt make any sense the worst part is what they did to luke i feel sorry for mark hamill that he had to take a part in this farewell star wars
Nov 30 2019,negative,ruined and tarnished star wars forever 
Nov 29 2019,negative,easily the worst entry to the star wars series for any concerned with the direction or the emotional plot of the saga it was a complete disappointment
Nov 29 2019,positive,this is my opinion i know this movie cut the fanbase in half but i thought this was a great movie all the actors did really good job and the visual effects are amazing great writing and direction this movie sets up a great place for rise of skywalker to begin
Nov 29 2019,negative,this is definitely the worst star wars movie ever but even outside of the star wars universe it just sucked bad pacing bad visuals incredibly boring poor characterization and it wasnt consistent with the previous movie at all the cast did do a good job with the poor material that they were given i will give them credit for that
Nov 29 2019,positive,i loved it rian johnson did an amazing job balancing action with character development to create something i would want to watch over and over again
Nov 29 2019,negative,this is the worst star wars ever its an insult to the star wars universe and mythology on what rian has done
Nov 29 2019,negative,this movie sucked so bad i made an account to write a review
Nov 29 2019,negative,no need to rehash its just a terrible movie and retroactively torpedoed tfa as well made it impossible to recover the trilogy since all the remaining characters are one dimensional and noncompelling hopefully with time disney will sell the rights to the franchise and this trilogy can be taken from canon and replaced with actual star wars movies in the star wars universe rather than knockoff marvel trope with the force
Nov 28 2019,negative,this soulless cash grab i mean movie almost ruined star wars for me if you want to watch star wars watch the original trilogy and even the prequels i wish more care had been taken when attempting to add one of the most globally beloved franchises ever this movie was no only a waste of time but was an insult to star wars
Nov 28 2019,negative,the amount of series breaking plot holes and lack of character in this movie make me feel like whoever wrote the story think all star wars fans want is pretty colors and explosions
Nov 28 2019,negative,with endless gotcha moments and your mom jokes this is an utter failure rj has forever ruined star wars
Nov 28 2019,negative,i mainly watch these for the light saber fight scenesthis lacked those scenes one of plot lines seemed almost pointless as well like if we took it out no one would have been able to tell the difference as for the overall story i struggled to sit through this one
Nov 28 2019,negative,disappointing and a bit of a let down
Nov 28 2019,positive,i really enjoyed this film i thought it was unique and fun and took the story in a new direction which was super enjoyable loved the storytelling and the acting was amazing
Nov 28 2019,negative,this movie was very frustrating and disappointing it didnt feel to be part of a star wars universe
Nov 27 2019,negative,ehmmmmm less than decent  4510
Nov 27 2019,positive,this was a pretty solid movie now this sequel is over 2 hours and a half so because of this i removed 1 complete star if its not for the time this star wars movie really captivated me and i think that this is a pretty underrated movie by the audience the final battle in this was just super awesome  if you found this review helpful please type on youtube the gangs official trailer kzm production and tell me what you think in the comments
Nov 27 2019,negative,so unbelievably bad
Nov 27 2019,positive,my favorite star wars movie as a almost life long fan of the series i felt it was respectful yet different it gave me some of my favorite scenes of the entire series
Nov 27 2019,negative,i really hope the next star wars movie isnt this horrendous
Nov 26 2019,positive,absolutely loved tlj yes there are moments that were a little on the lower quality mark but overall as a star wars fan all my life it is up there with my favourites where some feel characters were ruined i felt they were given more dimensions and their flaws that were ever present in the og trilogy were highlighted here and new characters grew stronger and took the stage
Nov 26 2019,negative,this movie ruins the plot that the last 6 movies tried desperately to fix and the ending is just bad dont watch this unless you are devoted
Nov 26 2019,negative,great franchise that was completely ruined by this one movie  the way they turned one of the most loved heroes of all time into a bitter old man was just plain stupid  if i could have given zero stars i would have
Nov 26 2019,negative,worst ever unbelievably bad
Nov 26 2019,negative,very bad movie no imagination
Nov 26 2019,negative,truly the worst star wars movie
Nov 26 2019,negative,terrible movie in general ruins one of the most iconic charcters in the franschise and tries to play it off with something that does not even make sense to his character
Nov 26 2019,negative,did the world need one more opinion on this movie  well here it is    were not supposed to complain that star wars scenarists ruin our childhood because its our problem not theirs maybe but on the other hand they capitalise on our childhood to make us dole out dozens of dollars to see their movie by selling it as a sequel  so  spoilers  to see luke skywalker as a bitter old looser to watch princess leia send herself through space through fart propulsion and have a sickeningly unconvincing love story between two ethnicexcuse characters shoved down our throat is indeed tainted the memory of 1977s wonder a bit
Nov 26 2019,positive,awesome better than the force awakens definitely worth watching
Nov 26 2019,negative,this film is the most cringeworthy awkward stupid film in the star wars franchise i cant count how many times i screamed wtf or fuck this not entertaining not fun just dumb
Nov 26 2019,negative,butchered star wars entirely disney got too disney
Nov 25 2019,negative,when i watched the film i had the same feeling at the end as when i saw the end of got ok i guess that was it it was ok i guess i would not watch it again but yeeeeeah   and then as time goes on i start feeling cheated and then i check in on the internet and realise so do alot of other people no more cinema visits for star wars until they get there act together  big problem is there is no character development every time a interesting challenge presents itself to the characters they make a choice that leads for a dull story
Nov 25 2019,negative,the worst movie i have ever seen in my life never would have guessed coming from one of the best franchises of all time just disappointing in every way
Nov 25 2019,negative,this movie is shit no other world can descird it
Nov 25 2019,negative,awful a shame that it is called star wars
Nov 25 2019,negative,wtf why did they do my bro luke like that
Nov 25 2019,positive,star wars the last jedi not only brought an emotional story but it brought an amazing franchise and honestly this movie is amazing the action the score and the characters were all amazing and i cant wait to see what the end of the saga has in store i definitely recommend you all go see the last jedi its amazing
Nov 25 2019,negative,at least the soundtrack was good
Nov 25 2019,negative,horrible ill just pretend the disney sequels just dont exist and star wars ended with episode vi
Nov 25 2019,negative,this movie is awful how they try to ruin luke sky walkers character blows my mind
Nov 24 2019,negative,it was horrible it was the worst movie i had seen in a long time
Nov 24 2019,positive,its not terrible like everyone says it is but not the best one either
Nov 24 2019,negative,the last jedi betrays the essence of what star wars is and is a bitter disappointment for anyone who still cares for the franchise      johnson and kennedy have used this film to primarily promote their own gender  political ideology instead of focusing on good storytelling and a cohesive narrative subversion of expectation is the new norm and poorly placed marvel like comedic elements lower the bar for the movies dialogue and come across as a cheap way of attempting to appeal to modern audiences     the cliffhanger ending jj built towards in ep vii is deflated for a cheap gag lightsaber tossed away and is indicative of johnsons disregard of the previous films jj even admitted in an interview that johnson disregarded the draft narrative ideas jj had written for ep viii and decided to write his own material instead the result is film which tries to trailblaze a new direction for the franchise but ends up burning the house down    one of the more disappointing elements is reys character which hasnt been given any room to develop instead were presented with a character with little flaws and a mastery of the force that would usually take other jedi male and female alike decades to master one must remember this movie takes place literally days after the events of ep vii meaning that in the space of a week without training she has been afforded a level of power that conflicts with what has been established in previous films and extended media shes also incredibly hard to empathise with as she barely faces any kinds of struggle or adversity and its hard to name any notable development outside of her parental revelation that allows us to truly get behind her as a heroine     other female characters like leia and rose tico dont fare any better leia is sidelined for most of the movie and performs a mary poppins maneuver through space which has no grounding based on what weve seen from her character previously its incredibly jarring and comes across as cheap and unbelievable rose as character is quite likeable but is only really ever used in the completely unnecessary canto bright subplot to talk about the dark side of capitalism and slavery her questionable high school speech and kiss on finn at the end of the movement also has no gravity or development and is very hard to take seriously a missed opportunity      finn as well was a strong character showing much promise from ep vii his redemption arc from a war criminal to a resistance hero was compelling despite this johnson chooses subverts expectation by stopping him from sacrificing his life to destroy the laser cannon at the end of the film by denying his sacrifice and by already defeating captain phasma his character is now in this awkward place at the end of his arc with nowhere to go     perhaps the biggest misstep of the film is the character assassination of luke skywalker who is reduced to a grumpy old hermit and a former husk of his idealistic self johnson wants us to believe that luke after seeing a glimmer of the dark side in his nephew would murder him in his sleep this is the character that previously put his life on the line to save his father because he saw a glimmer of hope in the heart of one of the most evil men in the galaxy its inconceivable that he wouldnt have behaved in a similar way with kylo and betrays lukes character arc from the original trilogy     we were led to believe from the marketing of this film that the original characters like luke would play a bigger part in the end of the skywalker saga trilogy we were misled and it is clear these now secondary characters were used for pure nostalgia baiting purposes only one has to feel sorry for hamill who gives the best performance he can with the material he was given to work with one must only watch his interviews where he makes it abundantly clear that the direction of this luke is a betrayal of the character he helped bring to life    the prequels for all their flaws script character development at least had a cohesive story line interesting characters despite having flawed dialogue and delivery in cases and great world building which ultimately made one appreciate the original trilogy even more the sequel trilogy is turning out to be a mess with no grand vision across all 3 episodes which is an utter tragedy given the resources and talent at lucasfilms disposal the fact that kennedy abrams and johnson disregarded lucass notes for what this trilogy says it all really    the last jedi is a mediocre film at best when you take it as its own thing but ultimately fails as a star wars film its a big misstep for the franchise and a missed opportunity for giving us new characters to love a new story to really get behind and a good send off for our legacy characters what a shame
Nov 24 2019,negative,this feels as if both the writer and director have tried to cram ideas for an entire trilogy into one filmextremely rushed  it is plain rotton
Nov 24 2019,negative,i rated this bad and was trying to give it a chance on disney plus but it was worse second time around a shame
Nov 24 2019,negative,terrible ignored the storylin didnt make sense annoying characters basically everyone but rey even managed to ruin luke leia and yoda this movie was a goddned tragedy
Nov 24 2019,negative,this movie is so utterly horrible that it makes me mad just thinking about it i still cant believe how they managed to ruin multiple of the most beloved characters while giving room to new poorly written ones that nobody cares about
Nov 23 2019,negative,the movie broke too many rules of star wars and by doing so it created plot holes why didnt the jedi in the prequels ever project themselves why didnt they control lightsabers with the force why didnt the rebels or clones ever use kamikaze light speed ships during the clone wars or to destroy the death stars why can force ghost use the force to affect the living the list goes on and on and not just with plot holes plain bad writing across the board
Nov 23 2019,negative,ummmmmmwhat happened i have no words
Nov 23 2019,negative,i did a little survey after this movie came out  i went around a retirement home and asked people who had seen a star wars movie before one simple question     do you think luke skywalker would ever try to kill his nephew in his sleep  0 of respondents though it was incharacter for luke      this movie ruins one of the most beloved characters in cinema history
Nov 23 2019,negative,horrible just horrible rey was somehow able to fight off snokes imperial guards a force youd expect to be extremely highly trained and kill snoke without him noticing this is despite her only having what about a week of training at the most and dont even get me started on the holdo maneuver    ugh im just glad i didnt have to pay to see the movie well besides my time 2 12 hours wasted
Nov 23 2019,negative,mark hamill tried to warn us rian johnson should have listened to him we should have as well
Nov 23 2019,negative,poorly made script writing and story plot holes this movie has no sense of direction it is only for people who care about this new age of star wars if you can call it that that is why i give this movie a half star
Nov 23 2019,negative,trainwreck of a movie and a disgrace to the saga
Nov 23 2019,negative,i finally got to see this movie and im absolutely shocked at how disappointed i was totally misunderstood and misused luke completely disrespecting the character and crapped all over what a heroes journey is supposed to be hamfisted nonsensical romance between people with no chemistry or whos pairing is unnecessary i was so excited too they basically game of throned this what a slap in the face  it took the force awakens and said naw scratch that listen subverting expectations is one thing totally crapping on a legacy and wiping your butt with it is quite another sure visuals are awesome but it just felt empty
Nov 22 2019,negative,its hard to overstate just how incredibly disappointing this movie was while the last jedi was far from perfect it set up the new trilogy nicely by introducing compelling new characters and leaving you with plot mysteries that were genuinely enticing and left the audience wanting to know the answers instead of building on the development of these new characters with the exception of kylo and rey and plot mysteries reys parentage snokes origins rian johnson seems to actively go out of his way to spit in the face of fans and subvert the fanbases expectations instead of more character development we see screen time hogged by the newly introduced rose tico and admiral holdo whose lack of character depth is matched only by their genuine cringeyness and unlikeability in fact in what had the potential to be the only compelling moment in the film for finn rose tico literally smashes her way into the scene and delivers the least deserved kiss in cinematic history instead of the answers to the compelling plot mysteries rian johnson instead unceremoniously dismisses both in a matter of minutes when snoke dies with no explanation at all of his origins or his connections to characters like luke and palpatine and reys parentage is outright dismissed    i loved rian johnsons looper but he is just not fit to make star wars movies and it is so disappointing that he completely and intentionally derailed the abundant potential of this trilogy in some sort of edgy artistic statement just read between the lines of what mark hamill and andy serkis and jj abrams have said about this film none of them like the direction it went    i will not be posting spoilers here but i will tell you i have read the verified leaked plot of episode ix and it makes this movie seem even worse in hindsight the threads between episodes vii and ix are there and tangible and if the connecting movie had been even somewhat competently made we would easily have a trilogy that surpasses the prequels it is just mind boggling that disney allowed rian johnson to throw such a massive wrench in the story of this trilogy with absolutely no heed being paid to episodes vii or ix and essentially the plot to thread water for two and a half hours which inevitably led them to bringing jj abrams back in an attempt to rescue the trilogy completely ignoring important plot points isnt a plot twist rian its lazy writing and its an insult to the fans one is left wondering how disney did not go into this trilogy with a concrete storyline set for the directors to follow even a minimal amount of overall story planning or just having the same director for all three movies could have made this trilogy great and instead were sitting here hoping that abrams can somehow tie it all together in under three hours while still advancing the plot it is truly a tragedy that abrams did not get to direct this whole trilogy    it is promising that the mandalorian and fallen order have solid plots and appear well made but at the same time they comparatively make this trainwreck of a film stand out even more the last jedi is a blackeye on the star wars canon that greatly surpasses even the oftmaligned phantom menace and attack of the clones in its disappointment and makes the latter two films seem practically great by comparison rian johnson should be ashamed of himself and not allowed within a parsec of this franchise ever again    help us jj abrams youre our only hope
Nov 22 2019,negative,star wars has a massive history not just including the 8 films out now there is a lot of history that fans have studied over the years and many many rules created by lucas that were thrown out the window here    it is equivalent of going to another country and insulting anothers culture which can be seen as ignorant and rude
Nov 22 2019,negative,im not a huge star wars fan but i love all the original movies they are classics and i watched them a few times during my childhood  i wasnt a fan of the previous the force awakens but this is just as bad if not worse  the acting feels so out of placekylo ren always looks like hes about to cry not terrifying like a sith lord should be  luke says some weird one linerstheres parts that are obviously forced writing to be funny  i know the originals had funny moments but they took themselves seriously  that was part of the magic  the last jedi doesnt even to take itself seriously  it seems to make fun of itself constantly like when rey is training with luke  there are so many weird momentsi just cant endorse this film  i wanted to like it so bad  but i cant  there are great fight scenes and space battles which is the only reason i dont give it one star  sorry disney its just not star wars anymore
Nov 22 2019,negative,i mean id give it a 0 if possible
Nov 22 2019,negative,so many things about this one that made it bad from poor character development terrible for the second movie in the sequel trilogy to bringing in things that wed never seen before in sw and frankly didnt need to see  felt forced and riddled with an agenda
Nov 22 2019,negative,worst star wars movie plot holes the size of planets mishandled and unnecessary characters movie doesnt continue the story of the force awakens in a believable manner because of the ending the story has nowhere to go in the next movie
Nov 22 2019,positive,entertaining but the many plot holes left us wanting more
Nov 21 2019,negative,it was even worse than force awakens lost all interest in these terrible disney sequels
Nov 21 2019,negative,an absolute insult to all star wars fans  stupid character writing  embarrassing fighting scenes and that one princess leia scene are absolutely fatal
Nov 21 2019,negative,this movie has great visuals and if your looking for a good action scifi you will love this movie however if you are looking for a great star wars movie look else where this movies give no thought to any previous star wars movie when creating a story or shape its character in fact this movie spits straight into the face of george lucas and any  star wars fan looking for star wars movie a true stain on the franchise
Nov 21 2019,negative,one of the worst follow up films to a trilogy entry of all time i think regardless if you think the force awakens is cookie cutter or not it setup some interesting plot points that the last jedi not only did not honor interestingly but at some points flat out ignored them
Nov 21 2019,negative,its so horrible i returned to my home at 3 am and watched episode 5 to clean my soul and eyes the superhumansjedisladies and the superloosersboys is becoming rule in hollywood its a shame such ideologycrap spet in the audience rest in peace george lucas rip
Nov 21 2019,negative,id give it zero stars if possible ive loved star wars for years rian johnson and kathleen kennedy have single handedly ruined the franchise in one less than expert stroke they completely betrayed the characters and spirit of star wars every male character is portrayed as either misogynistic or incompetent or both basic rules of the story universe were just ignored or purposely cast aside there arent enough negative adjectives in all spoken languages combined to sufficiently describe just how bad it is the constant underpinnings of social justice warrior nonsense is panderingly sickening they have forever lost me as a fan  horrific utterly
Nov 21 2019,negative,was a fan since 79  convinced my fiance to go see it      now im single  turned to the dark side and burned my star wars collection  save 2 12 hours of your life and do something more entertaining like take a nap
Nov 21 2019,negative,awful confused angering unfaithful to characters and a story we have been watching since the 70s tore up something great when there was no need to ruined any possibility of the new trilogy being good can jj save this in ep 9 im not sure so much damage was done
Nov 20 2019,neutral,the second installment of the new trilogy is here its star wars by disney does it meet the expectations the last film set will our questions be answered will they gracefully end carrie fishers character now that shes gone will the guy who sat behind me in the theater ever stop coughing and kicking my seat whenever a new star wars film is released it feels like buying a brand new used car  it smells nice runs nice but when you start to look closer at it the cracks appear and theres a weird stain you didnt notice before disney seems to be steering the franchise in an uncreative direction and it might mean that we may never get another empire strikes back again it just feels like another commercial product and less like a creative collaboration that filmmaking is meant to be     when we last left our heroes rey had found an old and emotionally battered luke skywalker with plans to convince him to return to the fight against evil finn was in a coma from his wounds han was killed by his son and the resistance had destroyed the starkiller base unfortunately this film has a lot of problems  none of which has to do with tone action or acting the star wars films have always delivered on those except with the dark and depressing tone of rogue one like the force awakens i felt like i was watching the space opera that the fans love the characters are charismatic the visuals are stunning the music is great the set pieces are interesting and unique and the lore is well fleshed out   daisy ridley as rey is once again the stand out performance her character is so much fun to watch even if she is a bit too flawless by that i mean she doesnt have any character flaws  such as naivety ignorance or temptation to the dark side the other characters are brash make mistakes or underestimate a situation only to learn from it rey always seems to be immune to that unlike the last film we actually get dialogue and character development from mark hamill as luke skywalker the hero of the original trilogy his character is broken and filled with guilt for causing the downfall of ben solo han and leias son his character seems like the one with the most of an arc as hes struggling to make amends with his past as well as prevent further disaster from happening poe dameron oscar isaac gets a lot more screen time this time around his story is one of trying to protect the remaining members of the resistance oscar issac is very likable and you want to see his character succeed john boyega returns as finn and steals every scene hes in with his charisma and charm carrie fisher returns one last time as leia the general of the resistance and mother to ben solokylo ren she has a wit to her that never gets old and her motherly personality brings a warmth to any scene shes in unfortunately she has a scene which resulted in me laughing in my head but its not her fault last but not least my favorite character from the last film kylo ren adam driver is a force to be reckoned with here you find yourself having sympathy for him and you never really know which side of the spectrum hes on until he makes it clear which is a testament to his acting and the writing   the script and editing are where the film seems to fall apart about a half an hour into the film the characters must go on a mission that will help save lives but it lasts so damn long and feels much less interesting than the two other main plots its like the scene from the force awakens with the tentacle monsters where it serves a single purpose lasts too long and feels like it could have been done differently but where the force awakens soars in comparison is the wellpaced editing and scenes that each serve a specific purpose even if the story is a softreboot of star wars 1977   my biggest gripe with this film is the resolutions of ideas set up in the last film so many fan theories were posted online that guessed how it would all play out the film wraps them up very quickly has disappointing answers or doesnt answer them at all leaving many fans and moviegoers disappointed   ultimately star wars the last jedi has its fun moments but has many flaws that will leave fans and audiences divided for years to come disney seems to be steering this ship off course but compared to the disasters that were the prequels at least this movie allows the audience to still have fun and doesnt leave us scratching our heads wondering whats happening the expansion of the story of this universe might be at its limit and the only thing holding it together is the massive loyal fandom and its brand name

Nov 20 2019,negative,ridiculous too many problems to talk about
Nov 20 2019,negative,a disgrace to every star wars fan terrible production company kathleen kennedy should just step down
Nov 20 2019,negative,yes a few visually stunning scenes nothing else good about this movie
Nov 20 2019,positive,an incredible film  very complicated and wellplotted with several plotsplot arcs perfectly tied in together  a very deep and thoughtprovoking film too diving deeper into the force than any other star wars movie  plenty of character development  especially for luke mark hamill gives his best performance yet  enjoyed the themes  while more plot and themecentric than prior installments the action we get is fantastic  especially the holdo maneuvre  the special effects are dazzling and the music score great  and oh that climax  a highly recommended film
Nov 20 2019,negative,this movie is a joke  i hope it was a joke and that they did a trick we will only get in ep9
Nov 20 2019,negative,an absolute cinematic failure riddled with plot holes and disrespect for the lore
Nov 20 2019,negative,that was terrible  disgraceful attempt at a star wars story progression
Nov 20 2019,negative,literally my least favorite star wars movie
Nov 20 2019,negative,this movie is was a mess bad story bad character development horrible dialogue   the writing choices betrayed the characters from the movies that preceded it especially luke  and retroactively made other star wars movies worse  dont waste your time on this stinker
Nov 19 2019,negative,abomination rian johnson point blank said he likes to make movies that divide the fan base well  he succeeded terrible plot betrayal of classic characters and political brow beating can all be found aplenty here if youre into that sort of thing the only redeeming qualities are luke imitating the force with a leaf and the freaking porgs
Nov 19 2019,negative,not as sleep inducing as the force awakens because it has twists that cause anger and jokes that cause cringe
Nov 19 2019,negative,everything about this movie was terrible  nothing matters anymore the force is female expectations must be subverted
Nov 19 2019,negative,after watching the full series with my girlfriend this movie stood out in a very negative way if feels like they completely rewrote lukes personality further the girl who saved finn not only killed herself but also killed literally the entire rebellion and finn to her knowledge in a weird and unnatural sacrifice also why would ice foxes exist on a salt planet there are a lot more weird reasons this move was underwhelming mostly character deaths and characters that should have died but im not here to cover all of them
Nov 19 2019,negative,the worst of all the star wars films  lame casino scene lame luke story no depth is added to rey when there could have been the movie feels drawn out and i have no attachment at the end no real questions or curiosity about the last film in the biggest movie franchise of all time  thats how bad rj fudged this movie up
Nov 19 2019,negative,i recall leaving the movie feeling well nothing it took me a rewatch to realize that i wouldnt ever want to see it again i appreciated the attempt to do something different with star wars by playing around with the themes and commenting on the black and white morality inimical to star wars yet there was so much that didnt make sense be it luke skywalkers unclear motivations and character twist to suddenly killing off the main villain whose role was never really clarified anyway that it hindered enjoyment again i was with the movies characterization of kylo ren and could accept not love rey as an archetype who doesnt necessarily need to be relatable in all respects not every character needs to be relatable and if we did need such a character it was probably finn but the attempts to subvert expectations portraying kylo as not all that evil and the light and dark side as important to maintaining balance were seemingly thrown away at movies end it comes back to a typical story arch and tries to replicate the joy of return of the jedis ending as if the previous thirty minutes of defeat had not occurred i could go into the others flaws in the film but to be honest even after listing all of them on its own this movie would probably get at least twothree stars why am i rating it so low because its a star wars movie the biggest fear of the franchise being bought out by an impersonal corporation albeit one typically attuned to youth culture was that films would be put out with little concern for its origins and for what could be added to the world to make it more endearing to a new generation children didnt need to insert themselves into a figure randomlyimbued with force powers they wanted heroes they could aspire to be and the shoehorning of finn the previous films most relatable character was a mistake moreover the fear was that a company lacking the creator of the series would be content to coopt the franchise for their own purposes disregarding original intent in favor of using a recognizable media as a vessel to further an elaborate moneygrab to be fair this probably isnt rian johnsons fault were he making his own science fiction series even as an homagecritique of star wars that i would ultimately accept and rate higher because it like original star wars it would be an original contribution to the world of science fiction rather than a disorganized attempt to pack the 2017 holiday movie season and sell toys even if that was partly lucas attempt from the beginning he did understand the strategy to creating a new story or at least creating something that furthered the timehonored mission of storytelling rather than putting wishfulfillment and inappropriate comedy at the fore
Nov 19 2019,negative,we may never see a good star wars movie again fuel um fuel a never mentioned item in 7 movies becomes the best plot point you can get
Nov 19 2019,negative,bad scenariobad acting there is nothing good about this movie it boring its cringe and there is nothing interesting in that movie
Nov 18 2019,negative,flat characters poor arcs feels more like a b rate television mini series than a contribution to one of the greatest fictional worlds we have   used primarily as a vessel to cram politically correct ideologies down the audiences throat at the expense of a good movie
Nov 18 2019,negative,the last jedi is not the star wars movie iwe wanted  notmyskywalker
Nov 18 2019,negative,worst thing to ever happen to star wars  the entire staff should be fired over this
Nov 18 2019,negative,this movie literally killed any hope i had for disney star wars
Nov 18 2019,negative,derivative in all the wrong ways original in all the wrong ways   does an equally awful job of handling the new characters as it does the legacy characters   much of the film is pointless and the moments that arent pointless are terrible   not to mention a very racist film starwarshatespoc
Nov 18 2019,negative,after seeing this for the first time i tried to convince myself that it was okay but after seeing it a second time i came to the realization that the last jedi does not work for me as a star wars movie sure it was beautifully shot ill give it that but it had terrible plot and character development    with regards to character development original characters like luke were completely disrespected others like ackbar chewbacca c3po and r2d2 were pushed to the sidelines when it comes to the new characters rey finn phasma and snoke were completely lacking in development others like rose and holdo just got on my nerves completely    with regards to plot this movie was a hot mess of bait and switch luke is important no wait he is a looser who gave up on lifeok at least he will train rey no wait he will just stick grass in her face and rey will train herself ok the codebreaker is important no wait they just find some random dude who will insure that this planplot point is a pointless failure wow leia was just killed no wait wtf she just saved herself by becoming mary poppins in space wow we finally get to meet and learn about snoke no wait he is dead nowok but wow it looks like rey and kylo are going to team up oh wait never mind wow finn is going to sacrifice himself never mind rose just tboned him wow luke finally decided to grow a pair and is going to face off against kylo and the first order oh wait he is just a stupid hologram and not actually there oh look apparently stupid holograms are too much for luke because he just blew away like a fart in the wind how nice
Nov 18 2019,negative,the only other star wars movie thats better than this one is darth maul apprentice
Nov 18 2019,negative,what a horrible load of dog poo had to create an account on here just to dump on this
Nov 18 2019,negative,a terrible halfasked movie that fans hated this movie tarnished so much of star wars but people keep blaming disney when it should be the director they shouldve kept jj abrams but sadly we got a loser instead the movie delivered the worst ending to luke skywalker and completely focused too much on rose and ben solo
Nov 18 2019,negative,words are not needed so bad poor directing no actions make sense
Nov 18 2019,negative,it was identity politics on this movie i did not recognize luke skywalker killing the main bad guy  using light speed to kill a big ship  never has the previous movies did that   the only way to fix next movie is to time travel which will still ruin it
Nov 18 2019,negative,horrible terrible movie full of gotcha gags and plot twists disgusting terrible movie
Nov 17 2019,negative,garbage movie every decision the director chose was wrong truely does not care about fans  critics arent reflective of actual people who watched it
Nov 17 2019,negative,it was horrible rian johnson ruined the setups that tfa made he took the giant cliffhanger that we were left on and just crapped all over it and he st all over lukes character as well it was all  stupid choices with stupid justifications and for the stupid sake of subverting expectations
Nov 17 2019,negative,visually stunning but painful for a star wars fan
Nov 17 2019,neutral,the whole movie was just a chase through space literally and figuretively
Nov 17 2019,negative,terrible kill the past the main theme in the movie is also the biggest issue its a movie that wants to do something new while trying to destroy everything it was build on  i think the best way to describe it is trying to build a sky scrapper using its own foundations as the building material  all it adds up to is a demolition of failure that destroys what it stood on having the movie fall on its face without anything to stand on
Nov 17 2019,negative,it was highly disappointing replaced the worst movie of the series for me it was too obvious in its plot ie snook being killed and the guy who betrayed the plans favorite moment was when the rebel ship hyper jumped into the first order command ship disliked po basicly taking a back seat for the just to complain the whole time but that does fit in ith the typical skywalker characteri was going to toshi station to pick up some power converters  another note this film pushed feminist themes up the wall with more useless characters than what the series had previously leia fisher was a great example where the themes were still there but they werent in your face every single time the character spoke really should have pulled from other star wars movies and shows on how to make a strong female lead other than leia examples would be like ashoka tano padme sabine wren or jyn erso all of those were awesome and strong female leads   finally i came for the action and battles that the series is known for not sitting listening to a slow drawn out chase of running permanently out of fuel for an hour
Nov 16 2019,negative,very lack luster plot holes plot armor i understand its part of a trilogy but rendered a lot of useless scenes and a lot of useless screen time overall the worst star wars movie yet worse than attack of the clones
Nov 16 2019,negative,the whole movie is just bad lazy writing full of plotholes no character development unclear character motivations social justice and feminism shoehorned into the movie this is just the ruining of a universe established by 6 former films really bad and such a waste of great characters like luke and leia shame on you rian and kathleen shame on you
Nov 16 2019,negative,slow inconsistent with characters
Nov 16 2019,negative,worst movie ever who decided to have such a terrible plot what a waste of my time
Nov 15 2019,negative,the only way to describe this movie a mistake by someone who does not understand what star wars was about
Nov 15 2019,negative,i love star wars and the history and build up it has however this movie was just terrible it had awful plot and they are painting the empire as the bad guys when clearly they are the good guys who brought order to the universe
Nov 15 2019,negative,definitely not worth seeing
Nov 15 2019,negative,this movie was complete dog shit
Nov 15 2019,negative,trash just total trash 
Nov 15 2019,negative,hitting your head on a keyboard doesnt make you a good writer
Nov 15 2019,negative,the worst movie i ever saw ruin johnson managed to destroy the star wars franchise and thats pretty impressive in terms of the amount of fail that one individual can accomplish  he actually made me miss jarjar ewoks and anakins sand rant    terrible character development illogical story and disrespectful to fans and source material
Nov 15 2019,negative,if youre a fan of the franchise and just want to sit down and watch a star wars movie youre at the wrong place if youre a casual and dont care about any of the facts and lore from star wars as a whole and dont care about what was previously established in episode 7 than im sure youll love this hot garbage
Nov 14 2019,negative,terrible movie poorly written characters and generic action its so bad i dont want to watch the force awakens ever again and dont care about seeing rise of whatever its supposed to be
Nov 14 2019,negative,i cant believe how a great franchise can be ruined by one person it was terrible and only got worse on the 2nd viewing
Nov 14 2019,negative,completely ignored both episode 7 and the original trilogy just ti be different and subvert expectations not a great strategy for a sequel the plot went nowhere the forced humor fell flat probably the worst star wars ive ever seen 
Nov 14 2019,negative,hats off to actors and production people whose work was trapped in a boring story
Nov 14 2019,negative,tlj is a poorly written film with a nonsensical plot  many of the scenes in this film were utterly silly the first orders chase of the rebels in space luke contemplating the coldblooded murder of his nephew lukes reluctance to engage in the fight against the first order leahs use of the force to fly in space did anyone at disney question the wisdom of this scene and the entire canto bight sequence  johnsons attempts at humor were cheesy and misplaced  i have no interest in the characters no fault of the actors and sadly have little desire to see what happens in the final act of the skywalker saga      disney please seek out talented writers and give your writers the time necessary to develop great stories  these films have been rushed and the star wars franchise and the legacy of its characters have been tarnished as a result
Nov 14 2019,neutral,2 12 stars exactly half the maximum is the most generous rating i could give taking into account both fans and casual moviegoers as passable entertainment it delivers quite well there is an adequate amount of lightsabering posturing and laser pewpewing to convince casual fans of the franchise that this is a good film     however it doesnt quite sit snuggly into the mythos and cannon of star wars true rian johnson took the cannon in a different direction and earned a saturn award for it but one could say the same if he put a jedi cat in the movie too it establishes a few unreasonable precedents as well a nobody can train themselves to defeat the top dark jedi of the first order handedly and fly a spaceship better than the one who owned it for most of his life with no further exposition i just feel sorry for all the young jedistobe who quite literally think they are jedi masters eschewing training and thinking they are the next rey     i ultimately see a satirical archetype waiting to be brought to the screen and that is one of the only conceivable ways to follow up a sw movie like rian johnsons a lot of the visual gimmicks are insultingly obvious cash grabs  the porgs although they are designed to be cute like the ewoks do nothing in the film except to look cute and churn out a few laughs  unlike the ewoks which actually served a purpose in the plot    if i have never heard of star wars past seeing a lunchbox from the 1980s then i think i would have thoroughly enjoy this film and thats how i recommend fans watch this film feign alzheimers and keep picturing that star wars lunchbox in your head you welcome
Nov 14 2019,negative,should i really explain why this is pure garbage 
Nov 14 2019,negative,rian please dont go near a star wars film again
Nov 14 2019,negative,disappointing too many moments where you stopped being absorbed in the film and instead thought what is going on too many important plot points poorly explained to the audience and too many of our old heroes rejected and ridiculed
Nov 14 2019,negative,the issue i have with this film is that it was just plain ugly people chasing each other the camera chasing them all over the place no elegance no aesthetic consistency no care for colour palettes not a single good shot i have nothing against the progressiveness of the film i love that but unlike previous star wars films this one looks like the usual crappy modern silly cgiladen action blockbuster with zero artistic ambition even the prequels had their moments of visual mastery nothing like that in the last jedi just plain ugly
Nov 14 2019,negative,whats the point in world building when the director and producer are just gonna ignore it all
Nov 14 2019,negative,what a masterful turd baked up by rian johnson
Nov 14 2019,negative,terrible plot a two hour chase seriously  rian johnson ruined movie
Nov 13 2019,negative,disney fail    seemed like fan fiction at best yuck 
Nov 13 2019,negative,abysmal writing and offensive misunderstanding of the world in which it takes place
Nov 13 2019,negative,so with rian we get a coward luke gravity in space drag in space hyperspace weapons and a terrible rey lineage  oh and who was snoke  i dont know man this movie failed on every level except graphics  the movie was beautiful  beautifully awful
Nov 13 2019,positive,inconsistent is the last jedi
Nov 13 2019,negative,to surmise this garbage movie its a total betrayal of luke skywalkers character rian johnson tarnishes the legacy george lucas created by reducing our beloved characters to insignificant and apathetic bystanders  all previous character development from the original trilogy is cast aside and we are faced with characters doing and saying things that are the complete opposite of who theyve been built up to be there is a complete lack of essential context to the frankly bizarre key moments in this film overall its just a trainwreck of a story dolled up with great visuals
Nov 13 2019,negative,the plot holes are so big you could drive a deathstar through them no continuity with the previous movie cash grab disney movie
Nov 13 2019,negative,this movie was a disgrace to the franchise rian didnt understand the context behind anything that happened in the previous movies and therefor couldnt write a single good thing mark tried to warn him but they didnt listen just a piece of rotten garbage
Nov 13 2019,negative,it wasnt luke skywalker but some sort of ultra diminished shadow intent in eliminating everything good about him
Nov 13 2019,negative,i finally watched the movie very disappointing its very predictable and boring
Nov 13 2019,negative,destroys the legacy of luke skywalker no coherent storyline plot point everywhere this movie was awful
Nov 13 2019,negative,this film is all cleverness without the heart or soul of the original trilogy it is as if the writer missed that star wars is predominantly driver by character and emotion and not just plot it is poorly written the characters are just jelly that gets squashed into whatever shape and new characters just appear character arcs are incomplete and even the physics and history of this film universe bend unrealistically all so we can get the tedious messages the story is trying to tell us poor character development meant i didnt care what happened to anyone more than half the film is spent trying to destroy the past instead of actually developing characters or just something new and interesting if the film was gutsy and actually made something new and interesting we might indeed let go of the past but the past is way more interesting than what we are being offered here any film attempting to subvert must at least make us believe the subversion  and with such poor clumsy construction and weak characters no real subversion can work with more thought consideration and better writing this could have been an amazing film some concepts just make no sense eg light rises to meet darkness  thats why there cant ever be a dark empire which dominates a small handful of weak rebels whose actions matter really also a terrible message for kids  as light is surely just naturally rising to meet the challenges of dark climate change  oh wait it isnt
Nov 13 2019,neutral,a beautiful movie with bad ideas no matter how much you like star wars this is clearly a bad following for the whole story and it breaks everything causing the episode 9 to just try to fix it its amazing how a studio as disney could let that happened shame on rian johnson and poor luke skywalker
Nov 13 2019,negative,bombers work in weightlessnes lukes a jerk that milk scene this movie feels like a prank i dont know if it is or not i just know im not much of a fan anymore
Nov 12 2019,negative,the movie experience is actually good nice effects and beautiful imagery however it is a very bad star wars movie and therefor i only give it 1 star i went to the cinema with a lot of expectations because it is a star wars movie and was let down and really disappointed even though i like the fact that rian johnson tries to subvert our expectations i think i would have liked one of the many theories more than i actually liked what he made
Nov 12 2019,negative,plot holes everywhere   unfunny comedy  no character development  subliminal political agendas   boring as hell  spits on the ot  no clear direction as to where it is headed or what this trilogy is about  more politics  plain vanilla female characters who have no personality charisma or character developments
Nov 12 2019,negative,horrible for star wars fans this atrocity butchers beloved characters while breaking previously established rules of the universe while also breaking the laws of our universe such as projectiles experiencing drop or fall off in space or a ship experiencing drag in the vacuum of space for non fans the only redeeming quality of this film is the visuals the main character suddenly gains new abilities and powers that deem every other character as useless breaking any and all tension as the audience knows the main character will never fail at anything there are too many sub plots with not enough time to get invested into any of them while the overuse of bathos or comedy breaks the mood completely in every scene that is set up to be tense or suspenseful gaping plot holes are present everywhere the choreography is horrific and the subversions are a blatant middle finger to any invested audience members it cannot even be enjoyed like the star wars prequels or the room as it fails to be entertaining in any and every way possible i would only recommend this to aspiring film makers who wish to see examples of what not to do or to distract ones pet goldfish absolutely horrendous would give it 0 stars if possible as i have seen and read fan made content that are vastly more entertaining than this thing
Nov 12 2019,positive,defenitely the best looking star wars of the new era even though somehow it seems not to bring the new trilogy anywhere except from kylo ren no other carachter seems to develop one thing that rian johnson didnt understand is that all this new kind of cheap comedy doesnt fit into this franchise leia flying the same scene could be done 300 times better preventing the fans from raging against this new installment lets see how it goes with ep ix
Nov 12 2019,negative,mark hamill was great the rest was awful 
Nov 12 2019,positive,star wars the last jedi is good
Nov 12 2019,negative,forced political agendas poor character development awkward forced and unfunny comedic moments that are so out of place the massacre of luke skywalkers character no continuity with episode 7 the entire side plot with finn  rose tico was horrendous this move is a total mess and has pretty much completely destroyed the sequel trilogy this movie renders episode 9 pointless theres no way they can salvage this trilogys story arc in one more final 3 hour film episode 7 wasnt anything special but with episode 8  9 theres was room to grow and improve then the last jedi happened and shit on everything that makes star wars star wars and now theres is absolutely no saving this sequel trilogy well done rian youll forever be remembered as the guy that ruined star wars
Nov 12 2019,negative,rian johnson ruined star wars nouf said
Nov 12 2019,negative,everything was wrong luke skywalker needed to train his apprenticepadawanreplacement  in doing so he needed to find redemption and hope you know the theme of the movie ackbar needed to be the one to make the sacrifice to make room for his replacement no heros journey for the hero everything was wrong
Nov 11 2019,negative,liked it in the theater but has gotten progressively worse after every subsequent viewing plot points just dont add up to an overall theme at all the characters dont grow and change and theres no journey for any of the heroes the movie seems obsessed with subverting expectations to the point where thats the only recurring theme rian johnson has an extremely poor sense of humor the canto bight sequence is prequellevels of cringe but with added political messaging rotten to the core
Nov 11 2019,neutral,not as bad as all say but how they handle mark hamill sucks
Nov 11 2019,negative,the worst star wars movie in the franchise too many plot twists and misdirections leads to this just being a big mess
Nov 11 2019,negative,this film breaks star wars it has little to nothing in common with the tone of the films it is supposed to succeed and even if you forget the legacy films was on its own a bad movie
Nov 11 2019,positive,this is definitely one of the better and more interesting chapters of the main star wars saga i think the toxic side of the fanbase really missed out on this one it has a ton to offer and if you enjoy star wars on a wholistic level there is so much here on offer the worlds look great and feel real the characters grow and the plot threads feel lived in enough there are two aspects of the film that i dont enjoy for one the battle tactics on crait make no sense and the battering ram laser was not terribly inspired the comedy is perhaps the other aspect that i felt miffed by but even that really is star wars han solo in the first star wars did a prank call gag during the death star escape and poe does the same here for me i am fan of the star wars ip the whole thing it is very fun for me the emotions the action the droids the aliens all of it it is fun what isnt fun are the fans to need these movies to be more than that the fans who needs luke skywalker to save them this movie honestly addresses that culture head on and it says what those fans hate that there is more to life and living that watching luke skywalker save the day and his dad
Nov 11 2019,negative,the ramming of the capital ships was the highlight of the film though letting admiral ackbar perform this action instead of being unceremonialy  spaced earlier in the film would have given the fans an emotional impact that this flick seriously lacked     literally the first star wars ive never purchased a copy of i even own a digital copy of solo  so much could have been fixed in this movie with simple things oh reyshes been getting trained on that island with luke after his initial refusal for the last 6 months   edit out that whole your mama joke at the beginning   the poe mutiny have it authorized as a plan b in case holdos plan didnt work seriously hes a bloody high ranking member of the resistance and shes a freaking admiralhis entire plotline makes no sense he should have been with finn and rose on the side mission       my birthday is around christmas i always see a big christmas movie last year it was into the spiderverse miles rocks   2017 was last jedi  2016 was rogue one awesome  2015 was the force awakens and i was interested in the story of rey and was looking forward to learning more about her i was actually ok with han getting turfed by ben though i was really confused why leia was in a deep emotional hug with this perfect stranger that stepped off the falcon who does that    you see a trend here  20122014 was three hobbit movies really shouldve been twonew line you greedy effs    guess ill be watching jumanji this year funyay
Nov 11 2019,negative,good as an unintended comedy
Nov 11 2019,positive,30 years waiting to see luke skywalker once again only to destroy everything that luke skywalker came to represent and then they kill him off  still an epic movie  and luke rises in the end
Nov 11 2019,negative,so much filler didnt feel like a star wars and wasnt fun to watch
Nov 11 2019,negative,ruined everything great about star wars
Nov 11 2019,negative,this isnt star wars
Nov 11 2019,negative,hands down the worst star wars movie ever made tarnished and disrespected the story that was built over the last 30 years logic in blockbuster movies such as this isnt super important but the rules set by the star wars universe should be followed not changed to serve the purpose of the irritatingly dumb story being told
Nov 11 2019,negative,truly disappointing  bad story nonsensical  and while star wars movies have never exactly been close to realistic having a space battle scene where the mechanics are treated like a naval battle under gravity well that is just too wrong  plus the whole tracker plot line was silly  sad
Nov 10 2019,negative,i got this movie out on dvd and stopped watching it halfway through the storyline was so confusing you couldnt really work out what this movie was about it was really bad
Nov 10 2019,positive,i used to be a hater on this movie but i have let it sit and i do believe the fans are overreacting like i initially did if you except what happens in the movie then rewatch it it is far better still has big problems with it though but overall enjoyable 
Nov 10 2019,positive,rian johnson has gone to the roots of what made star wars a relatable to millions around the world that the force is among all of us heres to hoping that people would go on to appreciate the movie years down the line
Nov 10 2019,negative,i cant stress enough how much this movie missed the mark if your review indicates how it subverts expectations that just means you expected it to be good and meaningful and instead it was garbage
Nov 10 2019,negative,this movie caters to sjws and lacks basic story development and common sense on so may occasions i cant believe it was even made
Nov 10 2019,negative,a disappointing film with great cast holding this film from being destroyed
Nov 10 2019,negative,that is a disgrace of a movie   sorry to have seen it in theatre should have downloaded it illegally
Nov 10 2019,negative,where to start the film that nearly ruined my favorite franchise
Nov 10 2019,negative,first movie of my life that gave me a bitter sensation at the end
Nov 10 2019,negative,this was terrible it trashed the established mythos and replaced it with an empty husk
Nov 10 2019,negative,a complete disregard towards characters and established lore it really makes you wonder why disney gave this film to rian johnson to both write and direct when he doesnt even understand the star wars universe this film was heartbreaking and not in a good way
Nov 10 2019,negative,truly awful and lacking in imagination
Nov 10 2019,negative,its the weakest horrible star wars film the main premise and plot of the film is boring and nothing really happens in it it brings barely any new lore to star wars and its new characters the acting is okay by some and cringy by others and u can tell the film tries to be funny but it ends up ruining the film the only redeeming part of the film is the visual effects and sound effects
Nov 10 2019,negative,when i first went in to see star wars the last jedi i initially walked away thinking it was good and that aside from a few questionable moments there was nothing wrong with it but after taking some time to think about it and in reviewing the previous films i realised that i was blinded by the smokescreen of the films special effects to notice how poorly written and horrendous the entire movie actually was even my friends saw the flaws in the film that i didnt because my love for the star wars name kept me from seeing the truth that this film was filled with so many plot holes retcons and writing choices that it made me question how this movie ever made it off the drawing board and into production i mean did they just get one guy to proof check this as opposed to an entire room of people or did a certain someone on the crew simply push this film to being made regardless of its gaping flaws    after what ive been hearing lately i wouldnt be surprised    before i get wrapped up in the politics of this film lets analyse the flaws a little more closely starting with the plot that way i wont get called out for being misogynistic or something like that by the director or anyone else out there in the world who supports this train wreck of a film    the entire main plot of this movie revolves around the rebels i mean the resistance fleeing from the emp i mean first order after blowing up their solar system busting weapon in the first film while at the same time the fledgling force sensitive rei is receiving training and guidance from the legendary jedi master luke skywalker an inspirational figure for millions around the world and the face of the star wars franchise itself now you would think from this premise of this film that the story would be exciting filled with a lot of action flashy fights and ton of trials and tribulations that would make sense and have you on the edge of your seat as you would expect after viewing all three of the original star wars films and the three prequel movies    but sadly it doesnt    the chase sequence between the first order and the resistance is slow drawn out and doesnt make any sense in the star wars universe due to inworld physics being rewritten and retcons being made left right and centre in comparison the chase at the start of the original star wars a new hope between the star destroyer and leias ship lasted about a few seconds before the good guys were captured but in this one we have an entire sequence dragged out for about two hours during which time a poorly written executive drama and conflict between two characters is happening on board the resistances ship that couldve been entirely avoided altogether    then we have rei training with luke though i wouldnt exactly call it training the entire secondary plot on the planet where the jedi master is hiding out gives us the golden opportunity to learn about all the events that happened between then and return of the jedi as well as answer the questions as to why hes currently living there and how things had become so chaotic in the galaxy sadly everything luke has to cover about the jedi his motivations his friends his adventures after the fall of the empire and how his nephew fell to the dark side are shallow pointless and with the films attempts to subvert expectations completely goes against his character in every facet and unlike with yoda rei barely undergoes any sort of training at all and the time she spends on that world is miniscule before she has to return to her friends in the resistance by my estimate she only spends a total of approximately 8 to 12 inworld hours on that planet at most that means the entire story of the last jedi takes place in only one day in their universe    then we have the entire subplot with finn rose and bb8 in which they must ask naz who tells them to find a hacker to sneak on board the lead ship to find the breaker room in order to disable the first orders abilities to track their friends through hyperspace now not only is this subplot entirely convoluted and highly convenient but all the scenes taking place on cantobite or the evil capitalist billionaire planet are boring and crammed with politics that make no sense in the universe and are something that no one wants to see in a star wars film at least not in such a haphazard manner cantobite is probably the best example of someone trying to be clever when trying to pose a political viewpoint in a science fiction movie yet has absolutely no ability in writing it its sloppy and sticks out like a sore thumb proof that no matter what kind of politics you try to stick into star wars it is destined to crash and burn    all of these events eventually culminate in a scene on a salt planet that is totally not a ripoff of the battle on hoth in the empire strikes back as well as a throne room scene that is shot for shot both a ripoff of the throne room scene from the wizard of oz and the original throne room scene from return of the jedi both these sequences are not only crammed with plot holes and conveniences but they all amount to a conclusion that is for lack of a better term a great big letdown  now i could spend the next ten thousand words going scene by scene detailing the flaws behind this entire movie however since this is supposed to be a quick review youll just have to be satisfied with the selfexplanatory titbits im sprinkling over this essay and believe me theres copious amounts of it    overall the entire plot of the movie is poorly planned tonally disjointed and horrendously paced filled with so many conveniences and moments that just make no sense and leave people completely baffled and disappointed at the end rian johnson who directed and wrote this film attempted to subvert peoples expectations by writing aspects into the movie and create moments in an attempt to surprise the audience however not only did all these elements result in nothing for example luke throwing his lightsabre off the cliff leia supposedly being killed and then being brought back reis parents being nobodies snoke wanting rei only for kylo to kill her and finish his training poe being the only one wrong about their escape plan etc they also take away any suspense and anticipation within the film leaving the audience dissatisfied and emotionally unfulfilled oh and these elements also add nothing to the story    there are also multiple moments within the film where the writerdirector demonstrates that he has no idea how to write a pitch appropriate scene for example luke trying to make jokes with rei during two very sombre moments both inside the jedi tree and then over the cliff during her first training sequence were tonally disjointed and detract from the moment the film was trying to establish with so much drama taking place within the movie particularly where sombre and tense scenes are supposed to be taking place and then having humorous moments thrown into them out of nowhere confuses the audience emotionally since they have no idea how they should feel even during scenes where a joke is supposed to be funny the audience barely laughed during the event unless they were straightup slapstick i remember those moments well since i saw the movie twice in the cinemas and the audience only politely chuckled this is just a light example of rians ineptitude at writing a coherent story that flows tonally    i already covered how the film was poorly paced by the long chase sequence and how all these events happened in such a short time frame i also highlighted how the movies attempts to be clever and subversive were a colossal failure so lets get to the conveniences within the film this movie is haemorrhaging conveniences that i dont even know where to start which breaks the rules established in the previous films for example rose and finn get caught placed in space prison but then conveniently have a lock breaker in there with them that breaks them out and doubles as their hacker and also their ride off the planet who doesnt even need to be paid convenient then theres also the first order tracking the rebel ships through hyperspace but being unable to catch them because they are too slow and the rebels are too fast convenient and then there are the plot holes such as the hyperspace ramming sequence no use of ywings during the bombing runs despite being shown to be more effective than the bombers they used the first order using a device that tracks through hyperspace leia using the most powerful force ability demonstrated in the series despite not being properly trained and so on you should get the point already and i havent even gone into any real depth about the characters yet and you know what i dont think i even want to    rian johnson has gone to great lengths to ruin every single character in this film that its just sad talking about them and this isnt just limited to the characters from the original star wars trilogy but from the force awakens as well general hux is made out to be a complete joke of a character despite being set up to be a formidable and intelligent force in the last film snoke was completely useless and a nobody with no backstory to speak of finns participation in the subplot is completely pointless especially when you consider the conflict on board the resistance ship couldve been entirely avoided by the characters simply communicating better rei is already established as a perfect character with no flaws whatsoever therefore she has no need to be developed anymore and is therefore the most boring element in the film leia simply sits around the entire time or is locked in a coma for most of the movie chewie just hangs around on a planet eating porgs and is just a glorified uber driver poe is shafted at every turn and not given any chance to shine and luke skywalker has been butchered picked apart and poached to pass the torch on to rei with his character being left as a hollow shell of its former self throughout the movies twohour runtime    these are all valid points that im sure many have already highlighted already considering the sheer magnitude of screw ups in this film i can understand how a lot of people have been made upset and angry by how it turned out myself included i also heard that whenever the writerdirector received these same criticisms from people disappointed or angry at the last jedi his response was to insult them and belittle their genders class and intelligence with the studio itself also using the media in an attempt to justify the quality of this film by saying that everyone is spiteful sexist and toxic when the simple fact is it was poorly made overall    anyone with a brain can see just how awful this movie actually is and id be genuinely surprised if further down the line the studio will continue to defend this travesty of a story my one and only recommendation to try and fix this mess of a franchise is to strike both this film and the previous film from canon and reintroduce the extended universe of the star wars world back into the fold because the stories in there were far better and entertaining than these ones not to mention they stay true to the lore of the star wars universe sadly though it doesnt seem like well be getting that    i would like to rate this movie as zero stars out of five i really would but unfortunately i cant so half a star will have to suffice
Nov 10 2019,positive,a subversive masterpiece underappreciated by the fans
Nov 9 2019,negative,this disgrace has dealt irreparable damage to george lucas beloved franchise  not only are the story and newer characters criminally underdeveloped but disney has fundamentally disrespected the remaining veteran characters  this move has rendered these sequels pointless
Nov 9 2019,negative,absolutely terrible rian johnson shouldnt be a director
Nov 9 2019,negative,i finally got around to watching this what a confusing mess the reason for the main plot made no sense space ships running out of fuel how does that even work characters seemingly had no common sense or motivation for their actions and luke dies in the end seemingly out of spite
Nov 9 2019,negative,it shits on the lore it brings no new interessing characters only kills the good ones it is just so god awful it killed all my exitement for any future installments of star wars which is saying quite a lot
Nov 9 2019,negative,i dont care about these characters  and the ones i do like han solo luke skywalker leah chubacca r2d2 and c3po were never reunited all together  the most epic waste of potential awesomeness of all time  its almost as if the writerdirector didnt like star wars   the remaining characters who do we care about  rey poe fin theyre as fun as dentists waiting room
Nov 9 2019,negative,making the star wars franchise explode like the deathstar  quite the achievement rian
Nov 9 2019,positive,honestly really enjoyed it
Nov 9 2019,negative,bad terrible horrible
Nov 8 2019,negative,i watched this again today to see how i felt about it its honestly shocking how bad the decisions were in this movie we never see luke skywalker fightonce snoke is no one reys parentsno one i would basically bet my life that rian johnson was not a star wars fan no star wars fan would make the decisions he did
Nov 8 2019,negative,having watched this movie many many times all i can say is i think this really missed a lot of marks spoilers ahead again disney i think played it too safe as it felt like a recycled empire strikes back but poorly done the majority of the film is the slowest chase sequence i think i have ever seen we dont need a forced romance story if it is going to happen it needs to feel organic the entire casino side track mission was completely irrelevant to the plot that makes up what feels like a quarter of the film and if you cut it out the story does not change at all i think there were a lot of missed opportunities to subvert fan expectations that could have lead to more in depth character development and lastly i think director rian johnson took a risk with lukes story arc which lead him to force feed viewers what he wanted to tell instead of earning that story with viewers and having that emotional equity earned for what luke went through and why he is the way he appears this just created a very poor cinematic experience for someone who grew up with these films and loves waiting for the story to continue though much like the force awakens this films visual effects both practical and digital do look spectacular props to those departments
Nov 8 2019,neutral,spoilers even though this film isnt worth your time          this film is sad not because of the storys content pulling my heartstrings but because there are so many inconsistencies rian johnson literally chucked jj abrams script something that was consistent with the franchises canon and decided to write his own so they wont show luke skywalker mourning the death of his best friend but hey lets throw in a meaningless scene where luke drinks blue milk fresh from an alien teatbecause thats what the fans want to see right the force awakens wasnt that bad this one has singlehandedly ruined the franchise due to johnsons inability to write a clear concise and consistent story why even create a new trilogy if you cant even top the previous one the only pro drowning in this cesspool of cons is the fact that carrie fisher and mark hamill are on screen
Nov 8 2019,positive,it was no better than the last but it can be interesting as well
Nov 8 2019,negative,first time watching a star wars movie and coming out with a bad feeling
Nov 8 2019,negative,dude 10 minutes in and the incompetence of the first order baffles me going for plot convenience rather than logic and this goes on for the whole movie  give me back my expanded universe
Nov 7 2019,negative,it is a competently made movie but the overall plot was terrible it moved the series in a poor direction  it also didnt follow the rules of the universe as previously established  basically  the quality of acting and production and what not was fine  but the storyplot has got to be better for the amount invested in this skill
Nov 7 2019,negative,disney likes to pretend that all the people who dont like tlj are male chauvinists instead of fans who would like to see more cool jedi things or more space scifi stuff rather than 30 minutes of lazilydesigned casino and spacedog gaming park it looks like a casino gaming park on earth rather than one thats more scifi fantasy is daniel craig making a cameo as james bond at the casino too why did rian johnson film the third lesson and cut it from release i had to sit through someone whining about children working in a stable or her childhood and her poor dead sister instead of seeing the third lesson of being a jedi what look at kotor fans want more jedispace pilot stuff not this 30 minutes side mission that didnt help or advance the main plot i want to see more rey kicking ass or the millennium falcon battling out of the armada as unoriginal as the force awakens at least that was cool even in the prequels as bad as the plot was none had wasted a quarter of movie on an useless side quest and what a waste of talent for kelly marie tran her character could have been a cool engineer and instead became one of the most useless and annoying characters in all of cinema like jar jar binks i feel bad for kelly ahmed christopher and hayden they dont deserve all the hate against for the badly written roles or bad direction
Nov 7 2019,negative,the worst thing to ever happen to a franchise this monstrosity needs to be deleted from the star wars archives and the sooner the better what an absolute piece of shit of a movie
Nov 7 2019,positive,thats a good movie that really attempts going deep into characters construvtion
Nov 7 2019,negative,movie is a joke killed the whole saga  boring and stupid plots lazy story telling
Nov 6 2019,positive,while definitely not perfect i dont think it deserves the hate it received id recommend it but maybe wait for the next movie to give a definitive opinion remember the empire strikes back it needed another movie for the plot to be resolved i assume the same will be for this movie
Nov 6 2019,negative,this movie is one big middlefinger to the fans rian ruined luke skywalker and introduced terrible characters like rose and holdo i dont know whats worse the plot or reys character
Nov 5 2019,negative,the cinematography was great the main performances by leia and luke were wonderful that big fight scene at the end wonderful buteverything else was lackluster if not insulting to fans of the series a faint retread of empire strikes back but with none of the fun aspects of the force awakens an ignoble worthless end to luke who goes out like a wuss as badly as han did a worthless canto bight scene an obvious betrayal i saw coming from a mile away waste of captain phasma luke barely does anything it was like being slapped in the face over and over subversion of expectations isnt always a good thing
Nov 5 2019,negative,thanks disney for ruining my childhood i grew up on the original star wars trilogy and you destroyed it tlj is one of the stupidest movies i have ever seen
Nov 5 2019,negative,garbage and im a big fan of sw it hurts
Nov 5 2019,negative,not even a decent star wars movie smh
Nov 5 2019,negative,destroyed star wars universe this movie
Nov 5 2019,negative,disrespectful to a franchise
Nov 5 2019,negative,poor movie overall acting was good but story was poorly written
Nov 4 2019,negative,this movie was completely pointless visuals over structure script character development next time hope they subvert our expectations by making a good integral movie  this is the best movie if you are not paying attention to any detail of it or if you are texting while watching it
Nov 4 2019,negative,they brought back the old heroes just to destroy them and i cant understand why unforgivable
Nov 4 2019,positive,one of my favorite star wars films nestled squarely among the originals in terms of its quality
Nov 4 2019,negative,i am a lifelong star wars fan i never thought id see something with the star wars label and dislike it boy was i wrong this film is an absolute travesty luke skywalkers character was ruined and killed in every way possible snokes death was stupid and the ot characters are poorly represented while these new characters have zero story yet take over everything pile of garbage that holdo stuff was awful as well kyle ren is a whiny baby villain i didnt even like tfa but i had hope for the future after watching it im never spending money on rise of skywalker it will likely be bad and theres no way the franchise can get me to forgive this dumpster fire of a movie thanks disney and rian johnson
Nov 3 2019,positive,the best looking film in the franchise introduces magnificent new locations expanding the ever growing star wars universe and some new characters along the way also not forgetting the return of some favourites however the way luke skywalker was handled was simply wrong while occasionally seeing your hero in a rough state can be good like peter parker in into the multiverse it usually ends with the character returning to the person we know and love sadly this was not one of those occasions
Nov 3 2019,negative,to call this movie a flaming dumpster fire would be unfair to dumpsters and fires    when vice admiral holdo was introduced aka purpley mcpurple hair it felt like she was a character from another movie who invaded the scene like the ending to a mel brooks movie    half the movie happened for no reason the other half was stupid    did anyone involved with this movie have an understanding of character development finn learns not to be brave poe learns not to ask questions about stupid plans rey learns nothing an gets amazinger    also they should have put luke skywalker in this movie he wasnt in one single scene    the force awakens was ok and had some potential the last jedi was a disaster    f 
Nov 3 2019,negative,an extremely flashy but ultimately depthless  and even insulting  movie    the last jedi contradicts almost everything setup in the previous films and even the previous two trilogies on occasion it treats fans with what seems to be deliberate disrespect not by subverting their theories but by simply saying that none of the questions ever mattered in the first place    if a new hope the empire strikes back and return of the jedi were the personified in the numbers 1 2 and 3 while the prequels were 4 5 6 the force awakens would be 12 and the last jedi would simply be 2 the force awakens simply offers a mildly altered version of anh while tlj deliberately seeks to do the opposite of its predecessorwithout meaningfully changing anything    punctuated with puerile humor and 6th grade philosophy this was one of the least pleasant moviegoing experiences i have ever had
Nov 3 2019,negative,worst star wars movie ever made  killed the franchise for me ill not bother with the next one and ive been a fan since 1977
Nov 3 2019,negative,the worst star wars movie and insult to some of the most iconic cinematic characters ever created
Nov 3 2019,negative,not a star wars movie
Nov 3 2019,positive,unlike what many fans have said i enjoyed star wars the last jedi visual effects and soundtrack are fantastic and i found the ending of the film perfect however there are some things that dont work in particular the duel between the guards of snoke and rey and kylo ren and the scene in which leia flies into space at a time when poe finn and the other members of the resistance open the door of the control room to recover leia how can they not be sucked out of space  the same in the sequence of bombers that i appreciated how is it possible that roses sister doesnt fly out of the ship my rating is 35 out of 5
Nov 3 2019,negative,the scenario is long boring and kills the franchise
Nov 3 2019,negative,this was a horrific rendition of space balls
Nov 3 2019,negative,dire boringactually made me lose all interest in the next movie
Nov 3 2019,negative,this was an absolute disgrace to star wars humor is terrible plot is shocking no good action scenes and ruins most characters by wasting them or not using them at all what was once the most loved franchise of all time has become a hot steaming pile of trash well done rian johnson you killed star wars
Nov 2 2019,negative,i dont care about how visually stunning the movie is or how diverse the cast is or whatever but nothing can justify an absolutely terrible story  the social justice agenda brought star wars to a new low  its so sad to see a movie try to do something meaningful but absolutely fail at it  also no one asked for those plot twists not to mention that stupid frickin casino planet scene  jeez  this movie as a movie is not as bad as the prequels were but its by far worse because of what was riding on it  its the next star wars movie man gosh  such a disappointment  definitely the worst star wars movie ever
Nov 2 2019,negative,this is movie is a disgusting blow to a beloved franchise i want my 2 hours back
Nov 2 2019,negative,waste your time with a 45minute side plot that goes nowhere ruins a fantastic story arc for fin to sacrifice himself for a none existant love story ruins the character of lyke skywalker i wont ever see a rjohns film again
Nov 2 2019,negative,this film is full of plot holes and petty humour that it basically is spitting in all george has created in his trilogy it baffles me that critics are lying to you and themselves just to make themselves believe star wars the last jedi is a good film lightsabers dont do much damage as they once did anymore even though lightsabers are the bread and butter of all things star wars     once you see it you know exactly what youre watching but in the new films lightsabers do basically nothing it gave kylo a scar over his face after it was struck by rey including when kylo struck finn in the back with his unstable lightsaber which would do even more damage than lukes lightsaber would this film finn is fine and healthy unharmed whatsoever after being hit by one of the most deadly weapons in star wars and they wrapped him in a bubbleboy suit to add a comedic scene while he falls over if finn became a paraplegic i would understand from a lightsaber slicing his spinal cord as i said before this film has plot holes from princess leia suddenly being able to use the force with no years of practising andor training to know how to use it oh yeah she has the force now deal with it manbabies is not a good answer disney and the entire scene at the end was horrid     they killed off luke in the most pathetic way possible a man that has been around since the start of order 66 dies because disney wanted a plot twist ending     in my true honest opinion these films are not canon and should be considered as fanmade films i am not looking forward for the next film
Nov 2 2019,negative,heresy sacrilegious blasphemous an abomination to the starwars mithology
Nov 1 2019,negative,ive been a star wars fan my whole life and for me the news that disney bought star wars and would make a new trilogy was amazing  the force awakens wasnt a very good movie in my opinion but at least it set up some stuff to explore in a new movie  than the last jedi came and usualy i just think about a movie to be good or not realy but this time i got pain in my stomach and i felt anger comming  the last jedi managet to be wors than the christmas special and i didnt knew that was even possible i feel very dissapointed about tlj and i cannot understand how someone could make a movie so bad so disrespectfull and overall bad
Nov 1 2019,positive,dont get the hate at all
Oct 31 2019,negative,top 5 worst movies ever made in the history of moviemaking at least the room made me laugh this disaster was pure cringe for the full 25 hours nonsensical incoherent and out of touch with the fandom and any sense of star wars the story is haphazard and the script is like eating a boiled potato with zero salt this preposterously bad film in every way shape and form is the prime example of everything wrong and unsavory about movie making today unadultered garbage this movie is like an  unfinished middle school project being handed in unadultered garbage the people spoke   what an utter disaster    some incredible visuals thats the only way i can justify half a star love daisy ridley as an actress everyone elses performance was stale and gimmicky rey was an extremely intriguing character in force awakens but for some mysterious reason rian johnson decided to subvert my expectations congrats rian and kathy i didnt expect the movie to be so bad i didnt expect star wars to die by suicide i didnt expect the creators wouldnt have a clue about star wars or storytelling i didnt expect rey to become an uninteresting pointless and bland heroine i didnt expect the movie would insult the intelligence of the audience by vomiting this lazy work but subverted     no reason or motivation to watch the next one or what they would call they final one this was the final one   i stepped outside the theater still trying to figure out if i was purposely or unintentionally slapped by such a hitty movie i just stood aghast outside the theater squinting eyes i kept thinking about the line that casper says at the end of kids  jesus christ what happened
Oct 31 2019,negative,what they did to lukes character is unforgivable generally a bad movie all around
Oct 31 2019,negative,quite impressive some one really didnt watched the old movies not even 7 no respect for the old characters no actions done that makes sense not for their character it self and barely any for the story they even fucked up the basic rules of the universe it maybe looks quite nice but even the story it self doesnt make any sensethink about what is happening andin comparison to the older moviesi am speech less how someone is able to hurt the entire universe and characters that muchyou either start disliking the entire universe or you just start to ignore that this movies exists at all
Oct 31 2019,negative,this movie is full of chances to be amazing and it glosses over most of them in favor of the next big plot twist  also since when did the importance of making political statements and cgi trump essential plot and character development
Oct 31 2019,negative,absolute abomination takes a nice squat over the ot please avoid this one
Oct 31 2019,negative,i thought the force awakens was weak a rehash of a new hope with new less complex characters and headed in a less than an ideal direction with immersion breaking continuity issues then we got the last jedinot only did it fail to stay true to existing franchise it threw away everything from the last film it was almost a reboot as sequel to what felt like a reboot in a franchise that did not need a reboot at all now though the franchise kind of does need a reboot because the last jedi effectively ended the potential of a good followup sequel it wrote itself into a corner massively broke continuity and was just a weak film over all the prequel movies were bad but they were prequels they allowed for sequels to come along later and build off the original story instead we got a soft reboot followed by a less soft reboot back to back
Oct 31 2019,negative,this movie had none of the expected pay off from the last movie it just wasnt good i didnt care about any of the characters or their stories
Oct 31 2019,negative,a complete disaster by any standard
Oct 30 2019,negative,the only reason i think this is a star wars movie is because of its name other than that it should be put in its own separate universe its just that bad what can you find inside the last jedi horrendous melee brawls lightsabers and other weapons ridiculous shiptoship battles flawed character arcs mainly finn and phasmas as well as just bad characters in general massive plot holes a frustrating storyline and the destruction of the character known as luke skywalker its no surprise that this isnt even getting one star from me
Oct 30 2019,negative,the fact that they feel the need to kill  the classic characters for no reason is just dumb and so uncreative and rian johnson  should not be let within a 1000 miles of a new star wars film he should withdraw from any future starwars films and if he doesnt we should boycott any star wars films he involved in
Oct 30 2019,positive,this was a good movie not gonna go on and on about why i thought so just going to give it 5 stars and say the only reason the audience score is 44 is because all the fanboys are pissed none of their theories heading into the movie worked out the way they wanted it to get over it
Oct 30 2019,negative,i remember when the credits rolled on this film in the cinema i couldnt even speak i didnt know what to say i had never been so torn on a movie in my life there were parts i absolutely hated there were parts i loved on subsequent watches it hit me that this is a badly made movie from beginning to end the overdone humour the change of basically every character from tfa the tone wasnt even the same as tfa something was so off about this movie it absolutely tore apart the star wars fanbase due to its expectationsubverting postmodern nonsense we wanted a star wars movie not game of thrones instead all we seem to have gotten with this trilogy is two dead ot characters leaving alive the only ot character thats dead in real life what an absolute travesty the lack of any solid plan for the three movies has really bitten this trilogy hard
Oct 30 2019,negative,despite popular belief theres actually a lot of scenes in this movie that are directly ripped off from the original trilogy and shamelessly so so as far as mr johnsons comments about it being a departure from the originals is a lie  beyond that this movie is objectively terrible any scene that was about to build tension and drama was cutt off by a bad throwaway joke there is little to no character development instead of having a well established and explained a and b plot we get several incomplete c plots  every difficult moment our heroes encounter is solved by convenience that is bad writing    then the unforgivable happens the complete and utter assassination of an original character whose motives are so out of character its maddening to imagine the director was a fan of the originals    it isnt good as a standalone movie it isnt good as part of a trilogy  and it retroactively devalues the originals a good writer and director can subvert expectations without diminishing characters story plot or insulting the audiences intelligence  rian johnson is no such writer or director    all flash and no substance  i was severely disappointed and as a disclaimer i entered the theater without any preconceived fan theories or expectations i entered excited and leftempty
Oct 30 2019,negative,this is a bad film it also neglects the previous film in its own trilogy to take the story on what feels like a different direction     if you watch the force awakens to prepare for watching this movie youre wasting your time honesty the remnant of the first order is magically in control in the beginning of this movie and every single previous character arc is ignored previous character growth is ignored and you may feel frustrated watching them make similar or the same exact mistakes again in this film otherwise you may find that a characters personality is now completely rewritten     trilogy aside this film suffers from many plot holes that will cause you to scratch your head at least a couple times we even took a detour from the movie for a subplot with the lovable finn and a new character rose but their portion of the movie dragged on this detour saved us from having to watch a boring chase scene between huge starships taking place at a turtles pace but makes the situation seem just as cheap as it really was written the lack of pace may allow you to ask why things are happening as they are but the story truly falls apart after reflecting back to the film after leaving the theater     the film has some amazing special effects that are just spectacular for example the incredible lightsaber fight and the final battle scene look splendid however the story between the beautiful nonspeaking portions fails and hollows the story to not feel epic     id say this is a mustsee if you loved the previous filmfilms i loved the force awakens and was ready for another adventure but feel disappointed this film is where star wars jumps the shark and nukes the frig and i disgust those scenes they make me upset still go see the film because you may really like it like many others but be warned that nearly half of the audiences are not enjoying this film and that is shocking to consider
Oct 30 2019,neutral,the last jedi is tolerable if you just want to watch something to pass the time beyond that its a huge failure the story is inconsistent a side plot that takes half the movie with no payoff and actions by some characters that generally just make no sense and shows a lack of proper writing
Oct 30 2019,negative,let me start off by saying the last jedi tlj has some redeemable aspects the cgi was completely top class and the visual effects were incredible also some of the action was good and the humor was at times good    the first issue i will raise is involving the light speed maneuver this forever changes the star wars space battles as it completely disregards previously established lore that light speed is in another dimension in which you travel faster from now on every space battle in a star wars movie people will be expecting either faction in the conflict to employ this strategy this scene also disregards every previous space battle in the sagas history as this surely would have been used before if not only as a kamikaze attempt in the next movie the creative team will probably have to create some contrived hypershield to stop this from happening again this is a perfect example of style of substance edit i now have been informed that large structures have a shadow mass in hyperspace the main problem presented in this point should now be about how this has never been used before    in addition half the plot is completely contrived from the moment laura derns character comes in and is secretive to poe who is known to be completely loyal but also hotheaded and prone to solving problems himself it causes half the plot to happen there is no reason for derns character to do this and considering half the resistances leadership just died he may be one of the most appropriate people to tell half the point of this is probably to kickstart finn and roses adventure to space vegas which was a whole completely useless subplot    furthermore rian jhonson and the creative team completely disregarded the previous film in order to have the protagonists be underdogs there is no reason for the republic funded resistance to having this little of a fleet this is partially the fault of the force awakens for a lack of initial worldbuilding but there is no reason for the previously victorious rebels to be down to 9 useless bombers a few xwings 1 cruiser and 3 medical friggets given this takes place immediately after the events of tfa there is no way a comic or tv show explains this    the space vegas portion of the film is completely cringeworthy the obvious anticapitalism theme is ironic considering that this trilogy seems to more and more be looking like and unplanned cashgrab from the corporate enterprise that is disney this entire scene could have been cut for more worldbuilding if maz was available to be the master codebreaker and was not just in the film for 30 seconds to meet a diversity quota    the movie completely destroys lukes character the man who converted the evilest man ever to the light side was always hopeful and optimistic would not try and kill his sister and best friends child who was just a boy he is shown as a grumpy miserable old fart the sadness on mark hamills face during interviews regarding this film is telling my favorite part of the movie is when luke walks out of the rebel base alone and faces the army of atats alone but this is ruined by him making a brushing the shoulders gesture which is completely out of character for him    rey is also a complete mary sue her power would be understandable if she was the daughter of someone relevant like maybe palpatine kenobi or maybe even luke but she is nothing she faces no challenges and has no relatable character flaws unless being bored with being too strong is one she pilots the falcon better than han she is the strongest force user ever luke even says so and can beat kylo in a duel    the first order is also portrayed as incompetent and amateur in this film in particular general hux their actions in the space chase make no sense general hux who was previously intimidating and one of the few snew trilogy characters i like is played for slapstick and laughs kylo goes from being menacing to an angsty teenager in minutes if the reason for half your plot is the antagonists are incompetent or dumb your movie is badly written    the final issue ill raise in this main body of the text is how the film had about 0 original ideas yes there were one or two vaguely new ones but its undeniable that a lot of this film was cut and pasted from episode 5 and 6 the new trilogy is obviously trying to show they were more like the originals    i will also clarify that at points the film was enjoyable somewhat but that doesnt mean it is any better so if someone could explain these major fundamental flaws in this movie then i could change my view so far people have just said well i enjoyed it which seems to be based upon all the fan service
Oct 30 2019,negative,like most beautiful things under the surface it is just terribly stupid
Oct 30 2019,negative,the only way to describe this movie is treason ryan johnson must hate star wars to come up with this proposition the worst star wars ever i actually fell asleep watching this this is the only star wars movie i watched only once and that was too much already
Oct 30 2019,negative,hollow star wars fanfic with nothing much to say about anything
Oct 30 2019,neutral,é apenas o pior star wars
Oct 29 2019,negative,oof that was rotten
Oct 29 2019,negative,this was a monstrosity of a film and blasphemed all star wars is and has yet to become if you love star wars and you still have not seen this please dont waste your time
Oct 29 2019,negative,what have disney done to our favorite characters luke han and leia and  replaced them with such dull and boring characters that nobody is interested in proof  disney star wars merchandising and galaxys edge
Oct 29 2019,negative,this film was trying to be so many things and having a finished thought was not one of them left fans more confused then ever and not wanting more
Oct 29 2019,positive,great movie best since empire strikes back
Oct 29 2019,negative,matter does not fall in space matter does not slow down in space when the fuel runs out you stop accelerating but keep traveling at the same velocity the entire premise of the movie is not worthy of a star wars movie
Oct 29 2019,negative,ruins the entire franchise i will never pay to see another star wars film
Oct 29 2019,negative,everything awful about episode 7 but magnified more like these characters because we expect you to nonsense a lot of talent wasted on awful writing and storytelling
Oct 29 2019,negative,this was a really poor star wars film in fact it was bad enough to stop me bothering seeing the final installment in the cinema very disappointing badly directed badly written
Oct 29 2019,negative,rian johnson obviously never understood the original movies luke skywalker can be anything except that regardless of the degree of his failure he will never lose hope thats the whole point of these movies  this movie was just a series of shallow and dumb plot points filled with cheesy lines and forgettable characters i enjoyed the force awakens and liked reys character i wish they had developed her character at least a little bit through this movie
Oct 29 2019,negative,there are so many glaring issues with this movie comedy bits in serious parts of the movie have no payoff and only seem to take away from tension in fact the scenes with this bathos can no longer be taken seriously and it would be fine if that was the tone that the movie was going for but it wasnt there was no legitimate character arcs fin had the exact same arc as the first movie snoke never created a feeling of threat the rey and kylo relationship is builtup just for them to go right back to resistance vs first order for no apparent reason disney relies too heavily on the nostalgic images and ideas of the original trilogy lukes character in this film was a middle finger to the fans how does this movie progress the storyline it felt like we ended right where we started the finrose sidestory was pointless i dont know if i can speak for everyone but when i go to see a star wars movie i am not there to have the directors shove their political agendas down my throat the feministic moral attempt was shallow at best action scenes were amateurish lets hope the next movie is better
Oct 29 2019,negative,terrible plot made no sense that chase  scene and the bombers whose idea was that
Oct 28 2019,positive,its not horrible by any means but the way luke was handled was probably worst of it and same for snoke rey was ok 
Oct 28 2019,negative,i saw this movie in theaters on christmas night and i left the theaters disappointed the movie does have 1 saving aspect the visuals and the ending fight
Oct 28 2019,negative,one of the absolute worst movies ever released plot made no sense casinoracing previous installments ignored all for politicalsocial justice gain rose was a pointless and annoying character the eyeroll and cliche was very strong in this the director and disney executives should be ashamed should be remade thats how bad it was
Oct 28 2019,positive,gonna watch few more times
Oct 28 2019,negative,they destroyed all the good characters and ruined everything that was good about star wars  i used to be a big fan i wont even see the last one after what they did to everything star wars stood for
Oct 27 2019,negative,this movie destroyed star wars
Oct 27 2019,positive,useless jokes thats what i hated but the actors did the best and it was fun 
Oct 27 2019,negative,where to start again similar to the trend of movies coming out of disney the plot and acting is very weak special effects are awesome
Oct 27 2019,positive,one of the three plot lines is a bit weak but the film has the best lightsaber duel in franchise history solid performances and bravely strays away from the formula honored by abrams in tfa
Oct 27 2019,negative,as jeremy jahns would say dogshit
Oct 27 2019,negative,great visuals and action but as far as star wars story should have gone no not remotely poor character development background antagonist snoke was taken out of the picture too soon too many goofy scenes that made no sense green cow milk little flying chickens the island caretakers etc too many side plots involving unusually political themes saving animals laura derns character making references towards arrogant males  luke used to be the most optimistic person in the previous story but now is a pessimist so much wasted potential lacking a viable story this didnt feel like star wars at all 
Oct 27 2019,negative,trash idk how can you call this a good star wars movie lol
Oct 27 2019,negative,over two years later and its still the worst movie i have seen
Oct 27 2019,negative,not bad but not good either metrics such as ticket sales appears to be evidence of riding on the coattails of the star wars franchise jj abrams sets up a nice lob for the alleyoop to rian johnson with the introduction of luke in the last scene of force awakens but johnson mishandles the alleyoop the whole casino planethorses bit should have been slashed because it does not meaningfully move the story along hyperspace tracking and weaponized hyperspace as plot points should have been avoided because now it just brings up the question of why hasnt anyone ever employed those strategies before why build the death star or star killer base when you can just use hyperspace to launch a large unavoidable projectile into any target
Oct 26 2019,negative,this movie was a complete and utter failure from a cinematic perspective despite its financial success  
Oct 26 2019,negative,in my opinion this movie no doubt has great special effects 100  as a stand alone movie this could not even work because the main character is perfect  she can do no wrong  there are silly moments in the film such as the adventure in canto byte  as a star wars movie this failed  it disrespects the characters of the original trilogy most especially luke skywalker  
Oct 26 2019,negative,this movie is so boring i would rather watch phantom menace for 10 hours than watch this slaying of the movie series that we have all come to love rain johnson is probably the worst director of all time instead of watching luke be a total badass we see him milk a weird ass space thing
Oct 26 2019,negative,lol the whole time they could have just taken a small ship and jump it to light speed and crash it into a planet 8 movies about death stars and they never thought to do that acting is lower than youtube quality critics are bad at their jobs
Oct 26 2019,negative,rian johnson proves that the prequels are in fact superior with his steaming pile of crap he created known as the last jedi 
Oct 26 2019,negative,this movie is not for fans of star wars
Oct 26 2019,negative,an afront to the saga filled with idiocy like the main villain ultimately having no meaning wasting time on pointless scenes like milking an alien space cow having characters with no substance the main character seemingly in godmode and who cant be beat and having an overload of subversion that a doesnt bear resemblance to the original films and b leaves you feeling made a fool of its boring nothing like the films that gave this franchise life and just not a fun time i literally groaned out loud watching this in the cinema as i felt my hopes for disney looking after the franchise slip away in this godawful trainwreck of a movie easily the worst star wars movie    so far a new hope    im struggling for any hope for episode ix    
Oct 26 2019,negative,the only really good aspects of this film were just related to seeing great scenes in this universe that were trying to love but this thing was a mess virtually every potentially powerful scene used pointless humor to undermine its own impact the characters made no sense even luke himself knows that his portrayal was simply misguided fan fiction and stated it publicly there is tons of idiot plotting happening trouble that could be solved by a simple conversation and so many of the fights make no sense all of these problems pale in comparison to the damage done to the franchise by rules changes to how hyperspace works the reason is this it breaks the universe going forward and backward for that matter
Oct 25 2019,negative,incoherent and lacking strong characters
Oct 25 2019,negative,ruined my childhood
Oct 25 2019,positive,listen this movie was only alright i appreciate the movie for what it was rian johnson did a great job with the visuals there were moments where the i audibly gasped at how gorgeous the scenes were however that leia scene in space was literally horrible it broke the flow of the scene and felt clunky in execution the story was lacking and it made it hard for me to care about the characters the finnrose subplot could have been great but was squandered at the end the only good story point is the breakdown of luke as a hero and the complexity that showed all in all rian johnson did an alright job jj abrams should have stayed on as director and had rian johnson as a part of the visual team 
Oct 25 2019,negative,terrible plot that appeared to be written by a 5yearold  a slow multiday sublight chase was just about the dumbest thing possible  they also ruined all suspension of disbelief by weaponizing hyperdrives
Oct 25 2019,positive,great addition to the star wars saga  loved all the surprisingly subversive stuff
Oct 25 2019,negative,this film serves as a study in how to destroy a seemingly indestructible franchise  give the woke far left a franchise let them create a mary sue that is one dimensional has no character flaws and someone you cant relate to then take a steaming dump on the most iconic character in cinema  viola you killed a franchise 
Oct 25 2019,negative,if you are a star wars fan you know exactly why im giving this half a star rian has lost all respect from millions he owes us an apology for destroying lukes imagine alone with a billion other reasons why he should apologize and have this movie burned and forgotten
Oct 25 2019,positive,this review thread demonstrates the dire need for educated film criticismthe lack of basic grammar genuine analysis and deficient comprehension of basic plot and thematic structures illustrate the intellectual divide between reviews and users on rt 
Oct 25 2019,negative,they couldnt have done more to destroy the star wars universe what a terrible movie
Oct 25 2019,negative,if i could give it less stars i would 
Oct 24 2019,positive,this is movie is star wars lol i still  love it but out of all the star wars movies this one islacking inidk there is just directions with certain characters that just are dumb i dont hate it i just hope for redemption in the seq
Oct 24 2019,negative,frankley i wish this movie was never made ruins the great name of star wars
Oct 24 2019,negative,this movie actually hurt my feelings with their depiction of luke from believing in the second most evil person in the galaxy vader to being a would be child murderer  my rating as a one goes beyond that  things like rey being a mary sue which is weak character development also snoke was killd prematurely i gave it another half star thobecause the visuals of admiral hold was amazing her withholding information from po was unnecessary and resulted in the dumbest side quest there are too many reasons this movie was rotten to list here
Oct 24 2019,negative,awful this a new description of the word awful
Oct 24 2019,negative,the visuals and soundtrack are fantastic but the movie fails every obligation to the running series universe in spectacular fashion  bad writing broken character arcs and plot holes plague the film along with universe shattering continuity breaks one of which is on a catastrophic scale  viewers who are new to the franchise or have no investment in its universe and are willing to not think to hard will be pleased but the rest will feel extremely frustrated
Oct 24 2019,negative,by far the worst star wars movie  
Oct 24 2019,negative,terrible the plot was stupid it broke star waste continuity and was just boring no tension what so ever and they didnt give any answers we had to first film instead just dumping them in a cire
Oct 24 2019,negative,definitely the worst film in the star wars main saga solo takes the cake for worst star wars film full stop  i dont care what anyone says about it being different and good it is not the storyline is just so pathetic there is so much filler action which visually is great but such a waste of time considering this is the second last star wars saga film did anyone actually even care about the characters after this film it was such a disappointment now there is so much to be done in the upcoming last movie because so much was wasted in this one it just completely went off the rails completely disregarded previous plot points and set ups and just really feels like its own random one off movie   hate what the director did with luke hate what he did with leia didnt even care about finnpoe and hated all the new characters talk about blowing it how this was even allowed i have no idea has disney lost the plot id take a george lucas star wars film any day over this one at least the story would stay on track with the whole saga and any surprises would be good ones the force awakens set up for such a good follow up movie but they blew it when all 9 films are done you can literally skip this one it wont make a difference 
Oct 24 2019,negative,i have seen the movie 4 times in total first time at premiere and i could not believe this was middle movie in the trilogy second time to catch what have i missed 3rd time when it was released on blue ray and 4th time recently this movie is the worst out of star wars movie rian johnson threw out all the ideas and rules that star wars had if it was a stand alone movie it might have worked but as a middle movie in trilogy it totally sucked from jokes space battle space chase casino part the last battle to handling characters and creating a bonding between characters and audience so many things do not make sense even in the scifi universe because this universe has been pretty well defined by 8 movies and animated clone wars series this movie could have answer few questions enrich the mythology and make force unleashed more meaningful however this movie shits on everything and is full of stupid decisions that leads to no more stupid situations what i loved about this movie was performance of mark hamill john williams music digital effects and beautiful cinematography otherwise it was very dull movie the profit of this movie does not equal quality the prequels are much better than this one is
Oct 24 2019,negative,out of character nonsensical plot points and misuse of characters
Oct 24 2019,negative,so many moments missed in this movie wish jj abrams did this movie instead
Oct 23 2019,negative,would give it a 0 if i could i liked all the movies up until this one including the prequels and episode vii but this an incoherent awful mess that irreparably ruins the star wars universe i felt genuinely depressed after watching this drivel but now i simply dont care childhood shat on i will never watch another another disney star wars movie 
Oct 23 2019,negative,this movie was and is an absolute disgrace i give it a half star because at lease the film looked good     i can forgive many of this movies shortcomings but when the entire movie is based on a miscommunication between characters my immersion is broken i came to watch a star wars film not a gilmore girls episode
Oct 23 2019,negative,disneys plan of having jj abrams write force awakens and then turning to rian johnson to fill in and write his own story for the sequel2nd film last jedi and then giving the direction of story back to jj abrams to finish the triology for the upcoming rise of skywalker is a terrible idea it just seems jj is patching up the storyline from rians artistic direction also seems rian just rendered all the questionscurious buildup that jj built brilliantly for the last jedi mute such questions as who is snoke and why is he powerful who is reys parents why is luke hiding and etc     last jedi destroyed fan favorite luke skywalkers character for all those who waited decades for his character to reappear it was heartbreaking especially if you wanted to see him actually use his lightsaber to go against the first order     the dumb plot of losing fuel what was pointless was the leader of the rebels not telling her whole crew what she was doing  didnt make sense  trying to add unnecessary suspensethus causing an unnecessary mutiny     snoke was a pointless character because of this film  whatever jj abrams was trying to do w the intrigue snoke and his background was rendered pointless by the last jedi directorwriter rian johnson     the lightsaber scene between rey and ben was cool and unique and i do enjoy leias presence in the film     in conclusion i enjoyed force awaken but i really disdain last jedi
Oct 23 2019,negative,rian johnson was the wrong person to direct a star wars film the worst star wars movie made to date 
Oct 23 2019,negative,there arent any relatable characters and their developement is also missing and thats only one of many parts that sucked in this movie
Oct 23 2019,negative,simply bad writing plot and characters arcs were an absolute mess individual action sequences were good but there was so many plot holes it was hard to not laugh meanwhile their attempts at humour fell flat story had no depth and seemed out of kilter with star wars universe hes a decent director but think his ego got in the way of this one script should have been written by a real writer that knew what he was doing 
Oct 23 2019,negative,this is the worst star wars movie and its not even close
Oct 22 2019,positive,this is the second most emotional movie in the saga
Oct 22 2019,negative,i have really enjoyed the start wars films since i was a child the original trilogy inspired me as a child and i even enjoyed the prequal trilogy although i admit that the script was weak i placed the story was consistent and good  when they announced star wars was coming back i was so excited   i pre booked ticket for the first disney start wars movie and did the same for the last jedi   i will not pay for another disney star wars product after being burned by the last jedi  this is easily the biggest mess of a film  i dont understand why disney thought they could entirely swap directors writers in a trilogy and have a consistent story   this movie had a decent set up from the force awakens but destroys every plot thread and offers no introduction into the next star wars film  there are some good scenes and i do like kylo as a character and he is cast very well i feel he is proping up a poor script i like the scene where kylo sees luke on the ice planet and they fight really good scene   the rose and fin story is a waste of time the main plot of a space chase is ridiculous and what they did to luke is pathetic  im so disappointed i wanted to love these films im left so empty
Oct 22 2019,negative,empty with just enough stupidity to breakup the monotony  
Oct 22 2019,negative,disney wanted to prove a point with this movie they wanted to show that they could create a wonderful story for star wars where they failed was putting rian johnson in charge and allowing him to throw away several years worth of stories wrapped up within novel after novels worth of wonderful story telling and creating the garbage that is this movie thanks to this dumpster fire for the first time i will not be attending a star wars premiere night and honestly cannot imagine myself watching this one please fix them mess that this man has created
Oct 22 2019,negative,i liked it on first watch but then i started to think about it and realized that it just dosnt make sense the character action the plot  how everything goes down there is no logic to it just pointless
Oct 22 2019,negative,wasted subplots blantantly terrible coreographyediting and fails to provide continuity to its source material visuals were up to task but the overall story tragically misses the mark
Oct 22 2019,negative,this was objectively one of the worst movies i have seen it doesnt feel or play as star wars it is only star wars by name all this time after seeing it i still have a bad taste in my mouth
Oct 22 2019,negative,this was the movie that killed star wars for me
Oct 22 2019,negative,i loved the last jedi when i saw it in theatres im a huge star wars fan and have been since i was a child and i consider myself to have been lucky to have seen all the films in episodic order im very invested in the overall arc of the skywalker saga so when the sequel trilogy was announced i wasnt skeptical i was excited  now im desperately counting down the days til the rise of skywalker puts this thing to sleep and i can move on with my life  the last jedi is an example of an entertaining scifi blockbuster but an absolutely awful star wars film as ive mentioned previously i loved it when i first watched it the acting cinematography directing and general presentation of the film are leaps and bounds better than any other star wars film in my opinion and when im in a cinema watching something like this thats what really sticks out to me and gets me hooked but when watching it on a smaller screen i start to notice things that i really wish i hadnt   the story it is terrible unfaithful and utterly boring  the characters there arent any  when you realise that an entire subplot the film spends a fair chunk of time focusing on was completely irrelevant to the central story im looking at you rose and finn you now know that deep down in the heart of this film something got lost and died   what irritates me the most about this film is that i cannot put my finger on what that deceased thing is there are many things that i supposedly should be annoyed about as a fan but im not to say this film is shoving in sjw politics to star wars is giving it credit that it really does not deserve this is a film that thinks that an empowered female is a tall lady with purple hair that acts completely irrationally and gets half of her people killed for literally no reason other than im the one in charge here or a woman who falls in love with and attempts to give her life for a man she has known for absolutely no time at all yes what a fine and progressive depiction of women this is indeed   i really wont go into detail about the treatment of luke as a character because we all know already what i think of that but hes not the only one who is badly written rian johnsons writing isnt just unfaithful to the characters of the original trilogy its unfaithful to the characters introduced in the film that this one is meant to be a direct sequel to finns character arc practically repeats itself note for note as if he wasnt even present for the force awakens taking poe out of the film wouldnt have changed a single thing about it and rey well she goes from being a jedi in training to being a jedi in training i really shouldnt be able to sum up the character arc of the leading protagonist in the film that quickly   overall if youre a star wars fan on the level that i am i can only recommend this to you if you want to know absolutely everything that happens in the skywalker saga canonically but otherwise avoid this like the plague that it is if you arent a star wars fan youll probably find this enjoyable enough on a technical level
Oct 22 2019,negative,surprising twists no those werent surprising they were decieving stupid lame and lazy twists a weird cow milking her milk thats the best show of this movie is
Oct 22 2019,negative,bits i loved rose the visuals bits i hated all the ot characters acting weird the force doesnt work that way rylo reys lack of growth and personality and holdo
Oct 22 2019,negative,unfortunately this particular viewer walked away with a lengthy list of the films missed opportunities while also wanting to help jumpstart the resistances nonexistent recruiting campaign 
Oct 22 2019,negative,hated how luke is portrait in this movie  rian johnson just destroyed my childhood hero
Oct 22 2019,negative,just awful a pile of crap if you watch this youll never want to spend time watching it again
Oct 22 2019,negative,outright terrible opening sequence all the way to the end of the movie either felt weak or unnecessary makes the previous title look good which was not too bad of a picture as plot had more depth and interest 
Oct 22 2019,negative,youve destroyed luke skywalker and this franchise total crap
Oct 22 2019,negative,wow  way to kill a franchise  i waited 40 years to see the hope of the universe justfade away
Oct 22 2019,negative,i dont understand why people that have watched anything besides the force awakens would like this movie they completely destroyed the original characters and did absolutely nothing with the new ones especially finn
Oct 22 2019,negative,absolutely horrible the director should never be allowed to touch another film
Oct 22 2019,negative,it pretty much disappointed me on every level
Oct 22 2019,negative,this movie was hot garbage
Oct 21 2019,negative,the movie was awful it was way too long for its little content   also there was never really a sensible character development     in comparison with the other star wars movies this was the worst of them   star wars v the empire strikes back has shown us that a really good second part in a trilogy is possible and star wars the last jedi was the opposite of that
Oct 21 2019,negative,absolutely disgusting movie too many plottwists and stop trying to be marvel jokes about mothers doesnt belong to star wars i dont recommend watching this trash
Oct 21 2019,negative,this is worse than episode 1 dont watch it
Oct 21 2019,negative,franchisekiller dont waste your time
Oct 21 2019,negative,awful movie should be remade it was so bad
Oct 21 2019,negative,what the heck was that they have destroyed the greatest story ever told
Oct 21 2019,negative,my goodness where does this site get its reviewers 91 on the tomatometer seriously this film should be an outright 0 it was straight up garbage and the level of fan outrage out there is both justified and another clear indication of what critics are worth these days the plot here is dumb what more can i say they missed the soul of lukes character by so much not even a phenomenal actor like mark hamil could act like what he was made to put on film for this was any good watch him in his interviews its hilarious like he was warning us about this movie the whole time before it came out nothing about this movie made sense seriously not 1 thing did they imagine this as a stand alone movie and that people watching it had not seen any of the previous films before what was the pitch meeting for this film even like i wish i could detail exactly how and why this movie is awful here without spoiling it but i cant if i had to really sum it all up it felt like watching a franchise one that has a whole universe of possibility for good story telling built on top of a solid foundation of already established stories take a whole bunch of drugs and alcohol grab a motorcycle a kiddy pool and a shark and jump that baby right into a ravine filled with the razor sharp shards of every broken and discarded suicide squad dvdblu ray im glad solo flopped afterwards and that disney is finally losing money they have an army of very fine actors but there isnt an actor alive not even mark hamil harrison ford or patrick stewart who isnt even in the franchise that can make up for either horrendous story telling or simply a complete lack of it honestly this was so bad i dont know how they could ever salvage star wars in episode 9 and as a heartbroken fan of the series im sincerely dreading whats about to be shoveled down my throat in december 2019 but hey dont take my word for it im not a paid critic d
Oct 21 2019,negative,worst star wars movie completely broke with previous movie terrible writing terrible direction terrible character stories and arcs didnt follow how the sw universe worked tries to be funny but comes off as awkward the movie is a joke and there is no passion in the storytelling and you can tell the creators of this mess didnt care about the film with the terrible attention to detail and huge plot holes that couldnt be ignored because the overall story just sucked on a positive note it was a movie that had a remnant of the stuff the audience could enjoy space conflict with some force powers and space ships
Oct 20 2019,negative,only because i couldnt give it 0 terrible movie ridiculous plotrunning out of gas with jokes that try harder that most forced marvel movies  this makes episode 1 look like a masterpiece 
Oct 20 2019,negative,it was boring and the effort that was put into the kylo and rey fight scene was a mockery to all of the prequel fight scenes especially the one between obiwan and anakin luke was not the same luke that i remember from the originals id say that this movie was worse than the phantom menace
Oct 20 2019,negative,loved the action but just found myself cringing at most of the other scenes and i have to say rose may be my least favorite character out of any star wars
Oct 20 2019,negative,disney has killed this franchise and it looks like they will continue to beat the dead horse until it turns into glue kill off all of the classic beloved characters and replace it with a teen girl and a soccer ball
Oct 20 2019,negative,1 star for being twice as good as any of the prequels  its a travesty what was done to the characters of luke and leia and nothing here makes any sense in regards to the overall narrative  
Oct 20 2019,negative,horrible horrible movie
Oct 20 2019,negative,im embarrased this is even a star wars movie wow this is bad
Oct 19 2019,negative,this is among the worst movies ive ever seen
Oct 19 2019,negative,it was the worst thing i have ever seen
Oct 19 2019,negative,i dont understand how this made it to the screen like its really really bad
Oct 19 2019,negative,rian johnson managed it to destroy the new trilogy as a whole singlehandedly with one shitty movie it is very sad to see how a movie this bad and with that many lazy answers and unsolved plot holes can surpass the creative board of disney and lucasfilm and even more tragic is the score on the so called tomatometer of 91 in my opinion this has to be a joke
Oct 19 2019,negative,disney desecrate star wars
Oct 19 2019,negative,a very bad movie compared to the franchises potential and the resources rian johnson had at his disposal  many choices in the film seem to deviate from good storytelling and instead seem to originate from a desire to subvert or push a very clumsy message of socioeconomic justice  as a very liberal person it came off as exploitative  to put this way i could tell disney mandated some key issues to be centerpieces of the plot and rian johnson had to find a way to shoehorn it in  also any good director can tell you to shut out the voices and just tell your story for big blockbusters with lots of hype    rian johnson had a lot of heavy expectations put on him and a lot of people had a lot to lose if the movie was perceived as bad  so i understand the pressure he was under and the uniformly positive critic reviews  but it seems obvious that rian johnson just wasnt the right fit for this massive undertaking  the humor was definitely out of place settings were bland and practically carbon copies of original trilogy planets  plot was uninspired seriously a chase based on lack of fuel  thats your star wars story  leia suddenly has force powers and only decided to use them once her own life was in danger  a ship with a hyper drive is apparently a weapon of mass destruction      problem with the last jedi is that i am a huge fan of star wars and yet have no desire to watch what happens next
Oct 19 2019,negative,plot was all over the place felt like i was watching an mcu movie 
Oct 19 2019,negative,made me never want to watch a star wars movie again no longer a fan
Oct 18 2019,negative,this is the only star wars film i could say i wouldnt watch again ive seen the film twice with the second time lowering my score the plot is a mess with finns screen time being a waste of time and reys being over with no tension the new characters are forgettable and visuals while nice are not impressive given its a star wars film poe was definitely the character that had me interestedbut his arc makes no sense given he was in the right 
Oct 18 2019,negative,a boring movie tries too hard to be woke ruining the series in the proces
Oct 18 2019,neutral,the film was underwhelming and could of have better and more action scenes otherwise the story is great and the cast give a good job but mark hamill is a darker luke skywalker i found that different and refreshing
Oct 18 2019,neutral,really disappointing
Oct 18 2019,positive,the last jedi is a great film that sadly its not understand by every fan of the franchise i hope this change with time like it happened with empire strikes back
Oct 17 2019,negative,dreadfull on so many levels poor character development pointless sideplots badly choreographed fights total ignorance and disrespect of ot characters introduction of really annoying new characters  holdo dj rose  officialy worse than jarjar ridiculous main plot most boring space chase ever and once again rey is better than everyone from every star wars entry at everything with no training experience or mentor those behind this implosion of star wars claim it subverts expectations all it subverted for me was my cash and my absoloute love for this franchise star wars is officially dead rip
Oct 17 2019,negative,the effects were good the story was not
Oct 17 2019,negative,social justice experiment gone wrong that pink haired admiral ruined it
Oct 17 2019,negative,this movie completely dropped the ball the force awakens set up for some interesting story and this movie squandered it it made the villains into a joke rey into some sort of supergirl style character and luke into a grumpy unrelatable hermit luke was a shining beacon of hope in the original trilogy seeing good in his cruel and evil father the agenda pushing is blatantly obvious a completely disappointing installment of an interesting saga that permanently altered the future of the franchise for the worst
Oct 17 2019,negative,big let down sad too see what star wars has become
Oct 17 2019,negative,this movie is a tone deaf mess in which none of the jokes ever landed and the characters were so stupid that i found myself constantly rooting for them to die only for them to saved by some of the dumbest most laughable plot armor that i have ever seen finn and rose during the exploding ship and salt planet scenes im looking at you rey is bland and unbelievably good at everything she does and the movie constantly spits on luke skywalker and really star wars fans everwhere i watched this movie on the same plane ride that i watched daddys home 2 and this movie made it looks like a masterpiece oh and it reeks of sjw propaganda like bad terrible movie dont waste your time
Oct 17 2019,positive,i never understood the hate for this movie it is everything you could want from a star wars movie rian johnson did an excellent job of giving fans classic a star wars story with great new twists
Oct 16 2019,negative,nothing but a quick cash grab by disney   
Oct 16 2019,negative,sjw trash they totally ditched storylines by killing snoke pandering at worst
Oct 16 2019,negative,absolute shit    enough plot holes to sink the titanic suspension of belief disrupted more than once characters act out of place and motives are just muddied    the movie tries to go too many directions at once and its overambition ruins it movie cant even be a standalone movie
Oct 16 2019,negative,cultural vandalism riddled with plot holes with some nice visuals 
Oct 16 2019,negative,this movie is very sjw thinking it does not care about the rules that have been set up in the star wars universe rian johnsons imagination is fine but he does not respect star wars the action sequences are fine but have many mistakes in them 
Oct 16 2019,positive,pretty decent movie however not perfect i didnt like how leia wasnt the one to sacrifice herself kamikazi style would have been much more impactful leia floating thru space didnt look great i dont think it was explained why luke left a map to find him which is flawed pratorian guard scenes were awesome snoke scenes were great didnt think rose crashing into finn was realistic i didnt like the millinium falcon being featured again too overdone mazs scene was stupid the cantobite stuff was justifiably criticized kylo and reys force connectionprojection was great lukes was cool too im glad luke died the way he died very good send off yodas force ghost scene was great i dont like the political agenda they were pushing with poe and purple haired lady keep politics out of star wars phasma vs finn was pretty good phasmas line i want it to hurt was badass didnt like when bb8 was controlling that walking cheesy cgi i wish rey joined kylo that wouldve been something fresh and daring but they didnt go that route 
Oct 16 2019,negative,this movie is trash its obvious that rian johnson and the disney execs hate the original trilogy  we are suppose to like characters as they do things that are horrible finn tried to leave the resistance like he left the first order and is tased and detained  i thought they believed in choice  apparently not    how about we start the movie with a phone conversation joke its unfunny and unbelievable  how about we have bombs that require gravity but were in space nah dont ask questions    worse than jar jar 
Oct 16 2019,negative,easily the worst out of the entire star wars franchise rey displays zero character development through these two films its not because of her acting but rather its because of the direction the director went with when making this abomination the plot is so incredibly flimsy it is honestly astonishing sweet christ
Oct 16 2019,negative,what a horrible movie this captures none of the charm of any of the originals it even fails to capture what jj had managed with the nostalgia of tfa    carrie poppins is literally the worst thing ive seen on screen ever plus its clear lucasfilm or at least rian johnson has a vendetta against luke skywalker i dont think they get that without luke there is no star wars 
Oct 16 2019,negative,looks pretty but a good movie it is not out of all the lore and possible stories to tell they created the worst one sad to say but this is the movie that killed star wars
Oct 16 2019,positive,this movie is not my favorite out of the saga but i did enjoy it very much the character development was great and i really enjoyed the story line
Oct 16 2019,negative,whats more infuriating about this movie is that it had the potential of being great with some changes to name one have luke teach rey and snoke do the same with kylo and you could at least have a flawed sith fight a soontobecapable jedi i mean you could argue that after rogue ones final awesome scene these people would figure what the audience wants but hey you can always have luke milking an alien for blue colored milk
Oct 16 2019,neutral,hi there im another bot posting a negative review sarcasm    enough has been said about this movie to the extent that it would be pointless of me to repeat it but if i can encapsulate whats ultimately wrong with it its that this movie was not value adding in any shape or form    tfa was derivative of a new hope but it added value it set up mysteries what happened to luke why did he disappear etc who is snoke etc it set up characters the mystery of reys lineage it set up things to look forward to eg the knights of ren    this movie added nothing it was basically a long tv episode of another pointless struggle between the resistance and the first order you could remove this movie and you wouldnt lose any major story element from canon    aside from the death of luke skywalker    what an ignoble end for a character who stood up to the most powerful sith lord in history  i am a jedi like my father before me    instead he died on a rock why we dont know    if luke had died there on the battlefield sacrificing his life to save the survivors that alone would have saved the movie for me    but he didnt he died on a rock whilst patronising kylo ren with petty insults    
Oct 15 2019,negative,i really didnt like the movie because it lacked quality in its plot and originality in general it was an awful movie
Oct 14 2019,negative,what happened to this franchise 
Oct 14 2019,positive,great and challenging movie for the fans loved what they did with luke even though i didnt like it at first i understand now i would give this movie honestly 4 stars instead of 5 but this movie gets way to much hate after episode 9 explains some things that occur in 8 i believe the last jedi will become a classic 
Oct 14 2019,positive,rose and finn storyarc sucked poe and that aldo zoldo admiral were clearly screaming forced feminism made 0 sense i only like luke leia and rey and kylo were the only interesting parts i only give 5 stars for them and for the actors hard work the rest can screw it  i appreaciate the actors for giving their best in this mess 
Oct 14 2019,positive,phenomenal movie only a few errors but those are minor
Oct 14 2019,negative,i made a rotten tomatoes to rate this movie
Oct 14 2019,negative,literally the worst movie ive ever seen in my life i seriously mean that the plot is non existent and makes no sense the side plot has no impact on the actual plot and accomplishes nothing the scene with leia flying in like mary poppins is laughable the movie abandons everything from episode 7 also a bad movie for example who is snoke idk lets just kill him who are reys parents obi wan luke neh no one also they ruin luke skywalker and are not consistent with his character mark hamil even says this luke refuses to kill vader because he sees the slight good in him but attempts to murder his nephew because he might turn evil no way not the hero we know and love i could go on and on but you get the point at this point the only way episode 9 could win me over is if they start the movie with it was all just a dream
Oct 14 2019,positive,good but bad for a star wars movie rian johnson created some bad characters and created some events that dont make much sense
Oct 13 2019,negative,not as great as the original trilogy script is very weak they really should have stuck with a traditional heros journey instead of pushing a bad narrative for subversion 
Oct 13 2019,negative,and i thought jar jar was bad
Oct 13 2019,negative,why was luke killed so dumbly
Oct 13 2019,negative,visually pretty good thats where the good ends the story was bad the politicizing of star wars is worse the holdo move is dumb and worse is the treatment of luke skywalker dont see it sucks
Oct 13 2019,negative,flawed scenario approximated characters some very annoying like rose or holdo so they had to bring politics into the movie to make up for their lack of creativity    this movie is a sequence of sjw clichés its not an entertianment its a political lecture     bringbackgeorgelucas
Oct 13 2019,positive,well my last review said that i would like anything labeled star wars and this is no exception but very underwhelming in fact there are so many sjw cringe moments in this movie and a subplot that was unnecessary this is a star wars film ill only watch once
Oct 13 2019,negative,absolutely disgusting rian johnson should hang his head in shame for destroying star wars everything from leias new force space regeneration hux now a laughing stock snoke being a nobody reys parents being nobody the whole canto bight catastrophe and to crown it off the way luke skywalker one of if not thee most iconic star wars character of all time is a grumpy old man who tried to kill his best friends son because he felt the dark side in him the same person who convinced darth vader to turn good absolutely ridiculous  and dont get me started on rose 
Oct 13 2019,negative,this is not star wars
Oct 12 2019,negative,this movie shits all over star wars  another casualty of our woke sjw cancer culture  social justice warriors can only destroy but never create
Oct 12 2019,negative,looking forward to see how jj fixes this on the next movie as i sit here and painfully try to watch the last jedi i honestly hate rian johnson after seeing this film 
Oct 12 2019,negative,the first time i really didnt mind it  i thought it was a time passer then i realized that this was star wars  not a time passer star wars is something that creates a universe around its self there is so much lore if you just watch the franchise its worthless and the last jedi ruins the lore  there are so many issues with it  i normally really trust the reviewers at then tomatoes  but man they couldnt have been more mistaken
Oct 12 2019,negative,it breaks sw canon and has major plot holes which are clear even for nonhardcore viewer of the saga as a life long star wars fan i stopped putting any money in this franchise after seeing this movie long time ago characters are badly written and simply boring which is unheard of visually beautiful movie which is empty inside
Oct 12 2019,negative,finally got around to seeing this and what an awful movie i see why the fans are so hateful of the director its like he went out of his way to shove two finger up to the original movies if you want strong female characters make them good ones and believable ones like say the lead in rouge one or ripley in aliens dont just throw in random characters with no weight or point and expect them to work because they represent a minority who wouldve thought luke skywalker would turn out to be a miserable old coward its clear that rian johnson didnt have a clue how to go forward with this story i dont think ill be seeing the new one this christmas theres no way forward from here other than a reboot
Oct 12 2019,negative,the last jedi in general was micro plotted to death two directors fighting for there own consistency witch ultimately brought this franchise to its knees
Oct 12 2019,positive,the story is pretty good but i think the last jedi was more comedic then the other films and id rather not have it full of comedy and have one or two comedic reliefs
Oct 12 2019,negative,even mark hamill hated this movie and voiced about how bad it was before it was released disney silenced him i wish i had listened im sad i payed for it and im not going to watch any more star wars films ill fondly remember star wars before it sold its soul to the devil
Oct 12 2019,negative,why this film has start wars in is name
Oct 12 2019,negative,this movie is awfulstar wars is dead
Oct 12 2019,positive,the overall movie is pretty strange as it has as many ups as downs but the movie provides some amazing action and character arcs while also doing some dumb things along the way making this a good movie with bad features 810
Oct 12 2019,negative,overly dramatic and corny this movie didnt do nearly half as well as the seventh movie
Oct 11 2019,negative,it is possible however unlikely tommy wiseau might have been a better choice as director
Oct 11 2019,negative,i used to think the prequels were the worst thing that ever happened to star wars  the estrogen is strong with this one 
Oct 11 2019,positive,far from perfect its highs completely overshadow its lows steers clear of straight up fan service and delivers a cast of characters that make you think 
Oct 11 2019,negative,overview boring mindnumbingly predictable garbage humor exceedingly preachy felt like a rehash of older movies with less depthemotion wasteful plot lines but visually spectacular     worst offenses  1 snokes death this scene was stupendously dumb and lazy the most powerful sith in at least a generation capable of building up a new world with incredibly advanced technology seemingly from nothing possessing incredible force abilities never before seen in the movies is killed by a cheap trick nevermind the fact that this is an enormous waste of a character who could potentially have had incredible depth and background its just anticlimactic and lazy     2 reys refusal of ben solo of all the predictable scenes in this movie this one best exemplifies how thoroughly uncreative the writingdirection behind this movie was despite spending much of this very long movie building up the relationship between rey and ben establishing reys affinity for both light and dark side the cave scene especially and paving the way for something new to be created in the sw movie universe the ageold tropes and clichés are enforced and rey and ben assume their tired roles for example had rey and ben abandoned the rebellion and the first order the jedi and the sith and gone on to found a new order that emphasized balance between light and dark fitting for both of their characters that would have at least been a fresh and interesting take on the sw universe with plenty of lore to pull from really though anything other than the expected course of this scene would have been pleasant    3 admiral holdos purple hair lightspeed attack while i do appreciate the creativity presented in this scene in using a new and very visually exciting attack the execution was pretty poor given the staggering power of such an attack why has no one ever so much as thought to use it before if youre going to introduce something like that a small bit of explanation as to why in a world full of suicide bombers no one has ever attempted that before on screen additionally this scene fails in the context of the larger movie how many ships did admiral holdo lose before it magically ocurred to her the first time for anyome in the galaxy to use lightspeed as an attack a lot for a character more or less exalted by the movies writing her actions and thought processes are pretty flimsy     but hey it was a very pretty movie  and who doesnt love porgs
Oct 11 2019,negative,better than the force awakens at least created some things new even if rotten interesting lukes evaluation of the jedi order the weapons industry profiting from both sides and some political undertones  still unknown whats happening at the galaxy at large what is the first order or the resistance the infamous mystery boxes from jar jar it is so depressing  that our heroes after exploding the death star and defeated the emperor are now old but still fighting and dying out of screen worst space chase ever stupid antagonists and mind boggling woke story culminating on the cringest scene ever recorded on a galaxy far far away georges prequels are shakespeare compared to to jar jar trilogy
Oct 11 2019,negative,all i can say is why
Oct 11 2019,negative,a movie with lots of plot holes and many a scene that makes no sense or leaves the viewer wanting does not live up to the star wars name lacks almost all the depth the original trilogy had  seems to be a slap in the face to mark hamill who made the best of the part he was given
Oct 11 2019,negative,the star wars saga continues to go down the toilet on this one no plot empty characters and shame on mark hamill for letting  them destroy luke skywalker like that half a star is a half too many
Oct 10 2019,negative,i can see that they wanted to do something new but it was poorly done
Oct 10 2019,negative,where to start on this dumpster fire visually i would say this is almost a 5 star character story development canon believability and flow dont deserve half a star i wont be watching the next movie good luck disney lol no quotes yet not surprising very forgettable 
Oct 10 2019,negative,its like to this movie was made by an angry jealous child that just wanted to ruin the party for everyone
Oct 10 2019,positive,this is such a great star wars movie and movie in general it shows how the protagonist can change and it subverts expectations in a way that i still enjoyed and yes i am a star wars fan just not the typical one that seems to hate the movies its a great movie with some flaws im sure 10 years from now star wars fans will cherish this movie like they are starting to with the prequels that were in my opinion so much worse than they couldve been
Oct 10 2019,negative,not a huge star wars fans but had watched every single episode before this and i can confirm that the last jedi is utterly rubbish and a huge disappointment like wtf leia got blown out of her spaceship and just suddenly fly back inside she never shown any force abilities beside intuition lmao
Oct 10 2019,negative,the movie was a disgrace to the skywalker legacy
Oct 10 2019,negative,this is the worst star wars movie ever made what boring piece of garbage
Oct 10 2019,negative,an absolute disgrace to the legacy of star wars
Oct 10 2019,negative,honestly this makes the phantom menace look like a masterpiece i grew up on the original trilogy and the many things george lucas got right was the character arcs the action and the villains the characters like rey rose and finn had no change through the course of the film the only moment that i had hope for was when finn was sacrificing his life for the rebellion but it was ruined by the idiotic side character who died for nothing saving nobody except the person who wanted to die the action couldnt get worse the fight chorography in snokes liar was a disgrace to the stormtroopers the villains which i can only remember two were unexplored and useless captain plasma the most feared stormtrooper in the star wars galaxy  got decapitated by a rebellious hotheaded stormtrooper kylo rens complete change of heart came with explanation and the greatest mystery of the  decade snoke was dead abruptly with only 5 minutes of screen time
Oct 9 2019,negative,literally the worst movie ive ever seen  ive never seen such a coordinated effort to destroy a franchise as this   
Oct 9 2019,negative,made all other star wars movies look like classical art including the prequels  since disney bought the rights to star wars they have killed the franchise  i will not watch the next star wars film
Oct 9 2019,negative,absolutely horrible star wars movie any true fan knows this 
Oct 9 2019,negative,watching this was like watching a director unbuckle their seat beat and drive 100 mph into a brick wall were they trying to kill a franchise on purpose because that is what happen for me at least the previous reboot was ok in comparison wont see the 3rd installment in theaters because of this mess  such a shame so much wasted potential here
Oct 9 2019,negative,no characters that i cared about worst story ever luke 
Oct 9 2019,negative,id rather watch the phantom menace than to watch this i didnt even hate that movie this one is just pure sjw garbage 
Oct 9 2019,negative,disgusting that this is even a star wars movie this movie turned the franchise into a slow rollercoaster the force awakens gave it the suspense but the last jedi was the slow and unexciting fall it spat in the face of not just tfa but the entire star wars mythology no character arcs boring characters and toxic feminism all combined to make this gross mess of a movie it never answered any questions with we had in the first movie and just seemed like a painstakingly long waste of time
Oct 9 2019,negative,hate this film and i hope it will someday become a legends movie so that it can be replaced with another not going happen though
Oct 9 2019,negative,the problems with this are too wide and many to go into its like no one bothered to watch any previous star wars and no one was in charge of writing or directing  no reason to watch the next film as this kills everything and anything remotely interesting created by its previous installment glad the star wars franchise ended with return of the jedi
Oct 9 2019,negative,broke all the lore and every rule of starwars characters completely used as character development props cringey and awkward acting by the new girl fins love interest she was so unimpressionable i couldnt remember her name and others and loose ends everywhere even for a second installment of a three part series it had so much potential and threw all of it away only a miracle can help abrams recover this dumpster fire in the finale
Oct 9 2019,negative,this movie killed star wars
Oct 9 2019,negative,rian johnson how did you mess up this big i could go on for all of the small details that were piled over the course of the whole movie but really all you need to know is that it hurts the already established star wars universe its great to see mark hamill reprise his role as luke skywalker but the hopeful goodhearted luke that we knew and loved is gone in last jedi we get a grumpy old man that has given up on the jedi cause id give it half a star but gotta give credit where credit is due and there aint much to talk about once again like force awakens this movie is visually amazing the sets costumes and cgi are fantastic and so pleasing to the eye but that far from makes up for the hugely poor choices in the screenplay so many moments that are meant to make us feel strong emotional reactions fall completely flat
Oct 9 2019,negative,while there might have been effort to subvert expectations this film sought to betray the entire legacy turning a legendary hero into a farce 
Oct 9 2019,negative,what did they do to luke skywalker how was ray so good without any training whats the point of this garbage movie
Oct 9 2019,negative,the nail in the coffin for disney star wars and the beginning of the end to disney themselvesabsolutely rotten and lazy and agenda fill bs
Oct 9 2019,negative,this film doesnt deserve to be called star wars it destroyed the legacy of luke skywalker by turning him into a joke its political and feminist agenda overshadowed the only thing good about it which was the visual style of it complete trash
Oct 9 2019,negative,wish i had held out and didnt finally watch it ugh i made a mistake giving it a try 
Oct 8 2019,negative,posted a review before but i guess it was deleted wont waste my words or time any longer with star wars good job killing it rian 
Oct 8 2019,negative,it will b a hard act to follow
Oct 8 2019,negative,what a piece of sht i registered to rotten tomatoes just to give a bad review for this film this is the worst film i have ever seen in my life
Oct 8 2019,negative,the absolute worst excuse for a star wars film ive ever seen the way luke was portrayed was all wrong the way rose stopped finn from dying a heroic death goes against the morals of star wars and understanding that there are things worth dying for and that saving the cause is more important than one person this movie sucked plain and simple 
Oct 8 2019,negative,utter garbage if there was a 0 star option id go for it
Oct 8 2019,negative,a crime against humanity
Oct 8 2019,negative,this just does not feel like a star wars movie from the pointless marvel type jokes to the point rose and finn arc this is disneys worst attempt in the franchise so far
Oct 8 2019,negative,this is by far the worse star wars movie ever
Oct 8 2019,negative,weak plot terrible continuation of both the force awakens and the original trilogy catastrophic misuse of luke skywalker awful choreography and horrible shoehorning of shallow messages its a great looking and sounding movie and thats all it has going for it
Oct 8 2019,positive,a star wars movie that is unafraid to look beyond fan expectations to deliver a story that is not only a logical progression of what came before but also capable of delivering cathartic surprises instead of bending to fanservice and or merely delivering what was expected     most fans take issue with the treatment of luke skywalkers character in this film insisting he acted completely out of character however when we look back on his actions in return of the jedi and consider how easily his father was swayed into abandoning his good intentions we see that lukes infractions against his jedi code and his former heroism are pretty tame by comparison the film even spells it out his impulse to kill his nephew was there and gone somehow this is conflated by some of the angrier members of the fanbase as a legitimate attempt on bens life this is of course ironic as this is ben solos reading of the event blindsided and betrayed by luke standing above him blade drawn ben understandably assumes the worst this is what makes the rashomonesque sequence of recollections from kylo and luke so brilliant its a tragedy of misunderstandings some fans will never be able to suspect it but considering luke having nearly lost his life to the ultimate evil one should be willing to humor him for considering an impulse that may well have prevented test evil from returning of course we know his actions had the opposite effect again therein lies the tragedy     the other characters are treated with a kind of realism that i think might feel a bit jarring for someone walking into a star wars film but i think they work by and large poes journey towards accepting caution over action and accepting responsibility can feel a bit wonky with holdo being an obstacle to his deception where perhaps just good communication should have taken place     finn continues from the start on the same quest from the force awakens protect rey its easy to confuse his loyalty to rey as reverence for the resistance but all his heroism in the previous film was really just in service of rey and that continues here its not difficult to see why either he spent his entire life in service of a radical military group unrecognized by the broader galaxy only to flee and become roped into joining another militant group separate from the republic finns journey in tfa was therefore about the discovery of self and making the self the priority as he is humanized by his new friend poe and is given a name and by extension self worth so canto bight is a bit of a detour but is a teaching moment that grounds finn away from selfish action and into fighting for a bigger cause     kylo is the real star here drivers performance is both nuanced and explosive and speaks to the caustic nature of the character his bond with rey is nuanced and toes the line brilliantly between genuine vulnerability and description hes a character so caustic and conflicted that one could believe he genuinely wants both yes he kills his master snoke and yes snoke had no back story but it was a necessary move for kylo and was a cathartic twist to know who we assumed was the master manipulator was the one being manipulated a satsifying subversion of the masterapprentice trope and very much in line with the darkside apprentice ascension model in killing his master ala palpatine and plagueis much like the enduring mystery of reys insane innate force ability this will only be a critical error in the larger picture if the choice is not justified and contextualized in the rise of skywalker given the constraints of the films runtime we didnt really need any explanation of snokes backstory just yet being the second chapter in a trilogy its acceptable that some things remain a mystery     my only reservations with the film is the detour that was canto bight i think those same lessons could have been introduced in a way that didnt feel so separated from the rest of the picture even though their mission there was of relevance overall additionally the humor felt a bit out of place at times and a bit too marvelesque with some moments losing their dramatic weight after an out of place joke the humor in star wars has never felt quite as punchline oriented as it does here and it shows     overall a pretty good film with some essential star wars moments even if there was no proper lightsaber duel but theres enough new force powers and fascinating character dynamics to make up for it and satisfy this lifelong star wars fan     45         
Oct 8 2019,negative,worst star wars movie in the franchise i am not only done with star wars i refuse to see any film rian johnson makes nice job with the casino scene and super leia
Oct 8 2019,negative,i was actually very disappointed with this movie i for myself have no issue with rian johnson director trying to be unpredictable and i also believe that you can make any movie premise work if you have the necessary skill to pull it off   this is simply not the case the timing is very sloppy filled with plotholes that could have been easily avoided and theres a lacking depth in character development that would have made it possible to empathize with the situations presented the movie almost feels like a teenagers attempt to leave a mark in a franchise thats bigger than themselves such a waste of potential
Oct 8 2019,negative,worst of the star wars movie from a director whose ego was more important than understanding the movie he was making i pointless plot complete lack of understanding of the characters useless secondary plot to get other characters screen time and countless other issues in an attempt to make star wars about more than just the skywalker family the problem there is that these trilogies are about the skywalker family specifically rian appears to forget he is doing the 8th movie of a saga and not the first or second movie of a new property in an attempt to make it so anyone can be special he casually forgets the premise of the jedi and that prior to anakin they were not allowed to have families thus negating any ideas that the jedi were ever about a persons lineage overall if you want to see some decent special effects and admittedly slightly better actingdialog than a standard star wars movie then you may like this movie if you have any love of star wars a novices understanding of storytelling plot development and pacing then you will likely see this movie for what it is an embarrassment to the star wars universe yes i say that even having seen phantom menace and attack of the clones
Oct 8 2019,negative,mark hamill said it himself they dont care about the characters and story its all about money    
Oct 7 2019,negative,i dont normally review anything good or bad but the last jedi was hot garbage way to mess up the franchise disney
Oct 7 2019,negative,broke starwars cannon and the rest of the film took no risks just a colossal disappointment
Oct 7 2019,negative,if i could give it a 0 i would random and horrible star wars is supposed to be a tragic story not whatever this is
Oct 7 2019,positive,likely inspired by the ww2 aerial fights used in the rough cut of a new hope rian brings us a bombing run at the films start to try and push back the first order    the theme of this film is about letting go of the past in order to move forward  a reminder to the audience not to hold nostalgia so tightly as to resist change    our heroes make costly choices and audiences are left with polarizing opinions over some of the creative choices made by its direction
Oct 7 2019,negative,worst star wars film so far i will not be watching the next one i will stick with the harmys despecialized original trilogy as the only real star wars films
Oct 7 2019,negative,the worst movie in the franchise
Oct 7 2019,negative,worst star wars movie made the prequels look like classics
Oct 7 2019,negative,worst star wars movie by far looks like rian johnson didnt know anything about the previous movies luckily disney got what it deserved with the failure of solo a star wars story
Oct 6 2019,negative,rian johnson and kathleen kennedy did something obnoxious that doesnt belong to the star wars it has massive problems with everything from the poorly written script jesuitically destroying the bare essence of the saga and the mary sue for the main character to the colossal plot holes and laughable fighting scenes its literally awful i think rian hates star wars he has humiliated and killed or killed and humiliated the luke skywalker  this is not my luke and not my star wars
Oct 6 2019,negative,trash film star wars is dead 
Oct 6 2019,positive,unlike the first film this movie adds new and interesting plot lines to the star wars franchise although there are some issues with the film it is overall a very enjoyable watch
Oct 6 2019,negative,leia is now mary poppins a bunch of characters you dont care about some of the most boring fight scenes in star wars history lukes terrible character development this is the worst star wars movie by a longshot
Oct 6 2019,positive,the boldest most unique and thematically rich star wars film filled with very sufficient character arcs gorgeous direction excellent music as usual and so many empowering moments sure to become iconic but its the themes of failure heroism legacy and finding your place and purpose  that make it stand out over every other film in the franchise it takes a few viewings to fully appreciate it as a whole and its few flaws are just specks when compared to the artistry and brilliance on display
Oct 6 2019,positive,this movie has gotten a very unfair reputation and although it does have so slower scenes it overall is a amazing mo
Oct 6 2019,negative,the biggest disappointment ive ever had in a movie theater a mortal wound for the whole franchise
Oct 6 2019,negative,worst parts  light saber toss  running out of fuel  drinking blue milk  leia mary poppins  yoda is not comedic relief  save the wildlife  using hyperspace as a weapon changes everything  no answer who is who  snoke was useless  rose is annoying   no lightsaber duel  the entire plot is the resistance or rebellion running out of fuel and for some unknown reason the first order cant hyperspace abit in front to flank them or do anything actually tactical    i have to stop before the list is too long i could go on forever    
Oct 6 2019,negative,movie that killed star wars
Oct 6 2019,negative,worst movie ever a total disgrace for the star wars saga the director rian johnson fd up
Oct 6 2019,negative,this movie sucks  it turns luke skywalker into a fool
Oct 6 2019,negative,the movies cgi is great every character has his or her moment to make you laugh and shine but overall it was a miss with me there was simply too many times during the movie i thought  wow that looks cool unexpected  and still lazy maybe if i just accepted dumb writing and the occasional dumb scene i could enjoy it more 
Oct 6 2019,positive,way better than the emoji movie
Oct 6 2019,negative,just terrible love when the director has an ill show you attitude with the fans there is a way to be creative without being insulting 
Oct 5 2019,negative,i thought this movie was absolutely terrible easily the worst movie in the franchise however this is disney star wars so i keep that separate from lucas star wars i am totally baffled that the critcs gave it a 91 while the audience gave it 44 with 211k seems fishy no
Oct 5 2019,negative,my expectations were subverted all the way through i actually thought they couldnt make a movie as bad as the force awakens expectations  subverted    this movie is hot garbage
Oct 5 2019,negative,an insult to the fans a vandalisation of the franchise how dare they
Oct 5 2019,negative,broke star wars did the creators even watch the previous 7 films
Oct 5 2019,negative,a film that looks stunning but is an insult to the star wars fans base and movie goers in general
Oct 5 2019,negative,while i appreciate johnson taking risks that abrams did not take  last jedi was just not a good movie disney has no plan for this franchise
Oct 5 2019,negative,absolute filth im surprised anyone have this the go ahead the way this new saga is heading is simply awful there were 3 bright sides to this film the addition of dj and the casino the fight scenes and the continued acting of fn and po being incredible however snoke is an underwhelming and completely random filler villain admiral holdo and rose are simply unlikeable characters and the films plot is subpar at best
Oct 5 2019,negative,i think this might be the worst star wars film yet and thats saying a lot i watched it when it was released on bluray i hated it i hate how they do not respect anything from star war history i hate the obviously flawed fight sequences i could go on but its a terrible star wars movie at best it is a mediocre space action flick but considering the bad fight sequences even that might be pushing it 
Oct 5 2019,negative,this movie was made with no thought or knowledge of the series characters or the galaxy in which it takes place luke skywalkers character is fundamentally different and ruined ive loved star wars for over twenty years this single film has made me lose all interest in the series 
Oct 5 2019,negative,the last fight scene with kylo and rey pretty much sums up the entire film bad watch fight scene autopsy the last jedi throne room star wars on youtube and you will see how common sense was thrown out the window in this movie
Oct 5 2019,negative,ruined star wars possibly the kill shot
Oct 5 2019,negative,awful tried to push uneeded storylines that made absolutely no impact on the story 
Oct 5 2019,positive,the story seemed distracted and the action was overall mediocre aside from two good fight scenes wasnt impressed with this one
Oct 4 2019,negative,this is not going the way you think  well they got that right i expected a good star wars flick and got just a very bad movie in general throwing away characters and storylines left and right with a sense of humor that is just dumb and not funny at all not worthy of the star wars name 
Oct 4 2019,negative,ryan how could you
Oct 4 2019,negative,worst star wars movie franchise killer
Oct 4 2019,negative,this had awe full pacing and did the franchise dirty
Oct 4 2019,negative,wowi never thought i would come across a star wars movie where i could care less what happens to its characters unfortunately this movie falls flat in every category but most of all its characters are the least memorable part will i go see the next installment of this franchise most likely not since there is nothing interesting going on with these characters story arcs 
Oct 4 2019,negative,absolutely awful made all previous movies irrelevant killed off characters that were pivotal to the plot 
Oct 4 2019,negative,  a real mess nothing in this movie makes sense the development of the characters and their motivations is bad the performances are not the best and the arcs that the film establishes do not contribute anything to the overall plot
Oct 4 2019,negative,plot was everywhere
Oct 4 2019,negative,boring unimaginative and sloppy 2nd time viewing was worse
Oct 4 2019,negative,this movie makes the phantom menace look good
Oct 4 2019,negative,this movie makes no sense but have great scenes 
Oct 4 2019,positive,this move gave no shits in a established universe in what seemed like they film the first draft of a script instead of really polishing it first 
Oct 4 2019,negative,it sucked worse that jar jar in the prequels
Oct 4 2019,negative,a perfect guide on how to ruin one of the best characters in film history
Oct 3 2019,negative,how top critics can call this one of the best star wars movies of all time is beyond me this has got to me one of the worst movies of all time with the only entertaining scene being when kylo ren and rey fight the guards together space vegas was just so irrelevant to the little plot the movie had
Oct 3 2019,negative,i gave it time before i decided to post my thoughts  i went into this movie 2 years ago wanting to love it  i walked out of theatre shocked at how bad it was  i said to myself give it time and watch it again later  my second watch i noticed even more problems than i did the first time  what happened to this franchise
Oct 3 2019,negative,terrible this movie should be wiped from star wars canon and completely forgotten about there are so many problems with it and rj should never have directed it
Oct 3 2019,negative,did not enjoy the pace of the story or how my favorite character from tfa was used  end felt very depressing
Oct 3 2019,negative,terrible storytelling and political propaganda
Oct 3 2019,negative,the counterargument that this is a childrens film and thus is unwarranted for any criticism is false all films are worthy to be scrutinized criticized and praised the films christopher robin an american tail the lego movie and ernest and celestine are examples of excellent childrens films and storytelling which involve issues of the day and are still relatable but unlike those films this film falls flat below expectations with its unrefined storytelling  this film fails due to the following reasons  a travesty due to shoddy storytelling heavy handed authors voice that comes off as preachy and shows directors incompetent skill in weaving social issues and politics with no subtlety lack of creativity with still no progression of technology in the established universe the writers complete disregard to the previous film shows the writer had no intention of continuing the plot points set by the force of awakensprevious film and the writers outright refusal of team collaboration and also highlights the lack of foresight by executives in creating a coherent and consistent trilogy that flows from beginning to end the film depicts previous established characters as if polar opposites terrible rushed uncoordinated fight scenes forced marvel humor as if the audience is not cultured enough to understand its a scifi movie insulting jokes such as yomama which is now not appropriate and outdated in this day and age of film no thought put into military tactics which shows the creators lack of interest in providing compelling battle scenes foolish and inept antagonists uncompelling  main protagonists that comes off as silly andor overpowered with no true inner conflict  or sense of struggle and trial a true hero finds the courage to get back up when they fall a character that never struggles and wins without trial or error is not worth watching with no real sense of struggle there is no feeling of accomplishment felt by the audience nor the character because perfection is not an attainable state flaws is what makes a believable human character the abscence of flaws in a character shows the writers hand in wish fulfillment and playing out their fantasies which thus makes the character feel inhuman and alien this film is a glorification of martyrdom which is a disgusting ideal and one not worthy of praising and is a redundant trope because the falsehood that you can inspire people with your death is destructive to society you can inspire more people with living your full life rather than seeking martyrdom in death this film exposes the falsehood of hollywood the media and its shills in pushing for a film the majority of its audience obviously does not like and has fully rejected
Oct 3 2019,negative,disappointing in so many ways betrayal of characters ideals failure of in universe physics and flying princesses and lets not forget the least impressive opponents in cinema dark helmet was more frightening and written much better  i went home after and nearly wept 
Oct 2 2019,negative,a horrible movie that some how manages to render this trilogy boring and dull
Oct 2 2019,neutral,not bad but not that great either
Oct 2 2019,negative,if this movie was on tv the same time as either of the ewok movies id pick the ewok movie evey time
Oct 1 2019,negative,absolute worst movie of all time ruins star wars way too goody goody lame and boring 
Oct 1 2019,negative,worst star wars of all time
Oct 1 2019,negative,it was okay  it passed the time  luke skywalkers portrayal was disappointing  daisy ridley is nice to look at but rai is kind of boring  shes good at everything  theres no suspense when you see her  you know she will defeat anything  kylo ren is no darth vader  snoke was worthless  hux was stupid  holdo and rose were terrible  poe besides his stupid joke in the beginning was the only good thing  i like fin too but this movie ruined him 
Oct 1 2019,negative,too many plotholes rey is boring and i am not feeling any tension within the movie i watched the awakened movie and this one when it came out and i will watch the rise coming out in december but this is a punch into the face why did holdo did the kamikaze is there noone in the histroy of ftl travel that thought of that before why did they even bother bulding a deathstar if you can destroy it with a simple cruiserjust ftl it into it it is total bs 
Oct 1 2019,negative,what a stinker beautiful sets good acting amazing special effects and a clunker of a story with plot chasims you could fly a stardestroyer through  the script seems to deliberately set out to destroy everything fans love about the star wars universe  seems to be more about the writers ego than trying to produce entertainment  really disappointing
Sep 30 2019,negative,a middle finger to the star wars community disney just killed half the fan base that they spent so much money on 
Sep 30 2019,negative,trash poor characters worse portrayals bad story bad sad
Sep 30 2019,negative,hollywood is at it again this time to destroy our most beloved scify series the only redeeming quality of star wars the last jedi was the performance of the villain portrayed by adam driver 155 stars imo
Sep 30 2019,negative,disney have destroyed once beloved franchise with this abomination
Sep 30 2019,negative,insulting to the intelligence of the audience and even more insulting to anyone who respected the impact that a consistent universe had on the star wars franchise a blind attempt to subvert expectations without any redemption
Sep 30 2019,negative,rian johnson serves up an absolute piece of junk as usual the critics got this once dead wrong complete waste of time
Sep 29 2019,negative,some scenes were an absolute blast that evoked the original movies and were expertly crafted but overall the movie overpromised and underdelivered and it also killed off some familiar faces that could be crucial to the ending of the saga in the next movie the character development is way too important here and still manages to feel useless concluding the movie was still entertaining but it took a very risky dive and screwed up in terms of delivering a complete star wars experience
Sep 29 2019,negative,poor writting and doesnt respect the essence of the saga   
Sep 29 2019,negative,very bad movie the writer of the script never understood what star wars is all about
Sep 29 2019,neutral,it ruins the legacy of star wars
Sep 28 2019,negative,truly a nightmare of writing pace and direction save your time and money 
Sep 28 2019,negative,o boy that was just horrible even now i cant bring myself to give that movie more than half a star 
Sep 28 2019,negative,pure garbage and waste of all previous character development i wouldnt recommend this film to a todler which is the level of intelligence you need to enjoy this buchery of a franchise i for sure will be boycotting the next installment
Sep 28 2019,negative,i thought this movie was poorly written i watched all the original trilogy and then the prequels i didnt think the prequels were that bad some of the story lines were ok i had no major issues with the force awakens solo or rogue one but this movie made no sense it is a big budget movie with a story line that goes nowhere the only way i would recommend someone new watching this movie is changing the settings to another language that way you wouldnt know what they were saying and the inability to follow the plot because the visual effects are actually pretty good i never thought one movie could ruin a whole franchise for me but this one did that i use to rewatch all the star wars movies but that stopped after seeing tlj thanks rian for taking that away from me
Sep 28 2019,negative,worst movie ever made plot made no sense longest star wars movie ever made that could have been literally broken down to play out in a 30 minute movie no good characters or character development useless dialogue ruins childhood do not watch 
Sep 28 2019,negative,an awful movie not just an awful star wars movie 
Sep 28 2019,negative,short review withsome spoilers for a movie thats been so divisive i will say this starting with its strengths rian johnson made a visually stunning film the questions his script raised were engaging and important the possibility of the jedi being corrupt and luke sealing himself off from the galaxy are amazing and worthy of a film   now on to its weaknesses unfortunately johnsons script and followthrough of the important ideas it sets up in the words of rlm failed spectacularly at every level last jedi should have been a great movie but with its missteps and inconsistent overlong script with excessive comedic misfires instead caused the franchise to implode    
Sep 28 2019,negative,a little bit rotten and boring tbh
Sep 28 2019,negative,it betrays the spirit of star wars it destroys luke skywalker to the ground its so painful to watch its like my childhood was destroyed in front of my eyes   i still can look the good filmmaking and all that but it just its more disappointing so sad for star wars and this trilogy 
Sep 28 2019,negative,a terrible end to star wars 
Sep 28 2019,negative,absolutely disappointing
Sep 27 2019,negative,there is no consistency within the movie nor the entire star wars universe it drags down the entire star wars experience while the movie breaks 4th wall several time to celebrate what it thinks is cleverness but closer to emptiness with a drop of shallow subverting expectations by doing the opposite was a better plan for george costanza than star wars
Sep 27 2019,negative,this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen and has ruined star wars 
Sep 27 2019,negative,this was a butchering similar to the last season of game of thrones smh
Sep 27 2019,negative,worst star wars ever made could have cut out at least 12 hour out of this movie and would not have made a difference 
Sep 27 2019,negative,such a wasted opportunity an incredible effort from the technical team and crew can not disguise a poorly written and directed film no regard is given for the star wars ethos or mythology there is another cut somewhere online that does fix most of the issues and is a much better watch
Sep 26 2019,negative,needs to work on story and the plot next time
Sep 26 2019,negative,this movie is a shame to the franchise
Sep 26 2019,negative,how to screw up decades of fandom in one film i cant believe they found out how to make the prequels look like titanic
Sep 26 2019,negative,ive seen porn with better storytelling and better relationships so the only thing this has is budget
Sep 26 2019,negative,    this movie does not feel like star wars at all it seems more like a scifi movie with the star wars title slapped on it not to mention everything else that is bad with this movie      disney has brought shame upon the name of star wars  
Sep 25 2019,neutral,disappointing and lacking plot depth rian johnsons star wars is sure to please those who watch it for fluff but those who were expecting solid content or character development are sure to be disappointed
Sep 25 2019,negative,bad cinematography bad characterization and a lot of strange moments that werent well enacted and if these were comedy these were not wellexecuted and were just disturbing sometimes combat was rushed and overthetop effects were good yet unfocused and just basically became a movie about flailing your lightsaber around and killing all the bad guys stream it if its on your alreadypaidfor subscription and dont waste your money in theaters or dvd unless youre trying for a blueray collection but just wait until 9 is released as it will be cheaper and your collection isnt complete until that movie anyway
Sep 25 2019,negative,a forced agendadriven trash that has ruined a seemingly bulletproof franchise not sure disney will be able to resuscitate this now 
Sep 25 2019,negative,the prequels spoiled me when it comes to jedionjedi combat i really miss the fantastical type of lightsaber fighting from those movies especially with todays cg tech if youre going to have a terrible plot and constantly insidejoke about previous movies could you at least throw some visual wizardry in there
Sep 25 2019,negative,worst movie of all time
Sep 25 2019,negative,i feel awful for george lucas they have butchered the greatest scifi saga of all time 
Sep 25 2019,negative,reminded me of those straighttovideo bstars action movies yet another failed attempt at recapitalization of a faltering franchise 
Sep 25 2019,negative,only redeeming thing about this movie was the lightsaber action otherwise it was a heaping pile of garbage 
Sep 25 2019,negative,disney failed the lore
Sep 25 2019,negative,horrible the story didnt make any sense at all
Sep 25 2019,negative,this movie sucked   its by far the worst of the franchise
Sep 25 2019,negative,the movie had its moments of greatness the imperial fleet being destroyed uhmwell maybe thats about it the rest of it was vague drivel a horrible installment of the star wars saga
Sep 24 2019,negative,disney destroyed starwars worst plot ever
Sep 24 2019,negative,bad totally ripped the legacy of star wars and destroyed any glimpse of a good trilogy off of the back of the previous movie in my opinion this is not worthy of being star wars cannon
Sep 24 2019,negative,this movie was so bad it got me to not care about star wars anymore  i used to love this one just ran it into the ground and ruined all the plot lines they had to go forward with  rather depressing
Sep 24 2019,negative,the death of a franchise 
Sep 23 2019,positive,say what you will about the last jedi but i enjoyed some of the parts of the film it was average the last jedi is not like ghostbusters where the audience gets too much pandering towards the tough female crowd if george lucas secretly write this film with rian johnson i can really agree with everyone the cast from the last film is good with rey finn and poe these people are the next generation of the sequel trilogy the cinematography is fantastic and so does the music by john williams does a great job if it werent for john this film wouldve sucked really hard the music is the heart of the film   the bad guys are alright no one wants snoke aka paplatine knock off to be involved anymore although andy serkis performance sells it adam driver kylo ren really tries in this film after seeing him from the force awakens and lucky logan he can really nail performances like kylo haden christensen feels so cliche and does not hold up it was really nice to see mark hamill again and so does carrie fisher after what the prequels dragged and at least were not the main characters of the sequel trilogy this time not since what happens to kingdom of the crystal meth here are the problems of the movie the casino scene of course everyone talks about rose tico and the rest of the cast including laura dern and benicio del toro gets no introduction rian is an inexperienced director by making two films bricks and looper then did episodes of breaking bad in which gains cult status
Sep 23 2019,negative,i went to see it in theaters and im glad i havent watched it again
Sep 23 2019,negative,if i could give it negative stars i could  incredibly bland characters and story  i wouldnt have guessed how quickly disney was able to take this amazing fantasy galaxy and turn it into bleh  my household regularly watches the first 6 movies and clone wars series but havent even opened the episode 7 movie case and simply wont buy episode 8
Sep 23 2019,positive,despite its flaws my overall impression of the movie was great the visuals were stunning the story of luke was bold and interesting and the building of rey and bens relationship was so enchanting just watching the two of them find common ground in the struggle of finding their place in the ancient religions and in the nexus of good and evil it was a great continuation of the story and im beyond excited to see how episode 9 will conclude the saga 
Sep 23 2019,negative,garbage i will never accept this film as canon
Sep 23 2019,positive,despite the lack of positive reviews from fans i enjoyed this movie although some scenes can be cheesy and cause a little cringe like the opening scene the scenes with kylo ren and supreme leader snoke are some of the best of the franchise i agree with the criticism of luke but i was glad to see he was redeemed the lack of captain phasma is one of my main problems with the movie too also the side plot with finn and rose was borderline unbearably boring if one was to completely remove finn from the film the plot would have been the exact same overall i had a relatively fun time and loved some of the scenes with kylo ren snoke and rey    coming back a few years later i must admit that rian johnson is a talented directed i think he is a poor star wars writer but a great director i would have loved to see this film written by another but directed by johnson then i think this film could have been great
Sep 23 2019,negative,despite impressive cinematography the script is an insult to the original trilogy and its characters this did little for the franchise beyond alienate a large portion of the fanbase and send the box office numbers for the next instalment through the floor
Sep 23 2019,negative,awful truly awful how anyone can seriously hold this up as a good movie is beyond me its disappointing that starwars has become a vehicle for people to signal which side of the political debate they are on in regard to social justice and identity politics politics aside this is objectively a terrible movie the story telling pacing direction character development all objectively terrible it doesnt respect the previous film let alone the original trilogy but of course to say so is to ally yourself with undesirables guilty of wrongthink im not a misogynist nor am i a racist i didnt mind tfa apart from the central premise being fundamentally flawed of course no need to fire on a planet if you have the ability to extinguish its star i even quite like rey as a character i have nothing against disney either i loved rogue one this movie however is an absolute disgrace to the franchise and has left me a life long star wars fan with very little desire to see the next instalment love him or hate him jj gave rian johnson plenty of material with which to build a compelling story but what did we get a slow chase through space and an inconsequential sub plot that had no baring on anything dont even get me started on his portrayal of luke awful just awful     
Sep 23 2019,negative,the worst star wars and also a bad movie in general 
Sep 23 2019,negative,this film turned a life long star wars fan into a its dead to me burn it down former star wars fan when you can make a 40 year old dude hate something he loved since childhood you have done something very wrong
Sep 23 2019,positive,force awakens has the upper hand its still good i enjoyed it very much cant wait for the next one
Sep 23 2019,negative,with all the talk of subverting our expectations this movie has more plot twists than the whole star wars series to the point where they arent even twists anymore taking away the tension of scenes this movie also ruins the shared universe of star wars not only with making hyperspace just going really fast not like in other forms of star wars media where you enter a type of wormhole overall this movie is a general cluster of a film and does not deserve the rating it has
Sep 23 2019,negative,beautiful visuals dont make up for sloppy storytelling that ruins wellestablished star wars mythology someone needs to give ryan johnson and lucasfilm a copy of campbells the power of myth or maybe they could just read over the scripts for a new hope empire strikes back and return of the jedi
Sep 23 2019,negative,the force awakens was good and the build up was good for this movie yet snoke was basically nerfed into a sock puppet and easily beaten    could go on as to how bad it was not going to see the next star wars movie
Sep 23 2019,negative,really awful signed up to rt just to post this
Sep 23 2019,negative,it sucks there are no answers to snoke lukes more whiny than he was in the original trilogy and rey whole character arc is just thrown away
Sep 23 2019,positive,my favorite star wars 
Sep 22 2019,negative,outstanding audio and visual effects the lack of character development coupled with the large number of holes in the story led to this negative review  
Sep 22 2019,negative,this one of the worst movies ive ever seen id rather watch all three of the prequels straight without any breaks
Sep 22 2019,negative,wow that was not a good movie 
Sep 22 2019,negative,this movie was terrible hardly even felt like a star wars film jj abrams set up what couldve been a great sequel to tfa and rian johnson threw all that potential away the writing was awful characters were flawed every character who died deserved so much better no respect given for the lore and plot holes everywhere the forced humor and political undertones made this already bad movie even less enjoyable disney is this seriously all 317 million was capable of rian johnson has shown his incompetence as a director and should never be let into a studio or near a star wars project ever again  
Sep 22 2019,negative,one of the worst films ive ever seen the plot is a complete mess this movie actually made me angry in less than a minute of watching it its that bad 
Sep 22 2019,negative,worst star wars movie ever painful to watch someone butchering everything that was built over decades 
Sep 22 2019,negative,rating 35100 35 grade f let me start by saying ive been a huge star wars fan since childhood the last jedi does not get bad ratings due to sour grape fans or any type of outrage simply put it is a bad star wars movie which means its a very bad movie overall the film is unrecognizable compared to any other star wars film the dialogue is beyond cheesy and you will wonder if actors are reading from cue cards during filming rian johnson singlehandedly did his best to ruin luke skywalkers legacy made a complete joke of the force and destroyed every set up jj abrahams stacked up for him the last jedi is one of the worst films of the 2010s and if you havent seen it yet i am envious 
Sep 22 2019,negative,the complete destruction of the star wars franchise
Sep 22 2019,negative,looks nicethats it
Sep 22 2019,negative,a fucking cinematographic garbage felt a bit like one of those movies the highschool teachers used to show students to lean them into modern identity politics sooo fucking bad ill never forgive them to what they made of luke
Sep 22 2019,positive,could have been so much better 
Sep 21 2019,negative,garbage this movie is garbage the writers disregard establish norms of hoe this universe works for cheap visuals and even cheaper jokes that are inappropriate to the scene and setting subversion of audience expectations for the sole sake of subversion is not good writing 
Sep 21 2019,negative,a true lack of respect what rian johnson did with luke skywalker
Sep 21 2019,negative,terrible this movie ruin johnson killed star wars
Sep 21 2019,negative,rian johnson knows nothing about star wars worst sw ever long stupid and just slow i had never looked at my watch in a theater during a sw movie before
Sep 21 2019,negative,rian johns has killed the golden goose
Sep 21 2019,negative,this is the worst star wars movie ever produced  there were two worthwhile scenes in this movie  the rest was craptastic and made no sense  i feel sorry for the actors and actresses who suffered through this garbage  garbage story garbage writing  tried watching again on netflix to see if i was just in a mood or something but no i couldnt even watch it  sad
Sep 21 2019,negative,the worst star wars movie and possibly one of the worst disappointments of my life still angry about this movie 2 years after release rian johnson shouldnt be allowed to write another script ever again 
Sep 20 2019,negative,what a horrible mess first star wars movie i ever hated luke is the heart and soul of star wars and they messed it up not going to see the sequel ill stick with the first six
Sep 20 2019,negative,worst star wars movie since attack of the clones a complete disjointed mess that breaks the rules of the already established lore it completely disrespects the original story and forgets that the previous film even existed its clear that kathleen kennedy and rian johnson dont understand star wars and gave us this mediocrity as is because they know the general population will eat it up and still call it good i had no fan theories and only wanted a good story not some bland rehash that tries to be subversive but does so in an extremely flawed way rogue one was a much better movie because gareth edwards actually respected the franchise and its rules while still entertaining us with new characters and a new story
Sep 20 2019,negative,by far the worst star wars film to ever be created rian and johnson and disney have ruined star wars they mishandled all the characters ruined space physics im never gonna watch this movie again and i am now frightened for episode 9 
Sep 20 2019,negative,exceptionally terrible huge plot holes in the entire story has huge amounts of the movie that lead to nothing and should have been cut  rian took a huge dump on luke skywalker ive seen this turd once and thats one to many times
Sep 20 2019,negative,1 luke is not luke from i can redeem darth vader the second evilest guy in the galaxy to i should just slaughter my nephew and then severe my connection with my sister and my friendsand the forcejust because  2 the plan is stupid why would a general holdo keep the plan secret from his underlings  3 hyperspace rammingwhy didnt they do it to the death star too if this was a thing  4 no training at all and no character development luke needed to train for months with yoda and it was one of the strongest part of the movie the spectator gets to know more about the force about the main character and his inner feeelings and his struggles and gets to know yoda and his relationship with his student  rey does 2 training sessions that last some minutes and bam she knows everything no struggles at all no learning  5 forced jokes not funny at all just randomly put there to catch the audience off guard  6 leia is kinda too much strong supermanlike force flight in the space really with powers like that nothing is really a menace  7 boring sidequests  8 snokeheffner was a big disappointment  9 the plotthe entire plot is a chasein spacewhy just dont jump in hypersace in front of the republicrebels ship since they cant jump anymore  10 the messagekill the pastquite the postmodern messagekill the past instead of learn from it  11 forced romance between 2 characters with zero chemistry finn and rose  12 this is hinerited from ep7where the heck did the first order come from the republic has beaten the empire and after 30 years the first order has the resources to build a gigantic army and a weapon that is like 6 deathstarsso in 30 years something that is much more rich and powerful than the empire just spawns under the republics nose  12 everyone can use the force and wthout training everyone is specialthat means that noone is special enymore 
Sep 20 2019,negative,this is a film study on how to make a terrible high budget film this movie is outright pathetic  insulting to its setting and its audiences intelligence world building has rarely been so utterly silly  
Sep 20 2019,positive,a very underrated movie theres more to movies than plot
Sep 20 2019,positive,ahead of its time  20 years from now people will call it a masterpiece  
Sep 20 2019,negative,felt like the director was more interested in making his own movie than continuing a franchise if you want to start something new wait until you close the chapter on skywalker then start something new with the new characters you created and have established around the beloved legacy characters when you do this then it makes us who grew up with the legacys feel more emotionally attached to the new ones and more apt to move on but johnson didnt care and ruined luke and his entire character the luke we left in roj was no where near the one we got here in roj he defeated the emperor by turning the most evil sith in the galaxy to the light he was a hero hopeful a leader and a warrior but in tlj we got mopey woe is me get off my lawn i came to this island to die luke subverting expectations is not how you make a good star wars movie maybe an independent movie whos own world logic and science isnt already established character of luke was just the tip of the iceberg its impossible to introduce new characters in the 2nd part of a trilogy and to expect the audience to accept them if the character arc of poe is a great hero fighter pilot who helped lead the destruction of death star 3 why is he now only the minimum wage employee who only gets told things on a need to know basis also if rey and finn are best friends in tfa why are they separated in tlj did we need mary leia poppins scene and im pretty sure the whole killing snoke and making rey a nobody were again just attempts to subvert expectations and making a star wars movie that no one has seen before but for me i never wanted to watch again 
Sep 20 2019,negative,true fans of star wars will be let down by this one casual fans will be disappointed theres no other way to describe it but to say this is not a star wars film
Sep 19 2019,negative,this movie undermines forty years of mythology known characters behave in an inconsistent manner to their previously established personality all of the newly introduced characters are twodimensional at best heroes and villains alike which makes it impossible to feel anything when they get killed off a short while later
Sep 19 2019,negative,the movie that killed everything star wars builded up
Sep 19 2019,positive,dont listen to the butt hurt fanboys your not fooling anybody we know you still went to see it and bought the blu ray lol
Sep 19 2019,negative,this movie destroyed inuniverse mechanics at the top hyper ram and force ghost who can interfere with the real world disney threw away beloved characters because they wanted to install new ones     in general disney made the sw franchise unwatchable at least for me i dont care about ix or anything thereafter 
Sep 19 2019,negative,this is rotten no starwars vibe at all the killing of all original starwars characters that made the original trilogy interesting like akbar and luke has reduced the interest into the whole new franchise for me  the script was dirt the new characters are dirt the socalled comedy is dirt heck it makes me think disney has gone to dirt to allow a pathetic pointless script that makes the first movie irrelevant go to film  delete these two films from the starwars universe they are the rot of the franchise the stories in the bioware game starwars the old republic hold more canon than this tripe 
Sep 19 2019,negative,the movie is trash and destroyed an iconic character  there is clearly no plan going forward  
Sep 18 2019,negative,we dont hate the people behind the characters we hate the characters the characters of the sequel trilogy are so incredibly bad they have just about no arc a lot of them are just here to fill a diversity quota which would be fine if the characters were meaningful to the story i dont dislike rey because shes a female i dislike rey because the universe up and gives her everything from flying skills fighting skills force skills even though she thought it was a myth in tfa everyone loves her everyone who doesnt love her is evil everyone trusts her everyone who doesnt trust her is evil you get the point these are all mary sue characteristics this is the opposite of what we want in science fiction we want failure we want training no one picks up a blaster for the first time and hits every shot although she does not its an example no one who has never been on the ship the millennium falcon can pilot it and fix it better than its owner no one hits 3 tie fighters in their first shot ever in the gunship of the millennium falcon no one can use the force to the potential she does without training no one should be able to beat a fully trained dark side lightsaber duelist with no training theres too many flaws in here character to list dont even get me started on rose and phasma dont get me started on why no one has ever used light speed as a weapon before holdo dont get me started on why there were hundreds of storm troopers in one shot and in the next theyre all on the other side of the room dont get me started on why light sabers only cause flesh wounds and please dont get me started on rian johnson and kathleen kennedy and their love for shoving their agendas and opinions down our throat in a universe we loved leave that to movies that dont have an already existing canon the force is not female the force is not male the force is an energy field that runs through and binds all living things it did not discriminate until you started to tell us this the force is female stuff you are the cause of this discrimination disney all we wanted was for you to not ruin the characters we loved what did you do made luke a coward spacecowmilkdrinking idiot he went from seeing the light in vader after he murdered hundreds younglings and other jedi to seeing the dark in his own nephew and thought to kill him in his sleep why disney why did you think this would be what anyone thought luke would do youre damn right you subverted our expectations not in a good way im not going to write any more about this theres so many video essays on it i urge you to watch them yourself
Sep 18 2019,positive,this is the best installment of starwars since the empire atrikes back the cinematography music action scenes all steller its not perfect by a long shot but a much needed fresh voice for the franchise which i love dearly
Sep 18 2019,negative,i share many options with other people for instance canto bight was pointless and hypocritical too many corny marvellike jokes luke and auckbar were butchered and nobody except for marey sue rey cared that han died not at all excited for tros
Sep 18 2019,negative,too many bad story moments to list
Sep 18 2019,positive,one of the top three star wars films rian johnson really did put his heart and soul into the project and that shines throu
Sep 18 2019,negative,brutal its one thing to accidentally make a bad movie but something this chronic could only be made by someone actively trying to make something harmful to the franchise the star wars christmas special was less damaging to canon ewok battle for endor was a better movie the over arching message is that starwars is stupid bullshit for nerds and youre stupid for liking it nerd
Sep 18 2019,negative,complete assignation of lukes character clear the way for the next generation by butchering the past
Sep 17 2019,negative,awful horrible abomination of everything that made star wars so great in a galaxy far far away
Sep 17 2019,negative,a mess completely derailed and crashed the whole franchise no understanding of what the original trilogy was all about myth and world building as well as character development and  archetypical concepts such as the heroes journey have been thrown out in favour of feminist propaganda and bad jokes
Sep 17 2019,neutral,was meh was hoping for more  sad the old characters are on the way out while the new ones theres not much attachment there
Sep 17 2019,negative,the worst movie plot of all time they relied on big budget effects to carry the movie and to fill the abundance of plot holes
Sep 17 2019,negative,terrible characters and story great special fx
Sep 17 2019,negative,spoilers  i personally found this weirdly misogynist and slightly racist and depressing  i didnt mind leias moment however i found the subtext that apparently all the female characters decisionmaking was flawed very disappointing  phasma an exciting new character falls down a hole holdo who proves you can be kickass and fabulous looking is an experienced and famous admiral famed for the battles she has won she then freezes under fire and watches hundreds of rebels die for no explainable reason i think rose was also a cool new addition but she was condemned by the script  and turning finn into some sort of weird slapstick buffoon to try and lighten the mood was not only ghastly for the character and the actor he was a great character now he is ludicrous     luke skywalker transforms from a youth wishing for adventure who turned into a knight who believed in his fathers humanity so utterly one of the evilest men in the galaxy turns against the machine of the empire and is redeemed its a great story star wars is a fairy story about humanity versus cold unfeeling science  in the last jedi he becomes a disgruntled hermit that gave up on his own story his belief in humanity because rian johnson thought that would be cool while critics feel this is exciting and new it is actually depressing johnson sacrifices the humanity of star wars for the machine of cinema the irony     also it was a fourpart act in a threeact story there were several elements which were extraneous and pointless it became boring      star wars is a combination of classic fantasy in an exciting science fiction setting  its wizards knights princesses and monsters with lasers and spaceships and alien worlds its a modern fairy tale for everybody exulting in humanity overcoming evil its meant to be exciting and fun  i walked into this film excited and optimistic and walked out depressed johnson sacrificed the mythology of the films we loved to feed his own ego
Sep 17 2019,negative,the storyline of this poorly written movie selfishly disrupted the entire trajectory of the sequel trilogy all viewers should be bummed by how they chose to tell this story wasting years of built up excitement luke skywalker was totally thrown under the bus and i have taken great offense to this choice     you just dont change a core character like this and you certainly do not scold fans for not liking the direction this is clearly the result of a rushed job with no accountability at all coming down from the top this movie had so much anticipation and it frankly wasted all of the potentials the fact that phasma dies so easily and the lack of character development leaves me wanting for me maybe in another dimension this movie works but in this one it fails     i think the big takeaway is when a director comes in and literally throws away all recommendations on how to make a sequel to one of the most anticipated movies of modern cinema history you dont let them go off the rails i believe there are more qualified directors out there that can work within the star wars universe the studios are a good ole boys club and talent is being overlooked     why was rian johnson given another opportunity to make another trilogy this is pure privilege and im upset disney havent given this opportunity to a director more deserving with all this talk of diversity it would be nice to see disney actually walk the walk and explore granting other directors the opportunity how about taika waititi or peter ramsey ryan coogler ava duvernay barry moore jenkins antoine fuquasteve mcqueen alejandro gonzález iñárritu alfonso cuarón orozco    whiteness has protected him and made him edgier even going as far to insult the fan base hollywood proves itself once again as the good ole boys club and its painful to see great cultures like star wars being destroyed this has set back the franchise generations the youth dont love star wars like youth of past 
Sep 17 2019,positive,amazing finally something new for the saga
Sep 17 2019,negative,a disappointment to star wars fans the amount of twists and redundancies even character break in this film make you appreciate the prequels this shows the capability of disney when it comes to writing films much so keeping their legacy
Sep 16 2019,negative,trash movie made very little sense and was such a deviation from other star wars movie i could not reconcile it
Sep 16 2019,negative,salt salt  what kind of rubbish line is that this is not star wars  no hope for this franchise disney has screwed up this opportunity
Sep 16 2019,negative,i could rant about this movie for maybe a month str8 there is so much wrong w it long story short its mega bad  dont watch unless you wish to be excommunicated from good cinema for almost 3 hrs
Sep 16 2019,negative,didnt think anything would make me hate star wars but this movie did it
Sep 16 2019,negative,utter garbage the only star wars movie i have ever only watched once there was no plot there was no point   just wow this may as well be a tommy wiseau flick
Sep 16 2019,negative,original idea but ugly ejecution 
Sep 16 2019,negative,this is the most disrespectful  careless star wars film ever made rian johnson took a crap all over everything that luke skywalker has represented for decades there was no continuity between this  the force awakens they explained nothing about the proragonist or antagonist we learn nothing from this movie its all political agenda  feminist propoganda looked okay visually thats the only positive
Sep 15 2019,negative,such a terrible film last star wars film i ever see because they really cant turn this story around to be good its bland luke skywalker was supposed to be the greatest and the writter just shit all over his character 
Sep 15 2019,positive,flawed but still good
Sep 15 2019,positive,fantastic star wars movie made me feel like a kid again it excelled where the force awakens failed completely changed things up and was an absolute blast along the way
Sep 15 2019,negative,the movie hat so many plot holes  the arrogance of rian johnson is also very provoking and makes this movie feel like a punch in the face of every old star wars fan  wouldnt recommend watching any further after episode 6
Sep 15 2019,negative,this movie just kill an era give me my money back
Sep 15 2019,negative,this movie destroyed the franchise with its woke bs
Sep 15 2019,negative,although my review will probably be dropped  its how i felt  it ran plots lines that did not need to be there that added nothing to the story save the domesticated animals it introduced single shot characters to make a statement based on an agenda holdo  it broke coherent story building and world building  did not like their treatment of luke  ray is still super powerful with no personal challenges to overcome or grow as a character  ended star wars for me my kids lost interest after they grew to love the original and they even liked the prequels i accept their opinion  maybe because they are kids they liked them lolalthough at least they were star wars movies i cant believe rian johnson had any love for star wars and if he was not supported so strongly by kathleen kennedy and disney he would still be the big budget director still promised another star wars trilogy 
Sep 15 2019,negative,loved the force awakens this one was just horrible 
Sep 15 2019,negative,would give it a half star but it would not count whoever allowed this movie to be made needs to be fired luke is dead to me 
Sep 15 2019,negative,the worst starwars movie this movie kill the all saga
Sep 14 2019,negative,while the cinematography was amazing and some interesting scenes were sprinkled in this movie tries too hard to subvert expectations and rips apart previous star wars canon in the process while the overall film is mediocre this is simply not good in the context of the star wars franchise
Sep 14 2019,positive,really great storytelling with unexpected plot twists  sometimes an emotional rollercoast  
Sep 14 2019,negative,e for effort thats all ill say  not at all interested in ix after these last two travesties  disney really screwed the pooch on star wars  i wish george lucas would buy it back at this point  
Sep 14 2019,positive,i really dont understand where all the negative reviews come from with this film sure its not the best star wars film but its not a bad one either so the truth of rays parentage and snokes identity didnt play out in the way anyone guessed it would but thats no reason to hate the film it is a great film the only let downs are that canto bight scene and the ending is a lot less hopeful than any other star wars film  the acting is  good the story was good but sadly dark and the fight scenes were excellent 
Sep 14 2019,negative,despite looking good on screen and doing well as a movie on its own rian johnson often forgets the movie he is directing and writing is a star wars movie and in subverting audience expectations derails entire characters and personalities and commits the greatest flaw a sequel or interquel can ever commit  not advancing the plot thats the main problem really admittedly as a single film it is nice but as the star wars film and as a followup and a bridge to the upcoming rise of skywalker it fails at its job on a mindblowing level
Sep 14 2019,negative,the last jedi was complete garbage  terribly written and abysmal storytelling that even rey couldnt save
Sep 14 2019,negative,its as if whoever wrote the last jedi didnt even bother to watch  force awakens or any star wars movie that came before it very disappointing  
Sep 13 2019,negative,having watched the force awakens when it was released and i recommended it that film showed that there could be life after the prequels  it was something of a reboot now comes the last jedi    the extraordinary thing that this socalled star wars movie manages to achieve is to soil putting politely on the original movies and make irrelevant anything that the force awakens was trying to set up the character assassination of luke skywalker was by far the biggest letdown however into the mix are the most appalling character and story choices ever to be witnessed in star wars gone are intelligence romance and intrigue replaced by dumb pointless generals stupid meaningless subplots and extremely nonlikeable characters he even gets the new sequel characters wrong rey loses all sense of purpose and why shes central to it all poe becomes some guy to be fodder to admiral holdo laura dern a  talented actress but wasted in this role while falling flat on the roguelikecharm stakes leia becomes mary poppins supergirl and finn stays the same as before     director rian johnson so rightly gets flak from hardcore fans who actually spend money on merchandise books and toys and like me carried on interest after return of the jedi in 83 to the 90s when the resurgence of interest started again with the special editions a case in point was admiral akbar is a very much loved fanfavourite alien character from rotj but the sheer lack of understanding from rian allows him to be dispatched so quickly and offscreen rian says he is a fan but thats not right fandom is about little details as much as the big     the ever dull kylo ren at one point says something along the lines of let the past die obviously referring to fans to let the original films and characters go however what exactly is rian johnson and the production team at lucasfilm are trying to replace it with well heres what we get rose tico  who cares about this character luke drinking from a space cows udder leia surviving the vacuum of space gender politics canto bight and animal rights free the space lamas but not the slave children shirtless onetone kylo dj  who is this guy capt phasma now you see her now you dont coldbloodied killer and later cowardly luke skywalker the list goes on johnson has gone on record to say that he subverts expectations but surely it has to be done for a reason the empire strikes back subverted many expectations without sacrificing wellwritten characters and logical good storytelling    to me the last jedi killed the disney star wars films and it is little wonder that star wars fans like me turned away from solo a few months after tljs release by far the biggest turn off was the treatment of luke and it is a small wonder that the latest film is called the rise of skywalker which hints at some kind of call for disney to try to redeem itself  it is a testament that while the phantom menace was not widely popular but at least spawned arguably better sequels and did not sully the original movies the last jedi to me personally has had a more negative lasting effect and has actually exposed some of the limitations of the franchise as a whole i clearly remember sitting in the cinema bewildered at first and then bored for me this film has not generated any anticipation to watch the next episode it is in fact the worst film of the entire saga     
Sep 13 2019,negative,broke the franchise completely given up on it disney at this point my disappointment could not be overstated its honestly confusing how they could miss the mark so heavily given the endless depth of source material to draw from its almost depressing to think how hard everyone must have worked on this film to have the director fail them so completely
Sep 13 2019,negative,completely ruined star wars for me
Sep 13 2019,negative,one of the worst star wars movie out there which completely destroyed lukes character even the actor himself was disappointed of these weird changes 
Sep 13 2019,negative,garbage worst film in the franchise 
Sep 13 2019,negative,not a good sequel for a trilogy didnt answer any question from ep 7 and waste lukes character
Sep 13 2019,negative,ive gotten 5 watches of the movie and all its done is make me hate the movie that much more and really be absolutely disgusted with rian johnson he took what could have been a great story outline and selfishly ruined it attack of the clones is a better watch then this nonsense
Sep 13 2019,neutral,not a star wars film 
Sep 13 2019,negative,not even sure where to start with this insipid flick which is reminiscent of teenage fanfic while i was excited to see a new story and a new direction for star wars this wasnt it while the visuals were superb the story was atrocious acting lackluster plot was horrendous and honestly it was terrible allaround the force awakens set up something that could have been a good story but now i doubt ill see any of the coming slew of these it was that bad
Sep 13 2019,negative,visually stunning and poorly written 
Sep 13 2019,negative,still smelling the smell left by this pile of dung
Sep 12 2019,negative,star wars you ruined my childhoodof all of the possible directions this franchise couldve gone this was the absolute worst possibility ooof
Sep 12 2019,negative,this is probably the most well planned disaster of a movie of all time
Sep 12 2019,positive,if you are not a fan of the original star wars trilogyor if you ignore the plot holes its a very entertaining movie
Sep 12 2019,negative,it was too focused on political nonsense and not enough on the story itself  i have been a huge fan of star wars my whole life but these last two movies are garbage  dont waste your time  
Sep 12 2019,negative,what did you do to luke skywalker you made him a grumpy old looser who gave up nothing like the luke skywalker of the original trilogy
Sep 12 2019,negative,poor movie shoudnt be caled star wars
Sep 12 2019,negative,terrible stupid plot points that had no reason being in the move 
Sep 12 2019,negative,nonsense it messed up space batlles and has too many plot holes the worst of them all
Sep 12 2019,negative,i would give it 0 if i could the plot made no sense the characters are dumb and anything from the originals is completely negated and made irrelevant the dumbest character has to be rose rose destroys a scene tat may have actually been a good scene by intercepting finn as he is about to sacrifice himself to save the rebellion instead she crashes into him risking both their lives and says thats how will win by saving what we love not destroying what we hate meanwhile the empire because thats what it is lets be real fires its death canon at the rebel base
Sep 12 2019,neutral,didnt develop any of the characters again many of them seem to gain knowledgeskills such as lightsaber duelling with no actual instruction on how to do so     the story changes the traits of characters especially characters such as luke skywalker who is suddenly the least hopeful most pessimistic person in the galaxy without any real backstory for it    the main character is basically perfect in every way which is just ridiculous doesnt struggle with anything just miraculously can overcome anything    watch the movie by all means there are some nostalgic moments in the movie and but its just not consistent with everything that came before
Sep 12 2019,negative,great stand alone scifi film terribly star wars story that disregarded the legacy built by the previous 7 films in the saga if you are true star wars fan that has been deeply invested in the lore you will likely find aspects of this film insulting there too many issues to list especially the treatment of legacy characters like leah and luke skywalker i encourage  you to look for unbiased negative reviews from others here and on youtube to find out what the issues are
Sep 12 2019,positive,its really too bad so many people didnt like this movie i hope it will age well like the prequels have my favorite star wars movie since revenge of the sith 
Sep 12 2019,negative,i really wanted to like this movie but i just cant there are some serious pacing issues here the casino sequence is absolutely pointless and the humor just isnt well very star wars like it seems like finn and poe were wasted and poor rose i cant tell what her purpose was aside for a love interest for finn as much as i love laura dern i dont see what holdo did here that admiral akbar or ever leia herself couldnt have done  i can forgive all of that but lukes character arc is the one thing i just cant accept when he said did you think i would walk out and face down the first order with a laser sword well yes episode 7 had us all set up for a kick ass luke skywalker in this movie we were ready to see him ignite the green do what the greatest jedi in the history of the galaxy does it is what i and so many kids have waited over 30 years for what we got was not the luke skywalker that brought his father back from the dark side i walked out of this movie feeling like i was punched in the gut and left tossed over by the franchise that gave me such joy wonder and hope rian johnson made a visually stunning film but i would have preferred someone like claudia grey or dave filoni to have penned the script in summary i dont think ive ever looked more forward to a movie that left me feeling so empty and disappointed i can only hope for something better from rise of skywalker   
Sep 12 2019,negative,we dont get to know who snoke was lukes role was disrespectful and pointless fin and rose bullcrap was forced and useless as a star wars fan this was a slap to the face 
Sep 11 2019,positive,very interesting sw film in that there are some great things about it and some terrible things about it   great  kylo ren becomes a fully formed charactereasily the most interesting character in the new trilogy   great  the pacing  it doesnt drag like the prequels   great production quality and soundtrack  par for a sw film  good mostly likable characters  even rose isnt so bad once you take her youth into account   terrible woke moralizing delivered subtly as well as over your head with a bat   this movie is definitely a product of its time   the weird treatment of poe dameron leaves a bad taste  terrible  screwed up luke skywalker  in fact rian johnson is a bad at generating sympathy for his heroes as he is as good at developing kylo ren   terrible    everything about tj an overly cynical and slimy character who doesnt fit into the star wars universe  overall i think its better than the force awakens and all the prequels but i realize that its not everyones cup of tea  
Sep 11 2019,negative,i made the mistake of watching this film 3 times before coming to terms with the fact that this film did not work half the movie is very boring and the climax and ending do a very little to bring any life to the film the one action scene in the film yes the one action scene in the movie is underwhelming and poorly choreographed there are very forced and uninspired plot points that do not say anything new about our new characters if i could rename this film i would call it star wars running out of fuel because that is really what the whole movie is a bout
Sep 11 2019,negative,so many plot holes luke acted nothing like who he has been his whole life and through all of the other movies the sheer number of holes illogical things etc is too many to list i disliked this so much even after trying to like it because it was star wars that i had to rate it something i never care to do
Sep 11 2019,negative,terrible movie that ruined star wars
Sep 11 2019,negative,it wasnt a star wars film 
Sep 11 2019,negative,after watching it twice i still think that its just a horrible addition to the sw universe and as far a movies goes it has some of the laziest humor on par to mr bean not to mention the unnecessary plots the killing off of supposedly major characters without further explanation and to kill the hero of the universe in such a stupid and lazy manner it would have been better if kylo had actually dueled him and won at least it has cured me of my sw obsession so thats something
Sep 11 2019,negative,i literally cant sit through this movie its absolute trash little to no continuity with anything episode 7 attempted to set up with laughable dialogue ridiculous writing and story arcs that turn the characters we are supposed to enjoy into a joke worst star wars movie ever made period and any true star wars fan would realize this 
Sep 11 2019,negative,the force awakens did a decent job of setting things up and creating excitement for the next installments this was a complete disaster and paid nothing off congratulations you subverted my expectations of viewing a good movie well done
Sep 11 2019,negative,beautiful cinematography and excellent acting are completely overshadowed by nonsensical plot points and characterization that doesnt fit with the rest of the saga     a great sequel makes the films before it even better the last jedi somehow makes the film before it worse while spitting in the face of the original trilogy and its characters in the process
Sep 11 2019,positive,this could of been great
Sep 11 2019,negative,this is not star wars
Sep 10 2019,negative,the movie had stunning visuals thats the star and a half that i feel it properly deserves in terms of storytelling it falls completely flat as if it was written by someone without an appreciation of the series as a whole the way they handled the main characters luke and leia felt straight up weird disrespectful luke milking some alien cow and out of touch and the relationshipsstories of the side characters finn kylo rey werent developed enough to be intriguing or convey the depth the story deserved     the casino scene and rationale for it were unfounded the purple haired lady seemed completely out of place using light speed to destroy the ships was clever but it cancels any future battles in space or star wars if you will after she did that in the sw universe there is no longer any reason to not put an android on a tie fighter or xwing and cause mass destruction via kamikaze attacks snoke turned out to be a chump and super easy to kill rose almost killing finn to stop him from saving the rebellion made no sense at all prank calls with your mama jokes exist in a galaxy far far away the list goes on and on    i genuinely enjoyed the force awakens rogue one and the solo movie but the last jedi is just a mess 155
Sep 10 2019,negative,horribly written and directed this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen disney had an amazing opportunity and squandered it badly 
Sep 10 2019,negative,terrible treatment of luke skywalker bad pacing bad undertstanding of how the star wars lore and canon work in previously made movies such as but not limited to the mary sue character rey no training no failing no character growth crapped on other characters such as poe and ackbar to fuel a story that didnt make sense im glad the fan base has eu novels and comics because they need to do alot of work to save the franchise with tros
Sep 10 2019,negative,the only thing of value in this movie is the stunning visuals  the writing was terrible and made the characters appear stupid at best 
Sep 10 2019,negative,it looks good but makes little sence
Sep 10 2019,negative,embarrassing they clearly sacrificed quality and the desire to make a good movie for subverting expectations and their agenda  i can do with or without all that nonsense in a movie all i care about is was the movie good or not and this one was a stinker made all the more so being that it had the star wars ip  a slam dunk and they schruted it
Sep 10 2019,negative,the film tlj has without a doubt great visuals and breathtaking settings however the story line and plot does not have a solid direction the film although 2 hours gives no answers and raises more questions the dialogue is lazy and the writing of tlj is a full on conundrum this film is disappointing mess and by far the worst of the star wars films 
Sep 10 2019,negative,star wars movies cannot be reviewed as stand alone movies they have to be reviewed within the context of the star wars universe this movie fails in both areas nonetheless     we dont need realism in science fiction but we at least need it to be believable in the context of its own universe one spoiler ill release because it happens very early in the movie and has little significant impact to the outcome    poe leads a strike force against the first order fleet as the odds turn against him leia orders him off numerous times she is the commander of the alliance or whatever the rebels are now called poe ignores her and orders the bombers to strike a first order dreadnought virtually every vehicle in the strike force is destroyed they do accidentally manage to destroy the dreadnought but at a huge cost in lives and machinery     instead of having poe arrested he is simply demoted in any military force in our known world poe would have been locked up and court marshaled in time of war he would have been sentenced to death not in star wars though for some reason leia even goes on to say later in the film that she really likes poe even though he sent dozens of people to their death against her orders only a few hours before    there are countless bizarre events that occur in the movie a pointless mission to another planet a revenge battle between two characters whom we dont really care much about the sad tragic death of a character we only met about thirty minutes before and have no emotional attachment to the death of someone we assumed would be a huge major character but whom we really still have no idea who he is a new major leader of the rebels whom we never met before and will never see again a secret that is kept from mutineers that didnt need to be a secret except i guess it added to the running time people using force powers that were created only for the plot of this movie     the only redeeming quality in this movie is the interaction between rey and kylo if the movie had focused most of its time on these two then it may have worked as it turned out their relationship was more of a sidequest in the overall story     when i first saw the movie i thought it was great yet i got home and thought about it and kept saying how this didnt make sense and that didnt make sense and what was the point of this or that    watch it for free if you can just dont expect much
Sep 10 2019,negative,when the highlight of the movie is the popcorn
Sep 10 2019,negative,the single worst cash grab film in history plot was empty writing was bad characters were unbelievable acting was awful effects were nowhere near the standard of the time
Sep 10 2019,negative,worst star wars ever if you dont want to care about the characters on the screen if you dont care if the plot makes sense if you dont care what happens in a movie if you need background noise while your doing your chores then maybe this one is for you
Sep 10 2019,neutral,gets 25 stars for the amazing cinematography and because carrie fisher turned in a great performance while on screen other than thatruined luke his death was underwhelming and out of nowhere rey love her but zero character development and still strong for no reason poe is actually good in this movie finn is no longer interesting as a stormtrooper turned good hes just a joke 3po was good but needs more screen time r2 has been forgotten by this trilogy and its a crime kylo saying he didnt hate his father in this movie is ridiculous of course he did snokedont get me started
Sep 10 2019,negative,horrible please bring back people that have ideas and can write please 
Sep 10 2019,negative,they could have done so much but it is just an incomprehensible pile of crp rian johnson intentionally added plot twists and surprises but they were nonsensical he could have added a firebreathing unicorn to save the galaxy and it would not have been out of place previous character development was completely ignored and none acted in any kind of logical or believable way this movie was not a disappointment it has destroyed the franchise
Sep 10 2019,negative,garbage film very little plot did nothing to build off of the force awakens made no sense in the greater context of the star wars story 
Sep 10 2019,negative,great visuals and amazing sounddesign but the story couldnt be more off and a director who should have let someone else do the story pacing is off as well jokes dont work plotholes everywhere  great visuals cant redeem a horrible screenplay might have brought the star wars saga to an absolute down
Sep 9 2019,negative,i am surprised that the movie managed to be this baaaaad 
Sep 9 2019,positive,id an absolute blast watching this although im amazed considering luke skywalker got a punk sendoff a purple haired nobody got all of lia organasolos lines and rose chickentikka stealing all of finns story    despite all this i loved it 
Sep 9 2019,negative,only fun for the first time but still is boring and it is so bad
Sep 9 2019,negative,this movie has been the battleground for all star wars fans alike some people hate it while others love it in terms of reasoning this movie offers up points for both sides to make clear and coherent arguments however in my opinion neither are right after leaving this movie for the first time i couldnt help but feel empty inside i decided to watch it again only to come out feeling the exact same it leads me to believe that this movie was exactly that empty characters do things that they wouldnt normally do plotpoints introduced in the film before this are thrown in the garbage and the entire plot has as much flow as a traffic jam its boring and long not introducing anything to keep the viewers attention in the very least the only storyline that i believe was done the best was reys even though i though lukes character was torched and replaced by an entirely different character rey seemed to have the most interesting plot development every other side story however was boring drawn out and leaves you questioning why the writer chose to do certain things over more interesting alternatives i cant say i hate this movie but i didnt enjoy it either i give it a meh 
Sep 9 2019,negative,pure trash disrespectfull to sw fans disney should be ashamed of themselves
Sep 9 2019,negative,full of flaws subversions for the sake of subversion without having any meaning behind them about 30min of the story could be cut without affecting the story throws away everything that was built up in force awakens the main character rey is bland if blowing 5 planets does not wake republic from slumber i dont know what does how can first order reign supreme by destroying 5 planets and by losing their big gun isnt the galaxy supposed to contain more planets as shown in prequels this movie is a hot mess and potentially might have killed the franchise
Sep 9 2019,negative,i hate this movie i hate this movie so much
Sep 9 2019,negative,my friends and i walked in beyond excited some 501st members were in the theater and the hype was real we walked out without anything to say most others that werent part of our party walked out quietly eventually one of us awkwardly asked whatd you think to which none of us had an answer we didnt know at the time it was because we all went in so excited and walked out deeply disappointed but didnt want to talk down and ruin it if the others liked it    the plot is nonsensical and all over the place it adds new rules to the canon that ruin the old canon it changes the personality of previous characters and previous relationships for the sake of shock without substance behind the change its just not a good movie
Sep 9 2019,positive,i like this move a lot the direction and cinematography is awesome i like that they introduce new worlds as i felt the tfa gave me so little to be excited about regarding new planets and settings     that said the stuff with the force and lukes arch that people find so upsetting im sorry these are themes that have been being set through the clone wars series to rebels and really the idea that luke feels the jedi might be the problem in the universe is completely justified he choses to die fighting kylo ren in the way that he does because it alway him to break the cycle of violence that has held his life and his family hostage i know its not satisfying to not see the space wizard bonk the space baddie on the head at the end but thats been done 1000s of times and maybe we can grow up a little and say the space wizards werent that great anyway a franchise thats willing to say that about itself is pretty refreshing
Sep 9 2019,negative,rotten near on destroyed what started as an interesting trilogy went against rules of the others concentrated on political correctness left a mess for abrams to clean up fingers crossed 
Sep 9 2019,negative,not a star wars movie not even close
Sep 9 2019,positive,a great addition to the ongoing star wars saga while this movie leaves various questions unanswered but i dont think this movie breaks the characters from both the original and new trilogies the huge action setpieces are so fun a good and heartfelt star wars sequel
Sep 9 2019,negative,nothing makes sense
Sep 9 2019,negative,rian johnsons masterpiece train wreck the star wars franchise may be going downhill from here 
Sep 9 2019,negative,cant say anything that hasnt already been said about this movie it killed my love for star wars completely the only thing im looking forward too with star wars today is to see them fail miserably the dark side has won
Sep 9 2019,negative,as an independent movie it wouldnt have been that bad but as part the star wars universe the thing is like a blasphemy if you want to deconstruct iconic characters at least do it right in all fairness mark hamill warned us 
Sep 9 2019,negative,after trying to watch this movie a second time in readiness for ep9 i couldnt sit through it again what a terribly written directed and edited production it makes no sense with time lines plot holes and quips it goes to show that money alone cant buy creativity continuity and story progression
Sep 9 2019,negative,the effects are great the actors are good the lukerey scenes were wonderfully engrossing the writingwas not i enjoyed myself while i was in the theater watching it but as soon as i walked out and my brain engaged most of that enjoyment melted away like ice on a summer sidewalk everything i enjoyed was a sudden twist or unexpected event that makes no sense when i think about it no rewatch appeal
Sep 8 2019,negative,one of the worst star wars films made
Sep 8 2019,negative,what did i just watch  plot holes after plot hole it is not a star wars film but some weird attempt if a funny space movie with romance and social justice nonsense  it is absolutely awful wtf like    now i understand the anger
Sep 8 2019,negative,johnson hoped to admire us by stripping us from epic moments in this movie the result a numb story boring and shallow lucasfilm killed the new trilogy with this episode cant believe it has 91 of the critics score better than joker unbelievable dont watch it try to close your eyes and forget what theyve done run fan run a dont look back
Sep 8 2019,negative,the worst movie ive ever seen
Sep 8 2019,negative,absolutely the worst movie star wars movie hands down disney star wars is not canon
Sep 8 2019,negative,ill never stop thinking that jj abrams should have directed this movie wtf did rian johnson do why did he try to let the past die if in the end everything occurred as every other star wars movie i think it would have been great if rey turned to the dark side side with kylo ren that would have been mindblowing but it didnt happen rey went to the light because you know she is a jedi and thats what jedi do its so stupid trying to do something but dont do it completely why the fk didnt we see who snoke was i feel like rian didnt watch the force awakens he went and did what he wanted without caring about anything that happened before i think this movie beats some of the precuels just because it has some good special effects and a great cast those are the things that save it from being a total disaster why the hell would you put the fuel as an important problem of the story why i hate this movie so much i hate it because it could have been waaaaay better if jj could have continued what he started looking back at tlj in 2021 i couldnt agree more whith what i wrote everyone hates ros but what that movie did wrong was because it tried to correct the awful things tlj did rian is the one to blame for the problems that the sequel trilogy had
Sep 8 2019,negative,beautifully shot and colored but cant make up for terrible or nonexistent character arcs convoluted subplots nonsensical character decisions and failure to deliver on ideas set up in force awakens 
Sep 8 2019,negative,well enough constructed as a film and overall enjoyable but when put in the context of star wars and its mythos it fails horribly on many levels
Sep 8 2019,negative,ill never stop thinking that jj abram should have directed this movie wtf did ryan johnson do why did he try to let the past die if at the end everything occurred as every other star wars movie i think it would have been great if rey turned to the dark side side with kylo ren that would have been mindblowing but it didnt happen rey went to the light because you know she is a jedi and thats what jedi do its so stupid trying to do something but dont do it completely  why the fk didnt we see who snoke was i feel like ryan didnt watch the force awakens he went and did what he wanted without caring about anything that happened before  i think this movie beats some of the precuels just because it has some good special effects and a great cast those are the things that save it from being a total disaster  why the hell would you put the fuel as an important problem of the story why  i hate this movie so much i hate it because it could have been waaaaay better if someone else directed it ehem jj ehem
Sep 8 2019,negative,they should known from the beginning what was happening to the story very bad writing i admit attack of the clones was really bad but this this is so cringe to watch it again really bad movie  
Sep 8 2019,positive,im sure the last jedi did right by my childhood or whatever but thats not very important whats more important is that it did right by my current and more informed standards and it continues to improve every time i see it kids watch the same lowquality cartoons over and over again with no discretion so i trust current me more than child me in terms of whats good because child me would have loved it regardless this movie really got what i love about star wars
Sep 8 2019,negative,subversion a good plot the prior will never solve the latters issues
Sep 8 2019,negative,awful film  the makers of these new star wars films need to bring back george lucas  
Sep 8 2019,negative,i liked the fight scene in the throne room and thats about it it makes everyone in the movie completely incompetent bad dialogue and writing in general makes the first two movies in the franchise irrelevant and completely changes fundamental laws of the star wars universe in a way that nothing makes sense now 
Sep 8 2019,negative,worst star wars film ive ever seen even more than clone wars and i had previously thought that impossible i cant wait till they let star wars stay dead instead of flogging it like a dead horse 
Sep 7 2019,negative,just terrible  no point to the movie no plot moving forward everything form the first movie doesnt matter
Sep 7 2019,negative,the pacing was terrible there were too many plots happening at once and the fight coreography was god aweful when compared to even the prequels    the few good things i could say about it are cancelled out by the unfaithfulness and unnaturalness of the writers to the characters
Sep 7 2019,negative,poor luke  they fucked this one up badly
Sep 7 2019,negative,easily the worst in the star wars saga an abomination of a movie on every level
Sep 7 2019,negative,this fanfic not only ruined itself the other two movies in its trilogy one yet to release but the originals that allowed it to even come into existence i speculate it hurt solos sales as well    ryan johnson claimed to be a star wars fan since childhood and in doing so he sent the fans into a civil war johnson planted himself in the history books with this just in what is possibly the worst film to have ever hit the big screen to date
Sep 7 2019,negative,this movie made me uncomfortable throughout i have since tried to watch again with the best of intentions and still find it to be unwatchable 
Sep 7 2019,positive,not the best far from the worst but definitely the most misunderstood film of the saga 
Sep 7 2019,positive,one of the best star wars movies
Sep 7 2019,negative,the lack of originality between this and empire strikes back kills this movie
Sep 7 2019,neutral,with pointless subplots discontinuation of established threads and disappointing characterization this may be the weakest entry into the entire saga
Sep 7 2019,negative,worst movie in franchise
Sep 7 2019,negative,wow what a film disaster which caused its director ryan johnson to the franchise that has marked more than a generation my recommendation is not to see
Sep 7 2019,negative,terrible awful plot and story star wars is ruined
Sep 7 2019,positive,25 stars lots of elements i liked but a lot of it missed the mark   the dated marvelesque humor felt out of placed and forced the first 15 minutes of the film dont feel like a star wars movie at all 
Sep 6 2019,negative,that was rough to watch  gonna pass on the next one
Sep 6 2019,positive,reylo mostly a good movie and those reylo scenes were great 
Sep 6 2019,negative,unfortunately this is the worst movie in the entire franchise jj set up a number of interesting  and exciting questions in episode vii and johnson answered them in the most uninspired and disappointing way possible that makes you think he either hates star wars doesnt understand it or simply doesnt give a damn he ruins the character of luke skywalker and mark hamill is too much of a gentleman to come out and say that directly but if you hear his interviews he sure as hell believes it to be the case lets hope the johnson trilogy never sees the light of day
Sep 6 2019,negative,boring characters are uninteresting ive had more fun staring at clocks waiting for a lecture to end too much identity politics
Sep 6 2019,negative,rey and kylos interaction was the best part of the film and actually something i could see more of    then you have  finn calling his twicebeaten nemesis chromedome  rose saying now its worth it after freeing rabbithorses in a inconsequential subplot that calls rich people bad   luke drinking green dragonhumanoid sixbreastedmilk  slow bombers that dropped gravity bombs in space  momma jokes  princess leia surviving in space with no build up to it  laura derns lines go get them rebels  the line we are the spark that will ignite the fire that will beat the first order   rey already piloted the millenium falcon in the first movie and then pulling a will smithesque line i got to get me one o these    
Sep 6 2019,neutral,not the worst star wars movie but the last jedi is a far cry from the rest of the entire saga
Sep 6 2019,negative,wow this was not good
Sep 6 2019,negative,maybe it is not very bad movie maybe it is even quite good movie but it is horrible bad star wars movie and when i go to cinema to watch star wars movie i want star wars movie   even my 11yo son was bored and dont want to watch it again
Sep 6 2019,negative,pretty bad all around
Sep 6 2019,negative,doesnt know how to star wars
Sep 6 2019,negative,it was exciting in the theater but as soon as i walked out i started noticing everything wrong with it the last jedi is the only star wars movie i dont own on dvd for the simple fact that i have no desire to watch it again that alone means that it has failed every movies basic purpose to entertain ive lost count of how many times ive watched the original trilogy and the prequels the fact that i have no desire to rewatch tlj means it has not only failed as a movie but as a star wars movie i could continue beating the dead horse and explain everything wrong with the movie but chances are if youre of the same mindset i am youve already filled your youtube recommendations with videos that do just that rey is uninteresting  and a literal god that can do no wrong and has access to every force power imaginable sometimes making up new ones because hey shes a woman all with no training whatsoever meanwhile kylo ren was trained by luke skywalker himself for years and then trained my snoke who turns out to be nobody like reys parents and somehow he loses to the girl with no lightsaber or force training yeah this movie will subvert your expectations alright you were expecting a good movie but you got this instead
Sep 6 2019,negative,ruined my childhood i want my money and time back this doesnt deserve the star wars name  
Sep 6 2019,negative,rubbish only one thing i liked about the movie and nothing else made logical sense and no one cared when making it 
Sep 6 2019,negative,character development was very poor luke is a whiny weakling now and the amateur rey has sudden master level skills wheres the struggle also the unnecessary pc messages were very cringe this film ensured i will wait until the next one comes out on netflix 
Sep 6 2019,negative,if i could give this zero star i would disney has completely ruined star wars at leas tfa tried to keep the same feeling this just throws everything built in the star wars universe out the window 
Sep 6 2019,negative,an incoherent mess that undermines its characters and story at every turn 
Sep 6 2019,negative,i hate the fact that i have to even give this a half a star just to assert how atrocious this sorry excuse for a star wars film is flixster please allow option to add a review with zero stars 
Sep 5 2019,positive,loved it did not care much about the sjw parts though im a starwars fan im biased
Sep 5 2019,negative,ruined the franchise for me
Sep 5 2019,negative,what a terrible excuse of a star wars film
Sep 5 2019,negative,congratulations to rian johnson for managing to take a franchise with a prebuilt structure that works charismatic heroes in the universe young talents introduced into the universe powerful and intriguing villains and a plan the previous director outlined to help throwing said help away and then taking a big massive dump all over everything     you turned the most iconic hero of all time into an old fearful and rude person who basically disowns family and friends because reasons you screw up the mythos and manage to waste an entire movie on a plot and sub plot that make no sense write yourself into a corner and break more rules to get out instead of creating strong female characters you make strong willed idiots who cant coordinate with their crew or almost kill the one they just met but somehow love trying to save him and thus stopping him from a noble sacrifice to save everyone and show in the background the consequences of your stupid incoherent writing    you have a fancy lightsaber fight where the  bad guys are so confident with their abilities they throw their weapons away or you cg them away you kill said bad guy without giving any idea of his history and how the hell he is so strong i mean wow this movie is terrible it is absolutely terrible     you also waste an amazing actress fazma and uturn character progression for finn and poe because youre an egotistical idiot good bloody job jj didnt do a great job in the first one but you definitely won the award for the most disappointing movie of the century and even though we still have 81 years left i am confident you will win    dont watch this trash rip luke skywalker you will always be one of my heroes no matter how a script tries to destroy you
Sep 5 2019,negative,ive seen better plots on made for uhf tv movies the whole star wars franchise is dead to me because of this movie
Sep 5 2019,negative,such a bad movie i wouldnt know where to start how about the day disney started to add humanitarian and political views to the star wars saga it lost my vote
Sep 5 2019,negative,decent movie ending was silly luke skywalker wasnt luke skywalker totally different character they should have written in that he was possessed or had a brain injury would have made his behavior more believable 
Sep 5 2019,negative,easily the worst star wars movie likely the worst movie i saw all year
Sep 5 2019,negative,worse than the phantom menace
Sep 5 2019,negative,junk  well produced piece of fan fictionlevel storytelling

Sep 5 2019,negative,decent concept that needed another draft this movie proves how lucasfilm under disney doesnt know what its doing with star wars
Sep 5 2019,negative,absolutely awful insult to the franchise with boring uncompeling characters shoehorned in for god knows what reason a stagnant pile of garbage that should be forgotten 
Sep 5 2019,negative,genuinely the only movie i walked out of the theater disappointed with

Sep 5 2019,negative,they ruined star wars kathleen kenedy resign please 
Sep 5 2019,negative,this is not star wars this is a parody
Sep 5 2019,negative,terrible character assassination  of luke skywalker this was an ok space film but with 7 movies of baggage previous this movie missed the mark shameful lots of fake account on this site who can you trust
Sep 5 2019,negative,i thought the prequels were bad rip luke hot garbage will go down in history as the turning point where the star wars property was cursed to mediocrity for all time never again will disney get my money ill watch the original original blue harvest and robot chicken specials 
Sep 5 2019,negative,so upset to say this i love star wars i have for nearly 30 years i love everything in the extended universe every movie video game and bookincluding movies 17    this movie was garbage for so many reasons i can not express in this short review ryan and kathleen should be embarrassed 
Sep 5 2019,negative,love the universe hate this movie thus 15
Sep 5 2019,negative,this movie ruined star wars forever terrible pos
Sep 5 2019,negative,i saw it opening day and remember coming out of the theater with the other fans in a confused haze i wanted to love this movie so much but it could not have been that awful right  its star wars and i even liked the prequels so i must just be in shock  so i went to see it again and our was even worse i tried this 6 times and it is the only movie where it literally got worse with every viewing each one revealed a bigger plot hole than the previous viewing the story arc goes no where so much pointless banter attempts at humor and bad storytelling 2 scenes that were decent were throne room fight and i take it back that was it i have read all the articles forums and arguments trying to find a way to like this part of my favorite franchise and at the end of the day it is just a bad movie from every aspect poor dialogue bad character choices no plot development wasted characters etc etc etc really sad that disney has allowed this and rather than bite the bullet and admit mistakes they blame the fan base glad to see their stance has changed a little bit since the failure of this movie and solo but it doesnt say much considering they are still allowing rian johnson to direct a trilogy after this debacle and all the backlash that is just not smart business really sorry disney but you were given a choice to do or do not  and you did not make a movie worthy of being in the star wars saga
Sep 5 2019,negative,the storytelling is lacking horrible character development and a complete destruction of luke skywalker as a character  
Sep 4 2019,negative,1  12 stars for spfx so horribly written it was as though they threw every star wars movie into the garbage no character development no one to identify with other than kylo there were two plots  the skywalkerreykylo portion was tolerable and then there was the moronic slow speed space chase which diverted to some space horse racing thing and had so many holes and was painful god this movie was awful 
Sep 4 2019,negative,yikes pretty disappointing excuse for a star wars film terrible terrible writing
Sep 4 2019,negative,jesus disney really needs to tone down the politics the last jedi was a train wreck despite me trying the hardest to find stuff to appreciate it just for the sake of the sw lore couldnt do it 
Sep 4 2019,negative,ruined the og series
Sep 4 2019,negative,rian johnson did a horrible job and it should be erased from the universe 
Sep 4 2019,negative,spat in the face of what star wars couldveshouldve been so sad bravo disney hope youre rollin in it 
Sep 4 2019,negative,this movie was poorly written and executed terribly truly the worst star wars film and yes i am saying the prequels are better i didnt go see solo because of this movie and actually really enjoyed solo when it came out on netflix as the rlm guys said this should be called star wars the quest for gas dont waste your time 
Sep 4 2019,negative,the worst in the series pushes far outside of the canon and the plot homes are as big as the death star 
Sep 4 2019,negative,dance on a grave of original sw
Sep 4 2019,negative,if you ever wanted to watch a movie franchise sell every aspect of itself to a hipster director whos more interested in tearing apart everything that made the franchise great and push woke ideology then step right up i was extremely disappointed in all aspects of the movie beside the cinematography which was incredible just like venice beach this movie looks so cool from afar but far from good up close apparently also if i dont like this movie then disney is up the opinion that i am just a bigoted incel this movie is a perfect representation of our modern times and as such it is cancer to the franchise disney will keep telling itself that solo was the reason why star wars will flop the lack of introspection is astounding
Sep 4 2019,negative,everything that needs to be said has been said by others far better at saying it in summation this movie is a dumpster fire with no redeeming qualities 
Sep 4 2019,negative,completely breaks from anything remotely close to the saga until this point disjointed from even the previous movie honestly this felt more like someone making fun of star wars and its fans than being interested in adding to the decades spanning story    i had seen every single star wars film in the theatre on opening week up to this one it was and will be the last i spend money on 
Sep 4 2019,negative,horrible what happen to star wars 
Sep 4 2019,negative,this movie is a disgrace to the star wars franchise it has ruined the star wars legacy as well as my childhood
Sep 4 2019,negative,this installment ruined star wars visually good though
Sep 4 2019,negative,plot holes bad writing and choreography plague the movie i love the star wars universe but this movie doesnt even come close to the original trilogy  sequels
Sep 4 2019,negative,this is the worst movie of the star wars sagas to date  
Sep 4 2019,negative,our heros took a back seat to a purple hair character who no one knows half of the film was unnecessary luke was completely wasted and died from thinking too hard at least let the most powerful jedi die in a real fight
Sep 4 2019,neutral,the influence of disney multiple directors and sjws has really ruined the star wars saga this movie in particular was extremely disjointed and goes against all canon too many story lines non of which were very interesting put this in the same area as episodes 13 
Sep 4 2019,negative,absolute shite the film is completely forgettable first star wars film to incorporate a your mama joke into the script which is all i need to write
Sep 4 2019,negative,the movie itself is pretty bad there are no memorable battles even the prequels had some amazing battles and the character interactions seem forced as heck  the best line in the entire movie comes from a character they had to revive for only one scene and for nostalgia vibes    it is just plainly bad it makes no sense to the original story but i still recommend to watch it youll enjoy it if you watch it with a funny perspective because how bad it is
Sep 4 2019,negative,this movie is such a snoozefest it is a disgrace to what starwars is about this movie had a huge chance to deliver something epic and it failed miserably i worry for this movie franchise
Sep 4 2019,negative,nice visuals i guess but this managed to be even more confusing and riddled with plot holes than episode vii unlikeable new characters inconsistency with said new characters and a complete disregard for the spirit of the franchise
Sep 4 2019,negative,i have tried to like his movie  but it is so poor on almost every level  it does not work as a sequel to the previous movie it does not work as the 8th movie in a 9 movie series go figure the characters are boring the plot made no sense but the thing that will go down in history are the missed opportunities quite criminal given how loved stars wars has been  
Sep 4 2019,negative,if i could give zero stars i would
Sep 4 2019,negative,damaging to the franchise to say the least as a huge sw fan this is far below the standard of storytelling within the franchise that i have always held in high regard
Sep 4 2019,negative,extremely disrespectful to the fans and the source material a nonsensical movie designes to surprise and shock and nothing more  moreover every surprise is just a character saying something doesnt matter and the answers to mysteries are all it was nothing it was nobody
Sep 4 2019,negative,killed off star wars 
Sep 4 2019,negative,may the star wars franchise rest in peace zero characters deepness or logic storyline this is recurring since force wakens and got worse on this episode
Sep 4 2019,negative,utter trash in the world of a classic stop the politically correct bs and make us a good well written movie please  
Sep 4 2019,negative,why did they make this movie just terrible really really terrible
Sep 4 2019,negative,forget the fact its called star wars  this is such a failure as a second part in a trilogy that the only explanation is that it was intentionally meant to fail there are no open plot lines going into the third part of a trilogy and i still dont know what the stakes are for either side or even who the sides are to begin with 
Sep 4 2019,negative,feels like a fan fiction made by somebody thats not a fan good acting by the actors tho
Sep 4 2019,negative,nothing star wars about it 
Sep 4 2019,negative,garbage not true to the series 
Sep 4 2019,negative,diarrhea pure diarrhea

Sep 4 2019,negative,awful would not recommend
Sep 4 2019,negative,weak meandering plot male bashing steaming pile of shit movie
Sep 4 2019,negative,its already been said enough but fck this movie 
Sep 4 2019,positive,even if this movie has some defects its fantastic 
Sep 4 2019,negative,as a sw fan i was deeply disappointed with this movie rian johnson is horrible mark hamill deserved better than this crap
Sep 3 2019,negative,so much disappointment ignores the previous films and tries to do its own thing and fails this movie alone killed the star wars franchise 
Sep 3 2019,negative,big disappointment i was a huge star wars fan wellnot anymore
Sep 3 2019,negative,a movie youd enjoy if you like sjw bullcrap or horrendous writing literally does not honor the past episode like it should adds new ideas concepts that should not have been introduced as it was lazy writing divided fanbase hurt the actors and caused boycotts for future installments id rate this lower but i couldnt only good thing imo was the look of the movie although ep7 established that easily with decent writing critics out of touch with audience so is disney  
Sep 3 2019,negative,this is the lowest bar for a star wars movie even a toddler could write a better story 
Sep 3 2019,negative,the only good thing about the movie was the cinematography and visuals     the plot made no sense the character development from the previous movie got thrown out the window and the character development in this movie was a bit too forced no pun intended    i didnt even know finn and rose had chemistry or a romance until she kissed him at the end of the movie     a big swing and an unfortunate miss from disney on this one 
Sep 3 2019,negative,worst of the star wars movie i dont recommend
Sep 3 2019,negative,ryan johnson is an incompetent director who made a total mess of a movie
Sep 3 2019,negative,immensely disappointing film  tfa was not the greatest fil but i enjoyed it and was excited for the series  i have never seen one movie thoroughly destroy my enjoyment of the preceding movie before tlj
Sep 3 2019,negative,horrible movie all canons are rejected
Sep 3 2019,negative,hot garbage in the summer time
Sep 3 2019,negative,if you want to kill a franchise this is how you do it
Sep 3 2019,negative,this movie absolutely butchers the franchise old plot points are completely thrown out and replaced with garbage heavyhanded political virtue signaling and poor attempts at humor also prevent this movie from being enjoyable 
Sep 3 2019,negative,honestly garbage untrue to characters pointless and boring the worst star wars movie ever and were talking about a franchise with the phantom menace an utter mess which ruins everything its predecessor tried to set up the only good part of this movie is the final battle and if thats not enough for you then forget it
Sep 3 2019,negative,full of plot holes and with zero consistency to the previous star wars films all in the sake of political correctness 
Sep 3 2019,positive,great movie with fun twists and good character diversions johnson did a great job directing and hamills excellent i also love ridley and boyega in the movie   biggest flaw is the imperial room fight scene as the choreography is very flawed in favor of a great looking scene with minimal cuts     a
Sep 3 2019,negative,these are not the same star wars i fell inlove with i dont like it not because its diferent i dont like it cuz its garbage and sometimes outrights doesnt make sense
Sep 3 2019,positive,one of the greatest fantasy films ever made an absolute joy from start to finish
Sep 3 2019,negative,critics will pander to it fans like myself will despise how lazy and cheap this is force awakens was ok but this shoots down any plot or ark that any of the new characters have rey is a mary sue at best and a bland character at worst she goes through no struggle with learning the force and is stronger than the main villain who has been training to be the most powerful sith for years but no cant have logic in this new trilogy   luke skywalkers character is butchered in this film and i feel sorry for mark hammil watching his most beloved and iconic character being turned into a grouchy old hermit that lives on a rock and does nothing but bitch and moan this entire movie his death scene is a slap in the face to fans instead of dying like a hero coming to aid his friends and family and sacrificing himself like obiwan in a new hope he instead force projects himself across the galaxy to fight kylo never explained and makes a dad joke when he fades away only to wake up the hermit planet and fade away and die again why      ive also noticed that the only reason that the og cast were in these films were to trick old nostalgic audiences into coming to see this crap only for their characters to be butchered and killed off in the laziest way possible     i would go on more about what i hate but other commentators on youtube have given more entertaining and better reasons to hate this movie     so yeah this film sucked 
Sep 3 2019,negative,with a one dimensional lead and fight choreography which would embarrass a school production this movie sounds the death knell for a once great universe
Sep 3 2019,negative,awful and all over the place hard to believe a franchise like star wars can fall so far you use to see fans sleep outside for any new star wars thing now they leave thinking meh not sure the new upcoming one can save the damage this one did 
Sep 3 2019,negative,if lack of character development isnt enough how about no clear narrative and a complete undoing of story from the preceding film  with so much wrong with this movie ill let the 15 stars i gave it speak for itself giving it 15 stars since i disliked the phantom menace even more  how do the critics justify a 91 fresh rating while the audience is hovering at 44 rotten
Sep 3 2019,negative,my very first unaccompanied trip to watch a movie in a theater was to see star wars a new hope  it was the late 1970s i was 7 years old and i was transfixed  i rode my bmx home from the theater with visions of xwings in my head i started reading every scifi writer i could get my hands on  from asimov to zelazny and back with all of heinleins juveniles and some 20 year old tom swifts for good measure  two years later the empire strikes back and i was again stunned  three years further on as a burgeoning surly teenager  not so much  what the hell were these fuzzy teddy bears doing hanging out with luke leia and han this is ridiculous  did they make this movie for little kids but at least there was a good ending to the return of the jedi by far the weakest of the three original movies    in 1999 lucas began crushing out the light in my heart that he had created more than 20 years before with star wars episode i  the phantom search for more licensed merchandise revenue not only did he stick it to kenner but to his fanbase as well i actually felt the need to apologize to the young lady i had taken out on a date for subjecting her to jarjar binks and the stilted poorlywritten dialogue that came out of the actor playing young anakin are you an angel  i almost puked i kept my money in my pockets for the next two films watching them years later on dvd  i was done with star wars i considered myself wellshot of george lucas star wars and the blatant licensing tieins    fast forward another 15 years  its been almost 40 years since i saw the first star wars movie  theyve done nothing but disappoint me since 1983  a new sequel is being released  i have a young daughter that i want to take to a movie we can enjoy together even better if the main character is a young girl that she can relate to unfortunately the force awakens wasnt great  it was a thinly veiled mediocre remake of a new hope with a whole bunch more mary sue added to the mix but it was watchable and since i went at matinee time i wasnt even mad at ticket prices    then a lightning strike  rogue one  the best star wars movie in almost 40 years  believable characters good storytelling  that feeling of wonder that i last felt in a tiny two screen theater in georgia during the carter administration returned  im hooked again  surely disney will improve the next release right      all of the above is prologue for the reader to understand my brief review of star wars  the last jedi  and my profound and utter disappointment in it and the direction that disney has taken the franchise    this was possibly the worst movie that i have ever paid money to see in a theater  i say that having once actually decided to go see tank with james garner instead of splash with daryl hannah     i could write pages but others already have  this is my list of bullet points to include    writing so poor that it causes you to fall completely out of the little willing suspension of disbelief that you had been able to muster     years nay decades of character development overturned luke skywalker as a despondent wouldbe nepoticide dying in a scene intended to be reminiscent of obiwan kenobi in the first movie he actually fails to accomplish anything    a main character who magically gains all the skills necessary in a fantastically brief period of time to perform her arduous task the scifi trope known as ensign mary sue from some spoton tongueincheek star trek fanwriting of the 1970s    strong female characters mysteriously absent  replaced by insecure shrewish lecturing adjunct faculty member with purple hair who berates her secondincommand for exercising initiative and questioning her apparently psychotic actions after she failed to brief him on them    pointless scenes that do nothing to advance the narrative like the trip to a space casino city where the exstormtrooper and the notespeciallybright technician free some space horses abandon some slaves and muse on the horrors of capitalism and patriarchy    i found myself rooting for the empire    all in all this is a horrible mess of a movie  but i have only myself to blame  as the old saying goes     fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me  i wont be fooled again  they didnt get a dime from me for solo and im waiting for the final movie to show up on netflix
Sep 3 2019,positive,star wars the last jedi is quite good it tells the story in a good fastpaced rhythm with some twists and turns along the way in other words the last jedi is another epic star wars film with star warsesq storylines and situations its very good
Sep 3 2019,negative,i was shocked at how stupid some of the scenes were  dont be a hero oh wait be a hero follow orders oh wait dont follow orders when you have love there is good and evil oh wait the evil have better ideas than the good introduce new characters oh wait we dont need them dont let your army die oh wait lets be happy that everybody died  horrible movie   the jedi have died 
Sep 3 2019,negative,i visibly cringed while watching this pile of vomit everything sacred was torn down and buried subvert expectations is an excuse for gross negligence perhaps even malicious intent   jedi training matters no one is born to the art and skill ancient jedi teachings matter wisdom matters no knowledge should be burned murder is not the jedi way especially of unarmed individuals presumed guilty before innocent credible character arcs are born of flawed journeys giant characters built up over time should not be eliminated in ridiculous and implausible manners without adequate back story and closure   i was emotionally detached from this mess and retained no affinity or attraction it is utterly unwatchable even repulsive i have never witnessed such a rabid and rapid destruction of a franchise subvert expectations indeed the expectation that star wars is reborn or has a future 
Sep 3 2019,negative,ruined star wars lukes arch is terrible 
Sep 2 2019,negative,just so sad to see what has happend to star wars again unfortunate to see such a wounderful group of actors and actresses in such a terrible movie i feel the worse for dasiy you can see shes trying her best and it really shows but so sad to see the people making the movie clearly hate their own fans
Sep 2 2019,negative,very different from all the saga confusing an irrelevant role for luke also ruining the reputation of star wars in general
Sep 2 2019,negative,i could write a novel on how bad this movie was  instead i will leave it as they didnt do justice to not only the old characters but ryan johnson did not do the new characters any favors by developing them any further  i have no desire to learn more about them and thats a shame  
Sep 2 2019,negative,i wish the second movie in the third star wars trilogy was a better movie  imo because of this movie there is no third trilogy  theyre practically just three different movies  first off there is no anticipation for the third movie because of the ineptitude of this movie  furthermore there was no cliffhanger or any motivation to see the third movie  for example because of the ending of the empire strikes back fans could not wait for the return of the jedi because of the carbonization of solo among other things and how would luke and leia save him  or avengers infinity war has that ending which i wont say and how will the avengers save the universe in avengers end game  there was none of this in the last jedi    there were so many things that didnt make sense  why would rose tico assault finn for leaving  they are part of a rebellion not part of a military  how can finn go awol in a rebellion  its freaking idiotic  why wasnt solo treated the same in the first trilogy or even luke  they left at times  its just idiotic  then you have leia who gets blown out in space with no spacesuit or any protection  and people assumed perhaps she was dead  then suddenly out of nowhere she uses the force to bring herself back onto the ship  now we all know she can probably use the force given her lineage  but it was never shown in the first trilogy and not during the second trilogy until this happened  why not say a little something that leia is feeing more of her force powers come forward instead of it just popping out of the blue  it just seems so convenient and not shock of happiness for this to happen  it was just bad writing or bad directing which would not be a surprise  then leia poe and the other lady had their little argument  poe said they needed to do something and was forming a coup similar to whats happened in our country while leia said there was a plan  essentially there didnt appear to be a plan at least a good one  perhaps leia should have listened to options because they lost a lot of people due to the lack of a real plan  at the same time they made poe look like an idiot as well  because finn did not get the job done either which poe was a part of that plan  also the whole casino part of the movie was unnecessary and extremely long  if they were going to spend 45 minutes or however long it was in this casino why wasnt it a fruitful endeavor  they should have shortened this part of the movie if it was meaningless    also snopes seemed like a big deal in the firce awakens and perhaps he could have been a big deal in this trilogy  however they killed him off pretty easily  imo rey is not very charismatic and we dont know much about her  she is not very endearing because the movie has focused very little time on her and her plight  she has a lot of face time in the movie but nothing in regards of her or at least very little  also kylo ren is just weird  he talks to himself and hears voices in his head  the way it plays out in the two movies is he should be in a psychiatric ward  it doesnt play out like these two people are elite warriors  but they dispatched of snokes and his guards pretty easily  bad writing or directing here also  and now were supposed to be anticipating a fight between these two powerhouses in the rise of skywalker  oh please they should have shown they were powerhouses in the movie  they should have shown that rey received some meaningful training or she read the books extensively to become this elite jedi or sith    this movie has many more weaknesses and if youre a fan of the first trilogy then you probably hate the last jedi or its near the bottom of you star wars movies list  this is the only star wars movie ive seen once  every other star wars movie ive watched at least more than 10 times  i probably watched star wars a new hope the most
Sep 2 2019,negative,its time for this storyline to end
Sep 2 2019,negative,worst star wars film ever if you actually care about the series then you dont really need my opinion or review to convince you that is how bad this film is
Sep 2 2019,negative,the first star wars movie to need negative stars available because zero stars doesnt explain how bad it is  the makers have no understanding of star wars mythology  this movie is a disgrace  thank god sir alec guinness is dead
Sep 2 2019,negative,george lucas should be feeling better about the prequels they have been made considerably better by comparison to this assault on star wars i call it an assault because that is the only way to make sense of this jumbled mess the priority was on taking down everything that was considered good in the original trilogy and subverting or negating it all the joy triumph and positive aspects of the originals have been taken out back and shot to be replaced by the dour nihilistic and negative
Sep 2 2019,negative,i would rather watch two and a half hours of jar jar binks 
Sep 2 2019,negative,when new star wars movies were announced who honestly said gee i sure hope the original characters have all their achievements are undone are presented as failures and are killed off so some fanfic ocs can take over and redo what they did and not be failures
Sep 2 2019,negative,everyone who had a hand in this movie should feel disgusted and shame for this movie that makes the prequels bearable
Sep 2 2019,negative,it was not that good  you can tell that it was hastily rewritten by a second person  there are all manner of inconsistencies in the plot such as using light speed as a weapon  makes zero sense  the purple haired female rebel leader was obnoxious too
Sep 2 2019,negative,worst experience ive ever had in theaters
Sep 2 2019,negative,meant to subvert expectations but disrespectful to the lore and overall feel of the franchise 
Sep 2 2019,negative,its didnt make any sense and such a waste of character development 
Sep 2 2019,negative,its disgusting to think that this movie is in the same franchise as the original trilogy this movie is not even funny they try to hide their failures by blaming man for not supporting feminism or just saying that they are toxic and do not understand the movie honestly just because there are plot twist in it it doesnt make it automatically good i could talk about the mistakes for hours but to summarize it i say its a bad movie with a thon of incredible visual effects
Sep 2 2019,negative,i grew up with star wars and even went trickntreating as princess leia several times as a child  star wars is a feeling a journey and an escape but this movie had none of those great things  it was just meh so disappointing
Sep 2 2019,negative,wish i could give this garbage zero stars 
Sep 2 2019,positive,a really entertaining star wars film 
Sep 2 2019,negative,no coherent plot terrible protagonists even prequels were better
Sep 2 2019,negative,this half star was for the original characters  they did a great job with what a cluster fk this story was disney just stop ok your only embarrassing yourself 
Sep 2 2019,negative,gave it 2 stars just for the visual effects  the plot was a complete joke no plot element made sense or was related to anything in the previous star wars movies  best example was all of a sudden luke is an apathetic hermit because he tried to kill kilo in his sleep  this isnt the luke of the previous movies and no backstory is given to this change  the first order is massacring people and luke is in hiding  this made no sense to his original character also the ending of him just being a force hologram is never explained or ever talked about any place in books and makes no sense  the best made up plot device is all of a sudden space ships need fuel   like where did this come from   i really thought a reasonable path was kylo  rey hooking up to finally bridge a void between light  dark something the jedi never figured out how to allow familes etc  but again with some horrible writingthey just become these weird stock characters again  left this movie with no interest in any of these characters i only watched to see what they did to luke  leia which was basically the same they did with han just destroy them in the weirdest way imaginable
Sep 2 2019,negative,what happened what a waste of time
Sep 2 2019,negative,garbage dont make a sw movie if you have no love for the universe you didnt have the authority to rewrite yoda and lukes characters or how the force works or light speed i wont be seeing 9 
Sep 2 2019,negative,just felt like it was made by people who dont care about star wars the movie doesnt fit into the story it is not a good movie and leaves a huge mess for the next movie to clean up lets hope it can
Sep 2 2019,negative,its as if rian johnson were beat up as a child by star wars fans so he secretly decided to destroy the film saga because of it the explanations throughout the movie are atrociously unscifi  the ships are smaller and weigh less um its space there is no weight they are light sabers not laser swords   bombers in space that drop bombs hyperspace is now going really fast and anything in your way blows up  oh and the lead character learns everything she needs in a day practicing by herself   these are just the things off the top of my head that make it bad yet alone the horrible dialogue 
Sep 2 2019,negative,worst star wars movie ever
Sep 2 2019,negative,horrible treatment of luke horrible non sense action rey is more powerful than everyone with the force without any previous training hands down the worst star wars movie lots of youtube videos describe the hundreds of faults better i still cant believe they wasted lukes potential contribution to these movies so completely jj obviously set him up for a prominent storyline in this movie but rian decided to trick everyone and go a different way
Sep 2 2019,negative,the only thing i like were the porgs in fact a whole movie about porgs wouldve been a whole lot better than this hunk of junk
Sep 2 2019,negative,hate the star wars franchise and praying for its death then look no further this is the movie for you in 2 hours and 32 minutes this pos kills off any chance of revival for the beloved franchise i want to wish jj abrams the best of luck trying to flush this turd in episode 9
Sep 2 2019,negative,ill defined characters muddle their way through a logicfree plot portrayed in incomprehensible visuals yes the movie even fails visually for example a shot near the beginning shows poe and his xwing taking up more space in frame than the super mega ultra star destroyer he is opposing while the movie itself is attempting to portray him as david to the bad guys goliath
Sep 1 2019,negative,i didnt expect much but i left the theater so mad at how insultingly bad it was it was like they wanted it to suck or just didnt care
Sep 1 2019,negative,pros makes episode 1 look like a cinematic master piece of writing  cons makes you turn your back stars wars    good special effects set and ship design utterly wasted character opportunities breaks its own consistency within the movie in real time as you watch it most story arcs lead no where which leaves the movie as boring and pointless skip
Sep 1 2019,negative,this was an absolutely terrible movie star wars might have died with this last production 
Sep 1 2019,negative,it killed star wars for me this movie is the reason i didnt go see solo 
Sep 1 2019,negative,this is the worst representation of starwars i have ever seen the new character have little to no character development this is just terrible save your money it sucks
Sep 1 2019,negative,you murdered the eu for this crap 
Sep 1 2019,negative,can anyone say dumpster fire
Sep 1 2019,positive,good movie but not a good star wars movie 
Sep 1 2019,negative,makes lukes character look like a low life teen so the movie is very very below average compared to the other star wars movies
Sep 1 2019,negative,without a doubt the worst star wars film ever 
Sep 1 2019,positive,somthing new and honest for the tirlogy
Sep 1 2019,negative,tlj ruined star wars for me i hated everything about this movie i in no way felt like the original trilogy these characters are not one fifth as charismatic and interesting as the originals the plot is lousy it had virtually no redeemable qualities i wish we could undo it boo
Sep 1 2019,negative,badly plotted nonsense how the mighty have fallen
Aug 31 2019,negative,if you grew up with star wars dont watch this movie
Aug 31 2019,positive,its just awesome the performance is incredible the action is fantastic overall its awesome
Aug 31 2019,negative,so disrespectful to the fans and the franchise
Aug 31 2019,positive,i really like the movie for what it is all avocets of it are interesting even though there are a few problems
Aug 30 2019,negative,good movie but absolutely awful star wars
Aug 30 2019,negative,i am a lifelong star wars fan but what happened in an attempt to be unpredictable the filmmakers created an awfully medicore and unexciting movie sorry 
Aug 30 2019,negative,even flashy lightsaber duels cannot distract from the feeling that the narrative was designed by committee
Aug 30 2019,negative,film was an utter disappointment tired plot marysue uninspired lead confused and directionless villain there was space combat that doesnt fit the cannon of the star wars universe ultimately youre left with a feeling of how much worse could this get at the end of the film i weep for the third installment 
Aug 30 2019,negative,pointless total waste of 230 hours it seems like a bunch of clips put together with no story at all horrible movie
Aug 30 2019,negative,most boring star wars movie in existence making phantom menace a flawless movie in comparison
Aug 30 2019,negative,its not hard to see why i have it a star but ill try to be brief spoilers  first order  everyone is just mad all the time and needs to explain everything even to the enemy in full detail   lets shoot the base that wont move but not shoot the ship that probably will jump any second   hux forgot to not listen to poe and just shoot him    yo mama joke ensues   rose has no reason to have heard of finn  finn wasnt a pilot in the first movie and now is in this one   didnt explain force powers or the training into them on either side   instead of any form of military tactics or command level cadre explaining the situation lets just trust the purple hair woman because shes her     casino planets lesson is just utterly stupid  those kids are gonna have to clean it and rebuild it     rebels or resistance pick one  rey is unbeatable in every situation ever and im sick of that    let her lose for once  plot armor    for real i can break this movie down so easily so let me end this whole deal with this      i sat in the movie theatre with 14 other people 1 week after open   3 people walked out midway through      i laughed when leia floated back to the bridge and opened the airlock and it just cut to the next shot instead of elaboration on how she didnt just explosively decompress the ship right then and there     i sighed when rey beat luke in the stick fight   i was interested in snoke well i guess that was time well spent   worst of all i lowered my expectations during the movie to allow that rey would save the day and wasnt disappointed     luke has been abused and finally killed and it was painful to see that    i actually shed a tear that that was all the respect they had for my hero        i left the theatre in good spirits because the visuals are amazing and the sounds and music are generally great      if you think that forgives a terrible story filled with plot holes and inconsistencys youll love this movie     im no critic  im a star wars fan    this movie is a disservice to star wars   this movie may have turned me away from even seeing number 9 in theatre and thats a damn shame        update  and guess what i didnt see it in theatre   i saw it on disney plus
Aug 29 2019,negative,ive seen this movie 3 times and still couldnt tell you what the heck happened the absolute worse that star wars has to offer
Aug 29 2019,negative,the whole movie did not work for me i am or was a big fan of the franchise and i cant say that anymore i never thought one movie out of ten movies could have such an affect but this one did it was sad to see what they did to the character of luke all the momentum that was built up in the force awakens was lost in the last jedi 
Aug 29 2019,negative,luke skywalker was just a farm boy thrust into an intergalactic war and after training and learning finally defeated his foes and became a hero the female lead despite no training just suddenly masters the force and beats kylo ren um wtf it seems to me the message isnt train hard be a hero the message here seems young people you are already better than grown men you just have to wake up to it dont worry about training its destroyed a great franchise i give it 25 stars because on its own merits the cinematography is impressive special effects are good it at least entertains for two hours acting isnt great the script feel forced and contrived like theyre shoving some political message down my throat could i write a better script probably not but you dont have to be a master chef to know when someone is feeding you garbage 
Aug 29 2019,positive,star wars the last jedi honors the sagas rich legacy while adding some surprising twists  and delivering all the emotionrich action fans could hope for
Aug 29 2019,negative,it was an unmitigated dumpster fire that took a shit on everything jj abrams set up but with no payoff whatsoever
Aug 29 2019,negative,not really star warslike and took the characters in a weird direction with a bad story and disregarded canon eg hyperspeed 
Aug 29 2019,negative,this movie ruined star wars
Aug 28 2019,negative,rian johnson made what was without a doubt the worst star wars movie ever by not giving us fans what we want and by adding in elements that nobody needed at all
Aug 28 2019,negative,worst movie i ever saw after years and years of non stop preaching of my friend about the original trilogy i watched all of them and after watching this movie only one question was in my mind is this some kind of parody movie this doesnt make any sense at all
Aug 28 2019,negative,worse than the holiday specialat the holiday special was funny suspension for both was equal
Aug 28 2019,negative,aweful writing horrible characters huge plotholes a slap to the face for every star wars fan
Aug 28 2019,negative,the movie ruins the character of luke skywalker
Aug 28 2019,positive,its incredible i love it
Aug 27 2019,negative,worst star wars ever    destroys old characters adds useless ones plot is inconsistent and nonsensical
Aug 27 2019,negative,my teenage daughter and i both hated this movie  with an hour left to go we both just wanted it to end  there were a couple of good set pieces  the effects are top notch  but the plot is such unintelligent nonsense it is painful to watch  yes i am a life long star wars fan and yes i created this account just to post this review  please disney pay attention and commit to a course correction with this beloved franchise
Aug 27 2019,positive,a star wars movie that explores gray areas beyond just black and white plenty of adventure humor and thrills and moves the story forward without being a carbon copy of a previous film 
Aug 27 2019,negative,it was terrible its ruined
Aug 27 2019,negative,bad storytelling bad character development so many questions left unanswered uninteresting subplots that took up significant amounts of screen time 
Aug 27 2019,negative,terrible excuse of a star wars movie plot that was boring and made no sense no character development other than kylo and rey another disgusting disney star wars movie somehow more boring than the last
Aug 27 2019,negative,not just a bad star wars movie but one of the worst movies i have ever watched  
Aug 27 2019,negative,a movie that doesnt even know what its own main focus should be because half of the movie is wasted by following the side characters finn and rose on their mediocre adventure that has nothing to do with the plot and feels like it belongs on some bad tv show meanwhile these finn and rose dont even have any character development and finn is transformed from the interesting mysteries exstorm trooper in the first movie to some sort of comic relief which is just sad meanwhile the plot between rey and kylo feels like a weak remake of the plot of the empire strikes back but for me the most important thing that director rian johnson did to totally abolish not just the trilogy but the whole feel of the star wars universe is that he takes away one of the core principles of the star wars univers and all the movies and that is that it feels like the dark and the light side arent fighting for the fate universe kylos first order is basically just 3 star destroyers and the mysteries snoke is just killed of in a couple of seconds and rey easily defeats kylo again just like the the first movie of this trilogy making the first order seem like a joke and no real threat like the villains in all other star wars movies which leads to the audience being left with no suspense for any other movie and this will lead to way less viewers for the next sequel    in summary a movie that is so bad that it makes a whole trilogy that promised so much in the first movie irralivant all because director rian johnson cant make any good movies
Aug 27 2019,negative,a sorry excuse for a star wars movie 
Aug 26 2019,negative,lazy script and storytelling not worthy of such a big budget in such a rich universe as star wars lack of creativity takes the movie to the most boring moments of all star wars franchise and on top of that characters and themes have reached the nonsense point where nothing matters anymore jedi mythicism and training  screwed up surprising and dynamic space fights  screwed up cool and meaningful hand to hand fights  screwed up a badass evil villain  screwed up very basic star wars universe stuff totally destroyed fuel really hyperspeed as a weapon sudden breakthrough really lightsabers do not cut flesh anymore really and so on and on  at some moment this amazing universe was going to faint and disappear and this is the movie where that moment has come not only to alltime fans but also to any adventurefantasyaction genre fans
Aug 26 2019,negative,this movie was terrible
Aug 26 2019,positive,i loved the directing rian johnson is a fantastic director my only issue was some of the script it shouldve been better 
Aug 26 2019,negative,tragically misguided with no really tangible storyjust a bunch of random scenes that were politically charged     terrible movie 
Aug 26 2019,negative,the movie was bad really bad and a salp in the face for every starwars fan the hyperspace scene destroyed big parts of the shared univers
Aug 26 2019,negative,rian did some good things but rian did a whole lot more bad things atrocious 
Aug 26 2019,negative,quite simply the worst of all of the star wars films a disgusting mess with no respect for the lore set behind it exposes the film behind the fantasy and pulls you completely out of the viewing experience also filled with nonsense social justice moments and awkward hastily written scenes that make no sense going from one to another     a travesty of modern film making 
Aug 26 2019,negative,a lot of the movies plot made no sense there was an entire approximately hour long scene that was a complete waste of time in the end  if poe is one of the high commanders and best pilot you would tell your high ranking officer the plan that makes no sense not too only for the writers to make the long and useless plot that wasted half the movie with     the character development and the plot fell flat i was hugely disappointed in an entirety   every build up the force awakens build up this movie destroyed   and then the one scene that was incredible cringe flying through space you all know the scene that was just bad 
Aug 26 2019,negative,most boring and trash part better never to see this movie
Aug 26 2019,negative,its the worst fucking piece of shit i saw of my entire god damn life
Aug 26 2019,negative,the story was pure trash the final 30 minutes just didnt make up for the boring 2 hour long chase scene wich its pointless inconsequential side quest failed to to distract from
Aug 26 2019,negative,an illogical mess that is devoid of creativity 
Aug 26 2019,negative,it was garbage disappointing that they decided  to destroy the mark hamil and yoda character in the process everything else seems more like nonsense failed subplots and loopholes everywhere
Aug 26 2019,negative,i didnt think a plot could make less sense than episode viis but i was wrong this was just a pile of nonsense it is like an eight year old wrote the script
Aug 25 2019,positive,this movie was actually great i loved it it had some flaws and i dont understand why there hating i loved it i recommend it and this gets a a
Aug 25 2019,negative,plot made zero sense and did not follow continuity of previous movies ship in light speed scene as a weapon was especially confusing if it could have done so in previous movies 
Aug 25 2019,negative,poorly written lore braking story garbage virtue signalling through out the whole movie terrible 
Aug 25 2019,negative,completely disrespectful to the source material and destroys original characters   
Aug 25 2019,negative,about as bad as it gets for star wars i rewatched the newer prequels from the 2000s and i couldnt help but find a extreme gulf between this atrocity and the genius plot from before i couldnt name half the characters minutes after leaving the theater and couldnt for the life of me remember what the whole plot even attempted to achieve what a travesty of a movie and worse still that they dragged the star wars name with it
Aug 25 2019,negative,an absolute travesty there is no real plotline going on the plot as to why kylo went down the path to the darkside is not covered the casino scenes never were necessary to the plot and luke is a coward unwilling to physically stand up to his nephew worst of all the morale of the story comes from the villain to let the past die not a bad morale but this is coming from a murdering sociopath that uses that morale to justify why he tried killing his parents and teachers for not giving him whatever instant gratification he desired i truly hate his movie
Aug 25 2019,negative,subverting expectations no its just a bad movie 
Aug 25 2019,negative,i was really dissapointed with this movie
Aug 25 2019,negative,        there is a difference between looking cool and being a well developed film the two are not mutually exclusive  while action sequences are visually interesting this movie suffers from a badly paced and uninteresting plot with characters who lack complexity  rey finn and poe have origins which could be expanded on to make more complex or relatable and have interactions that show their values flaws and motivations  however by the end you couldnt care less about these people             as a fan of the franchise its also hard to watch a movie with so much unnecessary and poor attempts at humor that undermine the tension and the potential epic feel of nearly every scene disney tried to turn this into a marvel film but the franchise has a completely different tone to it  dialogue and plot matter here and both are completely overlooked  with lines like whered the crystal critters go and the childish insult chrome dome by finn alone both extremely cringey in delivery how did the critic rating get so high visuals are good  acting is decent  directing and editing not great but the writing is what kills this whole movie  for similar issues from a better movie see the justice league         people call this bold but its a sad attempt at a rehash of the empire strikes back with a useless 30 minute casino sequence in the middle multiple plot holes and unfortunate retroactive continuity implications for the franchise  
Aug 24 2019,negative,absolute garbage i accidentally took my girlfriend to see this as it was her first star wars film needless to say we are not watching any more star wars films together
Aug 24 2019,negative,cant give 0 stars but god that was a horible movie the best visuals made no sense and what made sense was boring cant be that hard to make a single god fight scene that makes sense without mistakes or at least only small ones i mean george lucas managed to do it soooo
Aug 24 2019,negative,this movie is a piece of trash i held out hope for it but 5 minutes later in the car i saw what a piece of garbage it was
Aug 24 2019,negative,it was cringeworthy  horrible action sequences  marry poppins meets space balls yet nothing funny about it
Aug 24 2019,negative,the last jedi did what none of the prequels did it made me stop caring about the franchise  why  because the script seemed like it could have been written on the back of a napkin during a one hour visit to the local watering hole  for those who say boo hoo it didnt do the things you want so its bad    no thats absolutely not the case  the force awakens didnt do the things id hoped for and i still enjoyed it  tlj is a prime example of how not to tell a story  it wasted our time with irrelevant bumbling  it insulted our intelligence by making its most dramatic moment a slap in the face to logic ie if you could hyperram a fleet to destroy it there would have been fleets of drone hyperrammers in existence throughout the franchise    dear jj  please retcon this piece of garbage and truly melt our minds as kevin smith claims it will
Aug 24 2019,negative,political pc culture garbage this didnt feel like star wars it didnt even feel like a new twist on star wars it felt like pc culture training school with terribly choreographed lightsbaber views and weak attempts to get blood pumping as forced characters run through fake feeling peril absolute garbage
Aug 23 2019,negative,pretty awful film that narratively jumps the shark with a fistful of sjw propaganda and poor charchter structure and arching 
Aug 23 2019,negative,the plot literally makes no sense how can you spend so much money on a movie and accept such a shameful logically flawed script i wont mention totally pointless subplots what can you expect from rian johnson afterall 
Aug 23 2019,negative,utterly neuters luke skywalker and makes everything that came before useless seriously he always believed there was good in vader and finally helped to save his fathers soul but now we find he tried to murder his apprentice because of a bad dream do what add to that how weak and grumpy and just worthless he is as a jedi and im finally done giving disney constant passes because im a diehard fan someone please buy the rights from disney and fix this crap like it never existed hey if theyre going to replace that horrible allwoman manhating pretend like the originals never existed ghostbusters film like it itself never existed they must do it with this too
Aug 23 2019,negative,so much of this movie doesnt make sense ranging characters motivations to what people can actually do with the force it has a few really good shots of cinematography and adam drivers acting was spot on most of the rest was problematic there were 34 times i thought that was cool but there were a good two dozen times i thought that was stupid its too long and theres too much talking without people saying anything sorry guys the movies just not good    honestly this one was right on the border for me between a 25 and 35 there was just too much that was downright stupid in it there were three separate times during the movie when i took off my glasses and rubbed my eyes shaking my head because the movie just made no sense
Aug 22 2019,negative,im not a star wars fan but i enjoy a good movie and story same as everyone else and for the amount of backing and budget this had it was one of the worst films i have ever seen besides the huge plot holes bad directing and boring pointless parts the whole message of let the past die is completely forgotten by end of the movie the film states that the stronger the dark then stronger the light the universe will always balance itself out the arms dealer selling to both sides the jedi just being bs the more you try to repress yourself the worse it is the good and evil are just concepts then it completely throws that out of the window ren offers rey a way to change the universe a way to follow the films earlier message to do away with light and dark and she rejects it the whole message of the film completely erased he destroys his helmet to show hes following the message of the film the he rebuilds it and put it back on the only let the past die they really did was erase the old characters so they can sell and merchandise new ones because its established that the universe will balance itself out once good wins with a powerful darkness and when offered another path film goes lololol nope love will save us lol nope  the luke aka the past saved you oh rey is super powerful now guess what so is ren then and when she able to win guess what the dark side will rise and the only person who was like yeah we should just reject all that was rejected and just goes back to darth vader 20 also suicide bomber light drive ships are now a thing and the most powerful weapon in the universe this film is awful and for being such a huge powerhouse of a franchise its really unforgivable to be this bad let the past die nah just put a new coat of paint on it and charge twice as much
Aug 22 2019,positive,loved it some parts were unnecessary but story was great  now anyone can be a jedi
Aug 22 2019,negative,i hope this movie had never happened just dessapear into oblivion
Aug 21 2019,negative,this is a very very stupid movie and incredibly disrespectful to the original series its as if a very intelligent movie director was tasked with making the worst movie he could its not just bad its bad in millions of little ways along with most of the big ones
Aug 21 2019,negative,i tried but could not like it there are a few scenes that look amazing so kudos for that but the story is slow makes no sense and ultimately i just wanted to be over to i could get out of there a first for any star wars movie
Aug 21 2019,negative,tragic installment in an otherwise incredible franchise ep viii begins where vii left off and ends in the exact same place with nothing of substance in between save for the perversion of many great mysteries set up by jj in the preceding film 
Aug 20 2019,negative,atrocious story telling major plot faults sub plots all dropped with no payoff 
Aug 19 2019,positive,i liked the movie myself 
Aug 19 2019,negative,why everything we loved about star wars has been ruined with money the story is lacking with many plot holes the characters are inconsiderate and unpredictable constantly making irrational decisions luke has been destroyed as a character any story arcs potentially set up by jj abrams has been erased resulting in a jumpy story new exciting characters which had so much potential as side stories have been wasted this is a total failure 
Aug 19 2019,neutral,bluray 20198  the part of going to look for the person with the technology they needed was boring with usual scenario there was no special attraction im tired of lightsaber
Aug 19 2019,negative,saw it on blu ray and found myself bored to death the new characters dont seem to belong and i cared little about the scenes given to them had moments watching it thinking when is this horror show going to end    i came into this movie hopeful that luke skywalker would have a great role in this film turns out hes a pathetic and cowardly old man honestly this did not even feel like a star wars movie
Aug 18 2019,negative,the film killed the last jedi and the entire new trilogy
Aug 18 2019,positive,its not my favorite star wars movie the story was not that great but i still enjoyed it to me rian johnson just completly did things the way he wanted to with this movie and did not care or even respected the fans of star wars and i truly hope he stays away from the star wars franchise 
Aug 18 2019,negative,my expectations of a solid sequel were absolutely subverted thanks rian 
Aug 18 2019,positive,it has his problems but its a good movie
Aug 17 2019,negative,the movie that destroyed my passion for this saga
Aug 17 2019,negative,such incredible potential that was absolutely squandered by the director  the only category this movie did well in was in visual effects  truly bad storytelling  just wow
Aug 17 2019,positive,the movie was so close to being a great movie but just fell short because of poor writing decisions 
Aug 16 2019,negative,im watching this movie and witnessed the infamous holdo maneuver where vice admiral holdo destroys most the first order fleet by running her ship into them in hyperspace  my first thought is looks cool but this breaks everything in star wars  there are dozens of dumb things in this movie but this is the most damaging to the universe continuity  not bothering with the next one
Aug 16 2019,negative,made me cringe more often than not  nonsense plotlines leading nowhere and rian johnson managed to waste some of the most iconic characters in cinema    its just very sad as i had very high hopes
Aug 15 2019,negative,it could have been great but the last jedi will forever remain one of the worst nothing is worse than a wasted opportunity now the next film will have to play damage control and increase the fan service to absurd levels what we will get is a blunder followed by a course correction instead of an elegant and natural end to a 30 year and nine film saga 
Aug 15 2019,negative,horrible dialogue horrible directing only cool part is when the woman goes into hyperdrive and smashes through the first order ship
Aug 15 2019,negative,what a huge disappointment  
Aug 14 2019,negative,i lost interest and and was disappointed from the moment luke tossed his lightsaber over his shoulder it was like screw this and screw you and i felt okej screw this movie and it was all down hill from there i was detached the story didnt glue on me and the current political awareness permeated every action made me feel like it wasnt a star wars saga i was experiencing zero stars
Aug 14 2019,negative,horrible movie they fked up the hyoer space theory 
Aug 14 2019,neutral,i was hoping for more of the force awakens but instead we got a luke that seemed afraid and was nothing what he used to be it was a failed for me when i watched it but after some time i feel is not too bad
Aug 14 2019,negative,hyperspace breaking garbage motionlessness space chase bad choreography 2 terrible side plots coup and viva space vegas and worst of all the character assassination of luke mother fucking skywalker 
Aug 14 2019,negative,wish i could give it zero stars
Aug 14 2019,negative,all i can say bad bad and bad  they have literally sucked the spiritual life out of the franchise
Aug 13 2019,negative,disney did not understand the saga the prequels were not a copy of the original trilogy or a remake so why the sequels the nostalogy exisit and why not do something else with this rich mythology  something that tells a new story without the same plan of the past with new characters who have a real carisim and not place feminisim everywhere it just not credible maybe toxic to make a good film to me star wars ends in the return of the jedi 
Aug 13 2019,negative,poorly written tripe not one more dollar from me hollywood
Aug 13 2019,negative,i started typing something out but just search youtube for the last jedi is a complete cinematic failure it will start to give you an idea of what is wrong with this movie
Aug 12 2019,negative,george lucas should demand his franchise back before he loose the fan base 
Aug 12 2019,positive,one of the best star wars movies ever made kylo and reys relationship is so deep and interesting
Aug 12 2019,negative,visually a lot of interesting things to look at storywise just bad whoever thought that a complete overhaul and reversal of all elements from the original trilogy would be a good idea  was so wrong too many plotholes unexplained or inconsistent eventsdecisions illtimed attempts at humor and characters who simply made no sense  this single film solidified a decision i had been building up towards not rewarding disney with any more of my money in the theater  lazy uninspired visually stunning spiritually empty
Aug 12 2019,negative,this movie may have killed the saga
Aug 12 2019,negative,an absolute insult to star wars fans rian johnson should not be allowed near another star wars publication two thumbs down not only wouldnt recommend but wish i never saw it
Aug 11 2019,negative,overall this movie is garbage it is total nonsense and illogical it would have been better to put all the new characters into a new trilogy or even standalone movie and not try to put them into the skywalker trilogy i dont have a problem with ray or any new female charactersit is the story line and the rubbish jokes in this film the storylines from fa that are binned and the amount of wasted time in the film ie the sea cows or whatever its good to have new characters and move on but it wasnt necessary to destroy the old characters and the old mythology to do that  
Aug 11 2019,negative,this was a disappointment the entire film recycled content from the other movies to the extent that there is very little creativity or originality in this film the plot is boring and lacks continuity and consistency with the legacy created in the original trilogy and the prequal trilogy though many argue that criticizers hold unrealistic expectations there are so many obvious issues lukes sad legacy the illogical strategic action pointless segments and characters its a big big sad
Aug 10 2019,negative,this is no longer star wars  i really dont know how you can screwed a movie so bad 
Aug 10 2019,negative,the plot is resolved twice in the movie but it seems that nobody notices
Aug 10 2019,negative,absolute trash fan fiction at its worst 
Aug 10 2019,negative,this movie was comically bad on so many levels it is difficult to know where to begin     horrible dialogue retread story lines ridiculous scenes like princess leah floating in space luke dusting off his shoulders and an absurd and unnecessary detour to a casino planet all but rendered this film unwatchable    after rouge one the spirts of die hard life long star wars fans were lifted but the last jedi has all but destroyed any hope of the franchise correcting for the mistakes of the past and instead embracing them 
Aug 9 2019,negative,i didnt think it was possible to make a star wars movie less enjoyable than episode i 
Aug 9 2019,negative,style  substance this film doesnt know what star wars is
Aug 9 2019,negative,the excuse for this mess of a script was that they were trying to subvert expectations its just bad writing ex now you can solve a problem in the star wars saga by just ramming a ship into it somehow when finn tries to do it its bad when purple haired girl does it its good trying to be different and surprising is no excuse for this kind of bad and lazy writing
Aug 9 2019,negative,an absolute mess of a film plot is disjointed and the treatment of luke skywalker is unforgivable this film has clearly been made to alienate the fans and it will cost disney in their pocket if they do not change course and show a little bit of respect to the fans that put money in their pockets 
Aug 9 2019,negative,the last jedi is an amazing piece of garbage go see for yourself
Aug 9 2019,negative,antistar wars  reboot the sequels not canon
Aug 9 2019,negative,what a pile of garbage i was so excited after episode 7
Aug 9 2019,positive,alright so ive waited 2 years almost to post my thoughts on this movie and its probably my favorite out of the new trilogy but ive had a bit of a complicated relationship with this filmthe first time i saw it in theaters i loved it i loved it so much i saw it 3 times in theaters 2 more viewings than the force awakens or rise of skywalker but as time went on i let people convince me it was a terrible film and i began to bash on it too i didnt even watch it for almost a year but i recently gave it a rewatch and i loved it its hard to explain i noticed its flaws and i see why people dont like it but its telling a new story a story that feels like it needs to be told the best parts of the story though are luke rey and kylo ren lukes story continues through the film and contrary to popular belief this is in his character he almost killed vader when he threatened leia and han but im not gonna try and change your mind im just putting my opinion out there this movie is boldinventive and created an interesting and beautiful story that deserves more love
Aug 8 2019,negative,the last jedi is a sign star wars is dying 
Aug 8 2019,negative,only good part is how funny the critiques of it are
Aug 8 2019,positive,youll never like the last jedi until you understand what it set out to do let the past die kill it if you have to once you understand this objective i have a spark of hope that youll see tlj for the iconoclastic masterpiece that it is in the light of this objective the films multitudinous traditiondestroying scenes shine with genius the chief example of this approach is lukes defeat of ben in act three without striking a single blow he shows that oft evil will shall evil mar and defeats the young villain with a simple trick 
Aug 8 2019,negative,poor writing choices an entire plotline that lead nowhere some bad acting and an absolute disgrace to the star wars franchise
Aug 8 2019,negative,what are you doin disney sell the franchise please 
Aug 7 2019,negative,the new disney star wars movies ar not canon they are just bad
Aug 7 2019,negative,overall i thoroughly dlisliked the film for the following reasons       lots of plot holes ie bombs being dropped onto a ship in space when there is not gravity or luke complaining about not wanting to be found when left a map to where he was     odd and forced jokes ie luke mocking rey for coming from jakku or poe making a joke about general huxs mother     male characters are presented as foolish and overzealous poe starting a coup against holdo even though there was a larger plan to move personnel  which he was never told about for some confusing bizarre reason      iconic characters were needlessly and anticlimactically killed off admiral ackbar blown up randomly during a starship battle just for shock value      forced pairings between characters a forced romance between finn and rose that lacked any chemistry and tension  despite the best efforts of the actors       thinly written characters it was still unclear who snoke was before he died no effort was made to explain who he was or why he was doing what he was doing nor how he was able to establish the force connection between rey and kylo ren     thanks for reading my review as brief as it was and let me know if there is anything i have misrepresented or overlooked 
Aug 6 2019,negative,thats just terrible they killed everything that i loved 
Aug 6 2019,negative,a film that solely aims to subvert expectations at the cost of well developed characters logic and lore that permeates the entire franchise
Aug 6 2019,negative,not a great movie the script does not make sense within the star wars universe
Aug 5 2019,positive,the movie is great but we need skywalker luke back lots of open plots to be told for the ix episode
Aug 4 2019,negative,this movie is a true disaster i was contemplating whether or not to post this review of the movie after all its almost been 2 years the movie is a betrayal to lukes character he is basically used for comedic purposes only if it was not for carrie fischers unfortunate passing this movie should have been redone
Aug 4 2019,negative,one of the worst movies i have ever seen  terrible humor and often at the worst time  gravity in space  universe altering hyperspace changes  rey is the biggest mary sue in cinematic history  she is great at literally everything  her first time using blasters on the millennium falcon she gets a triple kill of tie fighters as her first shot  wtf  magical hand waves explain away massive plot holes    pointless casino planet sidequest for a slavery is bad and war profiteering is bad morality lesson    kylo ren would be really cool if he wasnt such a whiny brat
Aug 4 2019,negative,it was otter garbage it completely destroyed star wars for me i was a superfan now i can even watch the original trilogy 
Aug 3 2019,neutral,this movie is a paradox it is not a meh movie because there is good in it however it is not a good movie because there is a lot of bad in here rey is a mary sue lukes character gets assassinated admiral holdo and rose are terrible additions to the star wars franchise the only good characters in this movie are leia rip carrie fisher and kylo ren this singlehandedly broke star wars 
Aug 3 2019,positive,its a shame this movie got so much backlash its personally my favorite star wars even though it feels a lot like a rehash of empire strikes back it has stunning moments gorgeous visuals and just in general some of the best moments of the whole skywalker saga 
Aug 3 2019,negative,absolute abomination and slap in the face of star wars legacy and fans rian johnson should not be allowed near a directors chair ever again
Aug 3 2019,positive,though i really like it i dont think the director knows the difference between subverting your expectations and make some shit up to try to shock you
Aug 2 2019,negative,a film with no logic in it
Aug 2 2019,negative,this ruined a childhood hero of mineluke skywalkerthe movie is filled with mary sue charactersthe writing felt extremely random too
Aug 1 2019,positive,the best movie of the star wars saga absolutely must to watch
Aug 1 2019,negative,this movie killed star wars its not a bad movie  its the perfect case study of how a movie should not be made
Aug 1 2019,negative,terrible writing terrible plot ruins previous characters   good cinematography through and good cgi thats why it gets one star at all
Aug 1 2019,negative,this movie was awful i felt empty and wanting less  this seemed like the ending of the trilogy you have no where else to go from here  i dont care about any characters now
Aug 1 2019,negative,what a cinematic failure i will never watch this ever again and the critics are wrong about this movie 
Jul 31 2019,negative,star wars nerd from 1977 when i was 12 love the pt and clone wars used to have annual sw marathons from ep i to vi i believe as mark hamill does that the st was a missed opportunity
Jul 31 2019,negative,what a waste of time words cannot express what a terrible movie this was looked great and sound was good but that was about it
Jul 31 2019,negative,a horrible movie and a disgrace to the star wars franchise d 38100
Jul 31 2019,negative,i literally cannot find the words to describe how bad this thing is and how negatively it has affected the world for everybody forever    
Jul 31 2019,negative,a bad movie sad to say  so much wasted potential waste of good actors  luke acted in flashback totally out of character leia turns into mary poppins in space one large segment of the film was a side mission that was a total waste of time and lots of just plain stupid ideas  we dont defeat them with hate  while shooting at them no less  the handsdown worst star wars film to date
Jul 31 2019,negative,it was such a stupid pile of crap with pointless situations and choices easily the worst movie of the entire saga the 3 prequels that are so criticised shine in comparison
Jul 31 2019,negative,a tragedy the surpasses even jar jar
Jul 30 2019,negative,dont watch it
Jul 30 2019,negative,the worst movie ive ever seen waste of 2 hours i saw it on the thursday opening night and i have not watched it again since and i never will as a star wars super fan this movie was a slap in the face any movie fan could easily see even from a non star wars perspective this movie didnt make any sense it didnt connect to the last film at all rian johnson literally threw away the script jj made for 8 and made whatever he wanted this movie destroyed whatever foundation the force awakens created
Jul 30 2019,negative,this movie was complete and absolute garbage i have been watching this beloved saga since i was only 4 years old there is nothing i love more than these movies so to see this confused slowmoving nonsensical film really made my sad
Jul 30 2019,negative,worst star wars film since attack of the clones this movie does nothing to push the story forward at all a lot of dumb jokes that dont land or make sense for star wars they ruined lukes nephew making him go to an island to die from depression after trying to kill his nephew in his sleeprey needs no training and is flawless and can lift more rocks than luke and yoda within a week of time this movie is ridicuos and finns canto bite planet is a complete bore and adds way to much waste to the movie while adding politcal agendas the movie is a disgrace to what star wars is and what the previous film set up
Jul 30 2019,negative,plot holes galore can tell this was written with no regard for what came before instead of progressing characters many regress ie luke tfa was good in comparison for all its flaws and lack of innovation rehashed ideas are better then nonsensical ones some brilliant looking scenes but cant make up for the hollow feeling the writing leaves you with seems it was made for childrenmillenials rather then sw fans lucus should be allowed to fix their mistakes in final draft so the cannon and worldbuilding doesnt suffer like this in future films their best asset and they ignore his input  
Jul 30 2019,negative,horrible humour ruined hyperspace and canto bight disgusting
Jul 30 2019,negative,pure piece of crap they were trying to literally anger the fanbase the force awakens was much better and the prequel and ot are millions of times better i dont mind rey being a girl i dont mind diverse characters but i do mind them trashing luke killing snoke with no explanation and just generally taking a steaming dump on the fans 
Jul 30 2019,negative,total garbage this entire movie was a waste of everything     the plot goes absolutely nowhere the character motivations dont make any sense and rian johnson is far too preoccupied with subverting our expectations to bother making a good movie the fact that this movie has a 91 rating somehow is the sole reason i created an account on this site     whether you have never heard of star wars or youre the worlds biggest star wars fan this movie is not worth watching
Jul 30 2019,positive,at this point its pick a side and i loved it as much as ive loved every star wars movie
Jul 30 2019,negative,just an overall remake of the old ones and horrible
Jul 29 2019,negative,it is a decent movie but it is not a star wars movie it shares nothing but the name of the original star wars movie dont recommend watching if you are a fan of star wars and expect star wars
Jul 29 2019,neutral,i was let down by this movie to say the least it was kind of entertaining but tried to be funny a lot and failed to and i wasnt a fan of how they can communicate no matter where they are by telepathy it really ended my interest in the franchise force awakens was good this one was not
Jul 29 2019,negative,the humor was completely cringe and almost an insult to the saga really stupid plot people hugging and smiling after hundreds of their friends die the creators took a dump on our most beloved characters and threw them into the trash     i am a big star wars fan but i actually cant even watch this movie a second time with out getting angry or fall asleep
Jul 29 2019,negative,trying to stay positive for episode ix but honestly the last jedi was so horrible i just dont see how the team at disney can save this trilogy 
Jul 29 2019,negative,even parodies specially how it should have ended makes much more sense than this movie 
Jul 28 2019,negative,not sure what this is  but its not a star wars movie its a hot mess that needs to be removed from canon
Jul 28 2019,negative,it was politically driven insulting to both men and women providing an unrealistic vision of the rolls of men and women do and act like  it took the established universal ruled and method of behavior of established charterers and destroyed the universe  it was full of plot holes and inconsistent variables that are far too involved and too lengthy to write here  the director did not fallow the story line of the previous directors and decided to just do his own thing  this has single highhandedly shown that disney and lucas film are no longer up to snuff with the franchise  i am sorry but this film was a b script with b directing but with a list funding and name recognition  this was a bad movie and should have never been made
Jul 28 2019,positive,seeing the last jedi in theaters for the first time a thrilling experience as a longtime obsessive fan of the franchise and as a movie fanatic with one of my personal favorite modern writerdirectors at the helm by the time the movie came out i had somewhat outgrown my obsession or so i thought because i could barely sleep the night before wondering if it was going to be good okay or terrible some would chalk up my enjoyment of the film as a form of cognitive dissonance but to that i would say no u i just have so much fun watching it there are those who say the only way to treat this movie is to neither overly deride it or give it excessive praise but i wholeheartedly enjoy this movie so yeah thats praise people comparing it to the phantom menace or attack of the clones probably like those movies way too much because the levels of quality arent even comparable watching this from a writerly perspective and actively analyzing it like any other film that i would watch even other star wars movies i find this one to be of high quality its also its own satisfying and complete story but it still leaves me wanting another episode just real quick solo and rogue one dont even touch tfa and tlj in filmmaking terms they are the first skippable star wars movies honestly id recommend skipping them you may have fun with them but i sure didnt especially with solo which was a total drag anyway im sure the last jedi did right by my childhood or whatever but thats not very important whats more important is that it did right by my current and more informed standards and it continues to improve every time i see it kids like dumb crap and watch the same stupid lowquality cartoons over and over again with no discretion so i trust current me more than child me in terms of whats good
Jul 28 2019,negative,this movie destroys everything we knew and loved about the original star wars trilogy from its pointless subplots to its stupid plottwists this movie is terrible the thing i hated most about this movie is what theyve done to luke skywalker theyve turned his character from the last hope into the last nope the only reason i havent given this movie the lowest rating is because to be fair the visuals were stunning but apart from that its terrible
Jul 28 2019,negative,i only gave 05 star because its the minimum you can give because it doesnt deserve that
Jul 28 2019,negative,never seen so many plot holes in one movie
Jul 28 2019,negative,ive never written anything and i could have actually done better it wasnt even visually stunning its a poor shadow of the action we experienced in the prequels and even the original trilogy
Jul 27 2019,positive,as a star wars fan i see merit in it but i was disappointed and hope over time it will get better i doubt it but i have hope 
Jul 27 2019,negative,stupid written the chase segment with everything in there the casino planet and the salt planet everything was just stupid it tops with some sacrifice that breaks the whole star wars universe with hyperdrive as a weapon luke dies a pathetic death to be a jedi aint anything special anyone can pick up a lasersword and be one it seems i really dident like this movie
Jul 27 2019,negative,half of star is way to generous for this film this is boredom to the maximum level
Jul 27 2019,negative,i am a very devoted starwars fan and this movie had more plot holes than jedi killed due to order 66 here are a few  1 who the frick is snoke             he appeared out of knowhere commands the universe and then just gets killed  2 why didnt they kamikaze the dreadnought right off the bat instead of sacrificing so many bombers         also the design of those bombers is stupid its almost like they were designed to be blown up before they reached their target which they did not reach except for a very unrealistically lucky one  3 that was not luke skywalker that was some darkside trick that just brought hope out of the world instead of tride to spread hope like what  4 all of the above and like 9000 more    i am sorry george lucas and i am sorry to the galaxy                                                           may the force be with you  
Jul 26 2019,positive,half of the movie is exciting and feels like star wars the side story is awful though along with some weird luke stuff this is one of the worst star wars movies but is an average movie overall
Jul 26 2019,positive,theres no logic behind this film but why complain when its a space film that never made sense in the first place
Jul 26 2019,negative,a few things i can appreciate about this movie is that i can tell rian made an okay script the special effects are amazing and luke skywalker had more depth in this movie than the entire episode 7 script but thats about all this movie is an overstuffed poorly paced and downright stupid movie the movie is ruined by how incompetent the characters are im going to reference redlettermedia because he summed up the movie perfect the characters actions play like a comedy they do something stupid and it leads to more stupid things you see that wouldve worked in a comedy but in a star wars movie that seems like its trying to take its self somewhat seriously following up on what i said about luke skywalker i think its pretty interesting to turn him into a washedup old man who has no hope i think its dumb that people are upset because they thought luke skywalker was this perfect optimistic person when in reality hes just a man so it makes sense that he would have moments of weakness thats all see this movie if you like but try to ignore the amount of stupidity in the characters and the overstuffed plot
Jul 26 2019,positive,tells a compelling story has great themes and shows interesting character development while still showing the classic elements of star wars
Jul 26 2019,negative,crappy movie luke as a character was not done justice its almost like rian didnt watch any of the previous star wars films
Jul 25 2019,negative,in my opinion this is the worst movie of all time there are so many plot holes and inconsistencies it ruins the movie also the everyone except fin sucks and i mean everyone new characters and old ones they ruined luke c3p0 and leia and the new characters are all boring bland and 1 bad note rey garbage po garbage rose hot garbage even bb8 is bad and be does not even speak
Jul 25 2019,negative,ive been waiting to see luke skywalker for 40 years and what rj gave us was a grumpy hero that goes to force anonymous meetings  its like waiting 40 years to see superman but we get an angry drunk superman instead
Jul 25 2019,negative,ryan johnson trains future movie makers on how to destroy a franchise with this horribly bad attempt at a star wars story  if this movie did not have star wars attached to it i cant imagine anyone would like its putrid dialog and ridiculous plot
Jul 24 2019,positive,put right the wrongs of the farce awakens dreading ix with jj back in the driving seat
Jul 24 2019,negative,righteousness and politics do  not go hand and hand same thing with disney and star wars the characters and their personalities were extremely bland their origins not as interesting the new characters were incredibly boring the plot was terrible and worst of all they misrepresented luke skywalker    grade scoref
Jul 24 2019,negative,the luke skywalker rewrite was a total disgrace he went from someone insisting the most evil and dangerous person in the galaxy should be redeemed to someone that almost murdered a child that had a chance of being evil  be logical when you write for a saga write it in a way that makes sense compared to the rest of the story and if you truly want something different that rewrites it that drastically promote new franchises
Jul 23 2019,positive,star wars the last jedi takes a lot of risks and some of them work and others do not kylo ren is one of the best characters in all of star wars in my opinion and in this movie he really shines holdo rose and canto bait are 3 things in this movie that feel very out of place in a star wars movie but everything else in this movie is bold epic and an amazing addition to the franchise
Jul 23 2019,negative,worst star wars movie to date ruined luke skywalker and made a joke of the things we love about the franchise
Jul 23 2019,positive,it captures philosophy realism non fan service experience which is totally unexpected in a great way the way plot points turn will make you theorize why and how and it is exciting 
Jul 23 2019,negative,a parody of the original trilogy cheap comedy political correctness get in the way of storytelling
Jul 23 2019,negative,where to begin on the stupid nonplot decimation of the beloved character luke skywalker and allpowerful nontrained never losing college girl this movie is cancer
Jul 22 2019,negative,awful truly awful dont know how else to say it
Jul 22 2019,negative,this movie single handedly marred the franchise one of the most beloved franchises in cinematic history not only were pointless and random characters introduced existing ones made little to no progression throughout the movie and if anything regressed in terms of development the sheer ridiculousness of rians vision made the movie frustrating to the point of unenjoyability he should not be allowed to participate in the making of any more franchise films for the foreseeable future
Jul 22 2019,negative,this was the worst film i have ever seen and i seen a lot of rubbish the director should never work again there is so much wrong with this movie i would need a week to detail everything that was wrong
Jul 22 2019,negative,jj abrams should of directed this movie 
Jul 22 2019,neutral,ignoring the fancy special effects the story line of the follow up to the highly anticipated next chapter in the skywalker saga is lacking and is a disappointing entry into a marvelous tale
Jul 22 2019,positive,im not a star wars fan so i dont have as many problems with this movie as most people do i found it to be a pretty entertaining movie
Jul 22 2019,positive,the last jedi is a very good movie but i feel bad about all the controversy surrounding the film the actors the director and even lucasfilm and the walt disney company  while not perfect its a great message with growing beyond past mistakes and moving forward to a better conclusion
Jul 21 2019,positive,i feel a lot of the negative reviews from the film come from the unrealistic expections some fans have   
Jul 21 2019,negative,they ruined luke skywaker 
Jul 21 2019,negative,not a fan not a fan 
Jul 21 2019,negative,terrible lore breaking and character disgracing slow speed chase in spacewho is snoke rose is an awful character that takes up way too much screen time makes a far reaching feminist statement but ends up making female leadership seem incompetent resulting in mega cringe this film is awful and disjointed offers no follow up from tfa it just doesnt make any sense sure the visuals were good but the planet kanto bit looks awful do not watch this movie instead take your children to a park call your mother or just close your eyes and take a nap  brace yourself for severe disappointment that reaches new lows
Jul 21 2019,negative,terrible awful disgusting utterly disrespectful to the star wars mythos and story puts a major stain on this franchise im so mad that this film was even released to the general public it is a revolting mess
Jul 21 2019,negative,nothing to say its shit
Jul 21 2019,negative,man this movie was just a mess rian johnson you dun goofed man
Jul 21 2019,negative,absolute garbage movie i hope you rot disney
Jul 21 2019,negative,they tried to go big and create a masterpeice but they made a mess
Jul 20 2019,positive,the movie risked a lot more than the force awakens in an otherwise excellent film its petty attempt to add social messaging in a star wars movie fails as a second act to leave us excited going forward 
Jul 20 2019,negative,the movie is garbage weak plot the slowest chase in movie history leia poppins
Jul 20 2019,negative,horrible boring movie that made zero sense
Jul 20 2019,positive,star wars tlj 2017 is better than tfa 2015 and it is likely better than the rise of skywalker because comparatively tlj has much better writing than tfa rather the tfa is a rehash of the star wars iv 1977 with the empire making a death star weapon i enjoyed that tlj is more about democratic and equality rather than royal and bloodline indeed in the beginning of the film luke talks about whole the force doesnt belong to just anyone but to everyone talking more about details would give too many spoilers however i am disappointed that jj abram who wrote tfa returns to write tros indeed i dont even know why star wars 9 is even titled with skywalker unless jj abrams is going to make the force basis go back to royal bloodline which is stupid i blame the fanatical audience who refuse to change for such likely change again
Jul 20 2019,negative,yeah nah no thanks are the approved critics on disneys payroll or something 
Jul 20 2019,negative,is the worst movie of star wars 
Jul 20 2019,negative,terrible it had the budget and makings of an amazing movie but the horrendous writing was too much to overcome embarrassing for a star wars film 
Jul 19 2019,negative,what else can i say that hasnt already been said about this absolute disaster of a movie
Jul 19 2019,negative,tone deaf and poorly made this movie is full of inexplicably bad decisions and characters we know and love acting like figments of rian johnsons imagination
Jul 19 2019,negative,so any effects  so much work but story is all over the place too many characters  revealed at once its too busy to cluttered and confusing compared to original star wars this is disappointmentbut big plus for art design department and sgi
Jul 19 2019,positive,it was fine shut up
Jul 19 2019,negative,very disappointing a lot of characters established in the last movies are completely ruined especially luke and finn only adam drivers character is well developed the script has a lot of incoherences when it comes to the purpose of luke some subplots are completely worthless and useless to the story the casino planet with rose and finn is boring as hell however the movie has great visuals its a decent movie but a terrible star wars
Jul 19 2019,positive,i enjoyed it the more i watch it the more i notice and the deeper levels of meaning i find in it the fact that this movie has multiple psychological layers and its use of joseph campbells monomyths show that the director new exactly what he was doing those who were expecting a shallow guy movie will be the first to complain about it and express their hatred for the director out of all the star wars movies that exist this is the one i keep rewatching
Jul 18 2019,negative,worst movie ive seen in theaters im not going to waste my time explaining how terrible the movie was the way they treated luke was terrible if he saw the good in vader how couldnt he see the conflict in his own nephew the humor was terrible im not even going to get into the sjw crap they were trying to pull all im going to say is to keep that bs out of star wars the fight scenes made no sense at all and that leia scene was terrible it was just a horrible movie that was essentially just a money grabber because thats all the people care about i guess the force connection scene between rey and jylo was pretty cool and the cgi was the best its ever been but thats about it this is just a disgrace to the star wars saga as a whole and they should honestly redo this movie
Jul 18 2019,negative,horrible directing rian johnson  disney  worst star wars film ever i cant believe how bad the film was 
Jul 18 2019,negative,name one redeeming feature of this film i dare you its pretty cause they poured money in it its score is good anything else this is legitimately a joke the fact that rotten tomatoes has a 91 on it is a huge indictment on rotten tomatoes 
Jul 18 2019,negative,i think this is the most boring and plot hold movie ive ever seen i dont even know where to start first off the passing of the movie is all over the place and that casino scene just drags on to long and slows the movie down to a snails pace second the chase through space doesnt make sense with the rest of the star wars lore on space travel also the space chase is extremely boring many movies have done similar chase scenes way better like the mad max franchise for instance third most of the interesting stuff is only mentioned in the movie rather than shown like rey finding a way off of snokes ship i wouldve loved to see rey do some bad ass fighting as she fought her way off the ship or even sneaking around till she found an escape pod fourth this film brings nothing new to the franchise just copies other star wars films and their scenes but only half as good if not worse finally the movie has no true tone to it its a big mix of tones that dont fit right all together i truly have no words on how to describe how badly this films tone is i do hope that jj can do much better with the final film in this trilogy however im not holding my breath as ryan johnson has truly screwed up this trilogy
Jul 18 2019,negative,i didnt think that my childhood could be ruined so easily 
Jul 18 2019,negative,theres a right way to subvert expectations and theres a wrong way to subvert expectations so many things just didnt make sense to me the convenience of things the bizarre choices made i think its safe to say that i was not transported into this universe at all  too many jarring things surprising twists i mean just one example if you could just kamikaze a starship into an entire fleet of enemies why havent they been doing this for the past thousand years in space battles     the force awakens left me satisfied but this just completely threw me off the star wars franchise i mean just look at what mark hamill has to say it just sucks because i love star wars dearly i find it bizarre that the tomatometer vs the audience score is so drastically different but aye  trust the real critics yeah
Jul 17 2019,negative,its another star wars movie nothing really of anything new that you havent seen already its way too long many established characters go back and forth way too many times im not a huge star war fan but this was highly disappointing editing and directing seemed a bit skewed
Jul 17 2019,negative,this is the first star wars movie that officially lost its magic the plot is predictable humor lame i miss the old star wars
Jul 17 2019,negative,  things i liked about the movie     1 lightsaber fight in snokes room was pretty awesome good visuals and great choreography by both ren and rey i love rens more organized fighting style versus reys chaotic but controlled tempo    things i didnt like about the movie    1rosefinn love side plot this by itself was the most annoying flaw in the movie just awful took up a good portion of the movie that could have been spent solidifying the main plot    2 you cant drop bombs in space what made it worse was johnson afterwards trying to backtrack and make an explanation for that     3 introducing laura derns character only to kill her off immediately mainly im annoyed that they couldnt let a droid do the suicide mission of have freaking autopilot    4 tactical incompetence of the first order getting past the whole   we cant go to warp because the engine is broke so were just gonna go fast enough to stay out of their tie fighter range  why doesnt the first order just send a bunch of other battle cruisers ahead of the rebel ship and ambush them geez was i really the only one who couldnt understand this the rebel ship would have been the first orders number 1 priority so you mean to tell me they cant spare some other ships to finish the rebels off the nazis were absolutely evil but even they werent that incompetent    now the issues that really annoyed me    5 no back story for snoke we deserved a back story on snoke all of our fan theories my personal one was that he was plageus could have been wrong but we at least deserved a back story dude just doesnt get to be that strong with the force and we dont anything about him     6 snoke dying so easily some emo punk like kyle ren who only just recently was getting his butt whooped by snoke uses the force to turn a lightsaber on and cut snoke in half how in this world was snoke not able to detect this     7 reys parentage or at least explanation of her power maybe they are waiting for the next movie to explain this but giving us some lame scene with her in an ice cave was just distasteful     8 leia flying through space after the bridge is attacked yes i know that leia is force sensitive as well but come on the blast should have killed her which i would have been fine with and almost preferred as it would have really made kylo go full dark side but it doesnt and despite the fact that she doesnt immediately freeze to death in space she force pulls herself back into the ship johnson really butchered that     9 luke being a sissy mark hamill even had a problem with this ad well as most of the script luke went from being one of the toughest jedi ever to being a depressed wimp who couldnt handle the stresses of teaching which is what powerful jedi are supposed to do yeah kylo turned but you get back at it and try to fix it geez he was so whiny in this movie thats not a grab at hamills acting but the character writing     10 this is my final and biggest annoyance its kinda of a continuation of 9    we didnt get to see a seasoned luke absolutely shred some first order bad guys the knights of ren who have still pretty much been a no show or even snoke which would have been fitting no we get to see him force ghost fight ren in the lamest lightsaber dual of the entire franchise luke is the probably one of the strongest jedis in history and we didnt get to see the full display of his power over the force they could have killed him off this way by him taking on like a hundred baddies with him taking most of them down or even all of them and just being to spent to go on with life similar to obi wan but no we get wimpy luke and this was real kick in the nads to all of the old fans      disney has a real chance to build on all the plot devices set up by tfa but they absolutely squashed it here i hold johnson and kathleen kennedy responsible for this hot garbage im gonna get called a disgruntled fanboy who doesnt like change for my review but heres what i say to those who say that you probably also thing episode ii was a great movie as well or either didnt watch the episode i through vi and have no clue to the backstory of star wars and how everything plays out  this movie only made a billion dollars because it has the star wars name on it and they showed it in china     to jj abrams please for the love of god fix all this in the rise of skywalker tfa was awesome with you at the helm please help us jj abrams your our only hope  people who like this movie probably have no idea what that reference is to
Jul 17 2019,negative,the force is no longer with the skywalkers but with the nobodie bs   
Jul 17 2019,positive,i maybe understand why people hated this film but for me it was good i enjoyed it
Jul 17 2019,negative,a beautiful movie to look at visually but the film has a pessimistic cynical yet preachy vibe to it that doesnt feel anything like a star wars movie  its no surprise that sales of star wars merchandise and the popularity of the franchise as a whole went off a cliff because of this movie  last jedi will be seen as the black sheep the neerdowell the pariah of the star wars franchise  
Jul 17 2019,negative,its a star wars movie so its going to have an audience however it made me feel like johnson went online and looked at every fan theory about the questions raised in episode vii and wrote a script just to say f you to the fans
Jul 16 2019,negative,total disconnect from the saga
Jul 16 2019,negative,big disapointment they really ruined star wars for me 
Jul 16 2019,negative,thought it was over hyped the first time i watched it after watching the original vhs trilogy  prequels i went back and rewatched tfa  tlj and realized how awful both actually are going from 6 to 7 gave me whiplash but nothing compared to this one really concerned about 9 now no clue how disney is going to make this trilogy make anything close to sense
Jul 15 2019,negative,the more i watch this move the more i dislike it the writing is reckless with the cannon material and there is so much wasted timeopportunities in the movie any movie that needs a handful of comic books to explain loopholes is not a good movie
Jul 15 2019,negative,i hate what they did to luke skywalker i personally believe that that movie was the biggest pile of dog poo ever made  worthless
Jul 15 2019,negative,pretty yes everything else is just disappointing
Jul 15 2019,positive,while there are many opinions on the film i personally love it great acting especially hamill and driver beautiful visuals engrossing cinematography and a well crafted script despite canto bight from rian johnson help the film stand out among the other star wars films and shows a new way foreword in the franchise giving us fitting ends to luke and leia so we can usher in a new era for the final film in the end the film accomplishes what it sets out to do and i will gladly say i respect it as much as the originals
Jul 15 2019,negative,gotcha moments plot holes poorly written characters lack of payoffs and the most ludicrous chase scene in all cinema 
Jul 15 2019,negative,the stupidest movie i have ever seen in my life a lot of stuff have been said but i wont ever forgive what they have done to luke   no no no and 100 times no those people who are saying that its a new leap in his character development can just blow themselves i do not want to be rude but just think he even didnt kill his father dart vader who was a menace to the whole galaxy luke believed in him and here is kylo ren just a boy his nephewand you want me to believe that he was even thinking about killing him no fuck it fuck
Jul 15 2019,negative,so so sad to see the destruction of star wars by rj and co
Jul 14 2019,negative,absolute beautiful cinematography juxtaposed with absolute garbage story writing 
Jul 14 2019,negative,disappointing disrespectful insulting star wars isnt a comedy and it doesnt need an agenda just make a fun space movie guys is it really that hard but damn those visuals were good
Jul 14 2019,negative,cash grab not star wars
Jul 14 2019,negative,started off with a really good promise for a star wars movie i was begging to see but in the end disappointed multiple viewings allowed me to see this movie for what it was rushed lazy and over dramatic with absolutely no intelligent filmmaking i wish that reys character was more developed while instead being superfluous invincible and problematic the final scene left me with a bad taste in my mouth the whole logic of the hyperspace scene went against everything canon and showed the resistance as happy and hugging with full smiles while their entire fleet was decimated moments before i truly regret that this movie couldnt become what i wanted it to be 
Jul 14 2019,negative,the more you think about this movie the worse it becomes the director takes everything intresting about starwars and space combat and throws it out the window    i dont think the actors are bad i think the parts written for them are so terrible that it makes them look bad    episode 7 was a little sketchy but had the basis of somthing much greater but so far the sequels are the worse films in the star wars franchise    congratulations  
Jul 13 2019,negative,its not the actors themselves that are bad theyre all fantastic but this attempt on the star wars trilogy somehow manages to not have the soul and life that the prequels had    it is hard to connect with any of the characters whatsoever and the movie felt long    cgi is great and all but you need great storytelling and writing to go with it and i just was not feeling it with this
Jul 13 2019,negative,an huge insult to the star wars franchies worse than episode 7  
Jul 13 2019,negative,this movie has ruined star wars the saga cannot continue with this abominable mess
Jul 13 2019,negative,the most disappointing movie experience in my life i liked tfa and was looking forward to this one but 5 min in i noticed something was off non of the forced jokes were any fun everything interesting about tfa was completely wasted in this movie the abilities of all the jedi  were all over the place and weopoinzing lightspeed must have been the worst idea in star wars history at least it looks and sounds like star wars
Jul 12 2019,negative,the worst movie ever made the last sharknado is far better
Jul 11 2019,negative,ive never been as frustrated and disappointed watching a movie as i was seeing this in theaters i wanted to love this movie i really really did but so much of the writing and dialogue and subversion is just soooo stupid i threw my hands up multiple times during my screening like why the characters constantly forget their motivations and the whole canto blight sequence felt completely out of place like finn and rose forgot they were on a countdown to save their friends rose is a problem her character is an idiot but it seems like the film wants us to side with her same with the colonel huldo character the movie throws away luke throws away ackbar throws away phasma throws away snoke luke throws the lightsaber after supposedly laying clues all last movie for them to come find him turns out he has no interest in anything anymore and doesnt even care about doing the right thing who the hell is this new luke guy anyway leia is apparently a force user is immune to the vacuum of space and can unconsciously save herself from an atmospheric blowout rose stops finn from sacrificing himself to save everyone left for no reason instead shes fine to let them die and her line afterwards is so so so dumb and letting luke just die seriously i was pissed yes im critical im critical because im invested i love star wars this just wasnt it it wasnt star wars it looked like it had characters from it sometimes felt like it  a little bit but it wasnt it its obvious rian johnson and whoever put him in a position of power did not have the same care for the source material ps i love having women and people of different ethnicity on the show as long as they remember there is no earth in this show these are all supposed to be aliens so give them some alien backstory make them interesting dont think just because they are people who havent been featured in star wars as prominently until now that that in itself is enough better writing please thank you
Jul 11 2019,negative,this is not a good film it felt as if the other films had been forgotten this is the first time ever i sat in the cinema wanting a star wars film thinking please god make it end 
Jul 11 2019,negative,after the shaky start of the force awakens we get this they should make an episode 10 to make up for what can only be described as a cinematic disaster 
Jul 11 2019,negative,its hard to explain but this star wars movie was not a star wars movie
Jul 11 2019,negative,i fell fully confident in saying the last jedi is by far the weakest addition to the star wars saga between leias inexplicable space flight and snokes anticlimactic death the film is chocked full of moments that leave me struggling to understand why some would purposefully introduce a piece of cinematic turd like this into the world another one for the trash compactor thank you disney
Jul 11 2019,negative,i would rank this worse than the force awakens but rotten tomatoes dont have negative stars  all the problems from tfa is multiplied ten fold  its 3 plots feel stupid drawn out scenes that cant build suspense  howwhy did that happen and did anyone watch the earlier movies was my refrain    the phantom menace i feel had better special effects overall and better pacing    has one decent fight scene
Jul 10 2019,negative,horrible friggin movie who cleared this for production it felt like a first draft
Jul 10 2019,negative,too long no consistency and no connection to history way to destroy a franchise 
Jul 10 2019,negative,watched it twice only to make sure that the car wreck i had watched the first time actually happened i usually watch a star wars movie a minimum of five times and that was for tfa i watched the phantom menace more times than tlj
Jul 10 2019,negative,worst star wars movie ever i tried but just couldnt watched it again once i see fin walking around in a kids show bubble suit i just cant do it even episode 2 is rewatchable but this shit is just cliche and over bloated
Jul 10 2019,negative,an absolute butchering of a once great franchise it changed that motives of classic characters that we have known for over 40 years it did not do anything that was expected or accepted by fan around the world it has no twists completely ended several well known questions and gave us that lamest of all answers to the questions we had i love star wars but due to this movie i will not have high hopes for the rise of skywalker as i did for this abomination of a star wars movie
Jul 9 2019,negative,meh it wasnt terrible but it certainly wasnt good i have had a lot of time to think about it since the movie came out its a shame jj abrams didnt direct this one he probably would have done a lot better good visuals i guess great cji however special effects dont save this movie from its lack of coherency plot holes and i am exaggerating character destruction i think the most disappointing thing about this move was their treatment of luke the character we all used to love was just a depressed former hero in this movie i wouldve been okay with that if he had a redemption arc later on at the end where his depression went away and he became the person he once was unfortunately that didnt happen all he did was troll kylo ren and then commit force suicide i really hope hes revealed alive in the rise of skywalker maybe the name says something and gets better treatment even mark hamill was clearly upset with how his character was treated in this movie overall i dont think this movie is as bad as most haters say it is but its still moderately bad ive put my faith in jj abrams to fix rian johnsons mistake here with the rise of skywalker but who knows if jj can successfully reunite the fanbase and explain away the broken mess that was this movie
Jul 9 2019,negative,this movie is garbage
Jul 8 2019,negative,this was such a disappointing movie not just as star wars but there are many dumb things added like lea fricking using the force when she clearly should have died also space bombing runs there is no gravity what is the point also the fight choreography was just terrible also rose sacrifices her self for finn when the whole resistance is at stake also luke skywalker is completely out of character he has no hope when in the orginals that is some times all he has aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhh i hate this movie
Jul 8 2019,negative,totally disappointed stupid arguments no character development they destroyed the most important characters lore just lazy mindless  writing so total garbage   star wars was my favorite saga this totally sucks ill stay with the previous books anda stories
Jul 8 2019,negative,without stating the obvious qualms that most people have about this movie ill just say that i didnt like it when it came out and my opinion hasnt changed much since yes im an avid star wars fan and yes i even liked the prequels regarding the prequels thats simply because they are just star wars to me and also because of the nostalgia factor i got into star wars after seeing tpm in the theatre when i was 16 sorry not sorry dont care i loved the force awakens and didnt give a shit about it being too similar to a new hope because it was simply a blast to watch and it felt like star wars the biggest problem with the last jedi is that i never feel like watching it i just get bored and i dont care about anything thats going on i suppose i look forward to the reyren imperial guard or whoever they were duel and the lukeren fight that doesnt really happen but even those scenes along with the rest of the film just leave me feeling underwhelmed and still hoping for something else to happen its not a smart bold innovative and new direction in my book were not talking about a stanley kubrick film here were talking about a star wars movie a star wars movie that definitely subverted my expectations in terms of wanting to watch the damn thing over and over again just because its star wars with this one i just dont care to watch it
Jul 8 2019,negative,the movie is well made but lacks a good story and the direction they took luke in was terrible 
Jul 8 2019,positive,rian johnson is full of differences for star wars that we havent seen before
Jul 8 2019,negative,one of the worst movies i have ever scene there is so much wrong with this movie  you couldnt fit it on this entire page if you wanted to this movie was a joke and hope fully director rian johnson learns from his terrible mistakes this movie split the fan base in half from people who actually care about star wars and the little kids and people who think the newer trilogy is cool this movie was awful and should not be considered canon
Jul 7 2019,negative,as a life long star wars fan and someone who was incredibly excited for this movie after the wonderful new beginnings of the force awakens i could not have been more disappointed in my opinion the people behind this movie fundamentally did not understand the characters they were working with there was no love for the story lore and characters that all of us love the director seemed to just want to create cheap twist that completely detailed the entire franchise i have never felt so much disappointment leaving a theater and hopefully i will never have to feel that way again leaving a star wars movie but the issues that this movie has created narratively seem too great to be fix in a meaningful way with just one movie to go  
Jul 7 2019,negative,second half of the movie was decently good until that stupid ass rose saving phinn scene and interesting subverting my expectations and having some good action too but the first half was absolutely awfull its incredibly boring to the point where i had to get up and use the restroom in the theater to stay awake 
Jul 6 2019,negative,the resistance forgot to fuel up at the last marathon station movie fails to answer questions from previous movie poor tasteforced comedy that would better fit in spaceballs than star wars a 3045 side plot that adds nothing of benefit to the story 
Jul 6 2019,negative,brutal  reduced luke who was the perpetual embodiment of hope to a grumpy old man who tried to kill his nephew  completely confused the hyperspace mechanic  destroyed classic characters like akbar  turned leia into some kind of mary poppins character  had a totally inexplicable general hold her secret plan not really much of a plan from her own troops for no reason whatsoever  reduced lightsabers to laser swords  furthered the mary sue motif of rey  killed smoke without ever explaining who the hell he was  had possibly the worst choreographed lightsaber fight of all time  kylo becomes even more pointless and confusing  oh and luke dies  for no reason  his death accomplishes nothing    worst sw movie by far  at least the prequels explained things and furthered the sw story despite the brutal dialogue and haydens brutal acting  this movie just brutalized everything we knew and loved  worst part  the director is smug about it
Jul 6 2019,negative,it was horrible it didnt make any sense and was so agenda driven very disappointed 
Jul 5 2019,positive,despite its imperfections this is a great movie with amazing arcs and interactions between the characters this is the first sw film in a long time that i felt had something to say
Jul 5 2019,negative,doesnt respect the characters or lore absolutely awful movie
Jul 5 2019,negative,i love star wars but i really dont think this is a star wars film that hits home nor is this is a good movie in the vision of a non star wars related film either it sent characters in an sprawl of quests that amounted to no victory poor character development and i would go as far to say it even downplayed characters from the force awakens prior instead of having them grow i did not grow up in the original star wars era i am still young and saw episode 1 and 2 far later as well even and all though those are considered to be not the best they each left something amazing to talk about lore wise further adding books and tv shows full of beloved support episode one had qui gon darth maul young obi wan etc episode two had the clones count dooku etc while the last jedi killed off the main antagonist and belittled the possible history of some of the protagonists which i am sure making the directors of the eventual 3rd installment scratching their heads on how to make a quality film 
Jul 5 2019,positive,it was a fun ridebut nothing new
Jul 5 2019,negative,the worst star wars movie since episode 2
Jul 5 2019,negative,an insult to all star wars fans
Jul 5 2019,positive,its the best star wars movie i have ever seen 
Jul 5 2019,negative,the worst star wars film to date 
Jul 5 2019,negative,this movie was shit and barely passed as a star wars movie 
Jul 4 2019,negative,a dumpster fire boring and painfull to see like seen it your favorite restaurant to burn to the ground and being replace for a vegetarian hamburger stand that cant even assemble the burger rigth
Jul 4 2019,negative,worst one of the saga
Jul 4 2019,negative,ridiculous by far the worse start wars movie ever and an awfullywritten no sense movie in general well done
Jul 4 2019,negative,cant even get the kids to watch it and i havent been able to completely watch through a second run such a trash mess thank goodness for rise of skywalker
Jul 4 2019,negative,worst star wars film ever the entire movie is about undoing everything that the force awakens has previously established in the first film it has nothing to do with the bigger picture now its on episode 9 to do all the heavy lifting to fix all the new loose ends and to wrap up two movies worth of content in a single 3 hour movie sure the cinematics were great but the story was absolutely lazy ignorant and pointless to say the least btw this has nothing to do with the story not going my way the story sucked because it was poorly written once a the world and people are established the characters basically write themselves you cant change a characters entire personality just to subvert ecxpectations like george rr martin said ive been planting all these clues that the butler did it then youre halfway through a series and suddenly thousands of people have figured out that the butler did it and then you say the chambermaid did it no you cant do that      disney could have put this entire movie in a 10 minute short film where snoke dies and then luke dies and with all the stuff from vii that johnson threw out the window we have now went backwards in the story giving rian johnson complete creative control to do whatever he wanted is the reason this movie has the lowest rating of any star wars related film or tv show ever
Jul 4 2019,negative,what they did with luke jake skywalker was a terrible idea there are many other ways to pass down the reigns to the next generation also dont get me started with ray i dont need no training with drunk parents i see that no new great star wars films are going to be made subversion does not mean good also 
Jul 3 2019,negative,this is the worst star wars movie to date if you were expecting any character continuity even from the newly introduced characters look elsewhere or for a major retcon   the only good parts of it for me were mark hamills performance despite how horribly the writing was for a very beloved character luke skywalker far too many elements or the film either make no sense in the universe or were just plain bad  the solo star i give is to mark hamill for being a boss and putting in an amazing performance for the absolute trach script he was given and not to the film as i would give it a 05 if possible
Jul 3 2019,positive,i dont know where all of the negativity is coming from i absolutely loved this movie and also brought two of my friends who werent really into star wars to see it and now theyre in love with the franchise brings some lore into the movie and old characters stay true to the classic trilogy amazing
Jul 3 2019,negative,absolute drivel if you want to watch an hour long advert dont watch this one 
Jul 3 2019,positive,its great to see how johnson managed to create a solid well written screenplay who explores the feelings of the characters way better than the force awakens did visually perfect gorgeously directed with some little plot twists and except few plot holes a profound movie which helps the franchise to become a little more serious and professional
Jul 3 2019,negative,an overused mess of complete subversions of expectation character and franchise consistency are nowhere to be found unnecessary plot elements pad the runtime of this uninspired overly political story characters are either stupod or are very one dimensional with unearned benefits and other elements throughout would be very difficult to follow and will surely deter most fans
Jul 3 2019,negative,been a star wars fan my whole life and i never thought i could stop being excited for it before seeing that movie i could have payed to watch any star wars opening credit now i do not care for what comes next
Jul 2 2019,negative,disgusting mess of a movie   how this movie gets such a fresh rate here unbelievable
Jul 2 2019,negative,luke sucks the adventure is boring
Jul 2 2019,negative,movie sucked very overrated 
Jul 2 2019,negative,took everything star wars was and out it in a dumpster then lit it on fire worst creative directing ever horribly obvious plot holes worst choreography in any of the films you cant make a movie good enough to recover this trilogy or possibly the entire series
Jul 2 2019,negative,its a shitty movie
Jul 1 2019,positive,actually very good when you compare acting cinematography and overall storytelling its right up there with the best in this franchise 
Jul 1 2019,neutral,wow that was terrible
Jul 1 2019,negative,literally possibly the worst movie i have ever see story action characters direction acting all are atrocious and my favorite childhood saga is likely beyond repair
Jul 1 2019,negative,a really bad movie more than a star wars it is spaceballs 2 except its not funny but just painfully bad
Jul 1 2019,negative,this movie by itself is mediocre at best my friends and i can hardly keep awake in theatre yet the thing pissed off fans the most is not that its a bad movie but how little respect it shows to the star wars media that comes before it from what i have seen any fan that has indulged in some real good star wars media eg tcw kotor generally dislike this film intensely
Jul 1 2019,negative,it was not that good
Jun 30 2019,negative,it makes jarjar an oscar worthy 
Jun 30 2019,negative,one more plothole and the whole movie would have collapsed wich would have been a better outcome than this
Jun 30 2019,negative,starts badly and goes on getting worse 
Jun 30 2019,positive,the movie was great it was exactly how i thought it was going to be it wasnt however the hype it was built up too it didnt deliver what tfw promised
Jun 29 2019,negative,ivan ortegas edit was alot better do yourself a favour and go watch that one
Jun 29 2019,negative,if theres every been a movie in rt history that got this much love instead of taking the fact that fans hated this movie instead of honesty you see that theyve reseat audience score more than once now this movie is god awful and its breaks so much of the star wars that we know and love why this man was chosen and his decisions made it to the cutting room floor boggle my mind
Jun 28 2019,negative,i hated this horrible horrible movie it subverts exectatiosn by deconstructing star wars and replacing any predictable turn out by its exact opposite like paying for a house and getting sand really dissapointing
Jun 28 2019,negative,movie made no sense  an untrained person who can use the force and not yet a jedi is as powerful as the grandson of darth vader who was birthed by the force there was no sensible explanation for luke to be some old sour hermit how hates jedis  i still dont know what was the point of the movie except to destroy the star warsforce folklore  complete incoherent waste of time
Jun 28 2019,negative,star wars the last johnson was not good 
Jun 26 2019,negative,visually it was beautiful tonally and thematically it was terrible the plot doesnt make sense and the characters motivations were just awful rian johnson is a terrible starwars director and the management that let this travesty over the finishing line clearly dont care about starwars as a whole ruinef the future of a great story well done disney well done 
Jun 26 2019,negative,incredibly underwhelming with a plot that made absolutely no sense and no character building 
Jun 26 2019,negative,this movie as a standalone movie is ok but it adds nothing to the star wars saga and intentionally destroys previously established character development of luke skywalker rey snoke and to an extent kylo you probably already saw it but dont watch it again 
Jun 25 2019,negative,star wars the last jedi was a change from the typical star wars formula we dont get the tried and true story structure of previous films a deliberate decision by director rian johnson instead we get an incoherent mess of a plotline that drags for 25 hours and ends on a strangely happy note despite almost the entire resistance force being eradicated the comedy was forced the characters were underdeveloped and the conflicting severity and hilarity of the scenes lead to a misguided film that defies all convention in the star wars franchise despite the success of said conventions
Jun 25 2019,negative,not in my 40 years would i have ever dreamed of giving any star wars movie a failing grade but this one i feel whole heartedly deserves it i gave ray the benefit of the doubt in the force awakens and her relatively powerful force abilities with no training but they never drove her in any direction that faced adversity or really put her in any circumstance where she was anything other than a veteran of the force and really space travel in general coming from a desert planet to being instantly put in a position of life or death peril involving space flight or hand to hand combat she continues on a path where apparently she inherently has the life skills to become the next great jedi master there are too many plot holes and several literal unexplained characters and plot twists that serve so little point to the main story to list off this movie should have been the rough draft of which writers could sit down and critique and build the script off of to actually create a story with characters you could build an emotional bond with i think thats the biggest part of these new star wars movies thats missing theres no bond between the characters on screen and the fans watching it just feel very grey dull and color by numbers not to mention the complete crapping on anyall original characters from the real star wars movies even the droids get the cold shoulder including bb8 what purpose does he even serve any more the final installment of this star wars series is going to be trash and ill still watch it with just a glimmer of hope its not like they can kill any more of my childhood its already dead 
Jun 25 2019,negative,isnt a bad film by any stretch of the imagination    it is an abomination a detestable compilation of the biggest insults to original star wars fans that rian johnson and those responsible at disney could muster
Jun 25 2019,positive,truly blown away by this film 
Jun 25 2019,negative,worst scifi movie ever and rian johnson destroyed star wars with gravityfed bombers in space there there is no gravity and a long chase by ships with hyperdrives that dont use them to jump ahead this movie is horrible writing and directing    
Jun 24 2019,negative,omg you really think this is a star wars movie  this is a disgrace to the name  it is so badly written i thought that disney was pranking us and would jump out from behind a curtain two months after it came out and tell us they were just kidding thanks to this movie i will never see another sws movie again  if disney doesnt care enough about the franchise to let that movie be seen then it is only downhill from here  thanks for the memories george that is all they are now  
Jun 24 2019,positive,it was the best the could have setup after the force awakens although we didnt got snokes origin story
Jun 24 2019,positive,the last jedi isnt the best movie in the franchise but everything with luke rey and kylo easily make up for all of its shortcomings mark hammil is at the top of his game and steals almost every scene hes in the sound design is awesome the music is fantastic and the visuals are stunning moments in the film will stand out as some of my favorite in all of star wars the movie does feel a little long some of the storylines could have been cut out and i wouldnt complain but every choice made by the characters and some would say by the director supports the message of the movie we all make mistakes even the best of us its how we learn from those mistakes and what we do after they are made that matter
Jun 24 2019,negative,thanks for ruining everything we love about star wars ryan johnson 
Jun 23 2019,negative,not my star warsnot my luke
Jun 23 2019,negative,not only is this film bad for a star wars film its just generally a bad film its curious that the critic score is so high
Jun 23 2019,negative,awful plain and simple 
Jun 23 2019,negative,worst movie ive ever seen completely ruined the star wars saga for me yes it was that bad and no i am not a russian bot i am a life long star wars fan and i love the fantasy genre nothing about this movie was good from the first scene to the poorly performed and written final scenes this movie was nothing but suffering it is destined to be the next rocky horror picture show where true fans go as a goof the only time this movie brings me any joy is when i make fun of it watch videos of people making fun of it watching videos of people explaining how bad it was or not watching it at all 
Jun 23 2019,negative,its hard to be this bad like actually try write something and make it as bad as you can you wont beat this unless youre jkr and youre writing the crimes of grindelwald 
Jun 23 2019,positive,i know many people spoke negatively about it but i really enjoyed the film 
Jun 23 2019,negative,while watching you really question the raison dêtre of this movie 
Jun 23 2019,negative,as the second movie in a trilogy it just does not work  putting aside the plot holes inappropriate humor and illogical developments there is a bigger issue  how does mr abrams or disney or whoever plan a trilogy and then let a separate writerdirector drive the train anywhere he wants without a plan as to where the trip will end or what the trip is
Jun 22 2019,positive,the duty of the last of the jedi is its very challenging length which does not always justify itself in the second and a bit exhausting campaign some of the narrative arches that sprang in it could have been shortened without harming them and the feeling was that closer editing would have made the film final in the history of the saga in the meantime the fans and the experts will continue to argue about their nature and their historical place and as always only time will decide where they will eventually settle but it is safe to say that ryan johnson has succeeded in a particularly tough task the last of the jedi is not only a unique and beautiful film but also exciting smart surprising and amusing something irwin kirschner himself would have been proud of
Jun 22 2019,positive,star wars episode viii the last jedi is in my view the best star wars filmand the first great star wars filmsince the empire strikes back was released nearly forty years ago though some fanboys out there seem to disagree with me and the majority of critics who love the film thats fine but i wont bother addressing their gripes specifically as i dont find them the least compelling its directed by rian johnson who made another great scifi film looper in 2012 in the place of jj abrams who made the force awakens and he turns out to be the right person to put this storywhich revolves around a more compressed timeframe than other films in the seriesonto the screen including different pieces going the on at same time which brings much urgency to the situation like how irvin kershner who had replaced lucas on episode v was the right choice for that film also with a more compressed frame among other parallels this movie is much spectacle and also quite deep building on the legacy of the biggest sciencefiction movie franchise ever along with one of the best in very satisfying fashion      all the major surviving characters from awakens are back along with some interesting new ones with critical roles to play and like its predecessor the film finds a good the balance between young newer characters and the elder returning ones nothing seems forced and everyone gets his or her moments the array of female performers maybe more than any star wars film to date in particular shine in episode xiii the late carrie fisher getting a more substantial and interesting role than in episode vii and daisy ridley as rey continuing her strongwilled fascinating arc into potential jedihood and out of a nice array of new characters in important parts two are female the returning adam driver john boyega and oscar isaac solidify themselves into this universe too especially driver whose kylo ren i think will go down as the second most memorable villain in the star wars saga just behind darth vader of course luke played by mark hamill with all the buildup carried over from force awakens must be mentioned and his part is not disappointing including some delightful surprises everyone gets something to do thats a meaningful some make mistakes or act in ways that arent what wed consider heroic but that makes it a more human story and more satisfying at the end      as always in star wars films there arein addition to the new characters locations and technologies that build upon the universe weve known and loved for decadesnew ideas that are explored as well as older ones that are expanded upon yes even in the prequels had them those ideas just failed to be that memorable or interesting though i was more forgiving to those movies than many were the success of this film in the area of ideas is one of the biggest reasons why in this trilogy so far we are truly back on track in the star wars franchise     its pieced together with drama humor and wonder both with freshness and familiarity its an exciting intriguing journey the whole way through the last jedi tops the force awakens in many respects and ranks among the best science fiction films i have seen in recent years of course its not perfect even the best star wars films this included has had scripts underwhelming in parts but everyone from true star wars fans to those not generally big on the scifi genre should have a great time
Jun 21 2019,negative,i really really wanted to like this movie     but all it did was make the star wars universe smaller to me in comparison to the books that continued the stories this version of the story brought the saga down the lead characters are no longer the legends weve lived with for decades but pale shadows of what they once were     even the new protagonists introduced in the previous film were brought down and made less interesting i dont care about these characters anymore     like many i loved the original heroes i dont love this its just a massive disappointment that is a poor bookend for the once great saga 
Jun 21 2019,negative,this was a treat to the ears and visually breathtaking but thats as good as it gets after tfa i couldnt wait to see where they were taking it instead we get taken to canto bight by the time we get here i was struggling to enjoy this ride i bought the bluray and tried rewatching this and all i did was fast forward past this scene as it felt jarring and utterly distracting i also struggle to like other parts of the movie like the drawn out space chase the forced jokes urgent message to hux the hyperspace crash and general organas space walkabout etc    all that aside luke skywalker is one of my favourite characters and this movie did nothing for me it wasnt a fitting finale the return of the jedi was where it was at    i wanted to enjoy this film but right now its ranks as the worst of the saga imo maybe when the next film comes out it may improve some of the context in this film or retcon it may get a pass until then i cant see myself viewing this again in a long while
Jun 21 2019,negative,what a train wreck star wars was always my favorite franchise now i just dont even care what happens in this story anymore see ya star wars
Jun 21 2019,negative,made an account just to rate this embarrassing trainwreck
Jun 21 2019,negative,the worst starwars everrian johnson dont understand the spirit of starwars 
Jun 21 2019,positive,gave me even more hope that the star wars franchise writer directors might have the flexibility to pursue excellence over fan service 
Jun 21 2019,negative,this is not only the worst star wars movie ever made but the worst big budget film ever made the last jedi is not star wars its trash 
Jun 21 2019,negative,one star for the visuals the rest is an absolute trainwreck of ludicrous attempts at nostalgia and the butchering of beloved characters from the originals but what makes the film objectively bad are the plotholes and contrivances that would take several hundred pages to enumerate and explain bring your own fan theories and  head canon if you want to make sense of this abomination
Jun 20 2019,negative,visually entertaining 710  nice colors  have to watch in hd to fully enjoy  clean looking  storytelling 310  what the hell are the characters trying to do defeat the first order we dont have any background to how the fo got so strong and how the republic is so weak  character development sucks rey is boring finn serves no purpose as do several other characters old school heroes are lame  lore has been ruined the whole crash into an enemy fleet thing at hyper speed the ships just dont go fast they move across wormholes in the fabric of space and time  pointless side quests  
Jun 20 2019,negative,very bad movie reminds me of a futuristic harry potter movie with aliens very cheesy a movie only a little kid would love
Jun 19 2019,positive,people need to stop living in the past this was a great film 
Jun 19 2019,positive,despite the hate from the fan base of star wars i have only good things to say about this movie   amazing directions and screen writing excellent acting and character development   sure some parts are weird or pointless  snoke dying without us knowing anything of note about his backstory being one all in all its still a great movie  
Jun 19 2019,negative,complete disgrace to star wars worst then attack of the clones and just boring extremely disappointed
Jun 19 2019,positive,this movie granted was not what i wanted to see when i went to the movies all the qiuestions i had going into the movie were not only left unanswered they were gone as well because they no longer mattered like who is snoke when the movie was later released on netflix i gave it a second viewing knowing non of my questions would be answered i honestly was just bored and down to watch the kylo and rey montage scene and it was upon second viewing i enjoyed what i was watching the last jedi is a second viewing movie
Jun 19 2019,neutral,it was far from the worst star wars movie but i am astounded that it was rated that high with the critics
Jun 19 2019,negative,dont waste your timemoney 
Jun 19 2019,negative,what have you done to luke the film was a joke i honestly thought that i was seeing things let me be clear this character is not luke skywalker even mark hamill knows this character is not luke skywalker and he tried to tell us this until kathleen kennedy told him to shut up you can clearly see mark hamills sadness in the way they treated his beloved character in press conferences leading up to the film   there is so much wrong with this film from snokes death without knowing anything about his backstory reys parentage being nothing luke tossing his lightsaber over the cliff captain phasma being yet again a cameo and having no charcater development whatsoever and leia becoming mary poppins in space  however these problems take a backseat to the character of rose who is easily the worst character in all of the star wars films yes even worse than jar jar for most of the movie she is just an idealist moron who tells us that slavery is bad and saving animals is good i could literally go on for days to pick apart what an abomination this film is but the hatred for this movie from real star wars fans speaks volumes this will only get worse as now i am supposed to believe that the emperor will be making a comeback in the rise of skywalker even though darth vader clearly threw him 500 feet to his death whats next jabba the hut and the rancor from return of the jedi coming back to life
Jun 19 2019,positive,a fresh new take on star wars that not all fans were happy about but i was at first i didnt enjoy it that much but as i watched it several times i ended up really liking the film and the different version of luke and story that ryan johnson created
Jun 18 2019,negative,sadly this movie did nothing for true fans of star wars 
Jun 18 2019,negative,destroyed many concepts in the star wars universe  dumb plotline  badly written and poor character development 
Jun 18 2019,negative,complete and utter trash what they did to luke skywalker is unforgivable rian johnson and kathleen kennedy have destroyed star wars 
Jun 17 2019,negative,worst star wars movie of all time i was so disappointed 
Jun 17 2019,positive,tlj turns the galaxys greatest hero into a hardened hermit successfully the space opera heads in a new direction with multiple twists as it develops its characters both new and old though the quality fluctuates
Jun 16 2019,positive,a solid movie that could have been great i liked the first half more than the second half i liked how lukes character has changed and they didnt just do fan service but i didnt buy how his character didnt evolve a lot throughout the film that was my only major issue adam driver is absolutely amazing and steals the show his best performance to date ridley is better here than in force awakens in my opinion and i didnt mind the canto bight subplot i liked how johnson did something different and think the film is way over criticized but i understand that it could have been better still this is my second favorite film of the new star wars so far just behind rogue one
Jun 16 2019,positive,this is a great film the problem is that it is not a great star wars film
Jun 16 2019,positive,its a good movie calm down people whine and cry about these movies being a ripoff of the original i can see how people would call it a ripoff except its not its an homage to the original a very safe movie for disney crazy right a company wanting money for their biggest ip
Jun 16 2019,positive,there are certainly some flaws as there are in every movie including all of the star wars films but theres a lot to love about this it was overly criticized by a  toxic part of the star wars fanbase and trolls
Jun 16 2019,positive,star wars ofc high hopes for the upcoming ones
Jun 16 2019,negative,this new trilogy undoes all prior films and tlj goes out of its way to undo even what ep 7 does what a piece of shit
Jun 16 2019,negative,just shows how biased journalists and critics are when the rating is 91 on one hand but 44 from fans i absolutely hated it and i dont know how any real starwars fan could find it even decent
Jun 16 2019,positive,its fine good action and some really good ideas a little slow in some spots probably could have been a little shorter
Jun 16 2019,negative,cool cgi bro nearly every other area of moviemaking was shoved through production with poor oversight at best and sheer laziness andor incompetence at worst     gaping plot holes poor storytelling character devolution and amateur fightscene marking make this subtraction to the star wars universe hard to watch 
Jun 15 2019,negative,an absolute embarrassment it made me go back to rewatch the prequels and you know a movie is garbage when you prefer jarjar to any character in the new trilogy 
Jun 15 2019,negative,worst star wars with the worst director ever
Jun 15 2019,negative,the best thing about this movie you love the prequels afterward 
Jun 15 2019,negative,uhhhgghhwhat a disappointment ruin johnson really did shiit the bed when he came up with this polished turd of a sequel abhorrent storytelling glossed over with millions of dollars of shiny cgi  fx   when is hollywood going to learn    story is paramountwithout a good script a billion  in special effects wont save your film     cant wait to see what jar jar abrams comes up with from what i could gleam from the trailer  leaks disney might just have a fan apocalypse on its hands come christmas
Jun 14 2019,negative,i dont know what to say i guess i feel disappointing and bored
Jun 13 2019,negative,i love star wars however i cant forgive a bad or incoherent story its loud flashy the acting is pretty good with some notable exceptions but its also simply poorly written its too bad rogue one was a much better film with much more believable characters
Jun 13 2019,negative,a sad disappointment and nail in the coffin for disney star wars plenty of cringeworthy moments plots and characters 
Jun 13 2019,negative,train wreck of a film an embarrassment to the legacy of this once sacred franchise a serious disservice to mark hamill and the skywalker story on par with the miserable lucas prequels were still trying to forget happened 
Jun 13 2019,negative,questionally whether this was a cash grab for disney the film while providing some good moments thrills and action scenes the last jedi feels like a nostalgic copy and paste of the original trilogys the empire strikes back  it also introduces new characters but they feel underdeveloped and seem to not tie with the original cast and every conflict feels like its been forced to bring to the similar conclusion of the story   its too much of the same thing just modernised
Jun 12 2019,negative,due to its high budget the last jedi looks and sounds amazing clearly none of the budget went into its script unfortunately because the plot is riddled plot holes and is an inconsistent mess along with its characters the movies tone is all over the place characters are cracking jokes during serious scenes where peoples lives are at stake the action also has enormous problems theres one scene in which the choreography is flat out embarrassing and they literally edit out one of the enemies knives just so our protagonist doesnt die some praise this for being original but there were scenes that were clearly ripping off the empire stikes back and everything set up from the previous star wars movie the force awakens is practically thrown out of the window the movie damages the star wars franchise in general by breaking basic rules established in the universe it is baffling that the director was able to get his first draft appoved for a movie in one of cinemas most popular franchises the movie was so embarrassingly bad that it has practically destroyed any hope for the future of star wars which is ironic since hope is a huge thing in the franchise
Jun 12 2019,negative,rian johnson completely ruined a film franchise and whats worse is that this movie has set up a divide amongst fans avid supporters of this film blame their own kind for defending their right to love a franchise and refuse to acknowledge the blatant plot holes and fan disservice no amount of defense can hide the smear this film has had on the saga as a whole and completely ruined this sequel trilogy and its characters potential awful would rather watch attack of the clones on repeat 
Jun 12 2019,negative,this is the probably the worst movie of all time the visuals and the sound where the only good thing about this movie the rest of the movie makes no sense and shows no real value for any of the original characters the start of the movie only shows me that rian johnson has no clue how space works and no creativity he brings ww2 inspired bombers that make no sense as if technology has gone backwards in these movies the asian girl that was in the bomber further proves rian has o idea what happens in space   next we have what happens to leia one of the most ridiculous scenes to ever exist leia is blown up with fellow commanders of the resistance by the only 4 starships sent by the empire which makes no sense anyway since the empire never really gave a shit about about their soldiers she supposedly uses the force to return to the main ship never having any training of the force we know she had an aspect from luke in ep vi   we proceed to the fuel problem that arises out of nowhere making no sense and never having any previous mention of fuel problems that builds this absolute terrible movies plot   then we have luke who they decide to completely and utterly disrespect he does things that his character would never do he shows to have created kylo out of a vision which makes no sense at all  since in ep vi the whole movie was to turn his father back to being good he created the map in the first place so if he is needed he would return which was explained in ep vii   rey is just a mary sue of a character nobody can relate to her she somehow defeats the most powerful jedi to exist luke with no training what so ever she has no faults we have no reason to care about her since she will always somehow come out on top   also the throne room scene is just terrible snoke the biggest missed opportunity dies because he wasnt paying attention which was dumb the whole battle was so poorly choreographed and shows no visuals on how rey escapes the ship  rose was such a shit character that if u removed her the whole movie would have been better not because shes a woman just a shit character phazma was pointless and finally the story had way to many plot holes   finally we have lukes deathbasically inevitable makes no sense he creates an apparition on another planet only to die right after what was the point if he was going to die anyway why didnt he just go there they have managed to ruin the best character in the whole franchise mark hamill knew this and had wanted them to change it  disney has no idea how the lightsabers work especiallly when it comes to killing someone and how anakins lightsaber fucking turns on even the porg that was jumping on it when luke through it knew how it worked its the bar code looking thing at the center not the red button when any of the characters that where hit by any of the lightsabers only had flesh wounds with no amputations like in every star wars movie that existed before vii and viii the aliens where just there for decoration and had no importance at all the writing was lazy no care for any of the characters and somehow everyone had something convenient happen when they where in a difficult situation   disney should listen to the fans rather than generalize everyone as a misogynist or a manbaby or racist or sexist men love lead female movies when they are done right and not full of sjw bullshit  episode ix better be a good fucking movie and should fire rian johnson for how shit he made this movie and how he destroyed the star wars universe altogether
Jun 12 2019,negative,boring scattered overlypolitical the story line was mostly pointless terrible movie dont waste your time
Jun 12 2019,negative,rian johnson ruined the whole star wars universe with only one film the last jedi is a farce a parody and extremely badly written tones of plot holes and cringeworthy humor this film leaves not only a very bad taste in your mouth it also makes it impossible to care about future star wars movies and what is even worse the old star wars movies are highly damaged by this film rian johnson should never make a movie again  he should sell burgers or run a cleaning company but should  stay away from directing any movie anytime 
Jun 11 2019,neutral,the last jedi is rather nonsensical and has lots of set ups but no satisfactory payoffs 
Jun 11 2019,negative,im a fan of star wars since i was 7 years old it was so disappointing that i wanted the movie to end already at the middle so i could leave the cinema
Jun 10 2019,negative,my mother and i eagerly anticipated this move but thought it was meh despite the fact that most of the movie was actionfighting scenes we were bored why because we mostly didnt care much about what was happening why because there was not much character development and not enough humor other than rey upsetting the monklike inhabitants of the island by destroying things and bb8 scenes there were those cute little bird things with chewie and crystal foxes which seem to be in the movie more for toyvalue than anything else  not much storytelling aside from luke skywalker rey and kylo rens story mostly action if youre 13 thats probably fine the plot was pretty lame there was nothing original just the same regurgitated star wars tropes it was great to see carrie fisher back as leia but she was not given much of a part and she was in a coma  for a while no explanation of how she managed to not get blown up survive space exposure intact and then awaken from her coma the whole scene of going to find the master code breaker was lame they tried to reproduce the exotic famous cantina scene from original star wars but this time in a luxury environment that didnt work for the film they find a cell mate who just happens to be able to get them out of the jail cell just after they arrive well why was he there in the first place if he could leave anytime anywaythe characters of rey and kylo ren were wellacted but the story was missing somethingit seemed hollow mark hamills performance made watching the movie worth it he gives a powerful last performance for the only plot that has real teeth in this moviehis part in the turning of kylo ren to evil then he disappears at the end of the movie too bad because i cant imagine the next movie without him but it was a fantastic farewell for him the best part of the movie with the sunset echoing the original sunset in star wars episode iv on tatooine where he gazed out on the horizon as a naive teenager wondering where his future lay ahead of him why did he have to diedisappear when he clearly is not old given his fundamental importance of emotionally carrying this movie giving it some real weight his disappearance for no clear reason does not bode well for the franchise but i think he was given the farewell that he deserved ultimately this story was really about him with the rest of the movie being more of a distraction 
Jun 10 2019,negative,bad plot with some of the worst characterization ive ever seen slow pacing with some of the most ridiculous choices made by the director very inconsistent with the previous movie and overall really sloppy 
Jun 10 2019,negative,this movie was not made for me i guess ill always have the original trilogy
Jun 9 2019,negative,the hyperspace death move lost me luke was a hero not a hermit 
Jun 9 2019,negative,film stinks of sjw propaganda and empty ideals and morals no emotional connection to any characters and those who had the potential for some got their balls cut off poe dameron had a chance really but the subversion was laughable pathetic and disappointing    plot in general has so many holes it would make swiss cheese jealous
Jun 9 2019,positive,this movie defines excellence and yes its got few issues but overall its just so good for me its better than tfa for sure
Jun 9 2019,negative,there arent words for how bad this movie is the only way to save this movie is for the next one finn wakes up from his coma which lasted like 1 day and realize it was all a dream 
Jun 9 2019,negative,i have been a fan of star wars my entire life i even own original vhs of the original trilogy prespecial edition this movie stands on its shoulders and pretends it got here on its own  the last jedi is an insult to the mythology story and heart of star wars ripping g out the soul of one of the franchises most beloved characters it uses the phrase let the past dies kill it if you have to which this movie has done it chooses to pretendd that the other movies do not exist and makes an attempt to kill it aside from the utter assassination of a beloved franchise this move is structurally and functionally flawed the pacing is all over plot lines go no where character hide things with no clear reason or motive at the detriment of their own goals there is a maximum of 2 stand out moments that are shallow and shot lives  bad movie and an insulting star wars movie
Jun 9 2019,positive,ill be in the minority here cause many fans hated tlj i liked it way better than tfa it had actual lessons to be learned from the story and ren who i thought was lame in the first movie more than made up for it here sure this movie has some weak points but i liked that they at least took chances here 
Jun 8 2019,negative,terrible all around they took the characters and through their entire story arches out the window that blue milk bs was terrible for luke him being a little bitch for half the movie was enough for me to say do not watch it
Jun 8 2019,negative,im just disappointed that there isnt a 0 star option 
Jun 6 2019,negative,poppins leia and general colored hair zoom to action with a battle plan so secret no one knows it unfortunately they are too slow to cover the giant plot holes in this scifi drama
Jun 6 2019,positive,for any child of the 80s star wars in any form is nostalgic  if you had hbo you may have seen the original trilogy 100s of times  the last jedi is a throwback  its a good feeling even if it may be a bit too long and meandering and not all that original  star wars plays the hits and the hits are damn good  final score 7210
Jun 6 2019,negative,terrible just terrible nonsensical story telling 
Jun 6 2019,negative,worst movie of all times
Jun 6 2019,negative,the greatest disgrace of the 21st century
Jun 6 2019,negative,this movie is plagued with every sin in the movie business  bad writing bad directing bad acting really bad acting forced humor political massages done in bad taste    if you are a star wars fan this feels like a middle finger if you arent youll be lost most of the time and be asking why most of the time  this will go down in history as the sundering of star wars
Jun 6 2019,negative,lack of continuity bad story telling  
Jun 5 2019,negative,one of the most disappointing star wars movies of the entire series and i normally love all star wars movies
Jun 5 2019,negative,this film sucked in so many levels great job at ruining star wars folks
Jun 5 2019,positive,could have benefited from being more story given it place in its world and its place in the trilogy in our world however the arc and depth of its characters studies with our protagonist and villain was extremely compelling
Jun 5 2019,negative,even worse than force awakens which is slightly better this is the worst star wars so far anyone saying these two newest movies keep the sw spirit alive has good characters and good character development is lying to your face all these good reviews are either paid off or know nothing of star wars
Jun 5 2019,negative,i was a big fan of star wars this film is a disappointment however what they did with skywalker was terribleray just came out of nowhere with powers and skills without trainingjust some of the plot holes
Jun 5 2019,negative,it was really boring the plot didnt seem to follow what the force awakens or return of the jedi set up not a fun experience
Jun 5 2019,positive,while this movie isnt perfect its not terrible either definitely brought down by stupid character decisions that were only made to further the plot doesnt set the table well for episode 9 but the movie is still competent
Jun 4 2019,negative,its as if the director rian johnson hates star wars and intentionally made this move awful 
Jun 4 2019,positive,almost perfect definitely had some bad parts like the finn and rose storyline and i wish kylo or rey fully committed to going to the other side this would be something we havent really seen in a sw film but this movie puts me on an emotional ride like no other one and adam drivers acting is superb i love the theme of failure and not giving the audience what they want i got one didnt feel like they betrayed lukes character just made him evolved in a believable way 3rd favorite star wars movie 
Jun 4 2019,negative,as a lifelong fan of star wars who has always been able to ignore bad acting or weak plot for the sake of the overall story i couldnt suspend my disbelief while watching this film it felt like right as id be about to settle in and start enjoying it there would be a scene or some dialog that completely shook me out of my disbelief again the icing on the cake was the movie saying hyperdrive ramming was good despite it rendering pretty much every single other movie obsolete by simply existing but an incredibly similar self sacrifice to save everyone minutes later was bad ironically by saying the later sacrifice was bad the first sacrifice meant literally nothing 
Jun 4 2019,negative,this has got to be one of the worst movies created in history 
Jun 4 2019,negative,terrible movie one of the worst movies ive ever seen
Jun 4 2019,negative,disney completely ruined episode 8 nothing makes really sense rian johnson subvirted the expectations of some youtube theoreticians good for you rian 
Jun 4 2019,positive, its alright sort of alright it wouldve been much better without the director ryan johnson 
Jun 4 2019,negative,an insult disgrace and rotten for every one in every sense
Jun 3 2019,negative,complete disregard for the iconic lightsaber flat and disturbingly childish characters in some cases copied and pasted from the earlier films choppy story telling and a new low for one of our favourite characters from the original trilogy if you dont watch films to be invested in them this is for you
Jun 3 2019,negative,they destroyed luke why why whythis movie needs to be removed from star wars cannon
Jun 3 2019,positive,most epicand meaninful movie of the saga
Jun 3 2019,negative,great end fight scene  everything else either trashed the memory of star wars or threw away the character development from the force awakens
Jun 3 2019,negative,i wouldve bumped the rating up a half star if luke had actually fought kyle ren instead of dodging him and not actually being there this movie was not good and it was very disappointing
Jun 3 2019,negative,this movie literally killed the star wars franchise for me 
Jun 3 2019,negative,i never thought they would make a feministsjw star wars movie i thought star wars were beyond that but they did and they killed everything that made star wars great    its an evil movie that pisses on the star wars fans
Jun 3 2019,neutral,more a parody of a star wars movie
Jun 3 2019,negative,one of the worst movies ever made 
Jun 3 2019,negative,after a long time i still want to erase the day i saw that movie i love star wars but this is not star wars i still dont know what did i see
Jun 3 2019,negative,would rate 0 stars if possible worst cinematic experience of my life a stain on one of my favorite childhood memories 
Jun 2 2019,negative,tlj is a terrible movie in my opinion the actions that luke took in this movie seemed completely out of charachter for him luke saw the good in everyone even his father yet he couldnt see the good in his nephew its dumb most of the characters are unlikable or have incredibly preachy dialog i could go on and on but in conclusion i really dont like this movie 
Jun 2 2019,negative,star wars the last jedi is not my favorite sw movie ever ill start with that did i hate it absolutely not did i love it no not really its a solid entry with some epic action and superb visuals my main objection is the wacky humor in the first half of it to me it makes the movie feel less empire strikes back and more jar jar stepping in bantha poop dawn said she thought i meant it wasnt reverent enough to the more serious aspects of the saga the second half though absolutely epic and perfectly done do i recommend it to star wars fans yes definitely see this it is important to the ongoing story and a lot happens in it to advance the story does it represent the sw franchise the best of any of other seven movies for newbies no its not the one you should use to introduce anyone to this universe in the end i liked the force awakens more but this was leagues better than the three prequels plus luke does some badass jedi trickery toward the end see and enjoy it for being part of the overall story but dont expect to be blown away like you were when you first saw empire almost 40 years ago 
Jun 2 2019,negative,it did to the star wars franchise what the crystal skull did to the raiders of the lost ark plot was a mess it didnt develop characters and had pointless gotcha moments that detracted from any hope of a narrative arc it was worse than the phantom menace
Jun 2 2019,negative,terrible plot  horrible acting literally a remake with politically correct pretensions
Jun 2 2019,positive,a new and fresh take on the typical star wars formulaa must see
Jun 2 2019,negative,i hate this movie i think it try to hard to match with the empire strike back and it totally fail
Jun 2 2019,negative,rubbish  the end of starwars its just aimed at 12 year olds now 
Jun 2 2019,negative,completly trash  i love sw but this made me laugh
Jun 2 2019,positive,maybe not the story we wanted or expected but most certainly the story i needed the last jedi manages the nearimpossible act of both completely subverting the classic storytelling mechanics of the franchise while affirming maybe better than any film since return of the jedi the core themes of the series the movie uses a deft resonant metatextual script to tell a story about the indomitability of hopeof perseverance against both impossible expectations and the oppressive weight of almost certain failure its in both acknowledging and surviving failure the movie insists that we can transcend it and it channels these concepts through the character of luke skywalker unlike benkylo who is so deadened by his failings that he has become a sort of ultimate nihilist luke learns that inaction is just crippling as defeat in choosing to reconnect with the force luke regains his sense of purpose and hope at its heart beneath the unfamiliar tone and uncomfortable character turns burdened it should be noted by the narrative choices established in the force awakens the last jedi is a call to armsless a soap opera than a story about human frailty and the almost superhuman feat of carrying on i fully acknowledge the broader criticisms and can see with plenty of sympathy why people are cold on this movie but the last jedi felt more complete to me than any star wars entry since empire 
Jun 2 2019,negative,the movie effectively broke 4 decades of lore it was so very disappointing 
Jun 2 2019,negative,reminded me of a saturday morning cartoon
Jun 1 2019,negative,i love star wars  but this was tough to watch  bad story bad acting  disney has ruined star wars  maybe they can improve in the future  
Jun 1 2019,negative,total and utter trash 
Jun 1 2019,negative,easily one of the worst movies that i have ever seen the story is such a snoozefest and not only is the tone all over the place but so is the quality of the film there are so many universebreaking moments such as the holdo maneuver characters reset between episode 7 and 8 and then again within episode 8 there is no tangible growth rey is treated like a god and never given an opportunity to grow as a character which is totally robbing from her the arc that she deserves this is not even mentioning the total disrespect that this film has for the character of luke skywalker there is no real explanation from his shift from a hopeful man whonsees the good in people to a wouldbe childmurderer its sickening to turn a character people look up to into an awful person but more importantly its even worse when there is no tangible reason given or evolution deevolution shown
Jun 1 2019,negative,having jj abrams write a story and then turning to rian johnson to fill in and write his own story and then giving the direction of story back to jj abrams to finish the triology is  a terrible idea last jedi destroyed fan favorite luke skywalkers character for all those who waited decades for his character to reappear it was heartbreaking especially if you wanted to see him actually use his lightsaber to go against some first order     the dumb plot of losing fuel what was pointless was the leader of the rebels not telling her whole crew what she was doing  didnt make sense  trying to add unnecessary suspensethus causing an unnecessary mutiny     snoke was a pointless character because of this film  whatever jj abrams was trying to do w the intrigue snoke and his background was rendered pointless by the last jedi directorwriter rian johnson    the lightsaber scene between rey and ben was cool and unique    i enjoyed force awaken but i really disdain last jedi
Jun 1 2019,negative,worst star wars movie of all time in history
May 31 2019,negative,give rian johnson credit for making an unforgettable movie  it has been a year and a half and i still think about how much i hate it  its like the meal that gives you food poisoning you never forget and just looking at it makes you nauseated   
May 31 2019,negative,the pacing was horrible the plot was all over the place and the new characters were horrible especially rose
May 31 2019,negative,what a piece of garbage
May 31 2019,negative,finally got around to seeing this and it was a major disappointment  not sure where theyre going with the franchise but i can confidently say i no longer care
May 30 2019,negative,killed the franchise divided the fan base and killed my childhood hero luke skywalker and turned him into a character i couldnt recognize terrible story writing just look at the reviews 44 rotten its the worst rated star wars movie ever and thats a fact  this is the movie that ruined star wars for a lot of fans including myself if you think this is a decent movie then youve obviously never seen the original trilogy thanks disney
May 30 2019,negative,not good  disappointing at best it completely disregarded the build up from the force awakens which i loved ive always been a massive fan of star wars from the beginning but sadly tlj let me down 
May 30 2019,negative,if the force awakens was elementary schoolyard fanfiction  the last jedi is the deep thought provoking and clever fanfiction writing of a teenager in junior high  ill just list off the problems i had with the movie  general hugs  did anyone find that funny  its like they saw a mcu movie and thought yea we can do that humor  the whole smarmy mmm i dont have a plan theres no plan stop asking me if we have a plan oh is that a mutiny mmm  well guess what mmm  i actually had a plan bet you are surprised mmm act  from cpt blue hair is just why  it didnt add any suspense to the story  it didnt make the movie long space ship chase any better it only made me dislike her character so much so that at the end when she rammed the ship into the other ship i was just like okaybye  its not clever that wasnt a twist  the leia thing  come on man  it would have been better to send off her character if she was left in space  it would have been harsh it would have been hard hitting boom just like that gone  but you wanted to do a crummy fake out because you think thats what makes great writing  imagine if ned starks head just floated back onto his neck and he was like yass im okay  and grrm was like haha nope im going to destroy this character too  was that scene supposed to be deep and emotional the flying through space thing  casino thing didnt provide anything  lucas did a better job at this with the podracing nonsense in the phantom menace   thanks for making yoda reappear but as a mischievous riddle muppet real nice  classy  thanks for the soap opera meets anime encounter between finn and phasma real cool for making the characters that are actual good have minor parts  wow the great big bad sith lord killed just like that okay  neat  glad that went somewhere  darth maul was a more intricate character than that  thanks for destroying lukes character  and again with the cool characters being under utilized thanks for under utilizing finn that character who used to work for the enemy  yeah better not develop his character or keep him near rey would be ashamed if he were to outshine your cardboard lead  it must be noted that my main beef with this movie is the writing  i believe the actors did the absolute best they could with the script they were given  its not the actors fault that rose was a terrible character  and as far as the visuals go its easy for a company as large as disney to make the visuals and cgi look good  so its hard to commend them for it    
May 30 2019,negative,short and sweet i hated what they did with this entry of this trilogy and i have almost no interest in seeing the next one this is what happens when a corporation values money over art and creativity but lets keep selling everything to them anyway rip my favorite franchise of all time
May 29 2019,negative,the film feels like a fanmade film more restriction should have been placed on rian johnson and he should have followed the plans set out be jj abrams
May 29 2019,negative,this movie was horrendous what a disaster theres a whole part of the story with fin that doesnt even really matter wheres the petition to do this movie over again jeez 
May 29 2019,negative,this movie was an insult to the intelligence of star wars fans it completely undoes everything jj abrams wonderfully set up in the force awakens a movie in which i really enjoyed and was excited to see where the story would go there are awful character decessions and plot holes rian johnson does that make no sense like leia now being somehow able to float in midspace this being never set up in any other star wars film there is an entire 30minute scene with finn and rose that entirely could have been cut out that was dull and served no purpose to the plot the movies only saving grace is the action scenes can be exciting and visually some the planets look beautiful mainly the final planet called crait   overall this movie is a complete disappointment after an exciting twoyear wait hopefully jj abrams can undo the damage that has been done here in the rise of skywalker
May 29 2019,positive,the last jedi is a flawed film but i enjoy it very much
May 29 2019,negative,it wasnt good in theater  very disappointing  all star wars fans are very upset over this and i am right there with them  
May 28 2019,positive,i really enjoyed this movie this movie had amazing acting the cgi looked amazing and the humor in it was good i hate seeing this movie get panned because they added a couple new characters and luke getting killed off i thought the way that luke was killed off was very heroic and amazing luke really didnt have a purpose anymore to stick around what else would you expect him to do people that watch these movies always expect a perfect star wars movie that lives up to their expectations and dont focus on what the other people want to see overall this movie was awesome in my opinion
May 27 2019,negative,cant fully express how awful this was so bad in every way i want to give it 0 stars plot made no sense new characters were hateable humors tone was way off and felt like it was written by a middle schooler tried a few viewings to find something i liked and got nothing 
May 27 2019,negative,really bad this is not star wars
May 27 2019,negative,an absolute stinker with a shiny outer coat good performances good direction good visuals terrible story feels like it was created by someone with no understanding of andor no love for the ip     i can understand the desire to try something new but the main saga isnt the place to do that that story thread is now broken beyond repair not that the force awakens had been a particularly good setup a sad stumbling end to what was once the greatest cinematic story ever told 
May 27 2019,positive,when a character is in danger you  feel that danger theres something about the craftsmanship in this one but the movie has a lot of comedy to
May 27 2019,negative,they should take the remaining bluray copys out to the desert and bury them next to the et atari cartridges
May 27 2019,negative,star wars the last jedi dishonors the sagas rich legacy while adding some really lame social justice elements  and completely does not deliver all the emotionrich action fans could hope for they pretty much ruined the franchise and took away any desire to see another star wars movie i just dont care about that stupid animal racing side story the purple haired lady who made horrible decisions and broke the entire star wars universe with her light speed attack or any of the other lame characters who make me want to fall asleep this movie sucked so hard 
May 27 2019,negative,disney knows that half the population of the world has an iq under 100 and that is who they sell to most people dont understand plot holes and plot armor and disney takes full advantage of that 
May 27 2019,negative,worst star wars ever
May 27 2019,negative,disappointing an example of liberal hollywood forcing their ideals on us they know better how we should think and feel this was not only a bad movie but a hit job on characters plots and a universe we have loved since childhood 
May 27 2019,negative,i despise this entry and to me its clone wars level bad
May 26 2019,negative,toxic film shame on them
May 26 2019,positive,parts i liked i really liked however there are many parts i didnt like which were really bad 
May 26 2019,positive,good plot and insanly good artwork
May 25 2019,negative,perhaps one of the worst star wars movies to date  they lost the star wars appeal completely with this installment
May 25 2019,negative,they betrayed luke as a character
May 25 2019,negative,one word  horrible
May 25 2019,negative,worse movie of the franchise so far didnt feel like star wars in any way tried to be too smart for it own good subverting expectations thinking it was introducing new ideas all while really only doing the same thing it also felt vary dishonoring to luke skywalker im all for character growth but many of us who last saw him in rtj expected something more from the jedi who was supposed to start it all back up made the ot seem pointless 
May 25 2019,negative,not only the worst star wars but one of the worst movies ever made dont believe the critics they are paid by the studios
May 25 2019,negative,incredibly awful a real misstep for the franchise horrible story writing
May 24 2019,negative,i realy didnt like this movie because it is nothing with nothing luke is an idiot jn this movie and the story is not how i espected in my opjnion it is the worst star wars movie
May 24 2019,negative,this was terrible stop disrespecting the fans like this disney dont ever let this happen again
May 24 2019,positive,i saw this twice in the theater  i love this movie  after force awakens introduced us to rey  company i was hoping they continued in great compelling story  i was not disappointed  the movie is full of surprises that youre not expecting  thats what i really like about it  its not stuck in a rut of youre going to see the same things weve always seen and they arent afraid to kill off characters  since ive purchased the bluraydigital ive watched it at least a dozen more times  it makes me thirst for more of these characters and wonder where they will go next when episode ix arrives
May 24 2019,negative,this was badreally bad an abomination just pretend it never existed
May 24 2019,negative,worst star wars movie i have ever seen no previously made questions were answered no character development no real fight scenes no continuity with what all star wars movies have shown us about the force and how to use it rey is really good with the lightsaber just cause she didnt have any training whatsoever and is already more powerful that kylo who actually did train and has been training all his life
May 23 2019,negative,repetitive dragging everyone kinda knows this 
May 23 2019,negative,i will start with what i liked the light saber fight in the throne room was very well done thats pretty much it  it was what i would have expected from a mediocre fan fiction  not from a big budget star wars film  so many things in it that made no sense and added almost nothing to the story  you could have left finn who could have been the most interesting character in the entire trilogy and rose completely out of the film and it wouldnt have mattered  i hated how luke was treated  the only way i could see luke turning into what he was in this film was if he believed that he had killed his nephew  then i could understand him turning his back on the force and everyone out of shame  but they didnt do that  they keep introducing new force powers that are well beyond anything we have seen before without precedent to explain it  ultimately i am okay with some subversion of expectations but you dont do that in the 8th chapter of a 9 chapter story
May 23 2019,negative,only good thing is the special effects they ruined star wars
May 23 2019,negative,sorry once again this is not the universe of lucas  the movie is just a collection of action and scifi scenes with little meaning  the last ship the last rebels the last bomb  an important character like snoke is obliterated in one rush
May 23 2019,negative,had hope that it could build from the last film but it didnt awful plot acting characters and scenes that made no sense nothing memorable at all happens and i couldnt care less about the next film
May 22 2019,negative,easily the worst star wars movie ever worse than the clone wars animated movie the prequels and the force awakens so much is wrong with this movie on a fundamental level
May 22 2019,negative,they toss out fan favorite characters and try to shove uninteresting new characters down your throat    luke barely does anything and we spent the entire previous movie looking for him
May 22 2019,positive,canto bight sucked why did they kill off snoke
May 22 2019,negative,not my star wars incoherent story logic makes this unwatchable
May 22 2019,negative,where to begin from a critics perspective i can see why this is highly rated however as a fan it was terrible the plot and sub plots are bad the only reason i give it one star is rey and kylo really grew as characters everything else was bad
May 22 2019,negative,visualy one of the best storytelling and especialy a feeling for the right moment for a joke are way of it was painful to watch the first time it got better the second time since the shock wasnt as bad though it it was still bad
May 22 2019,negative,visually pretty but the story only works in a silo ignoring episode 7 and even then it is pretty weak any buildup on characters in the force awakens have been totally abandoned and all plotlines are mostly left for new onesonly rey appears to be a star in both episodes and even her story takes an unnecessary twist looks like movie directors forgot that a good twist has its own subtle buildup that you sneak past the audience because of red herrings not just randomly tacked onto the butt of a pinata
May 22 2019,negative,the worst movie ive ever seen its a huge amount of crap this is not a star wars movie its a nightmare
May 21 2019,negative,this was a bad movie its my opinion only but i remember the feeling of exhilaration when i watched episode 4 as an 11yr old the force awakens rekindled much of the vibe of the original movie and set us up for more rian johnson made a pigs breakfast of the last jedi the thing that confuses me most is the disparity between the critics review and the audience score im counting on jj to rescue the brand and give it back to the fans
May 21 2019,negative,this movie personally insulted me on so many levels i get angry every time i think of this bs i was forced on grrrrrrr
May 21 2019,negative,1 star   how does google have this rated as 71 when all i hear is how bad this movie is
May 20 2019,negative,rian johnson murdered star wars
May 20 2019,negative,this movie completely ruined the star wars feel and should be grated as anyone over the age of 9 can see that there are a lot of holes in the plot horrible emotional toning with simultaneously attempting humor while attempting serious emotion this was not fun to watch and despite the incredible cg it just cant make up for the character flaws plot inconsistencies and forced political messages written by rian johnson i hated this moive
May 20 2019,negative,good visuals but some of the worst strategic decisions i have ever seen in any movie ever bad writing bad writing and  cringeinducing scenes
May 20 2019,negative,subverting expectations doesnt equate to art without an observance of a convincing explanation for your decision to jump off the cliff
May 20 2019,negative,heartbreaking to see the heroes of the story we grew up to turned into punchlines for jokes and gotcha moments that would still be okay if it was justified with a story but honestly  it feels like the corporates in a hurry to kill off the older characters so they can launch their second mcu without any worries some brilliant visuals are the only positive point of this film the script and the intent its biggest villain
May 19 2019,negative,honesty i have been a star wars fan all my life and this shit is just embarrassing i have never seen a movie i probably have that has been filled with so much disappointment disney is pumping out these movies way too quickly and not stopping for a moment to think how much these movies are ruining star wars this movie had so much potential characters like snoke had potential at times but they just fuck it up killing him off before you even get to see anything and i mean anything about him luke what even is luke he could see the good in darth vader in the originals but cant see it in kylo ren and tries to fucking kill him the fuckkkkk the only good thing in this movie is kylo ren only good character thats what the half star is for
May 19 2019,negative,i left a review of this movie when it first came out i dont understand why my review is not in the list of movies i reviewed so i will try again i heard that if you give a movie 12 a star it is not counted   so i will try again   i am a huge life long star wars fan as a kid waiting for the news star wars movie to come out was like waiting a lifetime with the prequels i mostly liked them they were star wars to me even though i felt they had so many cringe worthy scenes   i liked the force awakens it had some issues but i liked it but i actually hated this movie for me to say i hated a star wars movie says a lot to anyone who knows me the story the characters i liked the new characters the force awakens  the breaking from all the rules of star wars was so bad i am blown away but it was what they did to luke skywalker was unforgivable
May 19 2019,positive,honestly i dont get all the hate its a solid movie the force is really well utilized in this one more so than any of the past movies
May 19 2019,negative,while force awakens wasnt perfect it introduced compelling characters and interesting story points  considering this and a nearly unlimited amount of resources to work with this is the worst movie ever made  a middle finger to what used to be good about star wars
May 19 2019,negative,not just the worst star wars movie but possibly the worst movie ever made seriously
May 18 2019,negative,perhaps my least favorite star wars movie even episode 5 beats it so many sudden plot twists that arent executed well ex snokes death leia using the force that girl at the end stops fin from saving everyone idiotically also rey still has 0 memorable character qualities
May 18 2019,negative,the ultimate mary sue narrative coupled with a complete lack of respect for the franchise 
May 18 2019,positive,although i would have gone a different way  i loved this movie  shame on the haters  i mean come on rating it a 12 star or 1 star
May 18 2019,negative,so much wrong it could take a book to explain it all the writer seems to have been given a list of boxes that needed ticking and scenes and characters just got thrown into the movie for no reason other than to tick the boxes no real effort to integrate these into the movie in a way that makes them work and therefore make them less noticeable so they are noticeable infuriatingly so for many people    the ridiculously fast development of reys powers is so far over the top its reminiscent of people on multiplayer games who spend tons of money getting all the good gear and powers without earning them we dont get much of a sense of accomplishment when rey turns up and just wins
May 18 2019,negative,disappointing especially reys training
May 17 2019,negative,still not really sure what the point of this movie was low speed space chase pointless side quest to mos vegas grumpy luke was this a sequel to 7 or some really bad stand alone fanfilm oh and im female and a fan since 77 my very liberal 20 year old hates it too  no manbabies here the movie just sucked simple as that
May 17 2019,negative,there are so many reasons that rian johnsons star wars the last jedi was garbage but i will only list one the way the director and disney treated mark hammill and luke skywalkers character was actually offensive to me jj abrams basically served up the most easy well intended and fan serving storyline involving luke that anyone could hope to get and johnson basically took that and said nah screw the fans screw the lore and screw mark hammill if you watch this movie keep that in mind
May 17 2019,negative,this movie is utter and absolute garbage
May 17 2019,positive,overrated by critics underrated by audience
May 16 2019,positive,loved the movie will watch again it is good to watch again
May 16 2019,negative,310 the prequel trilogy had rough effects poor acting and cliche dialogue yet the seeds of an epic story this was the inverse visuals were amazing acting was on point but the story bends over backwards for political messaging and often times does make sense of or explain what is happening characters look the part on the outside yet i couldnt care less what becomes of them or this trilogy
May 16 2019,negative,as long time and diehard star wars fan since i was 6 years old this was the worst star wars movie by far it had a couple of good parts like the silent hyperspace jump and the opening scene but it was riddled with plot holes poor acting untimeless dialogue and a whole bunch on gendersexand cultural based biases the were multiple instances where the concept of equality and gender neutrality was forced into parts of the movie that didnt reinforce the plot at all all of this lead up to a lackluster lightsaber fight this is a star wars movie for petes sake a star wars is meant to be timeless something that people can watch 40 years from now and still enjoy not riddled with terrible mainstream jokes and forced social issues very disappointed in disneys direction with this one it very much shows that a big commercial conglomerate can ruin a potentially great movie however i am glad that the decision was made to have jj abrams direct episode 9 i think he did a good job with episode 7 and that he can fix the mess tat was the last jedi
May 16 2019,negative,worst film ever sharknado is better
May 16 2019,negative,really i mean  reallly
May 16 2019,negative,minor spoilers  everything that was bad about the force awakens and make no mistake tfa was a bad movie is even worse in the last jedi the story makes no sense the new characters are poorly written and the old characters have been butchered into sad empty reflections of their former selves  this is especially true with the skywalker twins with leia being reduced from a crafty tomboy to a tactically inept geriatric that flagrantly lets her own subordinates die and taking luke from a spirited optimistic hero to a suicidal hermit who wouldnt lift a finger to save anyone  at the rate the movies are progressing the next movies looking to be an absolute trainwreck
May 16 2019,negative,why oh why this should be legends the scene with yoda is the only one i really enjoyed in the whole movie people kept telling me i was blind to the beauty of this film so i watched it three times in the movie theater the actors are not the issue at all its the direction of at all rian johnson please stay away from star wars
May 15 2019,negative,pretty bad in nearly every way
May 15 2019,positive,it was an amazing movie though there were a few scenes that could have omitted due to the lack of relevance to the movie
May 15 2019,negative,star wars the last jedi is plagued with many issues whether its the horrendous pacing terrible additions to the lore and terrible twists that go nowhere rian johnsons entry into the star wars universe ultimately is about burning things down the pacing in this movie is all over the place as certain sequences are similar to slamming the breaks on a car the terrible additions to the lore such as weaponized hyperspace completely break the universe and the terrible twists included might be unexpected but sadly dont lead to anywhere more interesting 
May 15 2019,negative,rian johnson casually ruins one of the worlds most beloved film series just a reckless mess the only thing that comes close was watching notre dame burn
May 14 2019,negative,not only is this star wars full of more nonsense that saddled the force awakens its incredibly boring and tedious 25
May 14 2019,negative,rian johnson ruined everything that was set up by jj abrams in the force awakens
May 14 2019,negative,rian johnson demolished the star wars legacy in a manner i never thought possible what a terrible take on one of the most precious franchises and a true killer of fond childhood memories worst star wars movie in any possible sense wont watch anything rian johnson touches in the future
May 14 2019,negative,quite the insufferable mess  just read all these other reviewsmost agree on reasoning
May 14 2019,negative,beautiful visuals and great cinematography are not going to save this movie it is the weakest of the star wars saga a film that decided the fan base like nothing before the true problem of this film is the title star wars has it been made under any other moniker it might have worked
May 14 2019,positive,i applaud the choice to subvert all expectations of not only star wars but trilogy storytelling in general
May 13 2019,negative,a beautifully made bungle complete with a vacuous wandering narrative awful attempts at comedy and dozens of worldbreaking events throwing the cinematic universe of star wars into a postmodern crisis of meaning we would all be much better off if this movie had never been made quality acting and beautiful sets simply cannot make up for the tragic immolation of so much content built up over the last 40 years utter irresponsibility on behalf of disney
May 13 2019,negative,really rotten tomatoes 91 rating the last jedi is the worst movie of the franchise and the worst movie of 2017 tag and bink has a better plot line wish i could give the last jedi a negative 5 star review
May 13 2019,negative,definitely the worst film of the franchise
May 13 2019,negative,i liked the movie well enough on the first viewing aside from the writers take on luke skywalker  however i found very little to delight in while rewatching the last jedi  what is star wars for if not to bring joy through cinematic storytelling  the visuals music and casting were all fantastic but the story could be improved on
May 13 2019,negative,absolutely terrible star wars addition with no redeeming qualities
May 12 2019,negative,dun dun dunalun dun dun dunalan dun dun done watching star wars as long as the characters are planks of wood that can know everything better than x character that is an expert or master
May 12 2019,positive,people are being way to butthurt yeah there are women and people of color get over it
May 12 2019,negative,probably the most jarring and hilarious disaster of a movie in all of star wars its like the director deliberately tried to troll the entire fanbase by picking the most dumb and irritating directions for the film and then deciding the rest by a dart toss you havent lived until you seen carry fischers corpse flying through space in the superman pose
May 12 2019,positive,obviously great soundtrack but also astunding sounddesing incredible cinematograpgy and stunning visuals intense and great acting alright story with believable characters few out of character or out of logic decisions
May 12 2019,negative,perhaps not as bad as some people make it out to be however one of my least favourite all time star wars films overall after the force awakens and rogue one which i truly enjoyed i was totally primed to see this film once the end credits started to roll i found that i was trying to convince myself i liked it and ultimately conceded to myself that i didnt really     main things that i didnt care for      left confused about the reason for reys journey to meet luke one of the main focuses of tfa      the build up and subsequent sudden and anticlimactic death of the big bad felt unfulfilling although this death could have been a red herring      a trip by two characters to a planet that takes up a significant portion of the film feels out of place and ultimately ends up having no purpose      the attempted epic send off for the ultimate star wars hero falls flat on its face dissapointing     there are quite a few other issues as well but those are the ones that really stand out at the end of the day id say it ranks somewhere around episode 2 which is probably the star wars film i enjoyed least
May 12 2019,negative,what a failure dont watch if you liked the previous star wars movies such a disappointment i just cannot believe theyd spent so much money for this disney tragedy basically written for 9 year olds also amazed about the amount of fake critic reviews quite disrespectful to the audience tbh
May 11 2019,negative,not that a movie about magic in space made in the 1970s was not without serious flaws but this is an insult to every small thing that made star wars an enjoyable story
May 10 2019,negative,they only thing worse than the last jedi is the fact rotten tomatoes professional critics marked it so high clearly pushing their own agenda
May 10 2019,negative,absolutely butchered the original characters and had no connection to any of the new ones so many holes in this story only thing good about it are the visual effects  but that is not what i paid to watch
May 10 2019,negative,this movie killed star wars
May 10 2019,negative,sound and fury taking the saga of skywalker and literally throwing it off the cliff   the script reads like something written by a junior high schooler and the rules of the universe are just ignored for convenience  give it a pass  its worse than force awakens which is saying quite a lot or a little
May 10 2019,negative,disrespectful and everything is garbage plot characters humor logic
May 10 2019,positive,star wars the last jedi is for me the third  best movie in the stcu
May 10 2019,negative,this film does not deserve the name star wars everything that happens in this movie is boring and awfully written they break rules set in the earlier movies and seem to not give a fuck about it when i heard luke call a lightsaber a lasersword i had enough everything set up in the force awakens by jj abrams got scrapped and ended in the most awful ways captain phasma had nothing to do at allleias sudden force powers werent even adressed reys visions were forgotten reys also seemingly the most powerful creatur in existence and luke literally disappeard the big fighting scene between kylo ren rey and the guards was awfully choreographed and even had mistakes in it a movie that made me sad in the worst way possilbe it shit all over my beloved franchise luckily theres much more to star wars than just the films the force is weak with this one
May 9 2019,negative,luke was trash the bombers were stupid killing snoke was just bad the bombers made zero sense as does haldos plan and canto byte was one of the worst things i have ever scene in cinema
May 9 2019,negative,this movie is absolutely terrible and completely destroys everything that is star wars the acting was definitely better than episodes 2  3 but the script writing editing and overall movie production was complete shit
May 9 2019,negative,death of a cultural icon deliberately insulting to original fans and even actors breathtakingly bad not luke skywalker some evil clone designed to dump on a hero done with star wars
May 9 2019,negative,nice visuals terrible plot around one a contrived chase scene and no consistency with the source material ruined my investment in the series
May 9 2019,negative,while the prequels had some bad reviews mostly because hayden did his job and made us hate his character this movie is just aweful writing and directing the people who made this dont know anything about star wars
May 9 2019,negative,the movie is unwatchable its like a star wars parody by the end i hated all the characters and wanted kylo to destroy everything just so it would be over i have been a huge star wars fan for years and this movie broke star wars for me it wasnt a star wars movie it was a movie driven by gender politics that had no respect for what came before it
May 9 2019,negative,the death of star wars  nufff said
May 8 2019,negative,get woke go broke this movie made me miss the days when the worst thing in star wars was jar jar binks im really not looking forward to 9
May 8 2019,negative,if i could give it negative stars i would 
May 8 2019,negative,the worst movie of the franciseiooks like a mediocre tv sf series episodetoo badi was a fan since i was very young
May 8 2019,negative,visually entertaining but totally disrespects the history of star wars and in particular luke skywalker
May 7 2019,negative,gargbage im a huge star wars fan and a year later im still pied about this film
May 7 2019,negative,even worse than the prequels worse than the force awakens this movie convinced me to never pay to go see a disney backed star wars movie rogue one is the exception ill wait until they come onto a streaming service
May 7 2019,negative,this borkend the star wars is shit
May 6 2019,positive,great job furthering the plot of the new trilogy although it deviated from the typical star wars movie format it kept audience members on the edge of their seats the story line was fast paced and captivating and the movie did a wonderful job of cast diversification although maybe not appealing to some viewers i believe this movie is the star wars for the next generation through a progressive cast and rich social commentary star wars has once again created a captivating escapist universe that also manages to reflect back on todays society through subtle themes and plot points
May 6 2019,positive,i like the risks this movie took is it perfect no does it deserve this bad rating no because the movie is great the bad ratings continued from this to solobecause could not let go of the hate the hate for this movie i will never understand i thought it was a great addition to the saga to a tired formula that old star wars wanted to be in the last jedi so bad guess what they didnt get what they wanted and im glad force awakens was nothing but a retread of a new hope they ate that nostalgia up like candy i have to admit i did too this movie is better than rogue one and solo its just hardcore fans bashed and ruined this movie before it came out and people painfully overlooked it like it was garbage its not garbage its a good addition and you will be entertained by it this user rating is unacceptable this movie is a lot better than a lot of other movies bashing on star wars think how wrong that is phantom menace deserves itbut not this gem 
May 6 2019,negative,this is now the 2nd time ive seen star wars episode 8  the last jedi and i can say that it wasnt as bad as i remembered     star wars episode 8  the last jedi is the 9th star wars film to be released in cinemas and is the 8th film in the series the film was directed by rian johnson who also directed looper the film stars daisy ridley as rey and mark hamill as luke skywalker    the acting in my opinion wasnt bad but at points the acting felt very off i also felt that a lot of the actors didnt really fit their characters     the characters i personally hate from kylo ren to rose tico the characters in my opinion are annoying boring and even uninteresting even luke skywalkers character was annoying and betrayed     the cinematography in my opinion was strong with some very good shots of the characters and scenery    the settings were okay but i felt that they were either rehashes from earlier films in the serise or were just there to make the runtime of the film hit the 230h mark    the set designs costume designs and makeup were all done very well from the structure designs to the various weapons and machines    the practical and special effects for the most part were very strong but there were points within the film were some of the cgi either felt out of place or just looked plain stupid    the action was steady from the direction to the cinematography but a lot of the time the action scenes either felt lacking or just dragged on    the music in my opinion was probably the greatest aspect of the film but then again a lot of it takes from the original soundtrack    personally i didnt find the story compelling or enjoyable but that could be because of my hate for the characters     the comedy in my opinion could be one of the worst aspects of the film from the jokes at the expense of the originals trilogy to the really irritating comedic relief characters    the film also had some strong atmosphere but it constantly kept getting ruined by the sheer stupidity of some of the scenes      i also want to point out that i have loads of complaints with the film from the timing mistakes to the cool ideas put to wast the film in my opinion makes some really stupid decisions that ruin the experience of the film one decision i really hated was the character change they gave to luke skywalker    the film i also found boring and really uninteresting     over all i give it a  310  30  155    you may like the film but i personally do not
May 6 2019,neutral,this film tries to deliver a message which is out of character for the entire franchise up to this point while the social themes and interesting character twists are relevant and fresh in our world they felt out of place using this universe as its vehicle what adds to the agony is the plethora of absolutely stunning visuals mixed with a poorly set up story line and the violation of basic cinema narrative if you are familiar with basic screenplay theory you see a range of grievous errors that lead to the negative feedback experienced by this movie i could have stood behind luke holdo and rose if only there was more to them and deeper meaning behind why they behaved as they did within  the movie
May 5 2019,negative,its insulting that disney allowed this film to be released its amazing that the script was ever green lit in the first place but even after it was upon watching the final edit it should have been unanimously decided to never release it to the public and to start again this film is terrible from start to finish
May 5 2019,negative,boring unfocused disrespectful yo its source material and surprisingly preachy at times in more ways than one the last jedi is inoffensive but plainly forgettable
May 5 2019,negative,by far the worst star wars ever made horrible plot cheesy new characters and major let down to star wars fans
May 5 2019,positive,far and away the strongest star wars project of the disney era rian johnson takes us on a journey through not just what star wars is but what star wars can be follows up beautifully on the tales of rey and ben while also giving great moments to our original trilogy heroes
May 5 2019,negative,poor humor plot holes and desperate attempts at being woke kill any enjoyment a star wars fan would find in this train wreck
May 5 2019,negative,literally one of the worst movies of all time
May 5 2019,negative,it was not completely horrible but you can tell that jj abrahams and ryan johnson never talked about what will happen in this new trilogy the result is from a narrativ standpoint a mess there were so many buildups in this and the previous movie that just went to nothing i can personally not understand how this movie has such high ratings even though it was a huge mess and had so many plot holes
May 5 2019,negative,the worst star wars movie since jar jar binks introduction
May 5 2019,negative,only redeeming thing about this movie are the visuals and even some of those arent great    the plots there are a few that merge are terribly written with holes as large as the hypothetical galaxy far far away    the acting is melodramatic at best i mean mark hamil was never a good actor anyway but this director gets the worst out of him what we wouldnt give to have alec guiness back     the choice of actors for the new characters is terrible     the direction is choppy     star wars tech has never been close to sci fi reality but this movie doesnt even come close to solid tech  and why come up with idiotic vehicles just to show something new     im not sure after this i would see the next installment
May 4 2019,negative,this movie stands alone in the trilogy the force awakens was created to introduce us to the new plot and left the ending open to lead us into something great rian johnson essentially threw out everything that the first movie did created pointless side stories that eventually meant nothing created characters that made no sense and at the end of the movie they did nothing to further the story and killed off everything that left us hanging in the first movie in a nut shell it is a go no where movie that explains nothing does not further the plot and just throws in a bunch of action scenes with no climax it jumps around a lot and does not explain anything and makes no plot setup for the next movie disney would be better off rewriting the entire movie in a way that actually makes sense not only is it a bad star wars movie it just a poorly written go nowhere movie full of sarcasm in a serious universe bottom line if it didnt have the star wars name it would have went down in the books as a complete failure
May 4 2019,negative,great graphics but a bad movie
May 4 2019,negative,it really sucked luke trained for a long time to lift one rock and she just lifts a mountain of them complete bs i say
May 4 2019,positive,the last jedi did for me what i never expected this film changed the way i saw star wars the force evolving in such a unique way the mythology of the force and an end battle that gave me chills    i dont care how many people hate me for this i think the last jedi is a masterpiece
May 4 2019,negative,this movie had so many disappointing movements that i was ready to walk out several times from the forced and not funny humour to the silly plot really a space chase to the very shallow characters there is so little to like here so very very little the attempt at humour was even on the border of inappropriate yes the milking scene comes to mind if lucas would have known that sw would turn into this well he would have asked for 40b instead of 4b
May 4 2019,negative,they ruined star wars this was worse than the prequels
May 4 2019,negative,sorely disappointing given all the hype around it utterly disappointing lack of respect to the character development over the decades not advocating for fan service but seeking renewal in storytelling shouldnt come at such an extreme of throwing out the baby with the bath water
May 3 2019,negative,absloutely terrible movie completely ruined the lore of the beloved star wars franchise and butchered some of our favorite characters a true disgrace really
May 3 2019,negative,tried watching again it was way worse this time around at least in theaters i could sit and hope it may not be as pathetic
May 3 2019,negative,we t to the cinema to watch this film and left feeling disjointed and crushed gave it  another try when it came out online switched it of after 15 minutes just a question have the writers director and producers of this film ever seen an original star wars film have they read any of the book ok maybe something a tad easier do you know that space is a vacuum so in the opening scenes we have one fighter taking on battleships point defence by itself bullshit  then we have big cumbersome b17 bombers that drop gravity fed bombs in space huh  yes the developers of the ywing that was specifically tasked to bomb large star ships that was later replaced by the bwing fast get in and get out intact star fighters but no what we really need is big cumbersome slow sitting targets that even a drunk stormtrooper could hit on a bad day and blows itself up when it drops its gravity fed bombs in the vacuum of space that it has to be over the top off when it bombs wouldnt that also work from the side or below ï 12 12 this is just the opening stupidity and it just goes down hill from there really one of the worst films ever made dont treat your audience like fools
May 2 2019,negative,how can a movie franchise i first started watching at a drivein theatre in 1977 in the pouring rain make me scream in frustration this was an atrocity what they first did to hanand now luke carrie must be rolling over in her graveawful
May 2 2019,negative,handsdown one of the worst films ever made period
May 2 2019,negative,i hated this movie it throws away all the plot points from tfa the way they handled the old characters was horrible none of the new characters are interesting and the movie is extremely boring im not against feminist messages but the way the implemented it in this movie was downright idiotic
May 2 2019,negative,i really wanted this movie to be good but it wasnt
May 2 2019,neutral,i liked the effects and the visuals but the story the characters and the action was lacklustre i also didnt enjoy the fact that the movie broke certain aspects of the original trilogy
May 1 2019,positive,most of the criticisms of this film are things already present in the franchise or have to due with overexposureoverhyping people didnt keep their expectations in check and when a genuinely new and interesting take on this universe came out instead of a sterile unimaginative hackjob like the force awakens that audiences guffawed at and threw their money at it got reception like this snoke was a dumb onenote villain and there was literally no reason he would have turned into a fuckin roman poet and started telling reykylo his past as darth plageius the wise which given that the dude has a huge lightsabershaped gash in his forehead seems like a good indication we havent seen the last of him takes a lot of influence from other pulpy material like kagemusha and ikiru by kurosawa or the bridge on the river kwai to spice things up like how the original derived a lot of inspiration from pulp and pop culture as well and gets back to the zeitgest of what star wars is about rather than rehashing shit weve seen a million times before in this ridiculously overexposed franchise as someone who hated fa and is pretty tired of the same old shit in star wars this made me happy and excited to see where the franchise can go next unfortunately jj is coming back to direct the next one so im sure well be back to the same old nostalgiabaiting he excels at
May 1 2019,negative,rian johnson treated luke very horribly very disappointing
May 1 2019,negative,worst star wars movie ever im finished now i will never watch a new star wars movie again
May 1 2019,negative,this movie has some good special effects but as a star wars fan it dissapoints me it has really bad story writing  rian johnson just doesnt know how the star wars universe works
Apr 30 2019,negative,i expect a more thought through story
Apr 30 2019,negative,a movie filled with c stories  all of the humor was out of place  major decisions that leave us with few if any reasons to watch the next film  this felt like the finale of the trilogy  storiesdevelpoments that were left to expand on in this film had abysmal resolutions  this movie was shockingly unsatisfying and disappointing
Apr 30 2019,positive,it provided some very shocking twists while introducing some controversial themes so i expect it may not be an instant favourite with some fans but with the epic action scenes and the pure magic it will be enough for others it is a very different formula to other star wars films and at points ridiculous and convenient overall it is another entertaining but different type of addition to the collection
Apr 30 2019,negative,does this deserve one star no but does destroying everything that was built up in the first movie deserve a one star yes this was a horrible star wars movie
Apr 30 2019,negative,very dull storyhas some awesome looking scenesbut jingling shiney things doesnt make a good film wish it was better loved tfa
Apr 29 2019,negative,too many plot holes and it ignores established lore from previous trilogies the writing is subpar the choreography is among the worst ive ever seen in a movie and the characters are completely inconsistent other than that its great like the cinematography
Apr 29 2019,negative,this movie has an embarassing number of plot holes goes against what luke is as a character in star wars injects some kind of political narrative in it that lead nowhere and features worse action scenes than the phantom menace this is a dogshit script that was given a 300 million dollar budget this is what happens when the director is given 100 control of the story and then dumps all of what was going to be the plan the continuity of the plot will be fcked forever
Apr 29 2019,negative,worst star wars movie  and that includes the prequels as bad as they were didnt destroy the franchise story lines built up over 50 years  rian go away
Apr 29 2019,negative,this movie is an insult to the franchise luke skywalker would never do the things his character did in this movie and when is rey actually going to train you know that thing you do when you want to get good at something
Apr 29 2019,negative,plot holes pointless sub plots mixed and often jarring tone poor character development luke skywalker character assassination contradictions of the star wars universe internal logic ultimately it seemed like rian johnson was set on telling the story a certain way that forced characters to say and do things that didnt make sense the visuals and score were amazing but those are the only good things in this movie
Apr 29 2019,negative,was really disappointed when i saw the last jedi hoped it would redeem the force awakens but that hope didnt materialize saw     avengers endgame today was totally blown away entertained and wished the same inspiration could have come upon the star wars     movies maybe wishful thinking since theres only one more part to the saga miracles cant happen
Apr 29 2019,negative,a disgrace take your paid critics away
Apr 28 2019,negative,hands down the worst movie in the franchise just plain terrible the acting is so brutal i kept hoping the main characters would get killed so i wouldnt have to endure their pathetic acting the characters just arent likeable everything just seems so forced pardon the pun please dont watch this movie
Apr 28 2019,negative,disney ruined star wars
Apr 28 2019,negative,ruined the star wars franchise for me thanks for destroying my childhood rian
Apr 28 2019,negative,been a star wars fan my whole life but this moving is terrible  no thought in character progress or engagement  ill probably just wait till the new movies are free to watch which is what i did for solo  this movie was just a let down
Apr 28 2019,positive,some minor plot inconveniences and a little too childish for my liking wonderful sound design and stunning visual effects rian johnsons directing is absolutely astonishing and most of the movie looks like it could be pictures of art in a museum my only major gripe is i would prefer a trilogy that was more planned out because like the prequels this seems like a completely different movie than its predecessor i feel star wars needs its own kevin fiegie to plan out its films better and make the overarching story work in the long run
Apr 28 2019,negative,i am never watching this movie again it disrespects its characters and it is a insult to the original trilogy the writerdirector destroys characters at the expense of a joke this is a good example of not understanding the source material the characters or the universe such a missed opportunity and unfortunate that disney did not invest themselves in this franchise it is clear disney only used our beloved characters as bait to have us watch this movie poor story telling boring sequences and it violates all the world building of previous movies
Apr 28 2019,negative,really bad movie disney make anything and put star wars name
Apr 28 2019,neutral,bad story and no respect shown to the previous history of star wars
Apr 27 2019,negative,i often thought i just like gloomier scifi  that cant be it however since i liked guardians of the galaxy quite a bit  it must simply come back to that same old dichotomy between pandering and sharing  ie between here those dumb assholes should love this and i fucking love this others should too
Apr 27 2019,negative,i cannot stress how godawful the direction plot and character development is in this movie visually stunning yet completely lacking in substance and heart rian johnson does not know star wars and his middle finger towards the best fanbase in the world was clearly evident with this horrid excuse of a film
Apr 27 2019,negative,in a word awful its almost painful to watch thats how bad i feel this film is the special effects are as good as youd demand in a sw film however a story lines with the plots the scenes and the set ups which turn out to be either dead ends pointless stupid or caused me to wonder wtf was that all for then in fact after the leia poppins moment im sure the person next to me heard me exclaim wtf  and i lost interest quite rapidly there after as it descended into more nonsense has r johnson ever seen are sw film  does he have any idea of the universe that had been created  because if this is the best he can come up with he shouldnt be allowed anywhere near anything to do with sw again     if i was the head of any of the disney departments to do with this and id been shown this as the finished article the company had sunk millions into id have been raging in fact so  irate id have pulled it as i couldnt have brought myself to release it 30 years this story line held my interest and this drivel almost finished it in the first hour of this film   
Apr 27 2019,negative,dull lifeless corporate pc drivel should be called the last jedi movie
Apr 27 2019,negative,when this movie came out to high critical reviews and low audience reviews i was happy i was like ah yes the star wars dweebs are getting their dreams smashed and expectations shattered and i was relishing in it because im not that big into star wars that being said i didnt see it because im not that big into star wars eventually i thought i would give it a shot though just to see what it was like and holy smokes i am so sorry for doubting you fans a lot of things seem to happen in this movie just because they divert expectations but not because they actually make sense within the confines of the plot or the lore that i am aware of part of me wants to explain what these things are but that would be spoiling a movie that i hope you never have to see
Apr 26 2019,negative,sad waste of what could have been a great story
Apr 26 2019,negative,this movie just continues to bury star wars lets hope for a better episode 9
Apr 26 2019,positive,episode viii is interesting either you loved it or you hated it tlj seems a bit out of place with its somewhat darker tone and story it features the protagonist rey seeking out jedi master luke skywalker and her relationship with ben solo aka kylo ren all in all this movie is okay its not great its not terrible its simply okay 
Apr 26 2019,negative,garbage movie littered with plot holes and terrible writing quite possibly the worst star wars movie i have ever seen yes that includes the christmas special
Apr 26 2019,positive,amazing and expands the star wars galaxy more than any other star wars movie
Apr 26 2019,negative,another serious blow dealt to one of my favorite sagas
Apr 26 2019,negative,this was a disappointment to say the least
Apr 26 2019,negative,why did they bother mary sue
Apr 25 2019,negative,any debate as to this movie going in a new direction is quickly nulled by the poorly paced script and glaring plot holes the story is so contrived as to be somewhat nonsensical you have to do more than suspend disbelief to enjoy this movieyou have to throw it away right along with the script to the force awakens
Apr 25 2019,negative,any argument about this film reinventing anything breaking new ground or being daring gets slapped down by the fact that this is a poorly paced movie with countless glaring plot holes rian johnson said that he wanted to make a story personal to himself but in doing so he forgot that he was making a star wars movie and its amazing that even with luke and leia this movie barely resembles anything star wars and thats at the core of this movies problem
Apr 25 2019,negative,this movie was terrible i tried so hard to like it because it was star wars but honestly i am not sure it could have been any worse
Apr 25 2019,negative,why i left the theater with a confused emptiness im not sure disney can come back from this mess
Apr 25 2019,negative,worst star wars movie ever the jokes sucked as much as the story did
Apr 25 2019,negative,beautiful movie but the writing completely ignore all the details of the universe  ignores any of the sudo science of the star wars world to such a degree it make it hard to suspend disbelief  its way too concerned about getting to each major set piece without being concerned if those set pieces make any sense what so ever  also the tone is completely off  rebels are dying left and right yet everyone is a bit too cheery  also too many forced jokes
Apr 25 2019,negative,im pretty sure rian johnsons goal was to give as many middle fingers to lifelong star wars fans as possible with this socalled film this couldve been told in 30 minutes and been far better
Apr 25 2019,negative,the only thing this movie has is good visuals and just one good fight scene the plot is lazy and boring im glad jj abrams is back for the next one lets hope catelyn cenedy doesnt fire him along with all the other directors
Apr 25 2019,neutral,this was a mediocre movie nothing more nothing less the narrative wasnt too great but overall action was fun the thing that sets this movie back was because of the heavy politics implemented they definitely prioritized politics over a good narrative with good characters luke skywalkers narrative was poorly thought and executed
Apr 25 2019,negative,awful kills a lot of the story built up by episode 7 a lot of gotcha moments to try and surprise you but just disappoint and annoy you it is blatantly attempting to rip off the empire strikes back but does so poorly in every aspect including a 1 hour long chase scene going at 2mph a new cloud city with child labor and bad rich people a new hoth with salt instead of snow with the same but far inferior walker battle so many points where you think a character is going to die but just kidding no one important dies i could talk about it for days but this is a movie you watch once then immediately hate and swear to never to watch it start to finish ever again
Apr 25 2019,negative,a pretty but empty piece of media
Apr 25 2019,negative,this movie was garbage im never going to see another star wars movie again
Apr 24 2019,positive,i think that attack of the clones was almost better
Apr 24 2019,negative,fuk this awdulmpiece of shit been a die hard since 3 years old and this movie fucks up every dam movie shows and books
Apr 24 2019,negative,as a star wars movie it was garbage but when you stop looking at it as just a star wars movie and really take a step back its still hot garbage the movie is riddled with plot holes and useless characters that you cant help but wish death upon there are are countless scenes where continuity and logic are thrown out of the window meaning emotion and star wars lore are tossed out the window for cheap jokes this movie is a mess and should have never been made shame on you ryan johnson
Apr 24 2019,negative,they killed lukes character long before they killed him off
Apr 24 2019,negative,i remember after i came out of the theater trying to convince myself that i might have kind of enjoyed the movie a little i remember waking up the next morning thinking what the heck was that the movie looked beautiful and had a lot of potential dont get me wrong if this was not a star wars movie it would have gotten at least a three star from me but given that it belongs to a saga there must be a certain level of continuity and feel that should have met that did not meet this movie became not exaggerating the most disappointing movie i have seen in my entire life the movie left such a sour taste that i basically lost all interest in everything star wars mainly because it made all previous movies and shows before it meaningless i will probably watch episode nine on google play or red box maybe the next one will cause people to care about the franchise again who knows
Apr 24 2019,negative,worst movie of the star wars franchise destroyed everything
Apr 23 2019,positive,the last jedi may be my favorite star wars movie since the original trilogy i like how it brings back that wonder and religious undertone that make this so different to other scifi there may be some scenes that were not too memorable but the whole spark of resistance is shown beautifully love the epic end they gave luke love the kids on the casino planet benicio del toro was a bit of a forced character but i appreciate the way they detach the mystery of the force from politics with the small weaponstradersubplot    all in all a movie i could watch over and over again the stunning music by john williams helps just as much as the great visuals on the salt planet for example or the space battles oh and surprisingly often i had to laugh refreshingly i always thought star wars should be a fun fairy tale in space and not another dark brooding downer
Apr 23 2019,negative,episode 8 suffers from poorly written characters an unhealthy obsession with subverting expectations unsatisfying conclusions and answers and a boring plot riddled with holes the only real benefit is its visuals excluding the fight scenes which are poorly thought out and choreographed all in all the last jedi is a missed opportunity to tell a deeper and darker story
Apr 23 2019,negative,awful wish they never bothered making this film force awakens left me excited and wondering what would happen next there was so much potential after force awakens but they just wasted the opportunity    i cant wait to find out who reys parents are   oh there no one shes no one     i cant wait to see what happens with luke  oh hes become a bit of a dick an throws the light saber over his shoulder    i hope they give us an emotional good bye to carrie fisher as she has died in real life  oh no shes survived and is flying through space like mary poppins and will now be cgid for the next film     who is this powerful snoke  oh we dont know what his back story is and hes died easily    i can go on and on with other crap that irritated me i actually couldnt wait for the film to finish and felt so angry when leaving the cinema force awakens and rogue one i couldnt wait for the bluray to come out i couldnt wait for the merchandise this film has been on netflixsky and i have had absolutely no interest in rewatching it i cant even bring myself to watch force awakens as it just irritates me to think they ruined it all with the last jedi
Apr 23 2019,negative,unfortunately there was only about 10 of the film that kept me engaged while the other 90 wouldnt allow me to engage due to constant writing distractions  characters consistently contradict themselves based on actions within the same film much less the obvious contradictions from the main original story thread  one could go one forever about the problems with this film and is overly selfaware about the fact its a star wars film  what else can you say it will probably go down alongside the most disappointing films in history no matter how awkwardly the artistically prideless praise it
Apr 23 2019,negative,pure trash  spits on everything that came before it in the name of subversion and postmodernist philosophy  no heroes no coherent story just political rubbish
Apr 22 2019,negative,i can forgive a lot as a fan i want to love a star wars movie i even enjoy the prequels despite all their faults but this was garbage 
Apr 22 2019,negative,the weakest sw movie since attack of the clones many plot points are poorly thought out and the characters are split into several nearly unrelated plots most disappointingly despite being described as subversive the movie ends with a very conventional return to the status quo    a clear symptom of the disorganization of this trilogys story is that two of the three major protagonists meet for the very first time at the end of this film the trilogy is twothirds over and the main characters dont interact with each other its a bit of a mess
Apr 22 2019,negative,the worst of all star wars films such a shame please dont bring political agendas into films
Apr 22 2019,negative,there is no point in doing a bullet point about everything thats wrong with tlj now this movie is broken beyond any redemption it gets the very few good things established in tfw and destroys them for a few dumb gotcha momments you dont have to be a star wars geek like the rest of us to see everything that is broken in this mess anyone that understands a little about movie making story telling and character development can see this pile of garbage from miles away please disney get your  together
Apr 22 2019,negative,how do you fuck this up so badly    id go in depth to it but im literally just here to post a bad rating because of how terrible this movie was    itd give me an aneurysm to write it all down on paper
Apr 22 2019,negative,an entire movie about people running out of gas where the directorwriter decides luke drinking green milk is more important that developing the characters and showing lukes grief when learning about his friend han nothing in this movie makes sense in the long term story of star wars and even if it stood alone it would be arguably one of the worst written star wars movies ever lets not even get to leia floating in space looking like a rubber figure
Apr 22 2019,negative,no comment needed terrible filmmaking just terrible
Apr 22 2019,positive,i really like this one
Apr 22 2019,neutral,unlike the force awakens this film attempts to be a bit more original and i commend that but the films real problem is its constant struggle between originality and being another star wars film is not much different than the films own antagonists struggle between good and bad following that analogy is being a more original film bad and is making another star wars film good find out in the next episode of dragon ball z exactly thats how much sense this film really makes
Apr 21 2019,positive,i was about to give up on the star wars franchise after the force awakens it seemed like they were just pandering to nostalgia and had no new ideas or ambitions with this trilogy i was pleasantly surprised to see the last jedi take new directions and im sad to hear that the rise of skywalker may retcon some of this i enjoyed this film the characters could still come a ways i dont feel too strongly connected with anyone in this series
Apr 21 2019,positive,kills off too many characters that were going to be important in star wars 9 but is still full of great moments
Apr 21 2019,negative,i really dont like this movie its very flawed and the characters from previous movies have been destroyed and killed rey is not a good character and admiral holdo is horrible  i hoped rise of skywalker was going to be better  and its not have seen the rise of skywalker   its not good
Apr 21 2019,neutral,production and set design to include overall look was okay  no longer has that star wars feel to it  however the story and direction was disappointing  as if the writerdirector thought it would be fun to make a star wars moviewith crystal furry animals and flying space princesses  this star wars adaptation could and should have been so much more  johnson failed to keep the force alive
Apr 21 2019,negative,despite good visuals it ruins previous movies in the franchises and subverts expectations in the worst way leading to a thin and dry plot
Apr 20 2019,negative,its amazing all the people that are kissing this movies ass and giving it undeserved praise  but i wouldnt expect any less from people that have bad taste in movies
Apr 20 2019,negative,ummm yea what a tacky movie its story line is completely fragmented they force humour where in places it really should not be and the use of tacky cliched oneliners is wayyyy over used think of it as clone wars but worse dont waste your time on this movie
Apr 20 2019,positive,risky yet a bold move the so called  real star wars fans hated instead of continuing the saga with more mediocre content it creates a new dimension to the series and fill up the gaps from tfa hopefully jj abrams dont ruin the next one
Apr 20 2019,negative,the worst star wars movie  it was painful to sit through bad storytelling with bad jokes  leia flying through space was cringe worthy  holdo and rose were bad characters  nobody mourned the death of han solo  lukes portrayal was disappointing  i can go on and on  the half star is for the visual and audio  i wish there were a way to give five stars to the great john williams who never lets us down
Apr 20 2019,negative,what a pile of crap this was terrible in every way
Apr 20 2019,negative,there were some nice things about this film but reys perfect character the tryhard comedy universebreaking moments pointless plot twists the nonlinear slaughter of luke snoke and phasma not to mention that so many vehicles subplots and concepts were copied from episode v just ruin it
Apr 20 2019,negative,less of a movie and more of an abomination
Apr 20 2019,negative,what an insult to a once great franchise the way the ot characters have been treated is a tradgedy
Apr 20 2019,negative,good job disney now to remove pc culture from movies
Apr 19 2019,negative,rian johnson go away from star wars i waited decades to see a decent luke skywalker but rian johnson did a terrible job rian johnson really doenst understand the star wars universe
Apr 19 2019,negative,well its long
Apr 19 2019,negative,since a fan from the begining this movie looks like the end of the force bored and asleeped as never before sorry but this film turns the one of jarjar binks  larger deprecated in the saga  into a level like gone with the wind scared to see what episode ix will bring to us please be the force with realizators please dont throw away 42 years of dreams and tradition
Apr 19 2019,negative,a waste of a star wars skywalker saga movie
Apr 19 2019,negative,i just watched the last jedi for what must have been at least the 10th time and oh man it gets worse with every time cant understand how they manage to make such a terrible movie
Apr 19 2019,positive,on its own it is a brilliant movie and a great ride but since it is hard to see this version of luke and rose is an annoying distraction i give it only 4 stars
Apr 19 2019,positive,solid but admittedly flawed has plenty of frustrating moments for sure but also some incredible concepts and set pieces and further sets a grand stage for potential gravitas in the upcoming episode 9 finale dont listen to the haters they lack scope and the last 30 minutes incredible
Apr 19 2019,negative,thats not star wars for me
Apr 19 2019,negative,im done with this ip
Apr 19 2019,negative,exceptionally bad movie on many levels silly humor bad plot twists and nothing added to main story linereally disappointed such a pity as rogue one was really promising and i enjoyed that a lot
Apr 19 2019,negative,many pacing issues many plot holes disrespecting beloved characters and contradicts all that was built during the previous movie the only redeeming part of this movie was the phenomenal acting in the face of poor writing
Apr 18 2019,negative,rian johnson is the worst that couldve happened to this beautiful saga
Apr 18 2019,negative,terrible writing terrible acting terrible characters
Apr 18 2019,negative,worst star wars movie by far
Apr 18 2019,negative,a shoddy mess of film that i cant believe got made  the plot is incomprehensible and the character development is inconsistent and often disappointing    if this were just any other movie it would be a forgettable shrug of a film  as a star wars film  this is unforgivable
Apr 18 2019,negative,as bad as the prequels not sure why they thought this movie was good enough to release
Apr 18 2019,positive,despite some minor issues with pacing and one particular unnecessary side plot this was an excellent addition to the star wars universe it looks gorgeous it has excellent characters and it was refreshing to see star wars go in a different direction overall this was a great film with some flaws
Apr 17 2019,negative,force awakens had its flaws but created something great and did a great job of introducing new characters could have developed ray better instead of making her automatically god tlj just destroyed everything the last jedi created with a bunch of meaningless subplots i felt no attachment to characters it was laughable purple haired lady just made everything so much worse awful movie i have no idea how jj abrams is going to be able to fix this good special effects though kinda entertaining once you just start laughing at it
Apr 17 2019,negative,congrats disney youve ruined star wars
Apr 17 2019,negative,since disney has taken over this franchise the stories have gone to crap they are all about fighting and action scenes no true story and drama no back stories no wider than just the main character stories they have gone down hill and are also politically correct 
Apr 17 2019,negative,the movie that killed all my interest in star wars
Apr 17 2019,negative,horrible any star wars fan can tell you it is a total betrayal to the series
Apr 17 2019,negative,this film is an example of how the writer does not understand the world hes writing in the characters lack depth and the plot points feel empty 
Apr 17 2019,negative,just a warmup with nothing new
Apr 17 2019,negative,the last jedi is a joke that takes what was good and loved about the original films and lampoons them with  contemptuous gender cliches childish jokes and doublefake plots ridiculous
Apr 17 2019,negative,a star wars parody that is not only  awful to watch but also destroying the canon
Apr 16 2019,negative,the only positives are the visual effects and the music the music does nothing new but is on par in term of series quality visual effects and music dont give much substance however when the underlying writing and directing is so poor there was extremely little character development for the main characters or any real advancement on the core and more exciting or intriguing foundations built through the sw movies and especially those more recently within the force awakens the previous movie in fact it seemed to work almost directly against that previous movie and instead of leaving viewers with some strong anticipation of whats coming next it serves to completely kill enthusiasm for the remainder of the trilogy by blatantly disrespecting its predecessors there is also clear ignorance towards star wars lore and this only serves to hurt the franchise all other star wars movies you can go back and appreciate the intelligence and foresight that goes into the story and character development but this one is really quite detrimental to star wars overall an enormous disappointment and i fear this will also hold the next film back from greatness because it will need to rectify the many mistakes made in this film
Apr 16 2019,negative,special effects and visuals were great but thats where it ends lazy writing time wasted on subplots that go nowhere
Apr 16 2019,negative,i never thought they could make a star wars movie that would make me think wow i actually would rather be watching the phantom menace right now
Apr 16 2019,positive,star wars is practically a religion these days keeping the mystery after all this time living up to the originals while still doing something new and fun  its a tall order and they did it a great movie and worthy of the canon and my anticipation for the finale just keeps building
Apr 16 2019,negative,what they did to luke is repugnant probably the largest waste of one of the most well known protagonists of all modern characters and an insult to 40 years of character development plot was clunky and the shoein characters they killed off the originals for are unrelatable at best whiny and boring at worst
Apr 16 2019,negative,the last jedi felt like anything but a starwars film  more like an unholy hybrid of men in black fifth element and harry potter it was littered with cringeworthy jokes and social concepts shoehorned into it that absolutely no one ever asked for i left the theater feeling entirely letdown and have not watched it again since i also dont plan to jj abrams has his work cut out for him and will have to pull something off that is nothing short of amazing if disney is going to salvage this epic disaster of a trilogy
Apr 16 2019,negative,great visuals just plain bad story telling
Apr 16 2019,negative,ruined the whole point of lukes character and introduced a pointless subot that was to long boring and interesting new characters that were absolutely horribly written that served to real purpose to the plot
Apr 15 2019,positive,even though this had lots of flaws it had a lot more to offer than its predecessor it addressed the force in a different perspective and some where particularly interesting
Apr 15 2019,negative,the fact that anyone would hand such a sacred franchise to a hack thats more interested in serving themselves and making their own mark on the franchise is ludicrous this movie upends a chunk of my childhood in a couple of hours you cant just change the whole dynamic of characters make them behave completely abnormally and pretend youre a creative genius id rather watch the holiday special
Apr 15 2019,positive,the most beautiful film in the saga aside from rogue one and a touching tribute to carrie fisher and the saga as a whole
Apr 15 2019,negative,omg this movie is so bad nuff said    seriously w t f
Apr 15 2019,negative,terrible  ruined star wars for me
Apr 15 2019,negative,visually satisfying but no meaningful character growth lightsaber fights were disappointing
Apr 15 2019,negative,disappointed in the mismanagement and direction
Apr 14 2019,negative,a slow movie with no real climax and no character arc
Apr 14 2019,negative,the first order was said to be weakened in episode 7 but i guess that must have been retconned seeing as how theyve managed to pose a credible threat to the resistance despite their massive mega death star project was just destroyed    i wont even award this movie stars for good acting not after the red room scene    overall just a bad movie
Apr 14 2019,negative,disrespectful to the star wars universe
Apr 14 2019,negative,start bad end worst nothing went ok with this movie is just garbage
Apr 14 2019,positive,was drawn in by kelly tran shes beautiful and intelligent hope she   gets more screen time true   cinderella story of the franchise  plus love the anime influence of star   wars   as far as the whole debate on the changes of this saga its obvious   that a lot of fans wanted a return to   the original 3 of luke leia and han    but for me it ended with return   that was their story this saga is a   sequel of the next generation being   handed the new stories  a tighter   script with a happy ending will   probably make more people happy
Apr 14 2019,negative,a terrible movie on every level the tone is badly off with flippant jokes destroying dramatic tension characters make maddening irrational decisions just to serve the plot luke is a totally different person from who he was in the original trilogy ruining the joy of seeing him properly return to the series other than the throne room scene the set pieces are poorly executed and nonsensical this film almost killed my love of star wars
Apr 14 2019,negative,worst star wars ever cant believe critics gave it 91 this plot is insane doesnt make any sense no character development snope sucks and wasnt important
Apr 14 2019,negative,great popcorn flick like transformers
Apr 14 2019,positive,liked it since it is star wars didnt like it because it was sometimes sort of confusing and due to lack of epic finale
Apr 14 2019,negative,didnt enjoy it had a few cool moments but so many cringey moments keep politics out of star wars
Apr 14 2019,positive,a creative and visually amazing extension to the series  great performances particularly from hamill and ridley  this film takes some unexpected risks and they mostly pay off
Apr 14 2019,negative,use to be huge sw fan when i was a kid i hated this movie when i saw it in 2017 my 10 yr old kids didnt like it either watched it again initial thought maybe it was not that bad i just had too high expectations the first time nope this is a bad movie and this review has nothing to do with the fact that i was sw fan as a child the are million things of mediocre quality in the movie key problems bad dialogue no emotional depth crappy humor i really wonder how the team was able to make such a mess after the force awakens which was pretty ok and especially set a good concept and landscape maybe the pressure was just too much johnsons previous movie looper was also pretty good here the guy really killed star wars and the greatest mystery why movie critics give good scores on average this film and critics behavior have changed how i view the whole business
Apr 13 2019,positive,the best star wars film of all it was the only star wars movie that i couldnt guess what was going to happen long before it did
Apr 13 2019,negative,possibly a decent scifi fantasy movie but an utter failure as a star wars film
Apr 13 2019,negative,what is a story twist definitely not this movie
Apr 13 2019,negative,if you dont understand the bad reviews i will explain one common reason many of the fans follow mark hamill on twitter hes a really nice guy whos been involved in the community for 40 years then a guy the director came by without earning his star wars stripes and writes the luke character in this movie mark had objections to the direction of the character but his objections were ignored the director knows better disney knows better     so imagine watching sw as a person who actually admires luke or admires mark hamill in this movie the new character who has done very little with the fans is beating up mark insulting him calling him a attempted child murderer this isnt what fans wanted to see of their hero its really upsetting    once the love bubble bursts where we overlook flaws we see the movie for what it is  the jokes are awful they dump the old beloved characters like senior citizens who are too old to contribute to society and so on it just keeps adding on when disney then calls these people names if they had listened to mark or given him his own starring movie i think it would have made a lot of fans very happy     instead a rich company bought the rights and treated the beloved characters followed by the fans like crap and they still go onto make over a billion dollars you know disney
Apr 13 2019,positive,where do i start i am so excited to write this review i probably should have brought something to write things down while watching the movie there is so much happening in this and i want to discuss it all im going to try to write this review spoiler free    i felt like crying so many times during this film not out of sadness but out of pure happiness i wasnt planning on mentioning this to maintain a bit of cool but it is worth sharing to let you know how happy i felt about this new star wars movie    the opening scene it was brilliant a great way to start a movie you immediately get introduced to these immense ships this beautiful environment a few of the known and loved characters it was actionfilled and it was funny the last jedi had me there and than and didnt let go till i had to pee its a very long movie and when i returned it had me again till the very end there is a progress in every characters storyline it was fun to see them all grow in their own way especially finn i couldnt really place him in the force awakens but in this movie he really went out there to make a difference and to help his friends and allies rose tico she is a sweet and brave character i enjoyed the part where she and finn went to visit a planted i didnt know yet and she saved those beautiful creatures yea i really like her which brings me to a character i first didnt really like to be honest and that is vice admiral holdo it felt like she wasnt doing anything at all and that frustrated me a bit now that im writing this i think that rian johnson might have given her that kind of mystery with a reason i mean in the end we all loved her right at least i did poe dameron i have loved this character in the last jedi and felt like he didnt have enough screen time this movie makes up for it all i think getting to know him a little better was one of my favourite things character wise and then luke skywalker what a champ i really enjoyed hearing what he had been up to and what changed him into the man he was in this movie seeing him and leia together was so good as well i loved it rey has become quite a grownup serious character as well hasnt she she is such a strong female lead the connection between her and kylo ren was so interesting to see i didnt expect that to be there and i think they are very alike their connection was very brief and very beautiful i really look forward to what is going to happen next with those two kylo ren always feels like the guy who just cant get it right ever a bit like general hux who thinks hes brilliant while hes actually not that brilliant which makes him quite funny which is also quite sad bringin me to the last character i want to discuss and that is the supreme leader first is it bad that i had no clue who he exactly is if it is and you want to explain it to me feel free to do so because i like to know right now i wasnt very impressed with him to be honest    there are a lot of beautiful new planets and fun new creatures especially on the island that luke was staying at the nuns who take care of the small village are so funny and the porgs i mean they are the cutest things i hear that opinions about them are all over the place but i cannot not like them im weak the storyline was very well written and it really went somewhere it had a purpose which makes this movie so much more interesting and indulging every single person who worked on this did one helluva job its brilliant    i wish i could have discussed a bit more scenes but i cant do that without spoiling quite a bit i tried to discuss the characters as spoiler free as possible which i failed to do but i feel like these spoilers arent major you can read them if you want i want to end this review by saying i probably forgot to mention a lot of things i miss han im a bit sad that almost the entire original cast is gone i cant wait for the next one and i think this one is better than the force awakens aka go watch it    james corden i saw you
Apr 13 2019,positive,the film isnt perfect theres a few contradictory elements and several key plot points that might frustrate fans but the movies so good in parts that i cant help but ignore its flaws it has maybe the three best scenes in all star wars from the spoilers lightspeed ram to the throne room battle to luke walking out of the bunker at the end add to that wellexplored themes of heroism belief failure perseverance and our relationship with past it has satisfying character arcs spectacular action genuine surprises and a real understanding of what makes a movie good generally and what makes the star wars saga so iconic
Apr 13 2019,negative,character development didnt make sense and story writers seem to erase everything that the books and starwars universe established  its like the director never saw or read the original star wars movies  i have never not finished a star wars movie  this movie was disappointing
Apr 13 2019,negative,an absolute train wreck of a star wars movie which propels its self to a different world of bad how ryan johnson got this so wrong is beyond amazing and deserves its own movie a big f u to the fans community and star wars universe    i have loved star wars for 40 years since seeing the original movie in the cinema this movie killed that with its bad story bombers in space plot holes terrible comedy and luke milking green milk from a tit    its more like spaceballs 2    my original toys games books now have no meaning but i will thank ryan johnson for saving me money as i will never spend a bean on this franchise again
Apr 13 2019,negative,given the quality of the past films this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen there are just too many gripes i have with it to put in a single review the writing is terrible lukes character is completely different light speed is not a weapon no one cares about rose and the casino planet stop trying to be like a marvel movie we dont want excessive humor leia is not a god and on and on and on
Apr 13 2019,negative,i felt as though this movie ignored the focus of the entire star wars saga the skywalkers
Apr 13 2019,negative,rian johnson is a disgrace to the franchise poorly written directed
Apr 13 2019,negative,terrible mala  una hora una nave disparando a otra  no la pudo alcanzar  todos los plots que se formaron en el episodio 7 estã pelãculas tumbã³ un villano llorã³n que no termina de dar el paso al lado oscuro ni siquiera con la muerte de su padre y luke nuestro hï 12 12 croe de antaão no quiso no hizo no nada  y hasta la muerte del capitãn ackbar fuera de la pantalla  mala   terrible bad one hour a ship shooting another could not reach it all the plots that were formed in episode 7 are movies knocked down a weeping villain who does not end up giving way to the dark side even with the death of his father and luke  our hero of yesteryear did not want to do nothing  and until the death of captain ackbar off the screen  bad
Apr 13 2019,positive,this film wasnt perfect of course but it was different and unique but theres just no pleasing star wars fans sometimes you ask for something different here it is canto byte scene could have been executed better but i think everything else in it was amazing
Apr 13 2019,negative,i feel like this episode butchers the story of episode 46 in the previous episode vii i hated the fact that rey was perfect at fighting even though she had no previous training but i was like okay i give them the benefit of the doubt lets see how she develops in the next episode she has no development whatsoever and i feel like she is a disgrace to all women i know that this episode was supposed to play with our expectations but there were so many flat jokes bad storylines and illogical plot points and characters that i was really wainting for it to end already however i know that all star wars fans are going to watch it just so they can understand what other fans talk about and this is the sad part studios earn money even if they make awful star wars movies
Apr 13 2019,negative,i did not enjoy the movie i do not blame the actors but i blame ryan johnson for the films quality disney chose a terrible screenwriter and director for this film he changed the personality of the characters and divided the fan base in an interview he said that he liked to create a movie that would divide the fan base which is a terrible idea to have when working on a beloved film such as star wars
Apr 12 2019,negative,official death of starwars but also makes sure to do its best in ruining the ones we love
Apr 12 2019,negative,disgusting and truley an insult and a fuck you to the entire franchise
Apr 12 2019,positive,a lot of reviewers going to bite their words after the next movie this one wasnt the best star wars but it was far from bad
Apr 12 2019,negative,horrible literally the worst star wars if u like star wars u will hate it if u havent seen any star wars u will like it  just wipe it from canon and move onjj abrams has his work cut out for him
Apr 12 2019,negative,not the best of the star wars movies this movie had good moments but that was about it
Apr 12 2019,negative,an absolute dumpster fire the last star wars movie i will ever pay to see
Apr 12 2019,positive,movie is pretty good but some things for me were disappointed but overall i enjoyed the film cant wait to see what they do with star wars the rise of skywalker
Apr 11 2019,negative,what they did to luke and ackbar is an abomination why cant everyone just admit that the choices while maybe bold didnt work and it ended up as a pretty bad movie oh right political correctness
Apr 11 2019,negative,ruined the legacy of star wars everything interesting was tossed away in an attempt to subvert expectations
Apr 11 2019,negative,the movie although enjoyable at times has so many subplots and characters all of which dont contribute in any way to the plot furthermore alot of these characters are majorly down played asian women and mark hammil especially and the direction they went with for rey kylo and snoke wasnt what many wanted
Apr 10 2019,negative,terrible movie that broke the star wars universe  approximately 30 minutes of the film was useless when admiral holdo refuses to share her heroic plan with the rest of the group  luke rolls over and dies for no reason    truly a terrible movie
Apr 10 2019,negative,a beautiful movie as it should be just from production costs the story is terrible the movie is nonsensical inconsistent boring canon breaking terrible physics full if incompetent people that act completely out of character for a star wars movie i could go on for pages listing ridiculous actions  simply stupid plot points the movie starts with the dreadnaught firing at the base when it should of destroyed the  resistances cruiser during the chase several ships run out of fuel  get destroyed when they could of done what is absolutely worst thing ever the hyperspace ram the entire canto bight b plot is pointless va holdo is just stupid uncalled for  a chance to ram in a woman character when admiral akbar would of been much better finn dragging rose 3 miles after she rammed him on crait  somehow they arent shot rey  her triple kill on crait how did she get to crait the vanishing weapon when praetorian guard has rey in it grasp leia does a mmary poppins even thought the ship should of flown past her instantly theyre all joyous at the end when everyones basically deadits just a dumb dumb dumb badly written movie that treats luke skywalker like crap rams in women characters just because a boring space chase that just sucks disney needs to get this st together when i dont want to use internet data i watch a star wars movie or cartoon series theyre on my local server tlj is the only star wars movie i honestly cant watch i have to skip most of tlj in my head cannon otherwise id star to dislike the series im 48  love star wars i really like the prequel series very much too i liked tfa as a reintroduction to the series for young people but tlj is just that bad  the hyperspace ram is a real problem for me i have an engineering degree  get force mass velocity acceleration  i really hope lucasfilm figures out some type of explanation as to why  how the ram was successful otherwise ill always be thinking strap a hyperspace engine to a ship or asteroid  ram it its a bad movie people its bad 
Apr 10 2019,positive,i dont understand why people hate this
Apr 10 2019,negative,a disgrace to star wars fans like me
Apr 9 2019,negative,really disappointed with the direction they took compared to the force awakens
Apr 9 2019,negative,this film did a disservice to fans who have been awaiting the return of luke for 30 years if you want to watch a film that treats the decline of its hero better watch logan this is an abysmal film
Apr 9 2019,negative,there is nothing i could say about this film that hasnt already been said
Apr 8 2019,negative,this film lacks all seriousness for itself and destroys the integrity for all previous movies before it    character assassination blatant copy and pasting ideas from the original trilogy and an obvious attempt to push a political message which should not be done on the big screen    what hurts most is i booked two tickets to see this movie before seeing it what a waste of time and money
Apr 8 2019,positive,absolutely loved it way more entertaining than the force awakens great job rian johnson
Apr 8 2019,negative,i am a real fan of starwars since i am young i saw many many times episode iv v vi  episode i ii iii are not very good but it respect the starwars universe  this episode viii is the worst starwars i ever seen it dont respect the starwars universe it dont respect luke skywalker character and dont respect at all the starwars fans  its really a shame to have done a movie like this shame to rian johnson shame to disney and shame to producers and shame to george lucas who sold the starwars licence and his soul to disney
Apr 8 2019,negative,absolute garbage  as star wars fan for my whole life i felt disgusted
Apr 7 2019,negative,this movie should be studied on how not to construct a narrative tone adherence to lore continuing a franchise character development it gets them all so wrong at the end of the day even if you ignore the glaring problems the last jedi is just a boring movie with rushed action set pieces that are too many and dont impact the plot enough for a fantasysci fi adventure film that is the biggest failure
Apr 7 2019,negative,the worst big franchise movie of all time so powerfully bad that it almost ruins all of star wars for me a series i loved very much before this movie it does everything wrong its almost genius in that way
Apr 7 2019,positive,trust the critics not the fans a lot of fans have been dishonest from the start failing the movie before it was even on the screen these fans have no imagination and would like to see the same movie over and over again but fortunately star wars the last jedi is a bold new ambitious vision delivers surprising punches twists unexpected character developments while honoring the sagas rich legacy and delivers all the emotion rich punch we could hope for
Apr 7 2019,negative,it would have been easy to please me considering i love star wars but it seems they spent more time and money on visual effects than story or character development found myself constantly frustrated with plot holes i feel like something ive always loved has been taken from me and ruined
Apr 6 2019,negative,the last jedi was such a badly written movie i think it destroyed the franchise the pacing was terrible intense scenes were ruined by slapstick comedy heroes werent heroic to the point that this movie somehow made me dislike leia  the bad guys the first order were ridiculously incompetent with a massively oversized fleet being the only thing making them intimidating like the force awakens never happened and there base of operations wasnt just destroyed
Apr 6 2019,negative,as with many other people i think the plot was too messy especially with cantobite or however you spell it luke should not have died in this movie luke should not have died the way he did rey should have had more training and should not have been able to defeat luke a jedi master in their sparing seession and the fact that rose crashed into finn was idiotic
Apr 6 2019,negative,this film is a fine example of why critics should not longer be trusted it sucked massively awful acting cheesy unfunny jokes a plot that didnt correlate to the actual story bizarrely and unbelievable special powers suddenly appear    awful
Apr 6 2019,negative,good effects bad movie
Apr 6 2019,negative,one of the worst movies ever so disappointing and such a waste of time rain johnson should never be allowed to make a movie again
Apr 6 2019,negative,worst movie in the franchise the force awakens may have been a redo of a new hope but at least it built up to something the force awakens ads more questions with no answers the humor was extremely forced cheesy and unnecessary the side quest to the casino was painfully boring and felt tacked on awful awful awful
Apr 6 2019,negative,why did they have to ruin star wars with this i mean it was really really badpathetic script fans waited yearrrrrrrss for luke to return and they made his character a complete douchebag i dont even consider this to be part of the star wars storyline
Apr 5 2019,negative,dreadful in every way
Apr 5 2019,negative,there are two ways to look at this movie  as a standalone film it mostly works  if youve never seen another star wars movie youll probably think this is pretty good  i recommend you go see it  on the other hand even if youre only a casual fan of the series youll likely wonder what the heck happened here  and if you really love the star wars universe youll probably leave the theater cursing  as you can probably tell from my score im definitely not in the first happy group  im going to skip all the usual and valid criticisms of this movie and jump to the one that made me realize im over star wars  by the end of this movie everyone that we cared about is dead and more importantly all that they fought for is defeated  by the end of this movie the good guys are down to just a bare handful  all the struggle all the sacrifice and all the other movies were a complete waste of time and effortthe good guys were doomed  irregardless  after watching this movie i realized that the universe could have been no worse a place if luke had never left his mothers side  that ruined star wars for me  i understand that they made another movie about han solo  thats nice  i havent seen it and dont care to
Apr 5 2019,negative,the plot is slow dragging  and nonsensical   finn is allowed to accomplish nothing and lujes character is inverted from the ens of return of the jedi  the film in short makes no sense  only rey and kylo ren are allowed to be genuinely interesting or accomplish anything
Apr 5 2019,negative,this film was aweful i could feel my braincells die as i watched this horrid movie
Apr 5 2019,negative,complete garbage please dont let this guy work on any more star wars movies better yet please redo this movie
Apr 4 2019,positive,its a different view on the star war universe that  enjoyed watching
Apr 4 2019,negative,made no sense and was not faithful to the previous cannon in the universe
Apr 4 2019,negative,overall i like the new characters in the new star wars movies and i think the franchise needed the new blood what i dont understand is the drive to destroy the original movies and heroes i get the plot point to kill off han solo to send kylo to the dark side except it didnt hes still a whiny brat thats mad at his family and what they did to luke skywalker in this movie made no sense every scene was totally out of character from the established history this is star wars without the heart someone needs to let them know its possible to pull in new fans without totally alienating the old ones
Apr 3 2019,positive,the last jedi was with all due respect a fantastic movie its no force awakens but i love the story and the characters this movie was unfairly and poorly rated by the audience it was an awesome movie
Apr 3 2019,negative,really wanted to enjoy this but its nearly as bad as people say
Apr 2 2019,negative,it looked great but the film made me question if i ever really liked the franchise in the first place i know it wont happen but i wish it would be decannonized as it currently stands i wont be hurrying back to another star wars film under disneys watch
Apr 2 2019,negative,not the star wars we all know and love
Apr 2 2019,negative,a very poor excuse for a star wars film every iconic character was altered so dramatically that i can only assume this movie was made by somebody that either doesnt understand what made star wars great or by somebody that hates the franchise the choreography is painfully bad take a close look at the fight scene in the throne room a real close look you can see some people waiting their turn to attack rey and kylo there was a part where 3 guards attack rey simultaneously she sparta kicks the dude in the middle but all 3 fall back with himi dont even want to get started on how this movie treated luke the last jedi makes the prequels look award worthy by comparison the only pro this movie has is that it looks nice thats it
Apr 2 2019,negative,worst star wars film ever this movie makes phantom menace look like a masterpiece in comparison
Apr 1 2019,neutral,this is the worst movie out of the new star wars trilogy and maybe even all the star wars movies
Apr 1 2019,negative,this film is a disaster that completely ruins the entire saga there are numerous major lore breaking scenes such as using lights speed as a weapon if it is so effective why has no one used it earlier and leiaï 12 12 12tms space floating powers the ï 12 12 12actionï 12 12 12ï 12 12ï 12â sequences are boring and there are few actions at all luke skywalker is drastically different from the character he was before and although people change he changed way too much the whole side plot on the casino planet was irrelevant to the story there were too many bad jokes in the film as well i have many more complaints with the film but i am running out of space
Apr 1 2019,negative,to many plot holes  ruined what jj had set up  original characters were not used wisely
Apr 1 2019,negative,nice visuals nice music some good fan services the rest is an awful insult to your brain
Apr 1 2019,negative,saw this on the plane otherwise i would not waste my time it seems to be made by someone that has no idea of star wars at all
Apr 1 2019,negative,a terrible star wars fan fiction nothing more 
Apr 1 2019,positive,this is a fantastic film dont listen to the haters this movie brings true raw emotion to star wars that is now desperately needed
Mar 31 2019,positive,ultimately disappointing a few enjoyable scenes and an epic finale with lukes sacrifice rian johnsons rogue directorial effort was simply off course and got lost in space 
Mar 31 2019,negative,cantobite didnt need to exist the plot has way to many things wrong with them some cool visuals but thats about it
Mar 30 2019,negative,whyyy   nnooooo dont ruin the jedi origin
Mar 30 2019,negative,a huge disappointment with a lot of rage quit moments for me
Mar 30 2019,positive,a great film for star wars fans which doesnt deserve harsh criticism
Mar 29 2019,positive,this review contains major spoilers only read if you have seen the movie alright with that being said i left this movie on thursday night with a lot on my mind and at a lost for words rian johnson took a lot of chances and risk with this movie some landed amazing some not so much i didnt want to write a review and give my thoughts on this movie until i saw it again which i did tonight with that being said im ready to give my thoughts this movie starts with an amazing space battle oscar issac as poe dameron is phenomenal he definitely had a lot more to do and oscar knocked it out of the park with poe in this movie from hes amazing space battles to jokes he has it all in this movie mark hamill as luke skywalker was amazing to watch this might be mark hamill best performance as luke skywalker the chemistry he had with daisy ridley is phenomenal and they both kill it together on screen adam driver as kylo ren is on a whole new level what adam driver does with this character throughout the movie is amazing and i cant wait to see what hes able to do next i already mentioned her but daisy ridley brought her a game for this movie john boyega and kelly marie tran both had awesome performances but the story line they had was weak and felt out of place in this movie some of the things i really enjoyed was the stuff on the island with rey and luke loved how it showed how much luke doesnt want anything to do with rey and wanting to train her to show her why the jedi should end also showing the back story to what happened between him and kylo ren when he was training him i really liked the connection between rey and kylo which we ultimately find out snoke it doing to trick rey into coming to his ship after kylo i really liked how poe had a lot more to do in this movie and felt more valued and had more to do and felt important to the story this time around something i really disliked and absolutely hated was how little snoke did and ultimately meant to this movie and trilogy he didnt do much and we learned nothing about him and he just died off when kylo killed him which does push kylo as the main villain but felt like snoke was useless and didnt need to be in these movies at all like i said earlier i hated the story line with finn and rose them going to that island just to get a code breaker to get onto snoke ship felt pointless and felt like it didnt belong in this movie it felt like they used it to talk about animal cruelty which felt out of place captain phasma was the biggest let down they had this amazing character that people loved and wanted more of after the force awakens and had books and comics about and built this character up just to get barley any screen time and to get killed off just felt like it was useless the final battles was amazing and looks stunning the rose saving finn pushed roses character more and built a connection between them the luke and kylo battle at the end was good and bad at the same time they didnt do much in ways of fighting but the dialogue was phenomenal i saw this coming but luke died at the end of the movie but the way they did it was phenomenal and paid respect to his character and history i left this for the end but carrie fisher as prissiness leia is phenomenal and magical she kills it yet again with the role of leia was definitely emotional seeing her finally performance as leia and what a performance it was interested to see what they do in episode 9 with leia since she does survive this movie but overall rian johnson took a lot of major risk and some landed and some didnt i really liked this movie leaving the first time but seeing it again i now love this movie i didnt say everything that happened but most of it go check this movie out with an open mind
Mar 29 2019,negative,admiral holdo was a terrible character rose was the most pointless bland and useless character in any film i have ever seen leia flying though space was comically bad phasma was wasted rey doesnt do any thing to get her power luke was ruined and the choreography was terrible
Mar 29 2019,positive,another fantastic romp through a galaxy far far away
Mar 29 2019,negative,story and plot  f  no main plot but several subplots we dont need to know or care about story is very boring confusing and hard to understand    directing  f  felt like the movie was directed by a 10 year old kid who has add    acting  c  some characters are new and dont do anything andor what is there purpose acting is nothing good  nothing bad just average    editing  f  the movie should have ended at least 1520 minutes earlier if not more the pace of this movie is terrible    musical score  b  keeps with the tradition of previous star wars films    special effects  a  great blend of cgi with practical effects  some of the best in a movie along with costume design and makeup    cinematographyproduction design  a  well done looks clean and a well made film    overall score  4310  too bad the production special effects musical score costume design and makeup are not the heart and soul of a movie in those categories some of the best ever for a movie however it lacks a comprehensive and organize story new characters one may not care about along with no character development poor directing and bad editing that in the end makes this the worst star wars film to date
Mar 29 2019,negative,absolutely destroyed what the previous enstallment had established utterly disgraceful
Mar 28 2019,positive,loved it bought it saw it twice in theaters
Mar 28 2019,negative,after being a sw fan for as long as i can remember i saw tlj in theatres only once and have never felt compeled to watch it again i wanted to like it i so wanted to like it but alas in one word it is forgetable
Mar 28 2019,negative,worst star wars film ever completely contradicts the previous films
Mar 27 2019,positive,this is a great film you dont end up understanding it straight away and a lot of fans dont have an openmind to the new concepts it has its star wars and i love it  yeah its not perfect to what you imagined but its not your screenplay
Mar 27 2019,negative,i tried giving zero stars these films are horrible like star treks new movies we need the studios to say sorry these films never happened
Mar 26 2019,negative,if this movie was not a star wars maybe it would get 25 stars but as a star wars movie it should not even get 01 stars pathetic lame and strays far from what a star wars should be very boring and predictable i am sure many others have elaborated on the points already so i wont go into depth overall poor plot poor predictable characters who i cannot invest any feelings or relate to dont bother watching this mess
Mar 26 2019,negative,the tragedy that this movie inevitably became started when the writers deliberately looked to defy the audiences every expectation just because a viewer expects something does not mean it should not happen the future of this star wars is grim after this new entry
Mar 26 2019,negative,absolutely disgusting movie and doesnt earn the name of star wars
Mar 26 2019,negative,i just feel sad about the loss of such an amazing franchise im not mad just disappointed
Mar 26 2019,negative,i feel cheated this is not star wars
Mar 26 2019,negative,the last jedi features a mixture of childish comic relief now a sad trademark of hollywood blockbusters and missed opportunities the eight episode of the epic saga fails to connect to the original trilogy in both in atmosphere and continuity rian johnsons attempt to create something unique in a universe already guided by established lore fails to impress in every way
Mar 25 2019,negative,this movie makes the prequels look great rian johnson has said in multiple interviews that his plan was to subvert the viewers expectations give them something theyï 12 12 12tmd never seen before hereï 12 12 12tms the issue subversion for the sake of it doesnï 12 12 12tmt work well there has to be a long term reason for why you chose to take the film in a certain direction and not only that you have to take into account past events in the story rian just seems to want to give a middle finger to past events and move on with something that star wars fans didnï 12 12tmt want to see the reason these movies do so well is because the fans love them to not consider the fans at all and the journey theyve had with these movies is insane i hope jj can clean it up a bit but good luck iï 12 12 12tmm not very hopeful for the next few movies in the main series
Mar 25 2019,negative,that wasnt luke that was his mirror universe alternate
Mar 24 2019,positive,while there are great moments in it i wouldnt consider episode viii great as a stand alone movie nor as a continuation of the sw franchise with the exception of luke rey and kylos storylines the film fails to do much of anything with the side characters we came to know and love in vii adam driver gives a standout performance as the conflicted ben solo and his backstory with luke and unique connection to rey is the most engaging aspect of the entire movie it isnt the attempt to subvert expectation that fails this movie so much as its pacing issues cringey dialogue and inconsistent characterization
Mar 24 2019,neutral,if you ignore some horrible moments it was an overall good movie i think they mishandled the rose and holdo roles in the movie i get what they tried to do as a whole but definitely some cringeworthy lines were written for them that are off putting
Mar 23 2019,negative,poorly directed movie still bought it but damn this movie is bad
Mar 23 2019,negative,a build up to nothing utter disappointment
Mar 23 2019,negative,an absolute waste of acting talent  and of the possibilities created in force awakens  please remake this movie
Mar 22 2019,negative,abysmal i love star wars and this movie challenged that feeling i even liked the force awakens but this moviejust awful and it really hurt solo which was a decent movie because it left an awful taste in everyoneâtms moth
Mar 22 2019,negative,bad writing again and felt like a different movie altogether than force awakens also forced political commentary that was not welcomed when qe want to just escape i was hoping for a good movie and my expectations were subverted     been a long star wars fan and even stomached through the prequels and if only this was just a bad movie but the politics brought into it made it worse why disney do you need to destroy everyhring with politics
Mar 22 2019,negative,this is probably the worst star wars movie i have seen the story and characters are ruined by this movie in my opinion
Mar 22 2019,positive,from the genius who directed brick and looper rian johnson  star wars  an absolutely incredible star wars movie i love everything about this movie the storytelling is amazing the characters are amazing this movie has tons of emotion in it the visuals are awesome the action scenes are fantastic i absolutely love how they handle luke skywalker this movie is more than a star wars movie it is an inspiring movie with amazing themes and messages as a star wars fan i absolutely adore this movie this is the star wars film i always wanted this is easily the best star wars film since the empire strikes back i am not only excited for episode ix but i am also excited for more works from rian johnson thank you rian johnson for making such an emotional and inspiring movie grade a
Mar 22 2019,negative,it is just so incredibly bad
Mar 22 2019,negative,normally a huge fan of star wars but this is garbage audience score speaks for itself
Mar 21 2019,negative,this movie is terrible it is hands down the worst star wars movie ever made the story is horrible rey is still a mary sue rian johnson does not understand luke skywalker and fight scene in the throne room is poorly choreographed this film was so bad it actually pissed me off something few movies no matter how bad have been able to do the people claiming this is a masterpiece have no idea what they are talking about if you want to watch a star wars film with your family do not watch this even the prequels at their worst were never as bad as this this was my first ryan johnson film and after seeing it i can safely say i never want to see any more of his work
Mar 21 2019,positive,really loved the throne fight scene
Mar 21 2019,negative,terrible movie so bad it manages to destroy the legacy  love of the original stars wars movies many fans childhood ruined by one huge mishap or stupidity
Mar 20 2019,negative,movie that lost its way  reys heroics at the end notwithstanding a very skippable movie
Mar 20 2019,negative,honestly i just donâtmt understand how people can enjoy this movie even if you gloss over the the massive plot holes surrounding the bombers and leia how can you not think about the waste of characters such as snoke and luke    from reys parents being nobodies and rose being a useless character who has literally no place i the movie i really donâtmt understand how someone with an iq of above 3 can like this movie for its plot
Mar 20 2019,negative,visually one of the best movies ever made but sadly the story and nonsense decisions which were made make this the worst star wars movie yet
Mar 20 2019,neutral,it was a good set up movie a movie that sets up for the next one but not a very good movie to standalone couldve been better but still a good addition to the star wars saga 
Mar 20 2019,negative,undid no mistke same old stormtroopers against rebels we still donât know anything about snoke  and killed luke for no reason
Mar 19 2019,positive,as a lifelong star wars fan i can honestly say that this is one of my most favorite films in the entire franchise regardless of the complaints and opinions held by others
Mar 19 2019,negative,seemed very rushed and like the director was simply going through the motions no originality and horrible acting all around
Mar 19 2019,negative,chaotic pathetic illogical messy saccharine infuriating disappointing garbage     regret seeing it i dont care about the characters the story or the universe  they have all become repellent to me     i now have no desire at all to see any more star wars films    thanks rian     btw  it isnt worth half a star but rt wouldnt let me give it a no star review
Mar 19 2019,negative,it was really boring and there were so many plot points that i found unrealistic the throne room fight was cool but thatâs it the problem is all the boring characters
Mar 18 2019,negative,it looks and feels impressive and on first viewing it is entertaining enough but with each subsequent watch it gets easier to pinpoint specific reasons why it rings so hollow at its conclusion
Mar 17 2019,negative,poor writing bad character development and subverted expectations are just a few of the many big problems with this film
Mar 17 2019,negative,rran johnson has destroyed the star wars franchise what could have been a boost and change for universe he destroyed the one character we knew we could depend on from bad writing and not understanding the star wars lore rian johnson has done more damage than lucas could have ever done
Mar 17 2019,negative,it gets one star for the crew caterers and background actors that put in so many sleepless hours to get this complete joke of a film made subverting expectations is not what star wars needed
Mar 17 2019,negative,im fan of star wars from childhood and im angry this is disgrace
Mar 17 2019,negative,boring plot with lackluster character     i cant believe that such a loved series like star wars had such a terrible movie i loved the force awakens and its characters but i have no idea what went wrong here     i do not recommend watching this to anyone and its probably one of the most disappointing movies of 2017
Mar 17 2019,negative,this movie was terrible for sure so much wasted time and pointless story arcs
Mar 17 2019,negative,the sequels make the prequels look like shakespeare
Mar 16 2019,negative,everyone was out of character story didnt make sense does rian johnson even care about the fans
Mar 16 2019,negative,literally one of the worst movies i have ever seen no plot the new characters cough rose cough were awful just a bad movie overall
Mar 16 2019,negative,the worst star wars movie i have ever seenu
Mar 16 2019,positive,great instalment in the star wars saga
Mar 16 2019,neutral,one of the worst star wars movies but the cinematografy and mark hamill with adam driver daisy ridley  carrie fisher make it a mixted movie
Mar 16 2019,negative,i dont understand what theyve done to the star wars universe the bombers make no sense like why do they move so slow    why did they tear luke apart what do the characters barely develop who is snoke there were no answers to answer what happened since luke left but then luke dies what
Mar 16 2019,negative,if you hated luke and han in the original series and wanted to see them grow into pathetic losers the force awakens and the last jedi are the films for you if you were also eager to see a girl who with almost no training and while had not believed in the force a week ago beat up on someone who has had years of training in the force and then get no real explanation as to why rey is apparently god this is the film for you if you really hated star wars and wanted to see it jump off a cliff this film is for you
Mar 15 2019,negative,the worst star wars movie ive ever seen by far 
Mar 15 2019,negative,i hate rian for what they did to our beloved franchise i also cant stand the positive reviews of this trash i love e star wars and i like oscar issac so not a 0 the plot the concepts everything is horrible and you are stupid if you like it
Mar 15 2019,positive,this audience score will rise after time jsut like the prey people will look back and forgot why that hated it in the first place iâtmm not saying itâtms perfect  i also donâtmt think itâtms as bad as people want to make it out to be
Mar 14 2019,negative,i hated it when i first watched and after a year i gave it another chance i hated it even more when i rewatched
Mar 14 2019,positive,i am split this film is one part amazing and another part foreign when i say foreign i mean this film doesnt feel like a star wars film at all in parts i do like rian johnsons ambitious ideas and i cant wait to see him take on his own trilogy
Mar 14 2019,negative,this movie is full of plot holes and  incompetent characters that ruin its immersion its weak narrative which lacked any strong motifs was also quite disappointing im giving it 15 stars for its weak but semiinteresting themes and its mediocre plot watching this movie makes me feel sick i would much rather watch attack of the clones
Mar 14 2019,negative,left the cinema disappointed with how the characters were treated kylo ren was the only character that felt like they matched and progressed from their appearance in episode 7 the plot is disjointed and opens alot of b and c plots that server no purpose too many plot holes visually there are some excellent shotsthe hyper space scene  excited to see how this story will fit into the saga once the next instalment drops
Mar 14 2019,negative,worst star wars movie everso far
Mar 14 2019,positive,most people who dont like this movie were probably in the fandom
Mar 14 2019,negative,given the hype generated by the previous entry one cant help but feel like this movie was one long drawn out anticlimax still at least there are new locations and settings even if the emotional connection isnt there
Mar 14 2019,negative,bad plot and lame humor
Mar 14 2019,negative,this was not a star wars movie rather it was a disney movie that was star wars themed disney somehow managed to inject the same corny humor and whitewashed tone they put into marvel movies into this star wars movie thats supposed to be set in a far far away galaxy i actually found episode 7 rather good at the very least it felt like star wars and was entertaining but rian johnson just destroyed any possibility of a halfway decent trilogy that jj abrams couldve done all on his own
Mar 14 2019,negative,it just sucks no powerfull leia no powerfull luke and a marry sue rey aloow rey to run against the wall and get back up that is human
Mar 13 2019,neutral,for me the last jedi fell short on so many levels it lacked a certain soul that the franchise had managed to carry with it for over forty years as a science fiction film it was enjoyable as a star wars film it was disappointing episode viii felt like a derailment there was an emotional buildup coming from episode vii that fizzled out quickly here i loved the force awakens and was excited to see these new characters develop unfortunately they fall flat in tlj the force is not with this one
Mar 13 2019,negative,this movie was a devastating embarrassment on nearly every level every part of the movie had serious problems but let me point to the absolute worst moment in the film a single line someone has to stay behind to pilot the ship when holdo says this it flies in the face of every moment of star wars back to the very first minute of episode iv with leia trusting r2d2 to find obiwan wheres the autopilot why is holdo being sacrificed in such a blatantly nonsensical manner why is the plot relying on absurd mechanics at every step of the way did the director have the foggiest clue of what machines can do in this universe heck a ship is really just a big droid and ron howard mocked rian johnson in solo by literally putting the droid l3 into the falcon moments like this that smack viewers with how wrong they are occur over and over resulting in an offensive degrading moviegoing experience
Mar 13 2019,negative,even over a year later it is an embarrassment to cinema and star wars alike this film had an insane amount of plot holes poorly written characters and a 5 year old director who can take no criticism without name calling this movie is a disaster and shows what happens when you milk a franchise too far
Mar 12 2019,neutral,not the best but not the worst it was ok
Mar 12 2019,negative,alien milking useless and bizarre scenes that didnt take any worthwhile risks didnt show luke as the same character we knew
Mar 12 2019,negative,it wasnt necessarily bad its just that they just killed off one of the coolest characters of the whole franchise and i felt so disappointed for that 
Mar 12 2019,negative,nothing left to say itâs just a bad movie
Mar 12 2019,negative,was boring with the long chase in space and fin and rose resucing animals for 30 mins was just stupid and a commander taking over with pink hair and actting so femine is not how a commander should be worst star wars movie ever who ever thinks that the prequels are worse then eisode 8 you are lying to yourself and you are just plain dumb
Mar 12 2019,negative,this was the worst star wars movie ever made it has made the franchise a laughing stock while at the same time destroying the legacy of our favorite characters i mean who actually cares about any of the news characters or is exciting to see the rise of skywalker lol what a joke
Mar 12 2019,negative,canto byte was a waste of time and the whole plot of the âflying through space for an hourâ got boring after a while many things about this movie practically ruined the future of the star wars saga very sad to see this disappointment come to theaters
Mar 12 2019,negative,dissapointed too many plot holes and really boring did not make any sense
Mar 12 2019,negative,utterly disappointing then again the director wasnt even promising to begin with
Mar 12 2019,positive,the last jedi acts as the equivalent to empire strikes back for the new sequel trilogy genuine surprises around every turn that thankfully dont demonize the star wars legacy as much as some vocal haters would have you believe
Mar 12 2019,negative,star wars ruined forever
Mar 11 2019,negative,garbage movie full of plot holes ruin johnson ruined luke why would luke pull a 180 after risking his life and the galaxy for the most evil man in the galaxy but tries to kill a child for having dark side thoughts why has no one ever used light speed ramning because it breaks star wars but ruin johnson doesnt care he just loves the lights
Mar 11 2019,positive,an amazing addition to the star wars films
Mar 11 2019,negative,as a lifelong star wars fan and a lover of science fiction this movie broke my heart i wont waste anybodys time by rehashing the many insults to the star wars universe that so many others have already described  rather id like to express my disappointment and genuine sadness from a different point of view  ever since i was a child my love of science fiction and fantasy stemmed from the endless possibilities that those genres presented  i was utterly intrigued by the exploration of the unknown and the unleashing of the human imagination in order to explore worlds both familiar and new  never did i read a science fiction story in order to be lectured about politics gender roles or class privilege and i certainly never expected to encounter those ideals in the star wars universe until now  the imagination of george lucas and those who built upon the fantastic universe he created felt like a feast for my imagination and then i saw the last jedi soon after the movie started it became clear to me that this movie had nothing to do with imagination or exploration nor did this movie have any interest in continuing what jj abrams had started in episode vii it also became clear to me that the original story arcs of characters id grown to love meant nothing  rather this movie was nothing more than a vehicle to indoctrinate people with political messaging  completely missing were any elements of imagination or exploration and the damage inflicted on the star wars characters that i grew up to love was for me irreparable
Mar 11 2019,negative,the worst movie i have ever seen and yes ive seen a lot of garbage but this one easily takes the cake
Mar 11 2019,negative,too many plot holes too bright rey too old luke
Mar 11 2019,negative,terrible movie in more ways than i can mention has successfully killed a beloved lifelong franchise in my heart thanks disney 
Mar 11 2019,negative,before i start this review i want to state that it has nothing to do with the agenda or anyones race or gender i think its wonderful and appropriate that different kinds of people are getting represented im just talking about the story i know star wars is a fictional world and all that but even within its confines this movie makes little to no sense everything that happens is ridiculous and farfetched and not grounded at all star wars has always had an issue with plot holes and story telling but this is a new low but as always it is visually beautiful i really enjoyed rogue one and i thought the force awakens was decent so this was kind of a surprise 
Mar 11 2019,negative,an insult to star wars fans
Mar 11 2019,positive,best star wars movie ever made i had some issues with the ending but it was amazing
Mar 11 2019,negative,star wars is dead along with star trek doctor who and the mcu another major franchise has been ruined by people who utterly donâtmt understand what made the showsfilms actually good cramming their own agendas into the already muddled storyline didnâtmt help either what is happening people
Mar 11 2019,negative,the phantom menace caravan of courage battle for endor and dare i say the holiday special are all better star wars movies than this steaming pile it took me awhile to figure out what it was about this that makes it so unwatchable was it space mary poppins porgs alien walrus milk poes frat house comedy although all of these things contributed to making this worse than superman iv hope floats and batman  robins mr freeze one liners the problem lies with the fact that when we left our beloved characters 30 something years ago they were heroes willing to do whatever it took to save the day i am a jedi like my father before me now they run and hide when things get tough
Mar 11 2019,positive,great visuals and strong performances this was truly a breathtaking movie
Mar 10 2019,positive,great movie dont believe the trolls
Mar 10 2019,negative,terrible movie with franchise ruining misteps
Mar 10 2019,positive,it was different than every other star wars movie iâtmve seen it was so hyped up but in the end i felt the director really just wanted to throw off all the viewers it makes me wonder where this is going is it just the rebels vs the bad guys again but killing off all the classic characters is kylo even bad why is rey so strong with the force hoping all is resolved in the last movie
Mar 10 2019,negative,leias flying lukes character assasination and admiral ackbars offscreen death are just a few of the reasons this movie sucks
Mar 10 2019,positive,i thought this movie had the feeling of star wars while also doing something new i thought the rey and luke interactions were great and showed a lot of emotions and the state the characters are in then showed how they got there would i have liked to see luke face down the first order with a âlaser swordâ absolutely but iâtmm happy with the direction rian took as well   despite the split fandom on the movie in my personal opinion this movie has a lot to love and some stuff not to but i really enjoyed it and itâtms still number 5 on my star wars list a solid entry in the galaxy far far away
Mar 10 2019,negative,the downright worst of the star wars franchise period 
Mar 10 2019,negative,this is by far the worst star wars movie yet rian johnson may make things look cool but he is a horrible storyteller the plot was worthless and was essentially comprised of one giant chase scene yet somehow two characters managed to go to a casino which did nothing whatsoever to move the plot along in addition the director decided it was appropriate to throw in a bunch of slapstick humor your mom jokes dont belong in star wars from the very first scenes its apparent that the sole aim of this film is to subvert expectations if only as much time and effort had been put into crafting an interesting thoughtful story 
Mar 10 2019,negative,mary sue saves the day without effort especially relevant since this is just days after the first movie also when did they figure out that warp drive can destroy enemies seems like this would have been known sooner
Mar 10 2019,neutral,hated it ruined and changed characters already established unnecessary plots canto bight holdo and poe boring characters with no personality the very cringey new rose they ruined luke however great cinematography and visuals
Mar 10 2019,negative,worst star wars movie ever worst than the phantom menace
Mar 10 2019,negative,this film marks the death of star wars
Mar 10 2019,negative,killed the franchise for me
Mar 10 2019,negative,worst star wars film ever produced genuine heresy
Mar 10 2019,negative,the worst pathetic a shame its calles star wars please destroy every copy of it
Mar 10 2019,positive,this movie is satisfying to watch if you dont think of it as a star wars movie
Mar 10 2019,negative,this is just a way to utterly cripple and destroy a franchise so much of this film could be cut so much of it is boring and the rest is frustrating to watch what happened to luke in this film alone is a reason to dodge it
Mar 10 2019,negative,bit of let down i was hoping for the story to go in another direction but it did not loss of another good character
Mar 10 2019,negative,this is by far a joke to the star wars franchise first off the story had all over it and actions that were taking place for no apparent reason they completely ruined every other star wars space combat by having a rebel ship going into lightspeed to take out a dozen or two of the empires most deadly ships why havent the rebels done this in the past just take a bunch of ships in space that have a pilot and ram them into every single empire ship boom war over dont even get me started on luke skywalker strongest guy we know of still alive for the jedi and here comes this girl who has no training and somehow kicks his butt like what the heck all shes doing is swinging to stick around its not like shes getting any training this movie is completely ruining every star wars before it
Mar 10 2019,positive,great story that felt fresh god forbid the writers didnt pander to the fans and actually provided a story that wasnt exactly what was expected and overplayed 
Mar 10 2019,negative,the movie itself was bad enough but that it was the final nail on star wars coffin rather than being an exciting new chapter of a beloved franchise is unforgivable
Mar 9 2019,negative,while theres an effort in development of main character it is definitely bland and lack of focus
Mar 9 2019,negative,they lost me with the blue milk and it went downhill from there
Mar 9 2019,negative,worst star wars of all time i liked the christmas special better
Mar 9 2019,positive,very good lukeâtms always been whiney get over it
Mar 9 2019,negative,what an awful movie it was
Mar 9 2019,negative,yaphit is becoming a mary sue  next hell be piloting the orville better than grimey
Mar 9 2019,positive,star wars the last jedi is a great addison to the star wars sag it actually felt like new fresh star wars movie unlike the force awakens through out the movie there are many consequences that puts episode 9 in a very interesting path that i canâtmt wait to witness rey is not as overpowered as the force awakens but is still a mary sue but i donâtmt mind it because daisy ridley is extremely likable as rey that iâtmm fine that she is a mary sue oscar isaac portrays poe as a true hero and is my favorite character in the film finn and rose are 2 goofy characters and seem like they belong in the marvel cinematic universe finally kylo ren is still a very whiny villain and adam driver is not given an opportunity to shine as actor which is a shame because he is a very good actor  the last jedi is an excellent addition to the star wars universe and iâtmm very excited to see how it ends in episode 9   8510
Mar 9 2019,negative,failed to have a satisfing pay off for the mysteries in force awakens rose allmost killed everyone for no justafible reson killed snoke luke and my intrest in episode 9 good cgi though
Mar 9 2019,positive,despite what many people say tlj completely honors and aligns with past star wars movies i agree there are some odd tonal moments but i think of all of the sw movies this one may be the most thematically layered after my first viewing i wasnâtmt sure what i thought about it other than it was beautifully shot but the more i watched it i gained a greater appreciation for what rian johnson was trying to do with tying up loose ends from previous movies i thought his treatments of luke and leia were completely consistent with their established characters most importantly he put the saga back on track for what it means to use the force and be a jedi i wish more people appreciated this installment thereâtms a lot of great stuff to think about
Mar 9 2019,negative,it had all the right ingredients but it was poorly prepared and ended up a flop listen to the audience reviews the pro critics seem to be out of touch
Mar 9 2019,negative,i saw this in theaters and have to say that i was horribly disappointed the force awakens was a three star movie nothing special  but i was hoping that it was just the framing device they were going to use to explain all of the stuff they set up in the next installment i was wrong    rey is good at everything no matter what and has had to sacrifice absolutely nothing in order to gain power this is not how you write protagonists and the rebelsresistance are about as effective as a bowl of jelo    somewhere along the way someone said its good because it subverts expectations all i can say is that when i go out for chinese food and someone brings me chicken parmesan my expectations have been subverted these are supposed to be direct sequels to the original trilogy  not watch us kill everyone old off so we can push our marketing strategies with skin    i am all for women i like women i really do but when you hamfist in these characters who have no motivation no reason to be and no direction and call them strong i have to wonder if the writers know what strength actually looks like     the cute funny jokes and not taking things seriously in serious moments and all of that is not the star wars tone  this is not parks and recreation with lightsabers it just isnt or maybe it is god knows that the continuity is about on par
Mar 9 2019,negative,big spectacle  huge missed opportunity  felt like they had to quickly change the end of the movie
Mar 9 2019,negative,i did not wait thirty years to see luke skywalker be a total disappointment
Mar 9 2019,positive,ive been a huge star wars fan my entire life i love the original trilogy i think the prequel trilogy films are mostly bad but ive come to accept them for what they are and enjoy watching them with my kids i like the clone wars cartoons and video games like knights of the old republic still one of my favorite star wars stories in any medium despite a few complaints another death star i thought the force awakens was good and was excited to see where they took the series and characters from there which bring us to the last jedi where the force awakens played it safe almost too safe with the star wars formula this is a film that is all about subverting our expectations and giving us something new this in my opinion is the main reason the film is so divisive the things that we expect to see in a star wars film dont always happen the hotshot pilot goes against his orders anditdoesnt work out all of the heroes dont turn out to be secretly related heroismpower isnt genetic luke isnt a confident badass who has all the answers honestly i can understand why some fans may have been disappointed you can definitely make the case that this is not a great star wars movie depending on what that means to you however i dont think there is a convincing argument out there that this is an objectively bad movie on its own merits personally i love the film and i would rank it as my second favorite in the series behind empire i do want to make one more point here for the people who are confused by how divisive this film appears to be based on the user reviews while many people dont like the movie for valid reasons like i mentioned above there are also a lot of people online giving this film negative reviews for pushing a sjw agenda the only agenda i can see is that the movie has women and people of color in it the plot doesnt revolve around this or treat any racesex as better or different from the others in fact most of the roles could be recast with someone of a different race or gender and i dont think it would change the script at all if people find that upsetting or threatening i think that is more indicative of a problem with their own views than the films the fact that some of these people feel passionately enough about this to dedicate the amount of time that they do and create multiple accounts to review bomb this movie just blows my mind i guess what im trying to say is dont put too much stock into reviews including this one ultimately as always you should watch the movie yourself and form your own opinion 
Mar 9 2019,positive,great film the hate seems fake
Mar 9 2019,negative,worst film of all time
Mar 9 2019,negative,i watched the movie 3 times  wanted to like it but i cant  i tried
Mar 9 2019,positive,my love for star wars is unconditional and knows no bounds with that said i support the last jedi to my best abilities and give it the highest score possible here im happy that star wars is alive and well again after all the years of them saying it was over bring on episode ix
Mar 9 2019,negative,just no fell asleep twice in the cinema watching this nonevent of a âmovieâtm kanto byte scene is a waste luke is not the luke i remember as a matter of fact his character is destroyed here rey overcomes all obstacles without earning her power again and all the plot lines set up in tfa are lost in this film    this trilogy will not be canon in my house terrible and unwatchable
Mar 9 2019,negative,great special effects and overall production this film looks and feels amazing however the plot and characters are seriously lacking all of the interesting hooks from tfa are tied up in unfulfilling ways this leaves little excitement or energy for the next film and makes this film a bit of a drag
Mar 9 2019,positive,i personally liked it
Mar 9 2019,negative,well you did it you killed it you killed this movie this franchise and all of its heroes mark hamil finally got the chance to relive his favorite character and you turned him into a crying baby the man who sacrificed everything to save his friends luke willingly walked into the hands of the empire to face the emperor the most powerful force of evil in the movie because he thought there was a chance to save his father he didnt care if he would die as long as he could try to save vader but in this movie he gets scared of ben tries to kill him and gets his ass kicked by a kid then runs away to hid and die on an island i hope you are proud of destroying star wars
Mar 9 2019,positive,this movie ruins not just the 3rd trilogy but the entire skywalker saga itself poor plot terrible direction with the characters and makes up new rules that dont make any sense in the context of the rest of the movies the only reason i gave 1 star is for the visually stunning scenery and effects
Mar 9 2019,negative,the only thing that is semi starwars about this movie is the name
Mar 9 2019,negative,ok the movie could have been great it has its moments and i wish it could have been better still no reason for rey being op the action is bland luke is portrayed as a old worn out man this could have been interesting but the reasoning behind it is really pathetic going gets tough quit its not the boy who lost everything and set out on revenge against the empire to fix it     all in all it is just a mediocre movie and because it is a star wars movie i must hold it to higher standard and give it a 15
Mar 9 2019,negative,it feels really long everything that could of been meaningful is replaced with gotcha moments it looks great but none of it has any real meaning the most visually stunning scene is completely wasted as its very presence completely ruins all previous star wars space battles
Mar 9 2019,negative,tlj could have been good if it wasnt the sequel in a trilogy inside of a saga the themes were ok but all of the twists were just to surprise the audience and did not service the overall story new characters were introduced while old characters and story lines were set aside to allow room for them subversive story telling only works in small amounts you can allow for some abrupt changes from the first movie but literally everything that was set up in tfa was cast off as if it didnt matter they need luke to fight the first order nope he doesnt believe in the jedi any longer who are rays parents well they are no body finn oh lets just send him on a pointless side mission and destroy his story arc by not allowing him to sacrifice himself who is snoke and what are his motivations well he is powerful enough to link two people across the galaxy but cant see kylo moving a light saber lets just kill him lets say luke tried to kill kylo and then lets kill him without anyone actually killing him the subversive nature of this film doesnt make it interesting or deep it just destroys any sense of congruent story telling throughout a trilogy this film just goes to show why having two writers that have two different visions should not direct sequels i just hope jj can fix it with the third film because the only way this film could work is if the third film fixes its mistakes please bring in the knight of ren 3 out of 10
Mar 9 2019,negative,the worst star wars movie bar none  if you love the original trilogy you will hate this one
Mar 9 2019,positive,totally awsome an original movie that cames to innovategreat characters and a very good story
Mar 9 2019,negative,the worst star wars movie
Mar 9 2019,neutral,this movie is a perfect example of why twists and surprises dont make a movie good the twists felt more for shock factor than for the actual story line overall this movie was disappointing and could have been better
Mar 9 2019,negative,his film destroys everything we loved in star wars i hope they will make more films like rouge one or like the prequels
Mar 9 2019,negative,as bad as it gets for a movie
Mar 9 2019,negative,great visuals amazing cgi class a actors but and awful  generally dislikable story that ruins the feeling of the star wars universe
Mar 9 2019,negative,years of luke being thought of as a icon and an incredibly power and wise jedi was runined in 2 hours words are hard to find how bad this movie made me feel after watching it very sad
Mar 9 2019,negative,top to bottom worst start wars film  poorly written  some of the dialogue is so bad there were audible groans in the theater  the attempts at humor are not in line with the star wars feel  i really wanted to like the movie as a liked most of the new characters from the force awakens  most of those characters get reduced in this film  i saw it a second time to make sure i wasnt overly critical the first time  it was worse  i look forward to never seeing it again  two of the characters introduced in this film are worse than jar jar binks  i didnt think that was possible
Mar 9 2019,negative,what a convoluted shamble of a movie thereï 12tmre so many things wrong with it itï 12tms hard to know where to begin worst movie iï 12tmve ever seen
Mar 9 2019,negative,horrible movie it had such potential but it is like the director decided throw all the hard work away from the force awakens
Mar 9 2019,negative,how they treated luke skywalker is an absolute crime
Mar 9 2019,neutral,upon seeing the movie twice im pretty sure that i dont really like it the messages seem forced the characters are bad the plot is banal i have nothing to say that hasnt already been said welp at least the effects are still cool
Mar 9 2019,negative,bad plot it is just pointless a disgrace to lukeâs character the hero just do everything right the first time there is no sense of struggle the bad guys are just a joke
Mar 8 2019,negative,i hate this movie wity every inch of my being 
Mar 8 2019,negative,lazy scattered writing
Mar 8 2019,negative,if zero stars were an option that is wha i would rate this movie  it goes beyond disrespecting classic characters and lore the movie in and of itself lacks any internal consistency whatsoever the good guys flip back and forth between being the rebels and the resistance  the villains are reduced to punching bags the comedy at one point even practically includes pop culture references as a cheap gag  save your time and pretend this movie is not part of the saga
Mar 8 2019,negative,the desecration of luke skywalker wouldve made a much better title
Mar 8 2019,negative,this was definitely the least planned and thought out movie i have ever had the displeasure of watching it flat out doesnâtmt make sense ruins lore and past movies and is plain boring at parts i would rather watch the prequels 100 times over than a second of this train wreck
Mar 8 2019,negative,its a joke that the critics have this at 91 this movie is absolute trash 
Mar 8 2019,negative,the star wars film that made me never want another sw film made i could list all the stupid parts of this film but others have covered them in depth simply the worst star wars film ever made im hoping that the next star wars film treats this one as a dream sequence
Mar 8 2019,neutral,this movie is perhaps the worst of the third trilogy
Mar 8 2019,negative,this movie is a perfect example of how you make millions of fans go from being excited about having more movies added to a franchise to hating the fact that anybody ever suggested it
Mar 8 2019,negative,what can i saw it was just bad i would probably run out of character space if i tried to explain everything
Mar 8 2019,positive,while some plot points are a bit aggravating the last jedi immerses you into the star wars universe with action and heart thats better then ever
Mar 8 2019,positive,this film was ok i would not consider it a waste of my time to watch it but it is not a great movie weak story at best and the heros growth from zero to hero took massive leaps one minute nobody next minute jedi master  come on
Mar 8 2019,negative,subverts expectations more like subverts everyones childhood
Mar 8 2019,negative,a convoluted and flawed story with stunning visuals the movie had potential but failed to seize it
Mar 8 2019,negative,its not very good its very bad story hate it
Mar 8 2019,positive,the last jedi can be best described as a schrodingers movie while i liked the effects sound and camareography i cannot deny the story felt dodgy to say the least  i find myself liking it overall but it was still a huge disappointment compared to the force awakens
Mar 8 2019,negative,so so bad  took an already boardering on bad movie and made that worse  not sure why they switched directors  what they did to all the old cast was terrible  the new heroes just arent interesting  the 45 min worthless plot to save alpacas was a huge waste of time  the fight scenes such as the throne room with snoke if you pay attention are worse than bad  kicks 3 guys in 1 kick a enemies weapon straight disapears she stops fighting a sword at her neck so she could drop her ls so she could stab the guy yet he doesnt take her head off  it was just so bad on 500 different points
Mar 8 2019,neutral,this was absolutely the worst possible story line ever imagined in my opinion for a star wars movie this movie left me in a bad place and i wanted a refund do not be fooled by the trailer as it is bait and switch what a shame this had to happen
Mar 8 2019,negative,this movie has completely lost touch with why people liked the original star wars  theyve forgotten how to make strong characters witty dialogue and have gone to an over reliance on cgi
Mar 8 2019,negative,the movie left me empty inside i think george lucas will have to save episode 9
Mar 8 2019,negative,the worst star wars movie ever made and has single handily ruined the entire sw franchise for me
Mar 8 2019,negative,good action but not enough to save it  so disappointed that the writers didnâtmt love this franchise enough to do justice to the stories and characters truly a disappointing addition to a most beloved franchise  mark hamill you did your absolute best with what you were given thank you for trying to save this movie you were the only highlight
Mar 8 2019,negative,they did not treat luke respectfully his death was awkward and he was not written well at all didnâtmt even feel like luke the casino scene was totally out of place and donâtmt even get me started on rose awful character and pointless it just doesnâtmt feel like star wars anymore the only good parts are some of the action scenes would not recommend
Mar 8 2019,negative,the original trilogy is treated horribly luke was a character built up over 6 films and it tore him down i didnt show his reaction to an important death from the prior film his charater tries to redeem his father the galaxies most evil person and never gives up but he does the opposite in this film never attempting redemption of his family member that went wrong     most of the other charaters arcs are not much changed from the start of the movie the universe is small because its a war of a couple people in a space chase the new aliens are all similar along with the ships being similar to the old trillogy its not very creative     had good visuals
Mar 8 2019,negative,what an awful sequel    everything that was interesting about the the force awakens was brushed aside in this film for the purpose of subverting expectations    every flaw of the force awakens was amplified 10fold in this film    for all of its flaws i could have forgiven them if the movie told an interesting story but it fails to accomplish that too the movie basically ends where it began with the resistancerebels on the run
Mar 8 2019,negative,absolutely horrible
Mar 8 2019,negative,a horrible movie that disrespects the source material and the previous movie the disrespect towards mark hamil is just incredible
Mar 8 2019,neutral,some stunning visuals but the story was not emotionally involving and was logic challenged i thought rogue one was a much better movie
Mar 8 2019,negative,what a disgrace of a film
Mar 8 2019,negative,i saw it three times in the theateri wanted to like it  some parts are great but the overall story was terrible and didnt make a lot of sense  why waste our time showing these side adventures that didnt matter
Mar 8 2019,negative,i know im late but this movies was terrible im officially done with star wars thanks disney after solo and this i cant do it anymore
Mar 8 2019,negative,i lost my faith in this excellent franchise after watch this movie i will skip the next
Mar 8 2019,negative,the worst star wars film ever made
Mar 8 2019,negative,plots holes disregard for the story and the lore and disregard for the fans opinions the movie has good moments but is over shadowed by plot holes and out handling of the characters
Mar 8 2019,negative,terrible remake of the original movie terrible casting of characters terrible cgi effects
Mar 8 2019,negative,wow what a disaster
Mar 8 2019,negative,this movie ruined star wars for me the classics will always stand the test of time but i could care less about any new star wars movies after this
Mar 8 2019,negative,this is not star wars
Mar 8 2019,negative,this movie ruined my interest in star wars rian johnson failed so many unneeded scenes just to please unneeded narratives rose like why this is the first time in star wars history that i just could not stand what i just saw
Mar 8 2019,negative,it let me down  it ignored all the plot points that i was excited about in the first film and basically left things in an anticlimactic state  i didnt even enjoy the big fight scene because it was just confusing and poorly choreographed  the movie was an overall disappointment
Mar 8 2019,positive,great movie beautifully shot captivating and unexpected story developed the star wars mythos demonstrating that lore from the books and other works do not have to determine the future of the franchise lukes philosophy was real with an honest reaction to tragedy i loved the arc between rey and kylo excited for the future of the franchise
Mar 8 2019,positive,its really a great star wars movie though i can understand why some people might not be happy with the direction they took luke skywalker  for me they gave me a believable scenario as to why he would seclude himself and we still got to see one of the absolute most awesome moments in the saga when he fights kylo ren  overall i think its the best of the disney star wars films though still below any of the original trilogy films  i love rey loved the battle in the throne room and loved the porgs  thought the canto bight scenes were the low mark of the film and probably could have been edited a bit
Mar 8 2019,negative,an insulting way to kill your franchise
Mar 8 2019,negative,no my cup of coffee really didnt enjoy this one
Mar 7 2019,negative,just a bad movie characters have no dept at all and a flying leia and destroying a fleet with hyperspace comon
Mar 7 2019,negative,destroys cannon removes pivotal characters for seaming no reason heavy fem agenda so much so that it creates plot holes more than can be counted visuals were as expected amazing music and audio first rate al actors across the board were solid just a bad bad story line
Mar 7 2019,negative,if you liked the force awakens everything it set up and the questions you wanted answered to then this isnt the movie for you but if you watch it anyways subvert your expectations youll thank me later
Mar 6 2019,neutral,some really good action scenes but an overall disappointment
Mar 6 2019,negative,this is not a good star wars movie or a good movie movie
Mar 6 2019,negative,the holdo maneuver created plot holes in all of the previous movies side plots didnt add to the story it is very apparent there was not enough coordination between this movie and the force awakens
Mar 6 2019,positive,people need to grow up and accept that the franchise has grown up too was this movie perfect no no star wars movie has been not even the empire strikes back are there things about it i would have changed yes was it overall a wellcrafted follow up yes
Mar 6 2019,positive,this is a great star wars movie the movie gets so much unnecessary hate its unreal
Mar 6 2019,positive,i really enjoyed this movie has it all good and bad but certainly original and must watch stay away from social media and make up your own mind had one of the most amazing cinematography i have seen in cinema cant wait to see what happens next
Mar 6 2019,positive,absolutely loved this movie even more than the original three which to me seemed like comic books brought to the big screen by contrast the last jedi seemed liked an epic exciting film which kept me captivated all the way through
Mar 6 2019,negative,how can ray be stronger than luke without any jedi training  how can ray lift a mountain without any jedi training  how can ray be stronger than the emperor guards without jedi training    this is not how star wars works    also why bother finding the dead star plans and weakneses if you can easily destroy it by hyperspacing a big junk ship into it
Mar 6 2019,neutral,this movie has some really high points and some really low points 
Mar 5 2019,negative,horrible character developmentcompletely ruined lukes character overallcheesy fight scenesoverall just a big disappointment
Mar 5 2019,negative,this movie deserves 0 stars but ill give you half a star extra for inclusive casting
Mar 5 2019,negative,disgrace to the franchise complete disregard for the established universe
Mar 5 2019,negative,1 star for the visuals otherwise the worst story and character portrayal ive ever seen
Mar 5 2019,negative,the short of the critique this film is technically solid and polished  photography is great the music is better than tfa good effects sfx and physical and design    however it generally fails to be a sequel to any previous film  its story falls flat in the 2nd act and ultimately is unsatisfying  its 3rd act flips on its own message and tries to be a star wars film but still is disappointing    i cannot recommend this film on the basis that it resets tfa and generally does not honor the character of luke skywalker in a believable way  rey is presented with an intriguing offer that in a film filled with subversion she fails to subvert  theres no redemption for this film short of technical achievements
Mar 5 2019,negative,easily the worst movie ever made
Mar 5 2019,negative,awful could not finish it
Mar 5 2019,positive,it was very good especially because of itâtms portrayal of luke the last jedi showed a consistency with luke his struggle with the dark side
Mar 5 2019,positive,explores more things about the mysteries of the force developed the characters and has some surprising twists but at the end itâtms not that good
Mar 5 2019,negative,complete bantha fodder  this is even worse than the force awakens
Mar 5 2019,negative,truly a disaster of a movie not only did it completely disregard any and all plot threads left open from the force awakens it managed to close all of the ones leading into ep ix which has left nothing for the sequel to go off the movie fundamentally did not understand the character of luke skywalker and destroyed his legacy along with the legacy of our original trilogy heroes poor writing out of place comedy and a lack of understanding of the core fanbasefranchise have culminated in this disaster of a film not only has disney killed any and all interest i had in this trilogy it has killed my love for the franchise i have been a lifelong fan of star wars and some of my favourite characters include princess leia ahsoksa tano and from the eu mara jade aurra sing and jaina solo i dont like this trilogy because rey is the main character i hate it because it doesnt fit into the skywalker saga    shame on you for tanking this franchise i refuse to ever give anymore money to disney
Mar 5 2019,positive,even though this movie tried some bold moves that became dull and somewhat ridiculous to the main plot it still has better things to offer than its predecessor
Mar 5 2019,negative,worst sw movie in the series
Mar 4 2019,neutral,what happened with star wars the movie as itself works but is misplaced in its huge universe
Mar 4 2019,negative,so boring i fell asleep  plus i really didnt like the force awakens and this story made me like that movie less
Mar 4 2019,negative,this felt less like a continuation of star wars and more like a spoof
Mar 4 2019,negative,ignore all the media all the hype all the hate and all the baggage people bring to this and what youre left with is kind of a dumb movie that makes zero narrative sense but has some nice visual effects
Mar 4 2019,neutral,a real disappointment  so many forgettable scenes very few worthy of a star wars movie  as bad as the 3 prequels and thats saying something
Mar 4 2019,negative,strong scenes and moments are failed by a plot that fails to understand the established characters
Mar 4 2019,negative,this movie is such a train wreck please do better with such a great universe of material theres literally no call for such a bad film
Mar 4 2019,negative,this is not the star wars you are looking for this movie is a betrayal to the original star wars as a star wars fan for 40 years the unnecessary and nonsense political correctness and sjw agenda are jammed in the movie and destroying star wars the character assassination to the original characters is horrible and done terribly although the visual effect and cinematic aspect of the movie was done beautifully the plot and  story is a complete betrayal to the original star wars spirit
Mar 4 2019,negative,one of the worst movies i have ever seen
Mar 4 2019,positive,iï 12tmm not certain why the audience score was so low i am one of those people who have been watching star wars since the very beginning like the empire strikes back  this film takes some unexpected turns in my opinion  these are all mature choices showing great storytelling and excellent dramatic choices over just making it another video game i think time will favor this movie  and erase all of the hate and calling it received by  a certain group  of disgruntled fans
Mar 4 2019,negative,amazingly bad script with no roots in sw lore gets a star for some decent effects
Mar 4 2019,neutral,the problem with the last jedi is really the pacing and tone the tone does not match the previous installments of the series the comedy feels very out of place and the pacing is poor considering however rian johnson is a great filmmaker and the film truly is filled with some of the best star wars moments unfortunately the subplots and character developments are generally flat but the performances by all the actors are downright incredible perhaps the release of episode ix will help this movies placement within the entire saga
Mar 4 2019,negative,the storyline made little sense some of the events which occurred destroyed long standing in physics in the universe sci fi films work on the necessity that they are at least consistent internally to the logic of the lore      when one ship hyperspacing can destroy entire fleets why wasnt that used against the death star to save entire planets and millions of lives      plus bos action make little sense the case scene sub plot is cheesy too long and has no effect on the final plot
Mar 4 2019,negative,terrible terrible movie
Mar 4 2019,negative,terrible badly written characters that you cant relate to beloved characters ruined if you loved the original trilogy and havent seen this dont
Mar 3 2019,positive,absolutely loved this installment i enjoyed what they did with our beloved og characters i liked luke becoming humanized and having faults the chemistry between rey and ben is exceptional i place this in my top 3 favorite star wars films
Mar 3 2019,negative,so bad nothing really happend in the movie felt like it was just filling space in the movie kylo is like a teenage brat ryan johnson poor movie let down disney wouldnt bother watching
Mar 3 2019,negative,very bad just lazy and bad writing everything in this movie gets you scratching your head and pass no  attention to past continuity
Mar 3 2019,negative,this movie was a good movie in appearance but it destroyed the star wars franchise
Mar 3 2019,negative,one of the worst star wars films
Mar 3 2019,negative,i did not like this movie at all  what they did with luke was lame  the way they handled the chief bad guy was also very disappointing  multiple storylines that i cared nothing about  this isnâtmt a legitimate star wars movie in my opinion
Mar 3 2019,negative,this film is not star wars and they ruined the franchise 
Mar 3 2019,negative,star wars the last jedi attempts to redefine star wars by trying to make the film appear deeper and intellectual however it is in this attempt that star wars miserably fails     star wars the last jedi kills every interesting idea set up in the force awakens     a film ruined by too much ambition
Mar 3 2019,negative,didnt like the colors too shinny
Mar 3 2019,neutral,the move was crap but cgi was great if not cgi i probably give this move 1 out of 5
Mar 3 2019,negative,memorable   which is unfortunate
Mar 3 2019,negative,wow i thought the force awakens was bad this is quite possibly the worst most poorly written big budget blockbuster i have ever seen the half star is for mark hamill and carrie fisher the only actors who came through this mess with any dignity intact its so sad to think this was carries final star wars movie excluding what was prefilmed for ep ix if you want to watch a true big studio mega budget train wreck in action this should be your first and last stop
Mar 3 2019,negative,insanely poor script good visuals cringeworthy characters and gags horrifically poorly executed plot devices and a horrendous virtue signalling element to the stupid dissapointing story painful
Mar 3 2019,negative,i only give half a star because i cant give less   episode 1 is light years ahead of this movie
Mar 3 2019,negative,the cgi team did a great job the rest of the movie is absolute garbo dont waste you time and your money on this
Mar 3 2019,negative,garbage movie convenient storylines dull cartoonish characters idiotic plot twists did not feel like a starters movie the opening scene with was stupid humor that distracted from the story they make finn look like an idiot walking around in his water suite these points happen within the first five minutes of the movie i could go on i so glade i waited to watch this on red box
Mar 3 2019,negative,this is not star wars anymore
Mar 3 2019,negative,worst film i have ever seen  an insult to fans
Mar 3 2019,negative,i hate this movie i initially thought the last jedi was a cool title i was excited having seen the force awakens to see where the story would go with the skywalker saga i was horrfied by the out of place comedy right at the beginning of the film at this point i had a very bad feeling about the last jedi because a tone was set and it was not star wars after enduring the time to sit through this awful movie i left disgusted and angry disney allowed this garbage to release as canon to be a part of the star wars legacy no it is not my canon this movie trashed the star wars legacy that george lucas built not does this film defy the lore and rules already established in the star wars universe they humiliated and destroyed luke skywalker nothing was answered from the force awakens and this was not a high thrill space opera it was nihilistic trash with a star wars label slapped on it it was a quick cash grab by disney that went out of its way to spite star wars fans i am done with disney star wars i hate it let the next episode of this disgusting sequel trilogy fail
Mar 3 2019,positive,what an amazing star war movie it was this movie is going one step further than the others and is an absolute emotional roller coaster
Mar 3 2019,negative,garbage and a complete betrayal of luke skywalker and everything that has come before it
Mar 3 2019,negative,destroyed the franchise will not pay to see another disney owned franchiseï 12ï 12ï 12 great job sinking the unsinkable
Mar 3 2019,negative,identity politics aside subverting my expectations aside   even those things are even more reasons why im heavily disappointed even angry at this film     i was not told anything about the film before watching  so my impressions were my own i did not like it even with fight of each side this film sucks and this film is great afterwards i tried to find reasons to like the film to be a fan is to love something at the best of times and the worst     the reasons i disliked the movie again with the identity politics causing me to be uncomfortable and the subverting of my expectations making me confused  what makes me upset is the inconsistencies in plot things taken from the previous film and disregarding a lot of it   second was the disrespect of luke luke was the embodiment of hope how he would fight as a soldier against the empire how he would fight for his captured friends on cloud city the best possible proof of his good will was that he went to convert his father from evil just by faith and a chance this is hope this reckless hope in the eyes of most people this character trait was disregarded as he tried to murder his nephew who was good and had a small entertaining thought to be evil this makes no sense it took me away from the film and into thought its not that i could never imagine my hero to fall but how they fell it was something that is truly a stretch of the imagination and fabricated to create a situation that went against the plot of the force awakens     the movie had too much comedy that was placed at weird moments     canto bight was a time waste    no respect for now dead past characters    i have an opinion and having the directors and cast attack me for this opinion makes me stern on my choice not out of pride or malice but to make a decision i wanted to be neutral but if i a fan have the power to speak i must so i have
Mar 3 2019,positive,this movie wasnt a star wars movie now its a disney movie
Mar 3 2019,negative,did what even jarjar couldnt doturned me off star wars
Mar 3 2019,negative,the absolute worst star was film ever i have read better fan fiction than this
Mar 3 2019,negative,i have loved star wars since i was a little boy long before it became as mainstream as its beginning to be nowadays i own so much merchandise including a full set of stormtrooper armour and a number of helmets im a lover of the movies i grew up on the prequel trilogy as that was my teen years and i loved them but there were a few issues with them as all movies all the movies coming from disney though are crap so far absolute rubish and they are tarnishing the star wars name with the exception of rogue one i liked as they built up a good mix of characters but unfortunately i knew they were all going to die off the force awakens was very poor and they killed off the legendary solo in such a stupid way the villain annoys me every time he is on screen im pretty sure i could knock this villain out myself with one right hook hes such a cry baby its drives me insane trying to understand why people like him compared to darth vader hes an absolute wimp and it harms the movies drastically    now the last jedi wow i saw the trailers and i thought this looks like it might be the one to chnage my mind it looked great and had the return of a legendary film icon and a childhood hero for me luke skywalker i was not ready i have never been so annoyed at the end of a movie it was absolute garbage they turned luke skywalker into a wimp and a man who would murder his own relatives completely against the character and unbelievable there was rubbish and almost sick enducing attempts at humour rammed in the characters are boring they are ramming political crap into a movie no end its badly written directed and an insult to the intelligence of anyone who has seen the originals just a joke i actually wanted my money back utter crap as a result of this i didnt want to watch solo a movie i was never exited about either and i most certainly will not be paying to see the next one im done dont watch this movie watch the originals or prequels or just something else    however its only quality was it looked the part and has perfect special effects but that doesnt make a movie keep making the merchandise disney as you are churning out some good stuff to buy but i wont pay another penny to see a star wars movie again i could easilly make a better star wars movie the fans would love over this rubbish they continue to churn out
Mar 3 2019,negative,so unless it was all a force dream theres nowhere to go mary rey already beat kylo they set up nothing in 8 only a reboot will fix this trainwreck ill gladly pass on sw ep9 pt1  pt2 you know theyd split the last movie if they knew it would bring in more money
Mar 3 2019,negative,i am sad i even watched this crap
Mar 2 2019,negative,terriable movie aimless story and characters took away from the star wars universe rather than adding  to it

Mar 2 2019,negative,terrible plot bad unlikeable characters kylo ren is crap space balls is a better starwars film
Mar 2 2019,negative,fragmented story main characters written off too easily
Mar 2 2019,negative,no back story for a lot of new characters came across as over excited chaos most of the movie weird dynamics between core characters that had no credibility and saddest of all the kids wanted to go after 20 minutes
Mar 2 2019,negative,this film ruined the franchise cgi was good but the story bad no fun watching this
Mar 2 2019,negative,disney not only murdered luke skywalker they murdered his character as well
Mar 2 2019,negative,it had some visually stunning cinematic moments but ultimately it let the fans down in terms of story structure connection to the previous film consistency with the franchise and on and on
Mar 2 2019,negative,this movie insults the intelligence of the audience and betrays the character of luke
Mar 2 2019,negative,what the hell happened to this franchise

Mar 2 2019,negative,horrible movie bad writing and acting
Mar 2 2019,negative,garbage movie for a star wars film rian johnson is a hack    pros   good cgi    cons  villains and heroes alike are killed off without seeing their archs all the way through  noone working on this film had even a high school level of understanding in physics or science as youll watch people be completely fine after being sucked out into the vacuume of space and laser projectiles have a trajectory arch even when fired in space where theres no gravity  lame new characters who are handed victories without earning them  i was quoting han the whole movie saying thats not how the force works the force is more of a convenient plot device to keep powering poor storytelling  a single fighter ship brings down a ship that was the size of a star destroyer if this is possible why hasent the first order been erradicated      just an aweful movie that should be retconned out of existence for the good of the franchise
Mar 2 2019,negative,they decided to ruin luke skywalkers legacy with this stupid simplistic space chase that was way too long for a film where nothing really happens  the makers of this movie dont even seem to understand what star wars even is and why anyone likes it or used to like it
Mar 2 2019,negative,just watched this movie and sure seems like star wars has lost its way
Mar 2 2019,negative,just tried watching this on netflix and i couldnt even make it halfway just not a good movie i used to love sw so much but this is just terrible very sad

Mar 2 2019,negative,mostly a trippy drug trip for the first 34 of it and then somewhat alright for the last quarter if youre a star wars fan watch it for the continuation of the story otherwise i wouldnt go for it
Mar 2 2019,negative,what a terrible movie  left me wondering what i just saw  nothing about the story felt like star wars  was just a long car chase in space with characters making really dumb decisions  nothing made sense  destroyed everything set up by the force awakens  makes me not care about episode 9
Mar 2 2019,negative,ruined my childhood it had its cosmetic moments but all in all i was nauseated most of the film skip this movie
Mar 2 2019,negative,so many plot holes and did tie into previous movie
Mar 2 2019,negative,this was bad writing incompetent military strategy on all sides are hero journeys illegal now why why did they do this to the ip rob me twice shame on you im siting the next one out who is running this version because its turned out to be a sht show and it needs to stop
Mar 2 2019,negative,this movie completely ruins the characters of luke and leia and it also introduces a new character a hundred times more annoying than jar jar binks it also had many unnecessary scenes and many scenes were filled with extremist politics all in all it was a terrible film and by far the worst star wars movie to ever exist i would rate this movie zero stars but i can only rate it a half of a star
Mar 2 2019,negative,everything wrong with sw tlj

Mar 2 2019,negative,so very many holes and no logic to any of this
Mar 2 2019,negative,its hard to like a movie that is so devoid of any real spirit or passion that its tedious work to sit through  the characters are not even realistic  stereotype s buti rather simplistic personifications of what some people think they should be  the action is lovely tied together with no real compelling goal  its just a boring mess
Mar 2 2019,negative,i think the critics are overrating this film i just dont like it sad to say it didnt have the star wars feel and if thats because of disney i dont know ep 12 are good compared to this

Mar 2 2019,negative,wow  after a over a year of being out i finally saw this movie  what a disappointment the original star wars i remember from the 70s and 80s is officially dead  its all a bunch of sjw nonsense with no valid storyline needless subplots horrible humor and bland acting  they made a mockery of the original trilogy and completely deviated from the lore of the swu to push their woke agenda  skip this at all costs
Mar 2 2019,negative,its just a bad movie

Mar 1 2019,negative,pros visuals    cons poor character development superfluous plots and conflicting messaging
Mar 1 2019,negative,completely ruined everything the force awakens set up who is driving this train wreck
Mar 1 2019,negative,a devastating sequel in this much anticipated trilogy it was painful to watch we kept looking at our phones waiting for it to be over the plot and cringe worthy scenes made this film unwatchable who on earth approved this horrendous script what wasted potential great actors with bad material what a tragedy
Mar 1 2019,negative,some great elements but the plot is really convoluted and the dialogue often feels awkward instead of organic 
Mar 1 2019,negative,a weak movie with the combined trash of han solo movie has forever ruined the star wars brand for me and i am done with it thanks for killing a beloved franchise cant wait to see what you guys kill next this movie was boring turtle paced too many fake endings terrible story telling and just a retelling of star wars 5
Mar 1 2019,negative,it does not follow the path that the force awakens set also i understand it is scifi but really dropping bomb in open space
Mar 1 2019,negative,not a star wars movie if you love star wars just ignore the new trilogy it makes the prequels look good
Mar 1 2019,negative,a good movie should be projected onto the screen and not the audience
Mar 1 2019,negative,disney does not understand star wars terrible script an insult to luke
Mar 1 2019,negative,this was a piece of shit movie so many plots holes it doesnt make any fcking sense i wont go see the next one for sure
Mar 1 2019,negative,i can not tell you how many star wars conversations ive had about the prequels every star wars conversation led to discussing why the prequels werent good and what lucas should of done mind you i saw the phantom menace eight times in theaters i still could find enjoyment in the films im sure star wars fans can relate after the force awakens which i saw 7 times in theaters i was excited because i thought star wars was going in the right direction i didnt think the movie was incredible but i could appreciate the bow to the original trilogy and i knew that they would start to form their own unique story in the next two installments of the trilogy    the last jedi is a calculated dismemberment or all underlying star wars themes character traits and overall lore watching this movie felt like being held down against my will arms pinned feet tied and mouth forced open to recieve a wad of phlem mustered up from the glands of a gamorrean     watching this movie was torture     its like finding out bill cosby raped all those women you can never watch anything he has done ever again without that sulking feeling no matter how hard you try you can not separate the man from his craft your mind keeps screaming out he raped womenas it should     the original star wars trilogy will always be my favorite movies nothing can ruin thatbut knowing what happens to luke knowing what happens to the universeit stings the only way i get through it is rejecting the plot of the last jedi i simply pretend it isnt star warsand in every way besides names and the title it isnt its your ex girlfriend wearing a star wars hoodie sure she cheated on you took your money for drugs told everyone you had a small penis and has never seen star wars in her life but shes wearing a star wars hoodie so if you call her a lady dog who lacks any flutter of soul youre just a toxic person     if you google star wars you get the articles talking about its toxic fanbase hayden christiansen himself said it best when asked if he had any advice for actor kelly marie tran who had received hateful messages on social media he replied with    i dont know if i have any advice for that but justyou know dont take it too seriously becauseunfortunately bullies are the ones that make the most noise but the majority of people dont feel that way so keep that in mind    mind you that i despised anakin in the prequels i thought his character was horribly written and i was unimpressed with his actingbut when i went to the star wars con in florida i was psyched to she him there i have no problems with the guy its nothing personal as a matter of fact i dont think he did a bad job in episode three i know its not all his fault     the very producers actors and directors are lashing out at the star wars community and they are grouping us all together with hateful people i was pissed at the team but i do not hate them few people do you cannot group all the harsh but true criticism together with trolls ryan johnson is on record saying the same people criticising the last jedi would have destroyed empire strikes back if that movie was released now how nobody went to see solo because of comments like this and because they dont view these movies as the star wars they know and love hate or no hate dont come after the star wars community as a whole     if youre not with me then youre my enemy  only a sith deals an absolute     the creators need to understand that they messed up not even by star wars standards but by movie standards the movie had no clear direction a honeycombs worth of plot holes lack of depth and lines that sounded as dry as siris directions     its worse than terrible money and pretty visuals dont make a movie good quite literally a cupcake with poop filling
Mar 1 2019,negative,rip luke skywalker rip leia such disrespect shown to these iconic characters
Mar 1 2019,negative,a movie completely devoid of respect or care for the characters and lore the new cast of characters undergo no character development and the plot is entirely nonsensical to the point of ruining suspension of disbelief a chase scene between capital ships that last hours while all of the starfighters that could have ended it in a matter of minutes sit uselessly in the hangars new bomber craft that dont even match the capabilities of the clone wars era ywing hyperspace ramming  sixty seconds of film that completely break any semblance of consistency within the setting to make a long story short this movie is absolute and utter dog shit if you value the lore of star wars at all youll strike this movie from your head canon entirely
Mar 1 2019,positive,i dont understand why people hate this movie some great battle sequences enjoyed lukes deception at the end and good character development could it have benefited from tighter editing sure but it was still a solid entry into the saga far better than the prequels
Feb 28 2019,positive,loved it âtmïâtmï
Feb 28 2019,positive,i liked everything about the movie except the fact that finns mission with rose was kinda useless
Feb 28 2019,negative,very poorly written and trashed star wars lore luke skywalker was treated like a different character it is just upsetting
Feb 28 2019,negative,i tried i really really tried to watch this movie all the way through    but no matter what i found myself fast forwarding parts that did not just make me lose interest but wince and cringe my hand instinctively reached for the remote multiple times   of the few moments i managed to get through i was left jaw dropped in utter amazement that i could be so utterly disappointed in the script    truth is i dont think the actors didnt have the chops the special effects teams seem to do solid work the costumes and set design crews deserve real praise for getting it right    but howââ how on earth did that script make itâ   disney are you now tone def do you honestly not know what start wars is i have a job where i interact with adults and children all the time no one thinks the last jedi was even watchable the kids ranging from age 12 to 15 state the movie was so easy to forget they dont even know the names of the characters but they do still know every harry potter characters names books events and more they can quote hunger games and tell me everything there is to know about pokemon and fortnight but not only do they not care about star wars they actually think it is lame now    congrats disney you killed the greatest more profitable ip in cinema history
Feb 28 2019,negative,only one good scene in the whole movie it destroys the legacy of the greatest science fiction hero of all time
Feb 28 2019,negative,luke throws his lightsaber then he drinks from the tit of some fat alien water cow need i continue
Feb 28 2019,negative,after a second watch defiantly the worst one not fussed about seeing no 9
Feb 28 2019,negative,this movie is a knife in the back of any true star wars fan a good rule of thumb here is if the rt critics rate it lower than the user ratings its worth a watch if the rt critics rate it higher than the users its trash not worth your money
Feb 28 2019,positive,one of best star wars movies
Feb 28 2019,negative,i dont think im ever coming back to anything disney after this  i felt like i was watching an abortion
Feb 28 2019,negative,poor character development and especially poor writing if special effects make a good movie for you or if youre five you will enjoy this movie
Feb 28 2019,negative,if i could give it zero stars i would this movie was an absolute train wreck not only did it manage to be even more boring than 7 it also completely screwed up the entire story kylo is 1000 times worse than jar jar
Feb 28 2019,negative,huge let down in every way could have been great but missed opportunities ruined this movie and ruins the saga story
Feb 28 2019,positive,this movie gets a bad rap     the plot is engaging and well done most of the issues you may have with things such as the infamous lightspeed scene can easily be explained away by the rest of the sagas logic real life logic or details in the movie the plotline betweenness rey kylo and luke is easily one of the best story arcs since the luke and vader arc from reutnr of the jedi    the acting is ridiculously good at not point did the actors ever have me think that this was anything less than a true story from a long time ago in a faraway galaxy mark hamill brings back his energy and ability from return of the jedi no surprise there and rey and kylo majorly step it up from the force awakens every emotion is felt in spades    the visuals are absolutely stunning the lightspeed scene is easily one of the most visually orgasmsic shots in star wars rian johnson expertly uses the backdrops and interesting llighting to give even more flavor to already stellar scenes    the editing of this film is on another level the connection between kylo and rey is ridiculously good and the cuts from characters asking questions to the objects of their questions such as when finn wakes up and asks where rey is is incredible it brings even greater impact to these simple scenes and is incredibly smooth     the characters are good in this film while the characters may not have the best character building they arenï 12tmt bad kylo is developed to a point that is almost too much for a star wars villain luke is so incredible to watch and so utterly convincing rey and the rest are a little less developed but they donï 12tmt necessarily reach the level of the boring characters of the prequel trilogy    the themes and fan service here is well done as well lukeï 12tms death is tastefully done and we get a lot of what we wanted to see from ot characters the themes outdo themselves there are several good ones one of the most beautiful to see if the theme returning to star wars after a hiatus during the prequels anyone can be a jedi the heart of this film beats on levels of the otï 12tms heart     all in all the last jedi is a great film its  emotions logic and reverence is something that i love to see and something i think most fans miss i would suggest keeping an open mind and enjoying yourself during this movie
Feb 28 2019,positive,best star wars film in a while finally get a new direction in plot
Feb 27 2019,negative,a great franchise ruin by identity politics
Feb 27 2019,negative,a movie that is more about forcing a liberal agenda than plot character development ect there is a way of having a diverse cast while not feeling forced and creating a riveting story making a terrible movie that does no justice to lifelong fans and then contributing dissatisfaction to the fans being closedminded is blissful ignorance at best
Feb 27 2019,negative,can be summed up by the moment an experienced military leader who has been fighting in guerrilla wars since she was a teenager explaining a military plan to what we are told is the best combat pilot in the galaxy using the words big ship   puerile garbage with no respect for an audience which thinks a complete lack of cohesion and internal consistency qualifies as a twist
Feb 27 2019,positive,star wars the last jedi just from the color red being presented throughout the film and the posters i knew this film was gonna have something different ive rewatched this 2 12 hour film about 6 to 7 times nowand i still enjoy this movie its not a masterpiece but its an undeniably fun daring ambitious bold grim mature  truly nuanced film that still provokes your thoughts up until the last frame my biggest issue with this film is that theres a storyline between finn  this new character rose in which i thought the film kinda took a detour the whole canto bight was a little unnecessary at times but nevertheless i thoroughly enjoyed everything else surrounding the film the chemistry between luke  rey the brilliant character arc of poe the deep torment of kylo ren the shocking plot twists the shining light that was put upon carrie fisher as leia and the overall visual flair of the film made it one of the most unique films in the franchise i love the fact that the camerawork for the fight scenes felt like how the old school kung fusamurai films looked it was so cool i do understand why people despise this film but im not gonna let them change my opinion i do still enjoy watching this film and i respect the direction that rian johnson took with the entire franchise
Feb 27 2019,negative,it was trash sjw bull crap they killed luke out nowhere
Feb 27 2019,neutral,star wars the last jedi might be visually stunning and the return of luke skywalker was exciting the movie unfortunately isnt very good in terms of character development or the plot the canto bight sequence was a wasted opportunity and the slow chase was tense at times but was also boring the character of luke skywalekr has also become an almost unlikable character in terms of how much he changed luke used to be the hopeful inspiring and positive farm boy turned jediknight but is now the lightsaber throwing grumpy and at times bad jedi the many questions the fans had for the force awakens were given very underwhelming and bad answers such as reys parents being noone the extent of reys marysue like abilities has been further amplified in this film making the character quite unlikable overall the film looked amazing but the story was just bad rian johnson has let down the star wars fandom
Feb 27 2019,negative,i made an account just to give this movie a bad rating thats how bad it is
Feb 27 2019,negative,all around a bad movie maybe the worst i ever saw
Feb 27 2019,negative,utterly horrible it deserves second star for technical reasons only
Feb 27 2019,negative,i would rather watch leonard part 6 while being drugged and alone in a room with bill cosby then ever watch this steaming turd of a quoteunquote star wars movie again an absolute franchise killer everyone involved should be ashamed
Feb 27 2019,negative,against the nearcertain prospect of drawing pissy venom from star wars aficionados which i just am not im gonna review the last jedi as simply just a movie i watched not as some cog in a fantastical legendary machine which for some reason must be viewed as such in a presumptive awestricken and oddly hyperjudgmental state of cinematic religious trance no im judging this from a different and equally grandiose grotesque state that of a film fanatic yeah ive seen pretty much all of the star wars flicks save for some animated legobased shit but thats only coincidence because i have seen pretty much every other movie save for some animated legobased shit a few of those along my path to the last jedi were truly exceptional films from a visionary director called rian johnson im specifically referring to brick and looper when i think of the way those two films made me feel i can only quote jake gyllenhaal who recently most accurately and hilariously used the word ensorcelled velvet buzzsaw incharacter and unrelated why those movies stood out from possibly tens of thousands i have seen i think of the best work by lynch cronenberg fincher one or two other davids and a stan or stanley not stan lee no detraction to that legend who might have been born an old man i think possibly but say preeyes wide shut kubrick and not for emulation of style but actually quite the contrary for a unique touch that left a powerful imprint on my psyche a sort of puzzle clockwork symphony that only a rabid artist can summon into existence bearing that i saw rian johnsons name attached to a star wars billion dollar production and i was intrigued totally shocked but interested nonetheless so fresh eyes watched once then again a few months later round one enjoyed it moderately but left unimpressed by what felt like a massive studiomuddled marketed and sterilized waste of a perfectly great director who was reduced to a tiny voice in a teleconference full of greedy pinstriped execs basically exactly what i expected but not a masochistic viewing experience there have been far worse and indeed far worse within star warscanon installments more than one or two with lucas himself at the wheel round two k here the seams and the woodscrews really started to show that and something else especially grated on me the casual star wars viewer an incessant sense of pandering to fanatical star wars fans whose demand for nostalgia and superrigid guidelines prevent the series from ever breaking through the tiresome routine and yet still is never quite enough to satisfy a small majority of them who apparently want to see the first two or three films made with new names and a bit more lightsaber action each time its glaring from the first moments of every post1983 episode right up to this one 40 goddamn years later where the same dated musical score and the same fucking 1977 fonts scroll on a diagonal overhead plane to fill you in on exactly where and what youre looking at right before you begin looking at it every aspect of it is so preordained that any directorial input from a guy like johnson gets silenced for the hopes of not alienating the hardcore fans and even then any special casual friday takes where the director gets to actually direct get shredded internetically with complaints that those moments made the film too dark or they dared to step outside the airtight star wars butt hole i could go on with other issues i take with the world these films exist in like why do lightsabres appear to carry substantial weight in the blade like a real sword when that beam is clearly made of projected weightless particles and or chemicals or get deeper and more useless into the science of why spacecraft have what are clearly air intakes which suggests some form of internal combustion or the existence of air  but rest assured the fan community has got some answer to all such questions that are never truly made into sense for the weekend viewer they would pick apart my words grammar and lack of official knowledge but that is not the issue here i mean to offend no one or delegitimize anyones childhood just saying they could have hired jj abrams to do this task 2 stars not 23 or 21
Feb 27 2019,negative,boring and disjointed with the rest of the franchise this was not a star war movie
Feb 27 2019,negative,this made the prequels look like empire strikes back
Feb 27 2019,negative,whatever jj abrams had planned obviously didnt matter this film has no continuity from the force awakens yet offers little to nothing in its place to make up for it the characters are dull the story line is woeful and the real world political agenda push is unreal tlj is a world filled with nothing but wonderous women and mansplaining misogynists every male character is whittled down to a pathetic joke whilst our lead female is a complete mary sue shes somehow a better pilot than han solo prettier than leia and stronger than luke all of which she has managed with no lineage andor training whilst living as a scavenger in the desert her whole life     we have well and truly hit rock bottom with films lately any whiff of a female lead and hollywood has to start fighting the patriarchy vader wouldnt have stood for this crap
Feb 27 2019,negative,worst sequel in this saga so far
Feb 27 2019,negative,if there had been no previous history or canon not part of a trilogy and more subtle with its ideologies this would have been an ok scifi film
Feb 27 2019,negative,space flying leia face palm
Feb 27 2019,negative,the film was a travesty to luke skywalker    the direction the franchise has gone is very sad
Feb 27 2019,negative,worst star wars movie ever rey is the best at everything best pilot strongest force user best light saber duelist with no explanation two movies in as to why they ruined luke skywalker rey has defeated kylie ten twice who cares about tico who really cares about fin what a waste of a platform could have had a strong male lead character of color turned him into the comic relief though how typical didnï 12 12tmt have the balls to actually have a masculine male black lead someone for kids to look up to and someone women wanted to be with a black indiana jones type lead someone capabale and relied upon and self suffiecnt just shit on all the male characters in this movie all of them watch it allllll of them are fodder for their female counter parts because apparently thatï 12 12tms how you write strong female characters
Feb 27 2019,negative,worst star wars film ever
Feb 27 2019,negative,after seeing the last jedi i was disappointed in how the narrative and characters were displayed the movie had a lack of character development a slow rushed plot and the use of comedy in this movie was poorly timed and very awkward what made me give this movie such a poor rating were the issues behind the studio itself the director was trying to inject real life political agendas into this movie for the sake of making it more appealing to its target audience i try to bring myself to liking this movie but i just cant     i was truly disappointed in how lukes character came out and the lack of development between rey snoke kylo and rose the movie really didnt subvert expectations but rather just retconned a lot of moments
Feb 27 2019,negative,the film that killed luke and the star wars franchise how could they fail so hard it boggles the mind
Feb 27 2019,negative,people love to talk about how daring this film was with its subverting of expectations what they fail to mention is how every time they had the opportunity to take the movie in a meaningful direction leias death fins sacrifice rey joining kylo they end up pulling their punches last minute what did we end up with the most cliched overused star wars narrative small rag tag band of rebels vs massive empire so innovative and daring cant wait to see rey fight kylo for the third time snoke no we dont need to know about him or the origins of the first order and how they came to be so powerful with near infinite resources
Feb 27 2019,negative,no payoff at al from the force awakens  wish i could get the hours of my life back
Feb 27 2019,positive,a bold and intriguing approach to star wars which exposed us to brand new frontiers the new approaches to characters feuds among heroes and villains alike a new approach to character heritage the deconstruction of the benevolent msster and the connection between protagonist and villain are what make this movie stand out it is also not only fascinating it is also extremely beautiful and well shot and the acting is incredible the relationship between rey and kylo is perfectly executed and exposing lukeï 12 12tms weaknesses while also humanising him is one of the best things the franchise has ever done his fall and subsequent rise to legendary status was beautiful overall this movie opened up a brand new route for the franchise
Feb 27 2019,negative,the worst star wars film ever honestly there isnt much of anything to love about this movie it spits in the face of previous star wars content or ripping off content from the eu or other movies      rian johnsons vision mirrors georges when he was writing the prequels in such a way its a shock no one made a scene telling him this is exactly the kind of mistakes of the past      rey continues to be a mary sue only experiencing failure once being manhandled by snoke who then dies in a pathetic manner despite all his power      instead of making a call back to the ot after dealing with yoda and lifting his ship from the depths of the water luke makes a projection robbing us of him doing anything significant other then buying time      finn poe holdo and rose only destroy the rebel forces with them in a convoluted manner      overall tlj is the equivalent to a wet fart in your face doesnt matter though im sure rt admin will think im trolling this movie really deserves no stars
Feb 27 2019,positive,very fun installment and underrated by fans
Feb 27 2019,positive,the star wars movie ive always wanted i liked the force awakens even though it was pretty much just fan service tlj took everyones expectations and threw them in the trash which is exactly why i loved it tired of hearing a bunch of grown men say their childhood is ruined get over it this movie took some awesome chances and they paid off 
Feb 27 2019,negative,totally discontinued from the last movie wasted screentime plot holes here and there nonsensical plot development continued mediocre acting extremely disappointed
Feb 27 2019,negative,the director rian johnson took the movie in a direction that spits in the face of fans and the previous director jj abrams
Feb 27 2019,negative,hopefully the last time that im ever this disappointed ever walking out of a theater ever again none of the dialogue or actions make any sense it almost feels like the writers decided to throw a dart at a spinning wheel for just about everything that happens in this movie
Feb 27 2019,negative,irreverent garbage with no respect for the core star wars mythos and its heroes every character in this film is a scumbag and a coward with selfish interests total character assassination of luke leia isnt treated much better good going disney you killed star wars that didnt take long
Feb 27 2019,neutral,weak story and character build up
Feb 27 2019,negative,awful plot bad luke confusing series of accidental moments serious waste of time
Feb 26 2019,negative,this movie is postmodernist propaganda and it even sucks at that
Feb 26 2019,negative,the movie undid luke and everything he did disregarded all that came before  also shoved politics that wont age well into it
Feb 26 2019,negative,easily the worst movie of the entire saga
Feb 26 2019,negative,shoddy storytelling at its best
Feb 26 2019,negative,flat story unrelatable main character throwing the oc trilogy under the bus bad story telling and a disappointing ending that severs the tie between the classic star wars universe and the future of the franchise not worth your time unless your only interest is lightsabers and starships
Feb 26 2019,negative,pretty rough i felt like a captive on a narrative that was not to my liking
Feb 26 2019,negative,1 unorigial everyone can see which old star wars film it is a copy of  2 unrealistic   i wont waste more time on this  im sad i gave money to the people responsible for this turd
Feb 26 2019,negative,why doesnt a droid kamakaze the ship that makes so many plot holes and thats just 1 of the many disgusting things they did in this so called sequel
Feb 26 2019,negative,just trash pure simple trash
Feb 26 2019,negative,its been over a year and still want a refund
Feb 26 2019,negative,pathetically shallow characters moronic social justice themes a plethora of plot holes and any potential drama is constantly undermined by cringy subversive humor or bullshit a complete disservice to the star wars canon
Feb 26 2019,positive,this is a mixed bag with both good and bad elements but these primarily permeate the story as it is personal preference however the technical aspects of this movie is some of the best in all of star wars the amount of practical effects is stellar without heavily clashing with the uses of cgi which in of itself look amazing the camera work is also to be commended due to the variety and unique use of shots throughout the film the acting is top tier and the best of any star wars movie to date while there is some clumsy dialogue every star wars film has that and itï 12 12 12 12tms not as annoying here    this film is hit or miss for many people with a decisive story and character moments not to mention that this is the longest star wars film to date can exhaust many people for me the good far out weighs the bad here iï 12 12 12 12tmve not been on the edge of my seat not knowing what was going to happen for a long time and i hope this continues for star wars moving forward and not just reverting to formulaic predictable fan service    if you havent 12 12tmt seen this movie its 12 12tms worth a watch and worth formulating your own opinion on the movie as the hyperbole around this movie is insane at this point
Feb 26 2019,negative,not good at all the whole story is just off how did the rebel fleet become so weak in the first place how did ray become such a powerful jedi with no real training or advice story makes no sense what so ever can never beat the original movies the producers who made the storyline clearly did not do a good job they tried to make the movie different but ended up making a mockery of the franchise
Feb 26 2019,negative,itï 12tms looks good but the characters and story line is horrible

Feb 26 2019,negative,lots of plot holes poor character writing lore breaking stunts all around no respect for chekovs gun needs to show and not tell and a chase scene that involves running out of fuel in space a vacuum where momentum doesnt slow down i know star wars doesnt always follow irl laws of physics but that one ruins the suspense of disbelief overall i dont recommend the last mary sue

Feb 26 2019,positive,a wellcrafted addition to the star wars saga taking the story to different places and plot twists which i feel was sorely needed
Feb 26 2019,negative,this is the worst film ive ever seen if you enjoyed this film it means you had terrible parents and there is no hope for you

Feb 26 2019,positive,this movie broke me in a way that is hard to describe i really loved it leaving the theatre opening night i was excited to talk about this film with all my sw friends and then i posted on fb my love for this film at the time it barely edged out rotj as my fav but i quickly began to see the backlash even that night a friend i barely spoke with from college almost immediately responded to poo poo the film and my opinion i have listened to and sort of understand peoples issues but i have purchased the film and revisited it multiple times and it is still one of my favorite films in the franchise while simultaneously being the film that is making me hate sw because it paradoxically brought out the worst of the worst of fandom this film is a strange beast for me because i simultaneously loved it while it showed me how trash sw fans can be 
Feb 26 2019,negative,it may look like star wars but itï 12tms a shell of a film it feels like they forgot what a good story was or what character building was
Feb 26 2019,negative,i didnt like the movie it made me sad and upset so many plot holes and strange chsracters luke skywalker was my hero growing up and to see him admit he gave into his darkness and the thought of killing his nephew ben was completely disheartening luke was a man who found the truth of his father no one believed darth vader could be turned to the lightside yoda obiwan even leia couldnt see vader becoming good yet luke persist and brought his father back    then to see that same man luke glimps into ben solo see potential darkness and gleem to murder his nephew didnt make sense to me   then luke left a map to find him when the galaxy needs him only for rey to find him then luke say i came here to die all a mess
Feb 26 2019,negative,horrible movietotally wasted my time and money on this shitty piece of crapdisney ruined sw for meboycotting all future films

Feb 26 2019,negative,this movie has terrible character development and a pointless plot the movie destroyed the character of luke skywalker and didnt progress the story in any way it feels like star wars has been replaced by a made for tv movie on the lifetime channel  i didnt pay to see solo and im not planning to see episode 9 unless lucasfilm and disney can stop attacking the fans for not liking this garbage movie if ryan johnson makes another star wars movie im burning my star wars collection and never spending another dime on the star wars brand please hire sombody at lucasfilm  that is an actual star was fan and is not trying to push a political agenda
Feb 26 2019,negative,worst star wars film i have ever seen i would rather watch all the prequels again before coming back to rians abomination of storytelling
Feb 26 2019,negative,i am not sure this film series can be redeemed after the director made the film about unmet expectations rather than follow the time honored classic of story telling through a heros quest yikes
Feb 26 2019,negative,awful the worst one since episode 2
Feb 26 2019,positive,dont listen to haters and trolls it was great
Feb 26 2019,positive,deep cuts bside ballads and heady word tonics await  this film has bones legs  can you dig  not for superficial fairweather fans  not for bubble gum pop semiliterate neophytes or plebeians  go read a book  this film is what i was waiting for  rock on

Feb 26 2019,negative,awful plot lost pissing on canon incoherent social justice nightmare
Feb 26 2019,negative,worst star wars movie ever you destroyed luke after we waited since 1983 for his return everything he faught for you pissed on thanks disney all the while just because i donï 12tmt like this movie disney accuses me of being sexist how does that make sense you killed han in the last movie and now luke goes out like a chump all the while poor carrie passed away in real life rip carrie so two movies that cover about 12 weeks of story time you bring our heroes back just to kill emthanks disney rey was a cool character btw rian johnson killed that rose is played by a great and likable actress and ao is holdo rian johnson made them incredibly unlikable not because they are women because of bad writing and directing carrie did the best she could with this crap script admiral ackbar is back nope rian killed him and never mentioned it bye bye heroes kylo started getting interesting by killing his master and wanting to change things and not repeat the past awesome ohnope i blinked and he was a stock bad guy again thanks rian johnson jjyou have a lot of work ahead of you good luck redeeming this horse crap rian set you up with rey is coolplease make her somewhat relatable please stop accusing people of being sexist because this movie sucks look at alita look at those scores and let the sexist arguement die men and women alike love strong female characters just give us some decent writing and character development and we will eat that up all day own up to your mistakes and make things better
Feb 26 2019,negative,an insulting film with no coherent direction or understanding of the franchise
Feb 26 2019,negative,what did you do to luke  didnt enjoy this to much political stuff thrown at you
Feb 26 2019,negative,this was the last straw for me it was not skywalkers journey very disappointing will not see ep ix
Feb 25 2019,negative,the last jedi was a narrative mess it lacked motivation for inconsistent characters the twists failed to further the story instead grinding it to a halt i couldnt think of an audience that i could recommend this to perhaps michael bay fanatics for the special effects all of moral of the story moments ryan johnson puts in the movie are contradicted rendering them meaningless thats a pretty good summary of the film meaningless but id add pointless as well nothing is accomplished in the film other than killing off people ray doesnt gain power nobody learns anything of importance and any surviving characters found themselves in the same predicament they were at the start of the film a very dull tom and jerry like chase that seems to have stagnated for an entire movie
Feb 25 2019,negative,the movie just doesnt make sense and the main character doesnt develop through good trials and tribulations it would be nice to have a movie with the heros journey
Feb 25 2019,negative,worst piece of junk i have ever seen
Feb 25 2019,negative,this is the worst movie ever made for the starwars franchise every one involved in that movie except mark hamill should be ashamed of themselves they literally are ruining the fabrics of society with their absurd sjw pushed agenda    its as if they are seeking to have humans hate each other and put them in a state of civil animosity this movie is pure garbage that destroy and humiliates belovedestablished characters by replacing them with unlikable characters that have no story to back anything in what they can acheive    kathleen kennedy is the worst of the worst and she placed the worst trolls of all time to direct this movie by obviously  spitting on george lucas hard work    this is outrageous anyone who likes this movie is absolutely nuts and should do an immediate introspection
Feb 25 2019,negative,im the leftiest liberal ever and i think this movie harmed my personal ideals those responsible have shown zero recognition of the damage to the brand the lore and egalitarian views in general that this movie inflicted on the world i like everyone who worked on this film and many of them made great choices as always those at the top are responsible for the wretched soulcringing decisions about the narrative that makes this truly one of the worst teleplays ever committed to film watch only if you can surgically remove all memory of the existence of star wars then im sure its beautiful11q
Feb 25 2019,negative,story plot holes were frustrating and defy all common sense character break tradition and destroy lore super under utilized characters and where was poe this movie makes no sense
Feb 25 2019,negative,they just ruined star wars franchise completely and i always tough that was impossible i wont go to the cinema to watch star wars movies ever again
Feb 25 2019,negative,i did not care for the story the structure the hit you over the head messaging geared to adolescents or the strong message sent to the older audience message received loud and clear 
Feb 25 2019,negative,misplaced bathos in a movie with a more serious theme and a non nonsensical plot
Feb 25 2019,negative,the worst movie of the saga  senseless  boring and at some times insulting  this is the beginning of the end
Feb 25 2019,negative,no respect for the original star wars lore
Feb 25 2019,negative,this movie is the worst of the 8 main4561237 8 thanks to the director and head of lucasfilm its entertaining but doesnt make much sense it feels like he tried to do too much and screwed everything up with his yes maam attitude i would say he did it on purpose but hes also killing his own career
Feb 25 2019,negative,a big loud preachy disrespectful mess literally makes star wars a punchline
Feb 25 2019,negative,garbage movie that ruined the movie abrams had set up in the force awakens lousy fight choreography was probably the worst in the series holdo and rose where shocking characters johnson stating that lukeï 12tms path was gonna lead him to where he was in the movie reinforces the idea that johnson did not take into account the event of the ot using hyperspace as a weapon in the 8th film of the sky walker saga has thrown into disarray all scenes with hyperspace in it the movie was never going to be good when mark hamill himself stated that this was not his luke skywalker
Feb 25 2019,negative,it is not my star wars
Feb 25 2019,negative,the film that divided a fan base filled with plot holes yet there is so much going on it will take you a while to figure out what bugs you about it   ultimately the utter disrespect it gave to the legacy character of luke skywalker is what sealed the deal for me   it is fine to create and push new characters just do not do it at the expense of ones we have loved for decades
Feb 25 2019,negative,not the worst movie ever made but i really hated it 
Feb 25 2019,negative,im giving this 2 stars because 1 star wont get calculated in the overall score
Feb 25 2019,negative,movie was horrible ruined the star wars franchise the magic of the force is gone  waited 30 years to see luke and thatï 12 12 12 12tms what we got a miserable grumpy hermit awful
Feb 25 2019,negative,this film was a slap in the face to decades of storytelling and world building of the star wars universe not only was the entire premise of the movie awful but rey is massively overpowered and can never mess up lightsabers seem to lack the ability to cut off limbs or truly kill people rather just doing small cuts lukes character was truly written poorly and inarticulately and we got a new side character that no one wanted a pitiful excuse of a star wars movie
Feb 25 2019,negative,terrible movie ruined the entire franchise  star wars is dead to me
Feb 25 2019,negative,very few enjoyable bits the politics outside the film ruined it for me
Feb 25 2019,negative,not star wars detracts from plot setups from previous film disrespectful from lore main character has no depth and doesnt need training or stuggles boring plot that doesnt serve any purpose to a trilogy i could go on and on jokes fail luke wanting to kill his nephew in his sleep that hasnt done anything yet but wouldnt kill his own father that murded several jedi and children what a shit movie also lightspeed to attack first orderwhy was this not do to the death star oh that right subverting expectations
Feb 25 2019,negative,ive been a fan since the 80s i enjoyed this movie but what they did to like and what they are doing with rey is unforgivable thumbs up for using actual special effects rather than cgi backgrounds etc but it doesnt excuse the lame script
Feb 25 2019,negative,considering the chance they had to give the most beloved movie trilogy ever an absolutely amazing sequel this was a very upsetting and even slightly traumatizing experience id prefer a monthly painful prostate exam before existing in a universe where star wars is handled with such irresponsibility    ill never watch it again twice was 2 times too much ive fallen into a deep depression  3
Feb 25 2019,positive,i saw this movie twice took me a while to process this movie its terrible i saw awakens 17 times and i skipped the solo movie i will most likely skip the next movie
Feb 25 2019,negative,the worst star wars movie ever and the only one i wont buy the dvd
Feb 25 2019,negative,beyond terrible  had to keep myself from going to sleep by repeatedly telling myself that eventually the movie would be good then the credits came up thanks disney for wasting my time with this garbage  who in the world greenlighted this scriptfinish product plenty of people need to be fired and replaced with real storytellersfilm makers
Feb 25 2019,negative,    worst movie ever  not because of what it portrays on screen but what it destroys  so lame
Feb 25 2019,negative,bad writing plot holes no real believable character development poorly written characters forced scenes meant to simply subvert expectations left with no believable villains in the end that would actually pose a threat female characters a strong just because they are female rather than actually being well developed strong characters regardless of gender speaking of which also a waist of some characters who had real potential to be great characters rey finn snoke poe connix just to name a few  ill give it one full star only because it is at least watchable but thats mainly because its star wars and has cool visual effects costumes and sets
Feb 25 2019,negative,story has to many plot holes and is lacking relevance a good example is the fact that lea flies through space and another example would be to use hyper space travel to destroy ships
Feb 25 2019,negative,the movie that killed star wars
Feb 25 2019,negative,the only thought i had after watching the movie star wars is dead after watching this piece of  cinematography the prequels seem like art now
Feb 25 2019,negative,this movie killed my star wars fandom thanks im grown up now
Feb 25 2019,negative,i would give this movie a 0 if i could hands down worse than episode 2 thats sad
Feb 25 2019,negative,an awful star wars movie full of plot holes things that do not make sense character assassination all in the name of subverting expectations which is fine but it puts nothing in its place leaving a hollow and desolate shell
Feb 25 2019,negative,not a good one guys
Feb 25 2019,negative,i saw this at the cinema and am glad to say it didnt get another cent from me nor another viewing disneylucasfilm it was garbage
Feb 25 2019,negative,looks like ryan johnson have a big hate for starwars saga and his legacy was piss on our beloved  childhood
Feb 25 2019,negative,too many plot holes to ignore ryan johnson had no business being handed the keys to this brand
Feb 25 2019,negative,one of the worst star wars movies ever i have seen the original saga like hundred of times te pre disney saga like 5 times but i definetely wont see the disney saga again they are sooooo bad
Feb 25 2019,negative,i went to theaters to see this and had to stop myself from crying so many good character arcs for luke such as the abeloth timeline were thrown aside to desecrate a strong character that could have been utilized more effectively a quarter of the movie the casino scene could have been cut out and the narrative would have been solid watching this felt like a waste of time a movie that truly used a big draw star wars for a movie that became a disappointment
Feb 25 2019,negative,this movie single handedly killed star wars
Feb 25 2019,negative,this movie is increeibly disappointing rey finn poe and kylo ren are never given a chance to grow in this movie the only hint of growth we see is them repeating their arcs from episode 7 or being rewritten as different characters in the beginning of the movie and resulting in characters that more closely resemble how they ended in episode 7 this of course isnt explaining lukes odd out of place murderous tendencies and the movies failure to adhere to the logic of the star wars universe ex lightspeed attacks and lets not forget the movies portrayal of leia that was downright insulting the tone and pacing are also all over the place making this drawn out space chase feel all over the place im honestly surprised that disney chose such a confused person to take on a star wars movie
Feb 25 2019,negative,i suppose the visuals were good
Feb 25 2019,positive,surprising and entertaining the last jedi is my personal favorite star wars film despite it being criticized by many fans of the saga
Feb 25 2019,negative,i have no words as to how utterly awful this movie is  its like being given pure gold and somehow ending up with a pile of dog shit
Feb 25 2019,negative,star wars is dead 
Feb 25 2019,negative,never senn such a bad sequal ignoring th emovie bevor ein all ways and also destroed the characters from before no character development and a directless story and big plotholes on and on ive never believed a star wars movie could be so bad  thank u disney
Feb 25 2019,negative,how to kill a franchise
Feb 25 2019,negative,beautiful but very bad movie such a waste of opportunity to be one of the best star wars movie ever poor characters with motivations that doesnt make sense and no respect to characters people loved and grew up with my second biggest disappointment after bvs
Feb 25 2019,negative,i cannot express how much i hate this movie and what it did to luke skywalker the star wars lore and my passion for star wars this film is a disgrace
Feb 25 2019,negative,an insulting addition to the skywalker story gaping plotholes bad choreography and the biggest mary sue in all of fiction not worth your money or time
Feb 25 2019,positive,another excellent entry in the franchise    pros    i loved the character arcs presented in the film mainly lukes and kylos lukes added depth to his character and made people think about things that otherwise would gone unnoticed such as his emotional outburst in palpatines throne room kylo has quickly become my favourite character thanks to the uniqueness and uncertainty present around his character the fact that he is so torn makes for some interesting engagements with other characters    the planets each had distinct attributes to them and they fit nicely into the universe     the visuals are amazing especially crait and some of the camera shots such as luke facing down the first order are up there with the best in the series     the musical score is as great as ever    cons    the pacing could be a bit wierd as the film zipped around the 3 main arcs a little too suddenly on some occassions canto bight last a bit too long and could have benefitted from being a few minutes shorter    the space chase as interesting as it was didnt really match up to other setpieces in the franchise for me outside of holdos sacrifice    phasma was much better excecuted in this film but i dont feel she should have been killed off in the second part of the trilogy i would have preferred her to be part of the final battle between the two factions
Feb 25 2019,negative,this thing broke the sequel triology for me good thing i can aways count on the ot and the prequels this movie has no proper charater development in some cases they devolve like in finns case it breaks the   established lore the lighspeed crashair and gravity in open space and is an overall mess hope this debacle subverted disney expectations for the franchise
Feb 25 2019,negative,the only star wars movie ive only watched once and have no desire to see again
Feb 25 2019,negative,the worst star wars movie since the force awakens force awakens was bad but this one is a disaster basically its not star wars anymore its just a random generic scifi movie that visually tries to imitate star wars special effects are good movie is flashy but plot is poor characters are broken there is no logic or sense in events that happen on the screen also there is lot of remade scenes from the original trilogy which makes the last jedi looks like some kind of parody i really felt like i was watching one of these leslie nielsens remakes but his movies were funny this one is not also its filled with political agenda people pay for tickets to have fun not to watch political propaganda and leave cinema angry and sad
Feb 25 2019,negative,the worst movie iâtmve ever seen in my life simply wtf what the actual fuck
Feb 25 2019,negative,tragic disregard for luke fans wrought with social agenda 
Feb 25 2019,negative,holy  this is worse than i expected
Feb 25 2019,negative,this movie may have destroyed the star wars franchise what rian johnson did to the character of luke skywalker is unforgivable
Feb 25 2019,negative,horrible movie even if viewed as a single movie but as the 2nd part of a trilogy even worse this movie seems to not care about the 1st movie at all it completely disregards plot lines that were introduced in the force awakens and instead spends nearly half the movie on some random plot that seems to be totally insignificant to the plot of the trilogy as a whole it is so sad that this garbage is allowed to taint the star wars universe
Feb 25 2019,negative,this movie is a terrible mess very very disappointed  absolutely the worse star wars movie to date
Feb 24 2019,negative,this movie has nothing to do with the skywalker saga set up by george lucas it is taking a dump on the legacy of george lucas franchise star wars imagine if jk rowling sold harry potter to universal studios and made harry potter a woman who doesnt need to learn magic or the wizarding school people would be outraged thats how i feel about these trilogy sequel movies
Feb 24 2019,neutral,tells a very bad story let me explain i grew up with the first trilogy and it taught me so much i learned to stick to my sense of being good instead of giving into hate and evil this movie has none of that sense of honesty or vulnerability it seems fabricated by disney to cram as much things into 2 hours to try to sell toys without making any effort into telling a story there is no depth to this everything happens in what seems like 24 hours it is so weird and also they way the women talk to men always putting them down i dont get it where is the sense of adventure and truth that the original trilogy had why are all the men dumb its a sad state of film making and rian johnson should never have made this movie
Feb 24 2019,negative,save yourself do not watch
Feb 24 2019,negative,terrible on so many levels
Feb 24 2019,negative,this movie is just fun to see visually once but other than that its a train wreck even if you were to take out the politics the plot alone sucks

Feb 24 2019,negative,goddamn i brought my dad who is a big star wars fan like myself i was embarrassed i even brought him along for this dumpster fire     the whole side story with tico and freeing the animals was long and boring as hell purple hair chick was unlikable from the start and were meant to feel sorry for her after her death     luke luke dont get me started ruin johnson puked on this gem of a character let the past die kill it if you have to and thats exactly what roundheaded j did     to think hes getting his own trilogy after this man its almost like companies these days do not want money anymore fair enough     jar jar standalone would have sold more than the last nail in the coffin jedi
Feb 24 2019,negative,the film that destroyed a franchise congratulations kk you must be so proud
Feb 24 2019,negative,i was excited about the movie until i went to see it on opening weekend i have been a fan of star wars ever since i was a little kid i was obsessed with the prequels as a teenager the forced identity politics in this movie and terrible story telling completely ruined star wars for me
Feb 24 2019,negative,goodbye yellow brick childhood
Feb 24 2019,negative,rian destroyed all the great work jj did in the force awakens this was set up for rian to do a simple layup but failed miserably the script and story flow was pure rubbish visually however cinematography and cgi was good some of the best but that script was so awe full jj youï 12 12tmre our only hope
Feb 24 2019,negative,the last jedi was an atrocious movie  space chase at a crawling speed irritating characters no real character development or growth from the last movie and a whole bunch of disrespect for the star wars franchise  i dont need any of that

Feb 24 2019,negative,fuel a concept previously nonexistent in the star wars universe now a crucial central feature idiotic stubborn refusal to discuss plans useless subplots that dont enhance enrich or even resonate with the main arc ignoring the foundation material upon which the universe  franchise was built women being just as pompous and domineering as the men they accuse of the same wasting characters we have come to care for even on the most basic level like poe and finn to be punched up like piãatas as an effigy of misogyny and unearned female superiority lord theres not a signal sign that any of the women glorified in this film were actual real leaders not even leia and i find that not only insulting to my female leader hero princess leia but to women in general you have to earn it and then you have to maintain it with consistency what i saw unfold on screen was neither of those things that right there tells me that this movies real goal was to make people despise women and push us back down oh and the storytelling was lazy the action an insult to science and to the force and the developments between rey and kylo wasted and unrealistic

Feb 24 2019,positive,a star wars movie that subverts expectation and leaves you wonder how are the rebels going to fight back however this does not mean it is a perfect film after watching multiple times i could not help but notice some of the flaws just about everyone agrees that the casino parts feel out of place a slow speed chase in space i hope lukes force ghost will be in the next film and can have a larger impact possibly teach rey something meaningful like yoda did for him in empire i cant hate the film the same way others have that is why i have given it a 70

Feb 24 2019,negative,thousands of user reviews already state what is wrong with this film heres my list in order of most important to least important  1 no character arcs  characters are flat and unidimensional the only one that shows signs of growing is finn but thats after he went back to being a coward after tfa  2 humor  seriously classic star wars have their comic moments but this is by no means a marvel type flick constant bathos in this movie just makes the whole thing look stupid and devoid of meaning even moments that should be serious and dark are filled with silly jokes  3 plot holes galore  so many its hard to remember all of them from the now infamous canto bight story line that turned out to be entirely inconsequential to captain phasma being raised from the dead finn regressing to a coward for no reason or even the first order now somehow dominating the entire galaxy just a few minutes after destroying a few planets in tfa  whats going on in this universe  4 absolutely atrocious plot twists sure lets kill snoke but can you at least provide some background on the guy and give him a dramatic death what about admiral holdo who the movie portraits as a bitch of a leader only to later reveal she was somehow right and instaredeem her for holding back critical information  5 breaking hyperspace  honestly in any sw battle both future and past just hyperspace one of your ships into the enemy huge cruisers and star destroyers are now the most vulnerable spaceships in the sw universe well done  6 first sw movie i only watched once and have no intention of watching again thats something i never thought i would experience in my lifetime  7 many many other issues    for all of the above and more i consider tlj a horrible movie star wars or not

Feb 24 2019,negative,worst movie of the entire francaise
Feb 24 2019,negative,right from the start things seemed a bit off with this movie but i suck with it then leia started flying through space and then i just lost it with this movie and with the whole new star wars franchise really anything else that happens in the movie is boring and laughable to be honest not laughable because of the terrible attempts at forced humor but cuz everything is just so dumb and completely out of character for a star wars movie
Feb 24 2019,negative,garbage movie bad acting bad writing bad diolge in general there are entire scenes that add nothing to the plot and every other line is a stupid quippy joke that seems way to cringey and half baked they could have cut an hour and a half out of this movie and it would have made more sense  it feels like whoever was in charge of this one wanted to completely change star wars into something unrecognizable and unwanted  the effects were cool though
Feb 24 2019,negative,wtf  this mutilation is as bad as it can get  whoever wrote this shit should go back to school    and why is there no 0 stars

Feb 24 2019,negative,hateful movie seems like the director was deliberately trying to troll and piss off the fans and he succeeded a scorched earth policy to destroy all beloved star wars lore and turning luke skywalker into a hated character bravo
Feb 24 2019,negative,the worst any fan of star wars couldâtmve asked pointless plot line for 23 of the movie to attempt character development on uninteresting characters while at the same time disrespecting the characters that made star wars what it was itâtms clear the director did not give a hoot about world building and continuity even coming off the success of tfa tfa might as well not even happened as there was literally nothing that ties the two together other than characters and the name star wars this movie had so much potential that was missed entirely due to bad writing and directing now this abortion of a film is considered canon great pumped for episode 9 now 
Feb 24 2019,negative,this felt like the bastardization of star wars i was so excited for it too based on the trailers so it was a pretty huge let down  
Feb 24 2019,negative,whats the point of killing off luke and making rey the last jedi this movie failed to make me care for the new characters and now that luke is gone why should i go see the next also disney is so stupid for not having a reunion scene of the 3 original stars really kill off han in 7 kill off luke in 8 obviously leia is going to die in 9 such a stupid trilogy overall and a big insult to the real fans
Feb 24 2019,negative,garbage  movie i am sincerely sad they did this to star wars
Feb 23 2019,negative,the story is pretty much ruined everything that was built up over the past decades pretty much evaporated leaving nothing behind but emptiness no payoff friendships and histories went poof the movie makes you feel just like youve been binge watching the greatest series on tv in existance only to arrive at a point where suddenly you find out the show was cancelled and the show kills off everyone in the last episode and its not a good episode everyone is acting strange things happen for no reason and you see the camera getting dropped to the floor at the end before the credits roll i hate this movie
Feb 23 2019,negative,left the theater very disappointed i bought a ticket to a star wars movie not some poorly written political and social critique
Feb 23 2019,neutral,visually stunning but the characters and story arch dont go anywhere and major choices made by the director really ended the trilogy for me ill watch the next movie but i dont feel any really excited for it which makes me so sad
Feb 23 2019,negative,if the they toned down on the humor i would have liked it better also the mary sue rey doesnt do it 
Feb 23 2019,negative,the movie breaks rules and plot points that where set up by previous films its a good film but the worst star wars movie because it doesnt care about the characters or the universe it is set in

Feb 23 2019,negative,i ordered sushi and my waiter brought me a stapler expectations were subverted it would appear there was no plan for sw 
Feb 23 2019,negative,whoever wrote this script has zero understanding or desire to understand star wars universe and its peculiarities what happened with all of the subplots from the previous movie where are the knights of ren who was snoke     luke skywalker character was butchered completely captain phasma potential was completely wasted as well
Feb 23 2019,negative,sweet jesus this was a travesty in film whoever had the bright idea to hire rian as director should be fired and everyone that agreed with them im looking at you kathleen this movie needs to have every digital copy in existence destroyed and the hard drives they are on microwaved all the physical media launched into the sun put the director on the rocket
Feb 23 2019,negative,extremely hard to do it worse not only it is a failed movie but also deprived the force awakens of any interest it could have previously had and made ep ix uninteresting since it left absolutely nothing to look forward to i am not even a star wars fan but this movie feels so disrespectful to the original idea of star wars that its hurtful to watch and also boring
Feb 23 2019,negative,the death of star wars
Feb 23 2019,negative,toxic femininity in a nutshell a complete mockery to star wars and offensive too a true fan  left me feeling bored  bitterthis film had the stage set too be a masterpiece but spit on the characters i love  now i know how it feels too be triggered like a feminazi well done this trash red pilled me and i can see a new hope spreading through out the world
Feb 23 2019,negative,this was an utter insult to the fandom horrible around every turn wont ever go see another made by disney
Feb 23 2019,negative,the worst star wars movie of all it is a disgrace to the franchise as a whole which has relied on steady character and worldbuilding for the past seven entries of the skywalker saga this movie however is so preoccupied in subverting your expectations that it actively undermines and renders futile the entire story leading up to this point if you are one of the lucky few who has yet to see this movie keep it that way
Feb 23 2019,positive,no idea why this movie is getting review bombed  snowflake metldown season  its a great star wars movie it isnt perfect and it has plot holes but being a star wars watcher from childhood having seen the original trilogy with starry wide eyes as a kid then the prequels as an early adult and finally this latest i see no other reason than perhaps selfentitled pissed off star wars fans nitpicking and just not sitting back to enjoy the show    do yourself a favor ignore the snowflake meltdowns watch it enjoy it for what it is a space action flick thats it    cheers
Feb 22 2019,negative,at least this was cheaper than going to the shrink why would a grown adult watch something like this its because we are useless we are lazy bored and useless and no girlfriend so dont get your light sabers up youï 12tmre fat and belong on the couch donï 12tmt get up

Feb 22 2019,negative,3 hours felt like 3 that i will never be able to get back    i tried to post a negative review about captain marvel but rotten tomatoes isnt letting me  hmmmm
Feb 22 2019,negative,if i could give this movie less than half a star i would essentially every character in this movie was  handled poorly to an extreme epic in proportion rey is a halfwit dumbass bumbling idiot who wonders about  aimlessly just doing whatever there are sequences in this movie that are entirely unnecessary and a waste of the time of any viewer  i cannot think of less necessary characters than holdo rose and phasma  and they are supposed to be among the main characters  the only thing about this movie that is not an a  complete waste of potential is the special effects   i dont watch a movie soley for the effects  but also for a good story  and a good story is clearly lacking in this film   this is not star wars this is bullshit
Feb 22 2019,negative,this movie was terrible there is not a star wars movie worse than this but force awakens comes close
Feb 22 2019,negative,nothing can fix the franchise from here
Feb 22 2019,negative,disney screwed up lukes character bad movie had no connection to cannon all the characters had the personality of a wet paper bag aside from ben unfortunate nobody wanted to listen to the fans
Feb 21 2019,negative,no clear direction from beginning to end like why did luke have white robes on in the beginning disney rian johnson and kathleen kennedy canï 12tmt accept it was a bad movie itï 12tms unfortunate to have subverted expectation in a negative way
Feb 21 2019,negative,there is a special place in hell for rian johnson after making this
Feb 21 2019,negative,the worst villains in the history of science fiction movies and the illintentioned destruction of a modern mythology that had settled in our culture disney did not take advantage of any of it and made a meaningless absurd and extremely childish movie

Feb 21 2019,negative,as visually stunning as the writing is poor
Feb 21 2019,negative,such wasted potential its the only star wars movie i dont own on dvd and i dont plan on seeing ep 9 either
Feb 21 2019,negative,when my 9 year old son who loves star wars has no idea what is going on it is truly a poorly made film  the blame lies squarely on mr johnson and those who hired him since he doesnt know what it is that people like about star wars
Feb 21 2019,positive,i thought it was fine

Feb 21 2019,negative,awful movie the worst
Feb 21 2019,negative,george lucas we miss you this isnt star wars
Feb 21 2019,negative,despite some solid performances and rich visuals tlj is an unpleasant film that disrespects the legacy of star wars and leaves the sequel trilogy in a sort of limbo where nothing interesting is happening  often playing like a parody made by someone who hated the other star wars films the last jedi is one of the most disappointing blockbuster films in years
Feb 20 2019,negative,dumpster fire makes a complete mockery of the franchise
Feb 20 2019,negative,disgusting completely killed the hype for the upcoming 9th and final movie
Feb 20 2019,negative,well were do i start with this mess of a movie well theres a few things i dont like laura dern character is only in the movie to show how you should never question women in charge ever even if they have some plan that could get people killed she hides her plan for no good reason making poe looking like a complete fool the whole movie    even though in the last movie he wasnt shown to be a hot headed fool why did they change his character right cause he is a male just like how they made luke skywalker look like a complete fool in this movie also why also cause hes a male now lets talk about rey who is just the most powerful character for no reason just making her a mary sue why it could because she a female  with no backstory and her character is kind of boring since she never really learns anything or has to  the only reason she is powerful is cause shes a female this whole movie shoves so much sjw nonsense in your face it forgets its a star wars movie instead it would rather be some political non sense
Feb 20 2019,negative,i dont know what this is but it isnt star wars
Feb 20 2019,negative,this movie was a turd inside of what you thought was a piece of chocolate cake  this was not sw  it was an sjw joke on all of the real fans who have been faithfully watching this franchise since 1977 and who have made it a tradition with their children  disney probably destroyed this forever
Feb 20 2019,negative,the new trilogy is an absolute mess
Feb 20 2019,negative,walked out of the cinema asking what the f did i just watch  not just awful was seemingly created simply to troll long term fans of the star wars universe  what was it   tried to watch again on dvd and had to turn it off   the film that killed star wars   come back jar jar binks all is forgiven
Feb 20 2019,negative,this movie sucks outright
Feb 20 2019,negative,star wars huh this is only star wars in name disney and kathleen kennedy told george lucas that they wanted to expand on his universe for the fans bs the last jedi is an exploitation of a narrative that men are bad and women are good there are great movies with very similar stories done better handled with more care and less of the degrading and appalling miss handling of characters that are loved and adored by millions such as luke skywalker disney fail
Feb 20 2019,negative,the movie lacks direction a coherent plot and strong characters a third of the movie does not need to exist and the movie tries time and time again to get woke the protagonist faces zero challenges and the ending is a disappointing payoff to a lackluster ride
Feb 20 2019,negative,spoilers in this  saw this movie in theater with the family about a week or two after it came out sorry to say this movie was just a bad version of empire strikes back the last stand in the mine was stupid and filled with mistakes and bad choices why did they defend from outside why did everything break off and go after the mf why and how did someone who followed the order to retreat able to do a 180 and a left turn to tackle someone out of the way most scenes had some point were you are like why would you do that how did they get there
Feb 20 2019,negative,they killed starwars
Feb 20 2019,negative,totally awful star wars episodespoiler am i to belive that luke who was going to sacrifice himself just to try to save his father from the dark side would just go and kill leias son   totally not believable wonderful way to destroy series with unlimited pow potential
Feb 20 2019,negative,this was an sjw mess a complete crap on the star wars universe
Feb 20 2019,negative,the special effects are awesome  however the story is dumb and not true to star lore
Feb 20 2019,positive,a criminally underrated film by the fan community this film brilliantly blends in humor and several dark moments together although more could be desired especially in the way some characters have been used a tremendous improvement over the force awakens
Feb 20 2019,negative,comedy did not land and felt out of place the direction of this movie contradicts everything the previous set up in a trolling way which felt detracting from the trilogy and the preceding trilogies total failure for the starwars saga
Feb 20 2019,negative,its amazing they were able to kill my love of star wars in a single film the only thing i can compliment is the visual design and cgi which were great but nothing made sense and the characters were unlikable
Feb 20 2019,negative,best hero in the galaxy  the hope become  a guy and you just destroy it you can kill  luke but at least give him a  worhty kill  such a regular history and bad use the characters go to hell guys
Feb 20 2019,negative,always was kind of neutral with this film  to be honest it was just shooting what was already dead to me  the sequel trilogy already died at the force awakens
Feb 20 2019,negative,its like if the two towers had gollum cut in half in a potato peeling accident and mount doom explodes after a purple haired giant eagle flies through it at light speed
Feb 20 2019,negative,the worst star wars film by a million miles
Feb 20 2019,negative,disney has destroyed star wars
Feb 20 2019,negative,hands down the worst star wars movie ever made i watched this terible film 3 times and every time i watch it i want to like it because i love star wars but it happens exactly the opposite i hate it every time more and more
Feb 20 2019,negative,i would give it 0 stars but rotting tomatoes ignore all the ratings below 1 and half stars boring and illogical film i even fell asleep during the film avoid as plague
Feb 19 2019,negative,just watch all the developed and constructed critics on yt i was sad and disturbed during the entire movie
Feb 19 2019,negative,this movie is garbage the directing characters especially luke and the strip was garbage is it ok to say a star wars movie is bad yes yes it is
Feb 19 2019,neutral,a whole lot of nothing
Feb 19 2019,negative,not a sw movie but rian johnsons vision which sucks aka rian has no johnson cause kk ripped it off him just like they ripped off lukes aka jake skywalker the only good thing i can say about this movie is visually its amazing otherwise it sucks sjw  i was part of the solo boycott and will continue to boycott all lucasfilms moviestoysect tlj the last joke the last jerk the last johnson ps shame on you lucasfilms for lashing out against your own customers and shame on you disney for allowing it
Feb 19 2019,negative,utter crap the worst movie of the franchise easily with no respect to the already stablished characters and seasoned with an instane amount of sjw agenda
Feb 19 2019,negative,saw this on my 43 birthday i was soooo disappointed i really enjoyed the force awakens and then they put this garbage out they ruined star wars
Feb 19 2019,negative,no respect for legacy characters
Feb 19 2019,negative,the beginning of the downfall of the franchise
Feb 19 2019,negative,ask yourself simple questions like    the first order only has eight tie fighters at any one time    a few tie fighters blew up leiaâtms ship but canâtmt do that to the rest of the resistance fleet instead theyâtmre going to wait until the resistance runs out of gas    this is such poor filmmaking shame on rian johnson and kathleen kennedy
Feb 19 2019,negative,awful film sjw woke trash  franchise ruining episode of the star wars saga
Feb 19 2019,negative,i really wish there had been a clear direction for the new starwars reboot the only thing i enjoyed in this movie was the kylo rey dynamic  there was way too much comedy for my liking in this movie it feels like the villains are always the butt of some joke that isnt funny   luke skywalkers character was completely butchered snoke a previously intriguing  character is gone  making him completely irrelevant  the movie wasted a great deal of time introducing new characters such as rose dj and the purple haired lady instead of developing the current ones the plot itself is boring  2 spaceships chasing each other through space at a snail pace fan favourite captain phasma barely got 5 minutes of screen time  i really hope the next movie takes better care of this beloved franchise  because this movie was just disappointing
Feb 19 2019,negative,in a word disappointing removed my enthusiasm for anything star wars under the disney brand
Feb 19 2019,negative,im sorry disney but your movie its very bad
Feb 19 2019,negative,i could write an 100 page paper on everything i hate and that is wrong with this this is terrible in everyway i dont about ep 9 star wars is over for me and many others i would have gave it a 12 star but i heard rt doesnt count them
Feb 19 2019,positive,the most daring and different of the star wars films since the disney buy out and the only one to try and take the story in a new direction not a remake like the force awakens nor a safe nostalgia love letter like rogue one the last jedi takes chances in its character beats and story telling itâtms not perfect  it drags a little in the midsection but itâtms the most challenging star wars film since the empire strikes back in 1980
Feb 19 2019,negative,the last jedi is a good mindless entertainment type film despite the themes found within the movie it feels like it wants you to watch it without really thinking about what is going on when i watched it i would question why the characters are making the decisions they make and the only logical solution i could come to was that it was happening because the plot neededwanted it to happen holdo not telling poe the plan drives the story forward there is no reason why this doesnt happen it just does rey wanting to save kylo after hating him in the force awakens and first half of the last jedi doesnt make no sense and yet we need snoke to die we need the throne room scene the characters make poor decisions which enables the plot to move forward removing the shields from the hanger and bridge for instance hux not hyperspacing ahead of the resistance holdo hyperspacing the first order fleet the movie is visually stunning and the acting is good but the plot does not work when you start examining it when you examine the context of luke and reys joke it does not make a lot of sense considering the fact that they know their friends are depending on this mission your best friend is dead but instead of mourning your gonna make a joke going from a serious grumpy old man to a funny old man and then back to a serious grumpy old man it is bloated with jokes that conflict with how you should feel as you watch it they come not from a comic relief character but from every character at some point in the movie if you like to not think about things this is a movie for you but if you like to analyze things while watching something in order to enjoy it more this isnt for you finally it has arguably the worst choreography in star wars it tried to combine the speed of the prequels with the heart of the ot and it failed it comes off more as a dancer then the prequels a dagger is edited out which enables rey to survive a guard throws his sword away before he is stabbed by kylo rey doges a swing to late so the sword is arched above her so it doesnt kill her kylo stabs the ground and a guard hits his lightsaber because it needs to happen three guards aim at the same place only to be all kicked away by rey the prequels had force sensitive people battling each other which made them work more then this
Feb 19 2019,negative,i came out of the movie theater a year ago confused and greatly disappointed this wasnt star wars its the greatest insult to such a beloved franchise ive been a lifelong sw fan and this is the only sw movie i watched once and have no plans of watching again thanks kk and rj for ruining sw

Feb 19 2019,negative,this movie is a complete disaster from the beginning to the end  congratulations rj for destroying the sw universe
Feb 19 2019,negative,awful too many ridiculous scenes worst moments  snoke dying so easy  continued whining of kylo ren  all things rose  leah floating in mid air
Feb 19 2019,negative,spoiler alert    episode viii  if you have luke dead when rey gets to the island and have her just go get the jedi coloring books erase snoke from vii and have kylo acting on his own or under the echo of vader then have a plucky character named rose among the 6 resistance members that managed to survive episode viii be among the 6 resistance members that get on the falcon after rey gets back from the island with the coloring books and some chewbacca chickens there was no need for episode viii at all  oh and when all of the unchanged characters get back on the falcon a character named rose will be there    so to recap everything that happened in episode 8 that mattered the crawl runs then luke died but didnt do anything helpful or tell us anything useful  snoke died but he didnt tell us anything useful or do anything either  rey has jedi coloring books now  roll credits    some other things that happened but wouldnt have changed anything if wed have just skipped to episode ix poe got in trouble for being daring  leia finn and chewbacca who got some chickens were the same at the end as they were at the beginning  kylo ren lost his helmet but is still not sure if hes good or bad  the knights of ren were in viii even less than vii  rey succeeds at everything she does in a movie supposedly about how failure is our greatest teacher and ostensibly this makes her more awesome at force stuff  yoda preforms divine intervention to blow up a tree that doesnt do anything at all or have any significance but without any explanation of what it doesnt do expects us to give a crap it got blown up  yoda gives us wisdom from posters with silly cats on them or sayings printed on a first graders prize pencils that have nothing to do with the movie  oh damn  rose  how did i forget rose  so theres this character named rose and  i forgot what she does but shes adorable like the chickens
Feb 19 2019,negative,the most disappointing film of the saga  lucasfilm has to understand that a film fool of unexplained abilities of the heroes and with a bipolar attitude that they are not consistent at all in their feelings and their actions is not interesting at all its not a problem about challenging the  order of the previews mythology that the funs loved so much its the inability to tell a meaningful and captivating story that reflects the reality that we live and experience  the great effects are not enough to achieve that
Feb 18 2019,negative,no no no no noooo  watching this film hurt this movie crapped on everything i loved about star wars mark hamill says it best i pretty much fundamentally disagree with every choice youve made for this character
Feb 18 2019,neutral,completely slaps the original trilogy in the face
Feb 18 2019,negative,franchise destroyer me thinks the mouse hates competition so destroy jedis by having their kids murder them
Feb 18 2019,negative,the train left the rails and plummeted off a cliff all the kings writers and directors have no chance of putting it back together again
Feb 18 2019,negative,terrible movie the plot was hard to follow and didnt connect to the previous movie the director seemed to do whatever he wanted for his sake trying his very best to dissatisfy the audience
Feb 18 2019,negative,trash and disney refusing to giving their movies to reviewers unless they give good reviews makes all of the good reviews null and void
Feb 18 2019,positive,people hate it when itâtms the same people hate it when itâtms diffrent
Feb 18 2019,negative,this movie was terrible possibly the worse among the entire trilogy no plot no decent characters and too many crappy jokes i mean yeah marvel did it but that was because the superheroes already looked stupid so they had an excuse to add in funnycrappy jokes between serious clips of their films while the last jedi i mean just wow im gonna stop this review only because of all the fanboys   of this film that comes on here saying its good they dont know what a good movie is then
Feb 18 2019,negative,the most insulting film i have seen since the force awaken parading around the star wars franchise to it has nothing left  this film does everything wrong luke is completely out of character and logic does not serve this film well how much the prequel where bad atleast there was originality the characters are complete joke especially the ot ones kylo ren while well acted is given zero development as for rey she is certified mary sue with zero redeeming characteristics
Feb 18 2019,negative,i see a lot of people here posting the highest scores saying they have been fans since the dinosaurs walked the earth     im sorry to sound provocative but know that i dont say it out of spite you are not star wars fans that doesnt mean you cant like the movie obviously  i feel the same casual entertainment when i watch the marvel movies i can rate them as good movies because if or when they break the universe to which they belong i wouldnt know  i am not involved enough in the marvel universe  however i am clearly not a fan the movies mean no more to me than the brief entertainment they provide    this is also the case with you and star wars again i dont say it to provoke but there is just not any plausible way that you could enjoy anything about the star wars universe prior to this movie if you think this movie is a masterpiece     there are many reasons for that but in summary this movie stands in opposition to everything that was made before it not as a plot twist but an incompatiable puzzle piece that wont ever fit anywhere because it was made with total disregard for the other pieces     the last jedi breaks the star wars universe the rules for which was firmly established early on and now there is not just a lack of predictability nothing inherently wrong about this but an absolute lack of consistence tons of wrong about this    it also breaks the last two characters we had left their characteristics and personalities it messes with the relatively distinct philosophies the conflict between which the whole universe centered around    so if you think you are a fan and didnt have a problem with tlj messing with the universe the characters or the values previous star wars movies projected then perhaps you should ask yourselves what you actually enjoyed about the universe before rian johnson broke it perhaps youre a fan of the new trilogy  thatd be a more honest standpoint    in the end johnsons creation is an abomination i dont fault the actors for this just the minds in the top that clearly hold no love for star wars or its fans
Feb 18 2019,negative,this killed the franchise
Feb 18 2019,negative,the movie that made me stop watching star wars movies except if i dont really have to pay for them like netflix  so sad that i now consider the movies i most loved as a child to be straight to dvd fodder  too woke i guess
Feb 18 2019,negative,this movie fucking sucks
Feb 18 2019,negative,doesnï 12 12tmt honour the legacy isnï 12 12tmt rich in story emotion or action downright worthless
Feb 17 2019,negative,so many plot holes it made my brain hurt not a bad movie sfx wise but the action and story scenes seem lazy thrown together and dont make any sense in my opinion
Feb 17 2019,negative,first star wars movie were i felt sick numb confused and wondering what i had just watched sad day
Feb 17 2019,negative,had to fast forward through some of the movie which ive never done in my lifetime worst star wars movie i have ever seen even the prequels were masterpieces next to this horrible movie oh i disliked the prequels
Feb 17 2019,negative,not good writing could be the best star wars movie ever but it isnt the visuals photography are great in some moments but in others are really bad and needed exposition like on the space chase on the beginning 25
Feb 17 2019,negative,this movie will be the reason i will not watch episode 9 how the hell do you miss so badly on who and what luke skywalker is rj was handed the keys to a ferrari crashed it then sat in on fire and dumped into the deepest depths of the pacific
Feb 17 2019,negative,if i could give zero i would worst of all star wars films terrible acting all round and a terrible story of nothing really
Feb 17 2019,positive,great special effects and characters the overall storyline and back stories were a huge disappointment this movie did not do any justice to our past heroes
Feb 17 2019,negative,demolished and humiliated all of the classic characters to elevate the boring rey  rose tico and the canto blight subplot are completely irrelevant to the story  contradicted all previous movies and canon  forgettable
Feb 17 2019,negative,this film is a mess visually it looks great but the story requires large leaps in logic to believe and luke skywalkers character is completely ruined
Feb 17 2019,negative,feels like they tried to create a great movie addressing modern liberal ideas but they failed and totally destroyed the rules that govern star wars and i doubt any of the writers bothered to watch the previous movies
Feb 17 2019,negative,its very beautiful but  a complete 1080o that could have been good if it was well made there is just too much plot holes bad jokes incoherencies with the main saga and plots that leads to nothing the worst starwars they even created the most hated caracter ever in a star wars good job ryan jonhson         jar jar  rose
Feb 17 2019,negative,this movie finished what the force awakens began  destroying star wars
Feb 17 2019,negative,not a star wars movie
Feb 17 2019,negative,lucus film is so disconnected from there own franchise there is nothing to look forward to for the rest of the trilogy
Feb 17 2019,negative,lost interest in star wars after this
Feb 17 2019,negative,one if not the worst film ive ever seen an insult and not a movie
Feb 17 2019,negative,would honestly have preferred to see jaja binks again
Feb 17 2019,negative, maverick helps destroy a battleship that wouldve killed them despite orders to the contrary gets demoted then mutinies against a feminist cabal consisting of space mary poppins vice admiral dangerhair and sidekick bigschnozz later they regain control and forgive him no biggie   token asian woman heroically rescues token black man from heroically rescuing the entire resistance force they then share a kiss having bonded over trashing a casino while fleeing from parking maids   darth emo and female neo try to turn each other but fail   jet bombers work in space apparently also the simple technique of hyperspace ramming has been discovered so from now on all space battles will be exceedingly short    anything else i missed  outside of me being a russian bot
Feb 16 2019,positive,lots of good lots of bad but stays true to the legacy regards and integrates the prequels originals and sequels in a small way could do without flying people and mama jokes tho
Feb 16 2019,negative,there was one scene that is pretty spectacular but the rest of the movie is a dumpster fire do disney pay these critics off
Feb 16 2019,negative,this movie was so bad that i nearly walked out of the theater its not only a boring movie but also littered with plot holes and it doesnt feel like a star wars movie
Feb 16 2019,negative,this isnt just the worst star wars movie its the worst of anything in the entire star wars genre the score also goes to show how out of touch and agendadriven professional critics are
Feb 16 2019,negative,liberal undertones are scattered everywhere in the film that is like the whole franchise states in a galaxy far far away im sure in a galaxy far far away people are above inserting their own political agendas into a movie not mention this is a fictional galaxy trying to implement todays liberal ideologies onto it its pathetic and needs no place in this once amazing universe disney has destroyed the franchise and im ecstatic at the fact that solo done only 83 million at the box office absolutley terrible yet terrific take a pass on this film if you dont want todays minority represented as majority politics forced onto you
Feb 16 2019,negative,not only the worst of all the sw movies but a complete insult to the fans  this movie was shockingly bad  i tried to watch it a second time to see if my expectations were too high but no it was worse than i originally thought  this is the movie thst did the impossible  i no longer care about the past movies or the future ones      well done ruin johnson and kathleen kennedy
Feb 16 2019,negative,this is what you get if someone who hated star wars made a movie with the intention of ruining star wars
Feb 16 2019,negative,star wars is dead 
Feb 15 2019,negative,for visual effects only does it get a half star
Feb 15 2019,negative,poor pacing bad acting horrendous story  this movie is really a 0 star    i dont know how it has such a high rating because it was so poorly developed
Feb 15 2019,negative,hyperspaceramming ruins canon if followed to its logical conclusion all space combat would be engaged with hyperspace equipped missiles also with hyperspace a carchase theme does not work was the first order incapable of jumping half their fleet directly in front of the rebels perhaps they were also short on hyperfuel and finally the emasculation of luke skywalker the greatestmost powerful jedi in star wars is a slap in the face to the entire skywalker saga this movie is mutually exclusive from the rest of the star wars universe and should be viewed as no more than an expensive fan fiction
Feb 15 2019,negative,itï 12 12 12 12tms a movie in the sense that things are filmed and thereï 12 12 12 12tms dialogue and actors other than that this movie is awful has an incoherent plot and was just a very poor attempt to get marvel fans and fort itï 12 12 12 12tms players to get interested in buying merchandise
Feb 15 2019,negative,almost definitely the worst star wars film ever made in my opinion first of all possibly the worst thing about this film was the way the character of luke skywalker was destroyed one of the most upbeat and optimistic characters in the franchise was deprived of all enthusiasm it was disheartening to see such a legendary and revered character be ruined in this way secondly the character of rey was not developed at all and again similar to the last film experienced no hardship or difficulties to overcome this makes her such a boring character as there is no room for her to grow as a person as she seems to be able to do everything already finn and po were two of the more interesting characters of the force awakens but seem to be emasculated in this film i feel like there were such potential for these characters however they were not done justice in this film i dont even want to discuss the character of rose the only thing i will say is that she is possibly worse than jar jar binks also ive never watched a star wars film that has made the universe feel so minuscule there are countless worlds to explore but for some reason we are stuck in a neverending chase which seems to be happening in slow motion it felt like watching a tortoise and a slug have a race on the rare occasion that our attention could be pulled away from the invigorating chase across space we were then lectured on capitalism in possibly the most forced scene ever to exist i actually had to check to make sure i hadnt walked in to a marxist convention instead of the cinema kylo ren is just an extremely strange villain hes not intimidating he doesnt even seem that evil i really dont understand whats happening with that character in addition the whole idea of luke destroying the ancient jedi texts just seemed a bit drastic a bit like setting yourself on fire because you were slightly cold finally the whole idea of hyperspace ramming just seems to be a massive plot hole  now for some questions why does princess leia turn into space mary poppins and why does the admiral with pink hair not inform her crew of the masterplan which is going to save them all why does she just keep it to herself these two elements of the film are not explained to the audience and appear to make little sense     overall this is quite a poor film as seen by the audience backlash
Feb 15 2019,negative,the destruction of a saga
Feb 15 2019,negative,horrible movies so far from what it use to be i wish better movies in my kids era
Feb 15 2019,positive,masterpiece i dont know why people hate this film
Feb 14 2019,negative,so horribly bad it wrecked the entire star wars canon
Feb 14 2019,negative,it was a comedy of failures using dated tongueincheek millenial jokes    it failed to explain the setting or advance a coherent plot    it didnt even develope meaningful characters who could shape the story rather all of the characters are molded into roles as per requirements of each individual scene
Feb 14 2019,negative,thought it was ok the first time i saw it but i like to see it at least twice before i leave a review after watching it a couple more times i think the last jedi has a few good things about it but a lot of flaws overall i feel it was a very disappointing movie first the good points special effects cinematography and music are on par with all the other star wars movie which is good the bad story line was unaspiring slowest chase scene ever sub story side adventure was pointless character development was poor and inconsistent the story arc of the previous movie seemed disconnected these are just a few of the many things i find faulty about this movie i could go on but id end up writing a 10 page essay i hope the next one is better
Feb 14 2019,negative,id give it zero stars for the character assassination plot holes and agonizingly slow storyline but the minimum seems to be a half star truly one of the worst movies ive seen and truly the film to make me miss george lucas and his maligned prequels
Feb 14 2019,negative,the movie kept subverting the plot making any build up of emotion or expectation useless  phasma was irrelevant   comedy was bullshit  villains were too easily defeated   chase scenes were pointless   lightspeed rules were thrown out the window  too much political messaging
Feb 14 2019,negative,the trailer looked great one of the things i was really interested in seeing was the battle between the walkers and the sleds i wondered what new way the good guys would find to take out the walkers because i assumed ryan wouldnt just have them use harpoons and tow cables again what we got to see was the good guys drive out thereand then just turn around and go back well i guess that did subvert my expectations  the last jedi is the matrix 3 of the star wars saga knowing the fate of luke is so grim it stifles the enjoyment of the previous films im much more excited to see adywans return of the jedi revisited than i am the next new star wars film which is a shame because i did like force awakens jj has an impossible task to wrap up this derailed trainwreck
Feb 13 2019,negative,now available on netflix  but i could not get through it again the massive plot holes gravity bombs in space a space chase in which smaller ships can come and go for casino trips   the resistance was basically eliminated  down to 30 or so people with no leadership   extremely disappointing it felt like a hit job on the franchise
Feb 12 2019,negative,this movie was terrible there are so many plot holes and unexplained circumstances unnatural dialogue especially after leia is saved timeline inconsistencies and general star wars cannon commonknowledge tropes of the star wars universe also heavily inconsistent such as hyperspace ships being used as weapons its just a total mess the movie completely turns the previous characterisation of luke skywalker onto its head and it was just baffling to watch i left the cinema feeling confused and empty i have no idea what could possibly come with episode 9 but frankly i dont care anymore we still have the original trilogy and nothing can take that away as much as rian johnson and kathleen kennedy would like to  the only redeeming quality about this film is its visual effects but not even its cinematography or anything just the cgi effects because the red throneroom scene is hilariously poorly choreographed its clearly a dance routine and not a fight totally breaks any immersion this film struggled to garner up until that point    just terrible
Feb 12 2019,negative,hour 2 my son says i want to go home  heartbreakingly bad
Feb 12 2019,negative,a dull narrative wasted story points ruining both the classic characters and the ones they try to build up the last jedi proved fans are not content with modern hollywood tropes in an iconic film franchise yes this movie made plenty of money but solo being a finanical failure shows the future of the franchise will have to prove itself to find favor with its fans again well see what happens with episode ix that is if i want to go see it
Feb 12 2019,negative,one star for the visuals and cgi which were really quite excellent in terms of plot however this film is a mess    where to begin the characterization in this film is all over the place poes character feels very regressed i cant really imagine that a hotheaded flyboy would have made it as far in the resistance military as he did so for him to be portrayed as such is a bit nonsensical finn felt pretty incharacter although some of the slapstick elements are strange and his entire subplot does little to progress the overall storyline rey the presumed heroine of these new movies has very little personal development she learns that her parents are nobodies which is an empirelevel plot twist that i wish worked but it doesnt personally i would have rather had the big lukes daughter reveal it would have felt more satisfying with the buildup anakins lightsaber calling to her obiwan serving as a guiding voice for her etc from tfa    of course lukes characterization is the most suspect im fine with him being jaded and bitter but its not done in a way that makes sense i cant believe anakin theres still light in him skywalker would draw his lightsaber on a defenseless boy unless kylo ren is literally that evilbut then what was the point of trying to show kylo as a sympathetic character throughout tlj just to say sike at the end luke felt like he was written specifically to develop kylos backstory and not in any way that makes sense with past portrayals of his character the only satisfying part of lukes plotline is depressingly enough his death scene which i felt was both beautiful and fitting    then theres rose who is cute and lovely but does not particularly feel like a useful addition to the story the same can be said for holdo who i think is meant to be portrayed as a strong feminist character but instead comes off as manipulative condescending and an incompetent commander im all for strong female characters but she was not handled correctly at all even some minor appearances felt mishandledlike why was yoda the one who appeared to supposedly destroy the ancient jedi texts he was a decidedly old school jedi it would have made more sense for anakin to come back light em up and maybe casually remind his son not to write off kylo ren the same way so many people wrote off vader but i digress    overall i would have welcomed a more subversive entry into the star wars franchise but tlj simply isnt it it felt like it was trying too hard to be edgy and different at the expense of its own characters and writing i still dont understand what the point of snoke was in tfa he was kind of creepy mystical and sidiousesque but in tlj he looks like jeff goldblum in thor ragnorak and he dies with very little fanfare who is this guy if anakin destroyed the last of the sith in rotj then where the heck did he come from it felt like the director didnt know how to develop him except tobig surpriseuse him as yet another element in kylos arc    it will be interesting to see where the next movie goes from here
Feb 12 2019,negative,mess of a plot ruins the futures of your favorite oldies and every character is either boring underused or overpowered none of the characters learn anything or change in any way an hour of this movie could be removed and it wouldnt affect the nearly nonexistent plot that makes no sense save yourself and go watch the originals again
Feb 12 2019,positive,a stunning narrative success building on the immense success of the force awakens
Feb 12 2019,positive,unlike the awful ratings and internet opinions i believe that this movie is an amazing work of cinematography and storytelling the only part of the film i disagree with is the side story with finn and rose going to the casino where they didnt even end up getting what they need 45
Feb 12 2019,negative,social justice warriors have ruined this franchise iâtmm all for diversity and if anyone wants to create a space opera of mostly women kicking ass fine but this movie force fed us kathleen kennedyâtms idea of diversity and female empowerbent itâtms so obvious and crowbarred into the movie i donâtmt buy it for a minute this move wasnâtmt just bad it was retroactively bad this made all the proceeding moveis worse     this franchise is not only dead i wish it never existed
Feb 12 2019,positive,what really hit the critics with a bulls eye but went completely over the heads of the audience was the moral of the movie its not about destroying what you hate but saving what loved ones you have left really this moral is the fundamental base of this movie and really the audience found this movie to be pretty bad because they just couldnt see how the complex yet amazing plot wraps around the moral of the story comfortably also the last jedi swings the old plots from a new hope but changing it around as well look at it you have a force sensitive person that meets someone to train them to help fight against an evil force hell bent on destroying them just like kenobi luke skywalker went to become one with the force i wouldnt be surprised if they pull off more force communication between rey and luke in the rise of skywalker honestly i stand firmly with the fact that this was a good movie and i hope star wars could still find a place in many peoples hearts
Feb 12 2019,negative,visually beautiful story incoherent as a chapter within the sw universe disastrously poor i do not know how lucasfilms allowed this to happen
Feb 12 2019,negative,but dont fret now that disney owns marvel and star wars thanos can now blink the new star wars movies out of existence reboot
Feb 12 2019,positive,had some cool special effects but overall it was kinda meh
Feb 11 2019,negative,itâtms hard to describe how damaging this film is to the franchise this movie is the equivalent of spending money on steak and getting the house salad no offense to salads  fool me once
Feb 11 2019,negative,disappointing and it was poorly executed i blame the director who ruined all plot points and luke skywalker
Feb 11 2019,negative,complete drivel dont waste your time
Feb 11 2019,negative,i cant believe what kennedy and the so called story group is doing to star wars i think its quite obviously apparent to us all that tfa  tlj are muck devoid of suspense and tension its as if these people have never watched 16 or played any of the games or even read any of the books     nobody cares about rey finn or poe seriously kill them off in the next movie and we would actually be relieved     ask yourself what each movie about    from the perspective of the protagonist and the audience       ep1 how anakin meets obi wan  ep2 how the clone war began  ep3 how anakin became darth vader  ep4 how luke and obi wan meet  ep5 how luke finds out about his father and begins his training  ep6 how vader restores balance to save his son    these next two god i dont even know    ep7  a scavenger gets jedi powers from nowhere   ep8  i honestly have no idea what to say eaaa the scavenger grows stronger in the force maybe or steals books from a hermit    if i were bob eiger i would fire everyone in lucasfilm and start again with a crowd of people that actually loves star wars any fan would take a salary cut to work there hell id work for free if i could even help the new movies in the correct direction     i wont go on but to leave you with a quote from kennedy and im paraprasing     im looking for female directors and i have so many guys calling me up saying im such a fan all the toy companies were saying star wars mostly appeals to boyswe have to change that it has to appeal to both whats wrong with that      well kathleen i will tell you whats wrong with that its called star wars as a percentage women do not participate in war yes there are some and they are in my opinion total bad asses like leia jyn padme warrior women are not the norm and by injecting literally a 5050 split of genders in every frame as a fan it is so jaring movie goers are not stupid we see these obvious intentional choices and it totally takes you out of the movie not to mention it dilutes the actions of the female characters       for god sake get seasoned directors like nolanscottlucastaraninokoen bros etc etc etc     we want quality not mediocre we care because to us its not just a movie its an escape one that some of us live and breath that gives us some comfort in our every day if its for boys then what the hell is wrong with that can we not have one thing to ourselves
Feb 11 2019,negative,although i felt the prequels failed to recapture lightning in a bottle i like the overall story in canon they still felt like star wars and unique to the world lucas built i thought the force awakens had a tough needle to thread but accomplished everything it had to it was enjoyable and felt like a solid relaunch the last jedi does not pay off anything that was built or hinted at in force awakens in general the story and screenplay dont make sense the casino planet was a distraction and boring the slowmotion chase lacked tension and admiral holdos secret plan was withheld for no reason and at great expense to the overall mission i dont get the critics store
Feb 11 2019,negative,perhaps the worst movie of the franchise despite some interesting storytelling pieces the movie lacks everything  not only the lack of quality stops dead in its tracks the story elements laid by the previous episode but it clearly makes any sequels totally irrelevant
Feb 11 2019,negative,ruined so much about the star wars we all loved dont even get me started on they treated luke poor mark hamil is broken hearted
Feb 11 2019,negative,i made an account just to rate this movie i have always been a star wars fan but this movie was impossible to like the moment leia flew in space after being literally blown out of her ship i knew the film was in trouble i hoped that things would get better but they didnï 12tmt this film brought about the overuse of the term ï 12toxic masculinityï 12â by trying and in my opinion failing to demonize poe this was brought about because the new rebel commander and leia refused to keep him in the know after demoting him which was also dumb so poe is running around the whole movie trying to save the resistance because there is no clear plan from anyone else of course his desire to help is portrayed as reckless if he had just been informed then the movie wouldnï 12tmt have happened because all the side plots would not have existed the casino planet also forgettable    reyi understand that she is supposed to be the best thing since ever but she seems to stumble upon her amazing abilities with the force rather than having any proper training if you recall how long it took luke to raise that xwing out of the swamp she is able to move massive rocks with a look like ï 12hmmm what if i just move these with my mind never done it before but iï 12tmll give it a goï 12â     finn should be dead and lukeï 12tms legacy was demolished in a way that doesnï 12tmt fit his background at all youï 12tmre telling me that luke the guy that couldnï 12tmt kill his father after he tried killing him multiple times just loses his mind after he sees a possible future and is now going to murder his nephewno just no this movie ruined my expectations for star wars moving forward
Feb 10 2019,negative,the movie itself has a lot of promise delivering the type of highoctane immersive content which fans wanted to see the glaring issue however is that the twists which everyones been feverishly whispering about fall flat as anything you could imagine i enjoyed elements of the last jedi truly but the narrative style clearly indicates the current status of disneys star wars trilogy shock value everything is done to get the audience to go whaaaaat thats crazy and thats it theres no lasting impact the movie disappeared from my thoughts basically once i left the theatre it doesnt mean its a bad movie per se but it is a vapid movie attempting to distance the franchise from anything offensive so disney can market it it comes down to which characters make good toys or which characters can become icons for the new generation the latter i have no problem with but the former makes me feel take advantage of as a viewer if you are reading this and you like movies as an audiovisual experience without much meaning or risk buy the last jedi merchandise frankly disney would prefer that you buy their toys  games in addition to their movies so if you buy the movie you should be a good to disney and just keep buying buying buying if youre reading this  you enjoy watching movies for their substance original techniques of filming andor believable drama i recommend avoiding paying any amount of money for the last jedi even if mark hamill brings another incredible if offputting portrayal of luke skywalker to the big screen this movie betrays his talent support his voice acting career his vo roles number in the hundreds at this point again tlj is a good experience to see in imax or something like suckerpunch 2011 was but dont be disappointed in the storytelling or world building you already paid for it disney doesnt care if you enjoy it
Feb 10 2019,negative,they absolutely ruined luke skywalkers character and its just sad the backstory to rey was weird and snoke was an utter disappointment
Feb 10 2019,negative,this movie is trash so full of stupid scenes and useless plot not consistent with each other ruining some interesting characters of the new trilogy and destroying some beloved characters of all times with no reason subverting expectations can be interesting but not done in this way when i left the cinema i was worn out kind of wishing there was a chance to say lets delete entirely this movie and do again an episode 8 with a consistent and interesting story  something that doesnt spit on the face of millions of star wars fans   since this was unlikely to happen as many other i told myself no more star wars for me in the cinema for a while
Feb 9 2019,negative,fk this movie luke deserves better disney please learn from this that yes you need an artist with a vision at the heal just make sure that person can maintain continuity and tell a good story good visuals and an establish ip does not a good film make risks need be taken to make something new and worth watching but dont put that job in the hands of people who dont know what there doing ignore continuity and are blinded by ideologies  agendas fk kathleen kennedy the force is not female as much as its not male its for everyone
Feb 9 2019,negative,stars wars  the last jedi disgraces the legacy of a once proud saga  with a massive jab at everything the franchise once stood for
Feb 9 2019,negative,i actually liked this movie the first time i watched it but have since changed my mind the pointless dialog that takes up most of the movie the ridiculously bad lightsaber training and fight scene also lasers dont ark in space and why are all the space ships so slow this is a star wars movie not a world war 2 movie kylo is a terrible  villain and his master was interesting but that got put to an end hopefully the next movie will be better but i will probably wait until it comes out on blu ray and just rent it iï 12tmve lost all hope in disneyï 12tms ability to make good star wars movies
Feb 8 2019,positive,it took a second viewing to get fully on board with this film but it won me over in the end the message that anyone can be the hero is one that has the potential to resonate for all generations of viewers a few exchanges of bad dialogue and unnecessary exposition made me cringe but it was equally balanced by some really amazing moments that could go down as some of the most memorable that this franchise has to offer the last jedi is the perfect segway to the forthcoming bookend of the episodic skywalker saga
Feb 8 2019,negative,this movie was did so much damage to the franchise its crazy people overwhelmingly hated this garbage of a movie dont believe me just look at last jedi merchandise sales they are almost nothing kids arent even buying the toys it makes sense though this movie was so poorly written and directed star wars lost a lot of fans thanks to disney
Feb 8 2019,positive,rian johnson is a wonderful director internal consistency of plot story and themes is super important i think there is some complexity to the story that makes things easy to miss but overall i think this movie is great for multiple reasons    too bad jj hated it i would have loved a sequel to this movie
Feb 8 2019,positive,loved it ive watched it over and over again my kids loved it too cant wait for episode ix
Feb 8 2019,negative,the most dissapointment i have ever felt that has ruined star wars for me
Feb 8 2019,positive,i really enjoyed this movie it was much better than the force awakens which was basically a remake of a new hope   the twists and the action in this movie was just perfect
Feb 7 2019,negative,pros visuals and music   cons terrible characters nonsensical plot and this movie manages to retroactively make the force awakens garbage too by throwing out every mystery that movie teased who is snoke doesnt matter hes dead who are reys parents nobody what will luke do now  get his arse kicked by someone who only discovered the force a week before hux  now comic relief just so so many reasons to hate this movie from a story and character point of view awful
Feb 7 2019,negative,a wasted moment for the great characters poor story and logic a mess unfortunately a star wars fan
Feb 7 2019,positive,the graphics are the best part  acting and choreography was really cool  storyline was kind of wierd
Feb 7 2019,negative,this film is beyond terrible as story and character development goes i left the cinema gobsmacked at just how bad it is took my 9 year old son with me to see it as after watching episodes 17 he was really into star wars and now hes turned to the marvel movies that must say something
Feb 7 2019,positive,borderline a cinematic masterpiece seen it so many times and made me fall in love with star wars all over again 
Feb 7 2019,negative,so bad bad bad bad so so bad and very confused what as disney done to star wars
Feb 6 2019,negative,subverting expectations is one thing but this is simply a bad movie with a mediocre story and a plodding plot
Feb 6 2019,positive,this review contains major spoilers only read if you have seen the movie alright with that being said i left this movie on thursday night with a lot on my mind and at a lost for words rian johnson took a lot of chances and risk with this movie some landed amazing some not so much i didnt want to write a review and give my thoughts on this movie until i saw it again which i did tonight with that being said im ready to give my thoughts this movie starts with an amazing space battle oscar issac as poe dameron is phenomenal he definitely had a lot more to do and oscar knocked it out of the park with poe in this movie from hes amazing space battles to jokes he has it all in this movie mark hamill as luke skywalker was amazing to watch this might be mark hamill best performance as luke skywalker the chemistry he had with daisy ridley is phenomenal and they both kill it together on screen adam driver as kylo ren is on a whole new level what adam driver does with this character throughout the movie is amazing and i cant wait to see what hes able to do next i already mentioned her but daisy ridley brought her a game for this movie john boyega and kelly marie tran both had awesome performances but the story line they had was weak and felt out of place in this movie some of the things i really enjoyed was the stuff on the island with rey and luke loved how it showed how much luke doesnt want anything to do with rey and wanting to train her to show her why the jedi should end also showing the back story to what happened between him and kylo ren when he was training him i really liked the connection between rey and kylo which we ultimately find out snoke it doing to trick rey into coming to his ship after kylo i really liked how poe had a lot more to do in this movie and felt more valued and had more to do and felt important to the story this time around something i really disliked and absolutely hated was how little snoke did and ultimately meant to this movie and trilogy he didnt do much and we learned nothing about him and he just died off when kylo killed him which does push kylo as the main villain but felt like snoke was useless and didnt need to be in these movies at all like i said earlier i hated the story line with finn and rose them going to that island just to get a code breaker to get onto snoke ship felt pointless and felt like it didnt belong in this movie it felt like they used it to talk about animal cruelty which felt out of place captain phasma was the biggest let down they had this amazing character that people loved and wanted more of after the force awakens and had books and comics about and built this character up just to get barley any screen time and to get killed off just felt like it was useless the final battles was amazing and looks stunning the rose saving finn pushed roses character more and built a connection between them the luke and kylo battle at the end was good and bad at the same time they didnt do much in ways of fighting but the dialogue was phenomenal i saw this coming but luke died at the end of the movie but the way they did it was phenomenal and paid respect to his character and history i left this for the end but carrie fisher as prissiness leia is phenomenal and magical she kills it yet again with the role of leia was definitely emotional seeing her finally performance as leia and what a performance it was interested to see what they do in episode 9 with leia since she does survive this movie but overall rian johnson took a lot of major risk and some landed and some didnt i really liked this movie leaving the first time but seeing it again i now love this movie i didnt say everything that happened but most of it go check this movie out with an open mind
Feb 6 2019,negative,if the dark side were a person this would be the movie that it would make for all the fact that the star wars orgional movies of the 1970s brought people together helped us all to see one another as fellow travelers this movie devides breaks and plants a bitterness between people that might easily turn towards hate ive never seen the name of a unifying franchise like star wars used in such a poor way star wars was the classic fight good v evil im not sure what this movie is but it is not that failure doesnt cover what this movie is failure is when you dont succeed at something this movie attempts to not only destroy itself but also the good will hard won mutual human appreciation which the past movies worked hard to gain i personally am upset at people having the arogance to tell me what i should and shouldnt like the answer to that kind of behavior is no no you dont get to tell me what i should and shouldnt like believe what values i should have or that i am a bad person for seeing not what this movie is but what this movie does it drives we fellow humans away from eachother the absolute opposite of what star wars does i wont be watching star wars episode 91011 whatever not until someone in this franchise remembers what star wars is all about bringing humanity together with common values and ideas which we all share family loyalty hope respect exactly who doesnt like respect and enjoys being disrespected etc i feel sick just thinking that such fundamental ideas ideals values and goals for one another have been forgotten that and the plot holes need to be seriously avoided so im going to forget that rogue one sw the force awakens solo and this movie were ever made and alow whomever at the top to reflect gain wisdom and learn and then start over wipe this divisive garbage off the face of the galaxy star wars was never a for the critics movie and the arogance that the critics have by claiming that this movie has all the emotionrich action fans could hope for unfortunately if that were what star wars meant to the fans that might be accurate but that isnt even close star wars does mean timeless core values like freedom from oppression love as an act not a feeling winning over hate as an act not a feeling reason and clear thinking winning over blind emotionalism and uncontrolled passions and feelings hate leads to the dark side this movie is nothing more than a hate filled sermon where female bullies are justified im sorry but never i dont care what you look like or what you do or dont have between your legs or on your chest hate looks equally ugly on everyone this movie is as ugly as they get mutual respect and appreciation is for everyone hate isnt for anyone ive this before elsewhere and i say it again here now hate isnt something you control hate controls you and no one who ever hated anyone hates the object of their hate more than they hate themselves hate is an all consuming emotion devouring those who feel it faster than the people whom are the objects of their hate star wars has been consumed by hatred the core value of the dark side obvious to anyone who values love both as a feeling and as a way of living life
Feb 6 2019,negative,i have never been more let down by a movie it retroactively spit on the legacy history and mythology of star wars
Feb 6 2019,negative,like any movie with a large budget the cgi was amazing but thats where the praise ends plot holes pointless subplots random character motivations that make little sense and tone deaf attempts at comedy interrupting serious moments in the film that rips you out of the moment its a meh film at best
Feb 6 2019,negative,i find the critics review of this film dubious for all the talk of taking sw in a new direction  having twists i feel this film just feels off  from poes opening on hold gag which was so toe curling in its crapiness i felt totally self aware of trying to titter in the vain hope that my son would also feel this was amusing it was not and these absolutely shite attempts of quick witted han solo type jibes came thick  thin but remained stedfast in there utter cringingly comic dying on a stage type thing  i suppose rj thought hed kick off the controversy straight from the off with the sabre toss im all for controversial moments in a film they can be brilliant this was not brilliant  the luke being an arsehole thing the milking scene which made me attempt to stab myself in the eyes with my diet coke plastic straw the fish nuns rey being being told her parents are basically the binman  pastry chef the princess leia  christopher reeve moment  believe me johnson  that will forever be your jar jar moment  they are all just awfully misplaced moments   what to make of rey being already seemingly more powerful than kylo even though having not 1 spot on the jedi dojo and then to compound the absurdity both kylo  rey being able to judas snoke who is obviously infinitely more powerful but is susceptible to the old look over there routine  the trailing of the ship through hyper space getting off the ship to get back on the ship after finder dj schtick and as for cantoshite  holdos sacrifice although visually fantastic to look at just makes a mockery of previous struggles to battle these gigantic destroyers  i cannot be even bothered to finish the review such is my ambivalence to this film rj has dropped his pants  dumped all over tfa possibly plot lines turned around and thought hed farted fairy dust he hasnt  jj abrhams will need episode ix to run for 6 hours to rectify this particular turd
Feb 6 2019,negative,not sure what this is but sure it isnt star wars
Feb 6 2019,negative,one star only for the cinematography set pieces looked great movie was hot garbage
Feb 5 2019,negative,the worst star wars movie ever
Feb 5 2019,negative,it was really bad plenty of videos explaining why its bad and all the ones saying jts good make no sense
Feb 5 2019,negative,unbelievable all the main characters are irritating and useless to the story
Feb 5 2019,positive,a masterpiece i said what i said
Feb 5 2019,negative,the main character has no development everything is handed to her the film is full of plot holes the writers dont know how light sabers work   its as if they havent watched a single other star wars movie
Feb 4 2019,negative,the last jedi is a travesty an abomination not worthy of illegal streaming  its like if garbage vomited on garbage  what do you do  you just leave and dont even revisit the franchise from this point onward  as a lifelong star wars fan i am boycotting episode 9 for the simple reason that i dont want to add more insult to injury   you had one job rian one job to follow the set out storyline from 7 other movies and you had to try to reinvent the wheel near the end  when people look up corporate whore in a dictionary your face should get a full page
Feb 4 2019,negative,the movie goes absolutely nowhere it builds no excitement for the next installment and takes no risks in no part of the movie do you feel emotionally attached to any character and by the end you could honestly not care what happens to each character in this story it absolutely blows my mind that these critics can rate such a boring bland story so high will never trust these critics reviews on movies ever again
Feb 4 2019,positive,this movie has become my favorite in the franchise by a large margin it adresses some of the flaws i found in the original trilogy such as the overemphasis of dynasties that made the universe feel small and the black and white portrayal of good and evil it delves into the idea of the grey jedi which yields one of the most complex and interesting dynamics between a protagonist and antagonist that weve seen in the series    the themes of failure and regret lead luke skywalker on a classic but little used character arch of the fallen hero culminating in one of the best interactions between luke and yoda of the series and a sendoff for the hero that could not be more fitting to his character    poes arc involves learning the difference between heroism and leadership and when each is most appropriate and the director does such a good job of helping us empathize with poes perspective that many thought it was a flaw of the film that poe should have to grow into better version of himself    finns character arc involves learning to believe in something bigger than himself while also discovering just what people mean when they talk about a spark of hope that will burn the first order down by experiencing first hand the oppressed children in canto bight and the rich few who profit from their oppression    despite the wealth of deeper meaning just below the surface of pretty much every scene in the film it still manages to keep a brisk pace while juggling multiple poignant themes and deliver fun action and comedy dazzling visuals and the fantastic score that you expect from star wars    if youve lost your sense of childhood wonder since you first experienced the original trilogy and cant bring yourself to leave your snarky cynicism at the door before seeing a fantasy film then this and any other fantasy movie is no longer for you sorry    if you can still enjoy star wars for the lighthearted flashgordoninspired wizardsinspace romp that is and has always been the heart of star wars youre in for a treat
Feb 4 2019,negative,a star wars movie that takes a huge dump all over the original characters in place of boring uninspiring and marysuelike new characters if youre looking to see nostalgia or how the original characters turned out after episode 6 dont bother youll only be faced with disappointment that you spent money on seeing it ive had to change my rating from a 12star to a 1star just so my review counts into the audience score
Feb 4 2019,positive,this movie is an amazing work of art filled with exciting action sequences and well fleshed out characters luke skywalkers story line is perfect the movies message about failure and letting go of the past is well executed and greatly serves as a worthy second part to this trilogy
Feb 4 2019,negative,just a terrible movie full of plot holes  the only movie i have ever walked out of
Feb 4 2019,negative,what a disappointment   ryan johnson ruined everything  gosh and that movie is so sexist 
Feb 3 2019,negative,just astonishingly bad   this was utterly detached from the canon of the original trilogy  there were multiple blatant attempts to stray from andor eliminate key elements and themes from the original canon and story arc of the saga   if youï 12 12tmre a fan of earlier star wars films and are looking for a cohesive continuation of that storyline this ainï 12 12tmt it
Feb 3 2019,negative,fundamentally flawed very poorly developed story line incoherent and inconsistent with the overarching theme although the actors make an effort to convey the story the poor direction really leaves no room for empathy with the characters
Feb 3 2019,negative,even worst than the phantom menace 
Feb 3 2019,negative,another good series ruined for the sake of sjws
Feb 3 2019,negative,in my humble opinion this is the worst star wars film of the franchisethey crapt all over jjabrams vision they made rey an enormous marie sue   and all the sjw crap all that does is hurt the film
Feb 3 2019,negative,political bs ruined another movie
Feb 3 2019,negative,good visual and that is all poor story telling no logic nothing make much sense
Feb 3 2019,negative,it was terrible not a star wars movie
Feb 2 2019,negative,this was quite possibly the biggest disappointment of my life i put myself through the horror of watching it twice just so i could be sure i wasnt being overly melodramatic     tfas second half comes off looking better after this clusterfck i will not deny that it has impressive visuals and with the exception of the space battle the visual direction is more than competent that probably deserves more than a halfstar but i find it impossible to do so     i swear even the entire ridiculous plot i could ignore not to mention the blatant sexism against the new female characters by showing them off as failures holdo rose even leia anyone or unrealistic expectations put on women by the sheer existence of rey yes even the blatant abuse finn and poe suffer but the character assassination of luke skywalker is not something that can be ignored the guy who sees good in darth vader mass murderer would kill his own nephew because he sensed darkness in him please     my hatred knows no bounds for the idiots who let abrams and johnson blunder into such a forest fire that turned every achievement of the original trilogy to ashes i cant believe this received so many good reviews from critics and i am further disgusted after having read some of them
Feb 2 2019,positive,the last jedi is a fantastic movie that grapples with the implications behind the ideologies and moral questions of the star wars universe in a way that i found very compelling granted it does not have the worldbuilding charm of many of the other movies but from a narrative and charactercentered perspective i thought it was a wonderful film that at turns challenged and reconfirmed the spirit of preceding star wars films
Feb 2 2019,negative,the sole goal of this movie was to not be a star wars movie and they fully succeeded  there is no continuity with the rest of the franchise and they just make up new force powers and physics to make it fit a mindless and pc plot  while it is ok to watch the first time as soon as you put any thought into the why that anyone did anything in this movie it completely falls apart  on the plus side it makes episode 3 look awesome in comparison
Feb 2 2019,negative,this movie is a feminist dream come true to much liberal political correctness i will no longer support this franchise maybe taking  away from disney will wake them up and realize the pc movies are not the way to go
Feb 2 2019,negative,this film really left me boring almost falling asleep and disappointing i can see why mark hamill did not like the movie  and script in the first place and i believe him the sub plot made no sense whatsoever and it was like all for nothing special i even hear the crowd chant boring which is not good and they walked out in the middle of the theater every scene is oversaturated with this comedy humor that lacks the plot and characters its so mind boggling the filmmakers didnt even bother to look up expanding universe star wars books which in my take alot better and just scratch off with pile of wacky crap the not good supporting characters especially the lady with a weird purple hair which cause some more heat this is the first star wars movie that let me down and walk away i could give this a zero star if i want to just to show how awful this movie is but ill leave a half star just to show how much effort they put in for all the wrong reasons
Feb 2 2019,positive,absolutely loved this movie
Feb 1 2019,negative,full of so much mindboggling plot holes and boring scenes it its kinda crazy
Feb 1 2019,negative,change of spirit or lack of it  characters are lacking personalities and social behaviour logic which turns this show into a crowed pleaser versus a art piece but it fails there is lack of vision  it ls very apparent that this was made purely for money
Feb 1 2019,negative,it has great visual effects thats all it did right
Feb 1 2019,negative,the five star reviews are the fake reviews imo    ix needs to explain why rey was so strong with the force with no training she needs to be palpatines granddaughter darth mauls daughter or lukeï 12tms or something cool still inside the star wars universe    leia needs to have been trained by luke with a ï 12pass on what you have learnedyodaï 12â flashback a ï 12sistervaderï 12â ï 12nooolukeï 12â flashback make leia god for all i care give luke and yoda credit for it have leia pass it to rey then die  chewy and lando need to return and be friends and bad asses  poe needs to lead also and finn has to not be running away  kylo is not a scary enough bad guy  neeed more story more planets more intergalactic politics an organa family young politician a descendant of samuel l who is maz etc
Feb 1 2019,negative,im very disappointed in this movie wasnt a big fan of tfa the half star is earned for their poor handling of the ot characters no respect for them or the fans in fact it was a big middle finger i will not be giving disney or lucas films anymore money yes im a 27 year old white man deal with it
Feb 1 2019,negative,this movie was an abomination to everything that makes star wars great rei is a worse mary sue than even westly crusher luke was basically ripped to shreads by the writers purple haired general was stupid they just threw away snoke and how they just trashed admiral akbar was disgraceful i could go on and on about how bad this movie was but i think ive said enough
Feb 1 2019,negative,starts off good but as movie goes lots of useless fill time and collapse of story and utter disappointment
Feb 1 2019,negative,this movie made me extremely sad star wars is a a saga that has built up a unique and interesting universe over the last decades and it was all destroyed in this movie the story made no sense characters were idiotic and uninteresting and the decisions made in this film completely destroyed pre existing possible plot lines set by previous films the actorsactresses in this film are not at fault only the people in charge of directing this movie they made a movie that was disappointing and made no sense rather than a movie that would be in peoples memories for a long long time i will not watch any future films nor will i purchase any further merchandise thanks to this movie do not watch
Feb 1 2019,negative,good great visuals and sound    bad horrible storytelling and editing with too many moments of cringe and bad humour  it almost as if the concept of being the middle part of a trilogy was thrown out  too many universebreaking elements and a mary sue character is confirmed not explained at the end viewers are not left with the desire to find out how the trilogy will end   ugly its suspicious that a real movie critic with any integrity could rate this movie as better than average  the fact that russian bots were blamed for the significant disparity between the critic and audience scores indicates that there is some manipulation of facts and reality
Feb 1 2019,positive,very very modern way of storytelling surprised every scenes
Feb 1 2019,negative,well dare i say the critics are clueless and disconnected from the fan base this move really deserves a half a star but the rt scoring algorithm wont count a half star in so many ways an honest assessment of this move can be summed up  as what a piece of junk  unfortunately i cant get this 2 hours of my life back that i spent watching this steaming turd hoping it would get better and have some kind of payoff
Feb 1 2019,negative,absolute disgrace to the series one of the worst films ive ever seen i walked out 12 way through
Feb 1 2019,negative,going in i was aware that critics have been busy dismissing many bad reviews as being all about a bunch of toxic fan boys and nostalgia junkies read the fans who watch your movie ripping apart a film because they didnt agree with where the film went boy were the critics wrong    though this film has some of the most spectacular effects and effective presentation of visual ideas i have seen in a star wars film it is a total disappointment in the writing department and it comes off as a rolling series of disjointed action sequences with very little thought in character development the film feels devoid of any attempt to stick to continuity of story line established lore or keeping true to the struggles growth and strengths of any character that came before it even the main characters of the new trilogy pack that in with poorly executed fight choreography where enemy knives disappear if this was a game my controller would have hit the wall and nonsensical character motivations to draw them ineptly from action scene to action scene and you have a beautifully entertaining shell with no candy inside    this movie is working to get us to trade in the strong story of the human struggle which we know and love for a henpecking narrative on current societal struggle to get us to give up the intrinsic idea of basic human heroism by rebranding it as some carefully crafted narrative about the inherent iniquity of current societal norms and by this corroding the conviction that no one is truly evil for a fickle punch list of ideological wrongs to identify evil and that facing your fears with grit and tenacity isnt as worthwhile as belittling your opposition and mocking those who engage in what you find as ideologically wrong though these seem to be the main lessons of today in general it is inexcusable in whatever narrative it is found and more sadly where there is a history of so much more subtle substance    we can say whatever we want about the previous films and the subversion of expectation that somehow is supposed to redeem this heap of trash but the intrinsic human struggle that the original trilogy of films spoke to our souls with is not here this is a film that whines and bickers about surface social norms not the human condition and i frankly refuse to listen to the unending stream of insufferably matronly tisktisks this movie tosses about in place of the sage and timeless bits of advice to humanity in general its precedent movies are loved and quoted for for over 40 years    the last jedi is either story telling at its most sadly inept and superficial sequel making at its most wantonly destructive or a premeditated dismantling of an intellectual property at its most deplorable but likely all three i just cant buy the main story line at all unless rey is the dark side embodied    the whizbang is pretty though good going special effect artists
Feb 1 2019,negative,a critically overrated social justice warrior movie with uninteresting characters and a mary sue as a protagonist this movie manages to crap all over the previous film and be spectacularly boring
Jan 31 2019,negative,there are several scenes that are visually attractive as well as some admirable performances on the part of the actors who were handed an exhaustive script that said the bad fat outweighs the good here the openening scene dealt the audience a poorly excecuted and outofplace ï 12yo mommaï 12â joke that completely deflated any tension or suspsense the plot is swiss cheese requiring the audience to write the script in their heads in order to make any sense of what progression is attempting to take place agendas aside there seems to be little character development taking place the plot doesnï 12tmt make much sense and the movie ran about 30 minutes longer than it probably should have this could go on for days but iï 12tmll end by saying that the legacy characters present in this movie were arguably disrespected to the point of disbelief if i could erase the imagine of green seawalrus tittie milk dripping from luke skywalkerï 12tms chin i would be forever grateful thank you mr johnson i was expecting a decent movie and my expectations were certainly subverted
Jan 31 2019,negative,it was like a parody movie but funnier
Jan 31 2019,positive,what the heck happened to leia why does she have a lightsaber and a beard is she a ghost now i really hope shes a ghost so she can talk with the goblin thing more    i really liked main charector girl and main charector boy i hope they get together but evil main charector boy might marry main girl xdxd     be prepared for a lot of plot points that dont make sense and a story that goes nowhere55 stars
Jan 31 2019,negative,i guess disney didnt have enough money left over to spend on creativity after they bought the franchise from george lucas  it may have not totally sucked if they would have at least left the political correctness out of it though
Jan 31 2019,positive,a 45 rating of this movie is insane 91 the critical rating is far closer to reality political hackery at its finest
Jan 31 2019,negative,the visuals are the only thing slightly redeemable in this film a carbon copy of the originals in a corporate cash grab possibly the worst film in this trilogy of money grubbing sequels the lazy writing fanbait and political undertones its not subdued in the slightest all combine to make a movie that can ruin an entire series well done disney youve manage to ruin millions of childhoods with 300 million dollars and corporate pandering
Jan 31 2019,negative,there was a lot i liked and a lot that i didnâtmt it still feels to similar to the originals as soon as i started to like the changes in direction the movie was taking i felt it suddenly gave up and went back to square one at the very least the movie ends in such a way that they wonâtmt be able to keep rehashing the original trilogy
Jan 31 2019,negative,seen it wish i had hadnt when graphics are the only thing you can compliment you have a problem dont get me wrong the actors did their jobs but the writers eproducers and directors need to be taken in the night tied to a chair and forced to watch the original movies because clearly they have not because if they had they wouldve understood all the evil they were doing to thier own franchise i personally will never see another star wars movie as long as disney has control or that was directed by a child who was such a lame as a kid heshe never even seen star wars himher self smh pure trash
Jan 31 2019,negative,it destroys sw its an inconsistent movie finn saying hyperspace is not possible and 2 minutes later knows all the details of it the chase is absurd and boring the first order shouldnt have any problems sending more fleets just in front of them to cath them also they dont have faster ships any civilian ship can outrun the first order if they dont have that tracker thingy a dumb thing also in the ot theres tracking its stupid that they only send 4 fighters to fight the rebelresistancethey keep changing the name in the movie they dont have more fighters in their 20 cruisers even in the ot we saw more fighters luke character is destroyed every plot opened in tfa is eliminated in the most absurd waysthe new sjw admiral behaves like and idiot not telling anyone the plan for no reason even when a mutiny takes placeyou take poe and tell him hes no damm spy he just destroyed starkiller base you moron also if theres a spy the plan wouldnt work anyway they treat poe like a reckless idiot but he actually makes all the good calls hes demoted for destroying a ship that wouldve kill them all they make husk a jokewhere are military leaders like tarkin all the movie is full with stupid jokes in the worst possible timing every serious situation has a stupid joke to ruin it rey is more a mary sue than ever using force powers like nothing defeating luke fighting elite guards after one day training by herself against a rockalso the worst fight in all the movies no reason for itwhat are the guards doing attacking kylo is not their new boss full of mistakes guards flipping and exposing their backs to the enemy guards aiming to the air or the weapons instead of attacking the exposed heads of kylo and rey weapons than dissapear no force powers being useda joke and its the best part of the movie sadly canto bight just a waste of time the plot about selling weapons is also absurd it doesnt make much sense that the rebels and the first order got different weapons from the same buyer also makes more sense that they create their own weapons specially the first order they have the most advanced weaponary in the galaxy that should come from their own id no from buyers does the buyers sell death stars also tfo can create death stars and not fighters theres nothing to save in this movie but the visuals and acting of some characters not worth spending more money on sw ever again or at least until they say this movie never happened and make something coherent at least im not even asking for good anymore
Jan 31 2019,negative,so disappointed by this film the first time i watched it i couldnt even watch it a second time further than the uninspiring intro bomber run such a waste all those setups and questions that the first film threw at us what happened
Jan 31 2019,negative,horrible poorly conceived movie that disrespects the entire saga with an unpalpable plot and saltless characters performances all of that allied to an unlikely inorganic comeout that fails to surprise the smallest child in the audience much less a sw franchise fan that makes one wonder how much money disney payed rt or how credible are their critics to give a 91 percent rate on this johnsons poop garbage
Jan 30 2019,negative,my god that movie was everything but not star wars
Jan 30 2019,negative,thanks for ruining star wars rian c unt isnt a strong enough word
Jan 30 2019,negative,at the first watch of this movie i thought to myself well they cant mess this up that badly i was wrong the first order comes back again being the copy my homework but make sure you change it slightly type deal the empire built to keep the universe under its boot and scared is not the same as reconquer the galaxy the resistance named prior to the first orders existence no idea what or who they were resisting prior not evolving their technology or tactics the entire movie seems to revolve around no one telling anyone anything leading to the plan that was pretty sound to be stupid because the main leader no one even knew who she was didnt want to tell the most trusted people luke being discovered the mystery that i wanted to know just led to the worst part of this movie he was hiding because he was done what the luke whos this terminator built face changing body snatching person thats here cause that aint luke but just to sum my main issues up 1 the character designs took a 180 with everyone that people couldve loved and turned them into mush and they killed off all of the characters 2 the plot was stupid and the decisions was something that could have been to the tune of benny hill theme with everyone running around with their heads off 3 everyone was celebrating at the end of the film theres maybe 30 of you youre kinda screwed maybe you should kinda look like it4 the throne room fight scene if you dont know why youtube it
Jan 30 2019,positive,itï 12 12 12tms a really good and enjoyable movie with amazing set pieces
Jan 30 2019,negative,i can never forgive this one it ruined a franchise ive been following since i was 12 years old i probably enjoyed about 70 percent of the film but so hated the other 30 percent that it completely destroyed the experience the entire canto bight sequence  about 20 percent of the movie  could have been cut out and you never would have known the difference since the movie is about 40 minutes too long anyway this would have been a drastic improvement and what was done with luke skywalkers character was truly tragic a poorly written and poorly thoughtout movie with consequences for the franchise that are already playing out with fans ignoring franchise followups
Jan 30 2019,negative,great movie for people that hate star wars movies and dont understand star wars history or logic in general  there is a space walrus green milk scene where star wars officially died for me
Jan 30 2019,negative,made me want to walk out of the theater
Jan 30 2019,negative,goofy humor completely despondent luke huge plot holes mary poppins leia this star wars movie sucked   btw the choreography for snokes chamber lightsaber battle is almost laughable
Jan 30 2019,neutral,i must say this is a big mess i have been a star wars fan all my life as i was born in 72 hehe so i can not stan behind this crap the storytelling is realy bad the logic of things is to magic bombs in space he could have done this on a planet of some sort and pulled it off the death of fin witch would have made sens was gimped as well  well all climaxes of the movie are uterly bs the jedi part an no laser swords wtf too bad to see that this is the shit the new young directors are pulling out of there asses shame on you
Jan 30 2019,negative,in the context of the previous two trilogies this felt like it was more than subverting expectations it felt like it was deconstructing established lore without building something new to replace it a demolition job  i think expecting a movie to continue the story of its seven predecessors in  an additive process is a reasonable expectation and shouldnâtmt be subverted
Jan 29 2019,negative,genuinely bad destroyed beloved characters and replaced them with unlikable uninteresting ripoffs
Jan 29 2019,positive,best star wars movie since empire strikes back and arguably the best performance of mark hamills career could have done without the time spent on a few of the subplots or jar jar binksesque humor from time to time but entertaining nonetheless im glad rian johnson didnt play it safe and recycle old star wars plots like abrams did with the force awakens force awakens is very enjoyable too but not nearly as profound as johnsons take give it a decade and the fanboys will realize the greatness of johnsons vision
Jan 29 2019,negative,bad written characters and story also dismissing everything that abrams set up in force awakens was destroyed in this movie made me not liking the movie it was watchable action flick but for a star wars movie it was big disappointment
Jan 29 2019,positive,there were definitely some slow spots in the movie but i think the controversial ending made up for it i was pretty satisfied with luke as well but i understand why some people were not i think the decision was made to have him act grumpy was because that just like yoda and obiwan luke had someone turn on him in the original movies luke had to convince them that they needed to keep trying and giving up is not the right option i think that it was an attempt to make the story go full circle by having rey trying to convince luke frankly i am fine with this their was also a unexpected death in this movie a lot people say its was unforfilling but ive always believed that this is how star wars is if you do like the idea of there being something unexpectedly shocking that greatly changes the outcome of the movie then star wars isnt for you this franchise has been around since 1977 i would think that we would all be prepared for it now overall i liked the movie and can not wait to see the next one
Jan 29 2019,negative,horrible disrespectful uninformed so bad is kinda of sad waste of money and time however it was beautifully shot the last jedi is the destruction of a lore that has in a way shaped or at least inspired a generation rian hates star wars and he made it very clear and anyone who disagree with what he has done is a racist sexist toxic fan or a bot but like simon pegg said and everyone behind this movie that literally makes a living from trying  to make their art and characters matter to the audience in order to make money is just a fcking film and none of it matters
Jan 29 2019,positive,star wars the last jedi was more entertaining than star wars the force awakens i did not want anything more than to see luke skywalker mark hamill return to the star wars franchise
Jan 29 2019,negative,the film that killed star wars for me  boring terrible and full of plot holes  aweful movie
Jan 29 2019,negative,while visually spectacular and beautiful the last jedis weak story and characters are a huge step back after rogue one
Jan 28 2019,negative,just awful really a miscarriage of cinema
Jan 28 2019,negative,the film was boring and the characters were not memorable i was confused by the casino sequence which led to a random del toro bit part that meant nothing seriously though who really wants to watch a show chase in space ooh but theyre going really fast with curving lasers for 2 damn hours the last battle with those useless ships was one of the dumbest scenes i have ever seen  what the hell was the point of the movie  what the snoke  nothing makes any sense anymore
Jan 28 2019,negative,this movie buried star wars once and for all
Jan 28 2019,negative,pretty much killed star wars for me
Jan 28 2019,negative,completely awful i understand trying something new but dont throw out the baby with the bathwater
Jan 28 2019,negative,one of the worst starwars movies ive ever seen  full if idiotic plot holes characters doing unexplained things no major story line to follow  in fact they went above and beyond to destroy any possible plot line only to make sure we get they are so woke and progressive  problem is they pretty much broke every rule in the star wars universe in this movie so i totally lost interest in this entire franchise after this    and no i dont have a problem with the female cast  i actually liked the force awakens and had high hopes for this one only to be hugely disappointed    by the way  i used tomatocalc to get all reviews and calculate the real audience score its says 45 on the site but only 12 of reviews are 35 stars or above    so its actually more like audience score of 12 not sure why rotten tomato is messing with the audience score nubmers
Jan 28 2019,negative,a script with too many obvious stupid plot holes and dead end stories itâtms painful to watch the otherwise excellent cast soil their careers to try and give this script life
Jan 28 2019,negative,one of the most mind numbing movies ive ever seen it seemed like a sw movie made by someone who hates sw actually makes the prequels look good
Jan 28 2019,negative,this is just sad not star wars everything is packed up with human race integration and female power no jedi no plot just so sad
Jan 27 2019,negative,the last jedi is beyond a bad movie out of all the ways they could have made  a bad star wars movie they managed to make one that kills everything that was ever cool about star wars    it is as if they intentionally made every scene to break immersion    i look forward to see the full damage this movie has done to one of cinemas biggrst franchise when ep9 comes out   i wont be watching the movie   i will be looking at how it will bomb art the box office
Jan 27 2019,negative,how on earth this this horrible mess of a movie get 91 fresh are they letting 10 year olds with no concept of the entire star wars universe write their reviews this is by far the worst star wars movie ever and that is saying something
Jan 27 2019,negative,not as bad as attack of the clones but very close  disney continues to ruin characters from the original trilogy to try and build up the new cast and it doesnt work  the casino planet scene is plain awful and the finn and rose storyline is a waste of time  too much girl power and a mediocre performance from adam driver  bottom line the new cast isnt able to carry this franchise
Jan 27 2019,negative,disappointing how does rey with no jedi training beat kylo someone trained to fight with a lightsaber since he was young it makes no sense and snoke the supposed evil mastermind behind it all was killed off in the most pathetic way possible rey  finn with barely any training have bested all their battle hardened foes several times already whats left for the last movie
Jan 27 2019,negative,think it has all been said about this movie already made me sell off my sw collection
Jan 26 2019,negative,absolutely horrendous destroyed what little faith i had left in the new star wars trilogy possibly living up to the lifetime of joy i have experienced from previous stories in films  other mediums a complete cinematic failure with no logical planning for the characters or plot leading to completely incoherent storytelling that had no basis on the preceding film all while spitting in its fanbases or anyone with a modicum of intelligence face  if you love star wars yet have somehow been supremely fortunate enough not to have seen this movie then please for the love of whichever deity you pray to do not watch this movie it will destroy the franchise for you  if youre like me  have already been stabbed in the back by disney  had your heart broken by your favorite franchise then the only potential solution is to henceforth discount all disney produced star wars content as merely fanfiction drivel with nice special effects ie not canon
Jan 26 2019,negative,really critics  90 approval  pfff wow  i mean if you liked it then whatever but 90  at the end of the day its a terrible movie which is so obsessed with subverting expectations that it completely derails the trilogy  the story is dumbboringpointless with a whole section in the middle that goes absolutely nowhere and adds nothing to the plot  the characters we are supposed to be rooting for do things that are frustratingly stupidunlikable  the only good parts of the movie are with rey and kylo but even that plot line falls flat by the end of the movie so  90
Jan 26 2019,negative,a middle finger raised from disney  a movie with no direction a bad fanfic that killed the characters written for the previous movie and replaced them with emotionless robots that are good in everything that in the last movie were wrong theres no tension and is a movie written for 2 years old 10iq children
Jan 26 2019,negative,i hope the last jedi is the last movie dont they look at these movies before they release them
Jan 26 2019,negative,what was this movie theres no logic theres no gravity in space everyone was basically made into a fool than character buildup fight me rian but this was not a star wars movie more or less its kind of like a spaceballs movie gone political the only good thing about this movie was that it was beautifully shot thats why i didnt look at my phone throughout the duration of the film
Jan 26 2019,negative,the only truly awful star wars movie ever made it would take a 20 page essay to go over all the problems so just go watch reviews on youtube instead of this movie im mainly just really sad for jj abrams personal tragedy tore him away from his trilogy which had some real potential instead rian johnson threw away whatever plans abrams made and along with kathleen kennedy ruined whatever hope there was for this trilogy add in some frivolous writing they succesfully achieve their goal of subverting expectations by spitting on established lore and beloved characters but disney made their money and the people responsible for this mess still have their jobs so i guess what we can take away from this is that disney doesnt care what anyone thinks as long as they make their money
Jan 26 2019,positive,great entertainment value but just doesnt fit into the star wars canon
Jan 26 2019,negative,never pay to watch another star wars movie will wait until they are free on sky a truly terrible film that sticks its middle finger up to what star wars once was
Jan 26 2019,negative,im a hard core fan of sw ive been going to watch the movies since empire strikes back this is by far the worst movie since episode 7 disney buying the franchise is the worst that could happen plot holes every where terrible acting the director doesnt know what sw is about or the mechanics of this world dont waste your time watching this youll end up regretting it and extremely pissed off better get a copy truce at bakura or courtship of princess leia youll fall in love with sw all over again
Jan 26 2019,positive,oh boy the movie everyone thinks sucks because a character had pink hair     the casino scene is visually amazing and criticizes selling wmds thats not political its common sense you absolute crybabies    i have only managed to like this more and more upon viewing seethe luke and yoda is an incredible scene kylo and rey work the throne room was sick escaping the casino was sick f the rich honestly this movie is not as bad as the casual cry baby rightie whities are making it to be rise of skywalker is 10000000x worse rian took a risk and this film will always be adored by me regardless of what the crybabies say     oh but luke isnt the same exact person from 30 years ago wahhhh    grow up 7 and 8 were a great time to be alive and not a crybaby
Jan 26 2019,negative,wow was this movie boring holy cowno pay off at all and the so called critics gave this movie a 91 they are selling all their credibility for what exactly episode 9 will be just as big of a failure as solo
Jan 26 2019,positive,this movie wasnt perfect but it played very smart on the viewers expectations and everything whit kylo ren and rey was just amazing
Jan 25 2019,positive,i listened to people complain about this movie for a year after watching it 3 or 4 times  i seriously began to consider all of the complaints about the movie and figured maybe the movie was not as good as i remembered  then i watched it again  i tried to dislike it and i couldnï 12tmt  sure there are parts that i was unhappy with but i find myself filled with joy after every viewing of this movie  there was some great character development visually stunning scenes unexpected turns and fun action  i love star wars and the fact that it didnï 12tmt go where i expected makes it feel more real
Jan 25 2019,negative,absolute garbage  critic score 91  i smell some dirty money  really though terrible writing pointless plot arcs and pointless characters the movie builds you up thinking something is important and then suddenly shows everything they had been building up is meaningless  rey has yet to face a real challenge the whole movie  also the political statements are obvious and poorly executed to the point of being sickening  ive spent time in the military and holdo is about the shittiest commanding officer you could ask for  i wont be visiting the theater for any more star wars movies until they fix the franchise
Jan 25 2019,negative,plot holes and cliches that are allowed to exist while serving no dramatic effect the force given no respect not earned not learned not taught life lessons of the first trilogy thrown out the door female characters that caricature power and feel flat like the rpg character an adolescent makes the first time male characters that caricature awkwardness in life with none of the humour or life lessons but all of the shame there is no lesson here that makes a better world or provides the intelligent geekdom of the world any relatable material i miss the never tell me the odds and do or do not moments  amazing that what felt like popcorn and a pleasure ride so many years ago now feels like wisdom when held against this travesty of our star wars universe
Jan 25 2019,negative,quite possibly the worst movie ever made why oh i dont know how about the mere fact its pure sjw feminist crap seriously like we need another movie pushing purple hair beta male women can do anything men can do so lets make all the officers women pilots and heroes women and all the men arrogant mean feminine beta males why not call this star wars the first feminist sorry but if you like this movie and youre a male you are the most spineless beta male in the world and need your man card pulled immediately while youre at it check your testosterone levels this movie is gi jane new ghost busters on steroids
Jan 25 2019,negative,my disappointment is that i cant select 0 stars and have to choose 12 stars
Jan 25 2019,negative,ryan johnson maybe a good director but he is an awful storyteller
Jan 25 2019,negative,this movie is a parody of the whole saga
Jan 25 2019,negative,i made this account to add my 2 cents on this film and the direction it has put star wars in  at this point we all know solo tanked at the box office because of the failure that was episode viii  rian johnson has at least mortally wounded star wars it was already in poor health due to the prequels and rian nearly killed this franchise my favorite franchise  disneys many employees have called the true fans many names labeled us overweight white males racists sexists russian bots you name it but were just fans watching star wars die like obiwan watching as qui gon is slain in front of him unable to do anything  but all we ask is that these movies be made of quality without ruining the characters like they brutally ruined luke skywalker the main original character that weve known and loved for 4 decades  all we want is care put into a vision the fits with the original trilogy that continued that that respected the lore of this amazing universe the rules that apply to it and the general feel of it the creativity of it  the worst part is that carrie is gone  this trilogy was the last chance to get the 3 main original characters back together but instead they killed han solo in the first one then they go and kill luke skywalker but he commits suicide via astral projectioni dont eveni justive had this conversation so many times seen too many dozens of videos of people pointing out the exact same obvious and major flaws within the movie in literally every sceneim not going to sit here and type 50 pages about it all most of you know all of this already  what is important is that everyone knows that your money is your vote  i didnt see this movie until it was dumped onto netflix like some broken unwanted thing i never gave it a penny nor did i go to see solo  i almost walked out of the theater during force awakens because of rey just automatically being able to resist and then reverse sith interrogation techniques learning the jedi mind trick and learning how to command the force well enough to grab a lightsaber while a trained force user is already retrieving it the same way among many other stupid and wrong things in the film but the last jedi is and i say this as a hardcore knowledgeable fan the worst star wars movie ever made  the 3rd film can only be garbage at this point  dont waste your money theyll throw it on netflix like they did with this film only episodic star wars movie to be thrown on netflix for a reason and rogue one not a terrible movie actually and solo utter garbage and only star wars film in history to lose money  star wars is on life support but disney is thriving as always  they dont care about this franchise they will milk it and dump its carcass then just continue to make money off their new star wars theme park and find other ways to ride of the tail of the original trilogy  boycott disneys star wars until it is in better hands whether they sell off the rights or fire kathleen kennedy and dont allow rian johnson anywhere near any and all star wars productions  boycott this garbage trilogy dont buy the tickets dont buy the dvds or the blurays the toy sales are already way down so go ahead and get yaself some star wars legos if ya really want  these movies dont produce good toys though which is why the sales are way down
Jan 24 2019,negative,rian did nothing but screw up the new trilogy that jj set up as a stand alone movie it would be an okay but the fact it is apart of a universe just doesnt fit
Jan 24 2019,negative,the weakness of the script is evident after a few minutes shouldve been more respectful to originals
Jan 24 2019,negative,as a star wars movie this was terrible canon destroying in many ways  not much better as a stand alone movie too much of the narrative just didnt make sense spent too much time clumsily force feeding politics to me which constantly jarred me out of the story   visually stunning across the piece earns 1 star back
Jan 24 2019,negative,my biggest problem with this movie is that it didnâtmt feel like a star wars movie i felt like it was a marvel movie wearing a star wars costume thereâtms a bunch of bad humor the characters arenâtmt developed well and i thought the plot was pretty dumb additionally thereâtms a bunch of 2017 political themes forced into the film which is something i donâtmt want to see in a galaxy far far away all in all i had to watch it because itâtms a star wars movie but this movie will never merit a rewatch which is something i never thought iâtmd say about a star wars movie
Jan 24 2019,negative,terrible storyline weak characters
Jan 24 2019,negative,just bad charactizetion and stupid jokes in serium frenchizes
Jan 24 2019,negative,utterly destroyed all story elements from the force awakens and then proceeded to retcon every beloved character as a sequel to the original thrilogy this is where all continuity ends
Jan 24 2019,negative,ive never hated a movie enough to waste time rating it this movie is that bad i would explain but there are many who have already articulated it far better than i could in a short paragraph if possible i would give it negative stars and a bullet in the back of the head to put it out of its misery
Jan 24 2019,negative,a film that falls apart from the opening scene fails to deliver anything new and destroys the characters fans has spent years falling in love with
Jan 24 2019,negative,watched it using boxxy software app visually stunning but a terrible plot and even more pointless side plot rian johnson seemed more interested in upsetting expectations of the audience than in the story of the characters of this film i think this might be least favorite star wars film of them all
Jan 23 2019,negative,disgustingly horrible mess of a movie designed to betray luke skywalker and all precedence of the force and history of original trilogy characters director rian johonson should feel ashamed of himself for this shameful piece of cinematic filth
Jan 23 2019,negative,a mockery of what star wars was and could be
Jan 23 2019,negative,how can movie that failed to work within the star wars lore get 91 rating  i didnt see solo   im a life long fan   it turned me off star wars   tfa has hole and set upas a fan ill give a lot  this movie just made more plot holes until it was broken   i have no idea how was made   it painful to think about  the only good point was it looked great   no story no love from me
Jan 23 2019,negative,visually good but the story is ridiculous and is one long incredibly slow chase scene characters are not respected rian johnson is so focused on expectation subversion that he forgot to make a good movie and tore down everything jj abrams set up in the force awakens
Jan 23 2019,negative,the worst star wars movie ever
Jan 23 2019,negative,worst star wars movie there is i would rather watch aotc i am looking forward to see ivan ortegas edit though he might be able to make it a decent film by the looks of it
Jan 23 2019,negative,this fucking shit shit fucking dog turd shit at now point was i entertained by the dumpster fire which has become star wars final rating 12 shit out of 5 shits
Jan 23 2019,negative,this probably has to be the worst star wars movie ever
Jan 23 2019,positive,this movie was another good but not great installment in the franchise where the force awakens failed in giving the audience a unique  sw experience the last jedi thrives in this area while the positives and negatives for both movies in the new trilogy mirror each other the last jedi excites this movie goer because of its audacity and bold character choices while the direction doesnt necessarily mesh well with the previous episode it takes the series in an exciting new direction where anyone can be a jedi just how it felt in 1979
Jan 23 2019,positive,while many hardcore fans decried the movie i thought it was a great entry in the star wars saga the action sequences and story were phenomenal while like every movie there were a couple of what moments i enjoyed it the same people that are mad about last jedi now likely were just as mad when empire came out
Jan 23 2019,negative,absolute joke doesnt deserve even for a half star this should be a guide for others how not to make a movie complete misunderstanding
Jan 22 2019,negative,couldnt watch past the your mom joke i see nothing that honors my most beloved childhood heroes
Jan 22 2019,negative,one of the most important elements of a film within a trilogy and more importantly a saga is the acknowledgment of previous films and characters that came before it this film not only subverts the characters that have been developed and understood over decades but even worse  it completely subverts the film that came before it within the same trilogy all questions of plot and character development that were set up in the previous film were either ignored unanswered or contradicted    as a stand alone film this would be somewhat understandable despite the unnecessary plot diversions canto bight scenes but thats exactly where this film fails it is not a stand alone film and should not have been treated as such by the director the weaponising of hyperspace is one example that completely undermines all logic of previous space battles and dangerously challenges the existing understanding of how the star wars universe works on multiple levels there are also many examples where important characters were discarded into subplots andor narratively mistreated in comparison to their representation in previous films luke snoke fin chewbacca leia yoda admiral akbar and phasma to name a few of these sadly luke was the most contradicted character    aside from all this  the cinematography was great sound design excellent as always vfx and sfx were very good as you would expect from a large budget film the location settings were interesting visually but somewhat unimaginative in comparison to previous star wars films     it breaks my heart to see such a beloved franchise treated this way by a director who clearly had little care for the star wars universe and the worst part is that the overseers at disney let this movie into cinemas for such a large organisation im surprised by the extreme lack of quality control by disney im sure they will recover from this and that important lessons have been learned so im not worried about the franchise overall however i do hope that future star wars films are written and produced with more thought and care
Jan 22 2019,negative,finn they are tracking us through hyperspace impossible    also finn i know where the hyperspace tracker is i was a janitor on this ship    this and many more inconsistencies make this movie an absolute mess why does snoke release reys handcuffs when kylo is only supposed to kill her the emperor wanted luke and vader to fight at least    i am just reaaally tired of listing up all of these things every time somebody says its star wars how can you hate it its art  its not its awful and i am done with it  episode ix can count me out    the inhumanity of the characters the lack of grief mourning reflection compassion the character reversals the unclear and shifting motivations of people like finn the absurd power growth from rey the awkward dialog and relationship with luke the surprise introduction of tracking technology and holdotechnology from nowhere    yeah the worst argument for shitty art is but its for kids    there are lots of great kids books films etc that are wellwritten and enjoyable the only excuse for shitty storytelling is intentional schlock anything else is just plain incompetence
Jan 22 2019,negative,this movie ruined star wars
Jan 22 2019,negative,terrible not a child friendly movie
Jan 22 2019,negative,crazy storyline destruction of all sw previous movies and total lore  they have no meaning as we see here  we must drop anything jedi the force the physics the characters the history etc so this is no star wars  this is like animated video story for kids on sunday morning and then they switch to benten
Jan 22 2019,negative,worst star wars movie its not even 05 stars its 0 stars
Jan 22 2019,negative,disney should be able to do better rouge one was so good the director choice must have been crap
Jan 21 2019,negative,not the best film i have ever seen could do so much better very disappointed
Jan 21 2019,negative,ive been a long time star wars fan after rewatching it over and over i still say to myself this is a really bad movie
Jan 21 2019,negative,this movie was all over the place plot had no clear direction it felt like a propaganda movie
Jan 21 2019,positive,i dont understand why everyone thinks this movie is terrible its fine its a star wars movie its fine space battleslight sabersforceinteresting characters etc there are interesting choices in this movie and things that happen that are unexpected things hardcore fans wont like but if everything happened the exact way you thought than it would be predictable which would be even worse this movie is pretty unpredictable ill give it that  45
Jan 21 2019,negative,sad excuse for a once stellar series
Jan 21 2019,negative,this is not star wars  this is a mess  the critics that scored this 91 must have been bought and paid for because this movie sucks
Jan 21 2019,negative,really bad story scenes dialogue acting
Jan 21 2019,negative,full of plot holes and military mistakes that do not make sense   1 plot hole how did dj know about the cloaked ships yes he overhears poe telling fin and rose that the resistance is planning to abandon ship and loading the crew in the shuttle singular not plural this is what is actually said so how does he know they are cloaked or have multiple ships he has no way to know when the resistance is executing this plan nor does he have any way of knowing they are cloaked because it is never mentioned in his presence  2 military mistake why doesnt general hux order his ships to immediately attack poe why bother negotiating if its already been established that they are attempting to eliminate the resistance the first order had no problem destroying multiple planets in the last film so why now are they are willing to negotiate and spare a small fleet  3 military mistake general hux doesnt order the star destroyers to assist and protect the dreadnought from the bombers   4 plot hole when fin rose and poe leave to go on their mission they go into light speed and the first order doesnt notice this if smaller ships can go into light speed unnoticed and you have cloaking technology why not just send the crew onto the smaller ships and leave while the first order is distracted by the larger ships even if the first order is able to track the smaller ships which if so why didnt they notice when poe rose and fin left why not get on the smaller ships split up and jump to light speed in different locations they couldnt follow all of them effectively   5military mistake why doesnt the first order open fire on the resistance immediately after tracking them through hyperspace or why not send out huge amounts of tie fighters what they do instead is send 3 tie fighters to initiate the engagement why remember the old star wars films where dozens if not hundreds of dogfights occurred in the majority of space battles where are they in this film   6 military mistake rose saves fin rose decides to save fin in his suicide run on the ground cannon she defends this decision with the notion that you win by saving loved ones not killing those you hate or something like that but they lose anyway she does this which then leads to more resistance fighters dying in what is clearly just a selfish move to save fin because she likes him on top of all this rose had no way of knowing that crashing into fin wouldnt kill him making his death pointless   7 plot hole fin and rose somehow get from the ground right in front of the cannon to back inside the bunker on the salt planet how were they not spotted or fired upon fin literally just teleports to poes location the next time you see them with no explanation as to how he got there remember that the last time you see them rose passes out from her injuries the next scence she appears in she is still unconscious so wouldnt fin have to carry her     8 plot hole if light speed can be weaponized why hasnt anyone else ever done this im supposed to believe that this is the first time anyone ever thought of ramming a ship at light speed even if its a suicidal actionkamikaze attack it seems like someone should have used this action before   9 plot hole this is more of an issue of questionable morality but still presents the plot with issues fin and rose decide to rescue some animals while away on their mission to find the hacker this is an issue in the story they seemingly dont have time to park their ship in a legal or at least less conspicuous location but have time for a side mission they rescue the animals knowing or risking more resistance fighters being killed off while they do this they rescue animals instead of the slave children what the hell and from the looks of it these animals just ran off to a nearby field which unless the owners of these animals are incompetent can be easily tracked and recaptured so really the point of the side mission is to spite the animals owners and wreck the city doesnt rose save fin using the notion that you win by saving people not attacking what you hate so why the spiteful side mission  10 military mistake why doesnt holdo tell poe about her plan poe has been established as one of the remaining captains among the resistance yes he was previously demoted but still remains in a high ranking position and deserves to know the plan as much as anyone else is holdo not telling poe because she doesnt like him this is a ridiculous explanation withholding information for personal reasons is not something you do as a  vice admiral holdo also knows that poe is rash and likely to formulate courageous plans so why not tell him to avoid such measures
Jan 21 2019,negative,this movie literally shts on the entire franchise i used to think that the movie had some redeeming qualities like the throne fight scene until i saw the fight slowed down now i truly see what a cluster fuk this movie really is extremely saddened by this outcome of disneys star wars 
Jan 20 2019,negative,killed off every plotline left and almost every scene was useless or left the watcher sayingwhy why did anyone approve this  lukes scenes were ok otherwise skip or chug all the vokda in the house before watching
Jan 20 2019,negative,rian johnson destroyed the franchise he better hope i never see him out
Jan 20 2019,negative,simply awful force awakens and rogue one made me believe good star wars movies were possible again but this movie brought it all crashing down i boycotted solo just because of this film which is sad because iï 12tmve since seen solo on tv and itï 12tms a great film but emotions are trust in the franchise is hanging by a thread  from the very beginning with adrian edmundon casted as a officer in the first order the alarm bells started to ring then the stupid parody joke between poe and hux ending with a your mother joke made me think oh god this is going to be bad then thereâtms leia flying through space and luke tossing his lightsaber and generally being an annoying morose idiot and itâtms the only perfect mix for the all time worst stat wars movie  like many others iâtmm besotted by the films i grew up in the 70s and 80s and collected the toys and wore out many a vhs tape of a new hope such a shame shame on writer and directed and producer too
Jan 20 2019,negative,vote with your wallet people this will be the true measure at the end of the day i anticipate the next film will have empty cinemas that is my hope
Jan 20 2019,negative,this is how you destroy a beloved story
Jan 20 2019,negative,doesnï 12tmt know what it wants to be the characters are lacking and fail to hold a candle to the depth in characters of the previous 3 episodes
Jan 20 2019,negative,the last jedi is not only the worst star wars movie ever made destroying lore and beloved characters but it is also just a complete cinematic failure
Jan 20 2019,positive,spoilers this movie was pretty good i dont know why people hate it are they mad because luke dies its not as good as the force awakens but has some exciting moments lukes illusion at the end was epic and the escape from canto bight was dope adam driver is lame and awkward the asian girl is not as bad as everyone says i think they got mad because she took finn away from rey 
Jan 20 2019,positive,while it certainly had its problems last jedi flipped the script and burned established star wars norms good burn it all never look back
Jan 20 2019,negative,a bad bad movie between forced agendas bad character arcs haha not any more copy scene for scenes from original trilogy the hole fin and rose arc was literally the worstpointless part of the movie heroic  and beloved past characters die pointlessly while new boring and non developed characters can sacrifice them selfs to they may look more like heroï 12 12 12tms
Jan 20 2019,negative,whilst visually spectacular kudos to the effect crew and cinematographer this film patently ignores and throws away continuity set up in previous movies in favour of its own world building that it in turn repeatedly throws out of the window  id say air lock but apparently they work differently in in episode 8 to 1 through 7  truly bad film making
Jan 20 2019,negative,it had some good scenes but it didnt really live up to the potential it had and luke was just so stupid they chance things that werent even bad in the first place typical disney
Jan 20 2019,negative,nope its pathetic now
Jan 20 2019,negative,the worst star wars movie ive ever seen the interest fans were trying to pick up from jedi narrative all gown down the drain with how luke was portrayed not to mention all those sjws that piss the hell out when moviegoers need to invest in mythology once these movies were successful at pathetic 055
Jan 20 2019,negative,rian johnson for his pleasure chose the least pleasant way for any fan of the saga for this disappointing sequel in all points of view except cinematography the arc of the characters makes no sense and brings nothing more to their journeythe worst episode without a doubt
Jan 20 2019,negative,terrible abortion of a movie disney trolling the fans this isnï 12 12 12 12 12 12tmt canon and itï 12 12 12 12 12 12tms not taken seriously by any real star wars fans the fandom menace scuttled solo and the same fate awaits episode 9
Jan 19 2019,negative,princess leia flying through space while unconscious sums up the film
Jan 19 2019,negative,yuck worst star wars ever
Jan 19 2019,negative,really killed the franchise im not a bot or racist its plain and simple terrible script and story that disrespected the beloved characters and lore of star wars and destroyed everything that came before it  really ruined any hype i had for solo how on earth did this thing get approved no i didnt care for the story to go a certain way as they claim  this movie is pretty incredible in a way it single handedly destroys everything special about star wars and makes long time huge fans want to never see any future installments or buy any new merchandise solo clearly suffered as a result not a bad movie btw and episode 9 i have no idea how they could turn it around but im not excited for it because this film left nothing to look forward to 9 is probably dead on arrival disney you really screwed the pooch on this one a lot of people feel the same way and are pretty angry at how the pr responded about our outrage
Jan 19 2019,negative,awful writingvisually stunning
Jan 19 2019,negative,someone needs to retitle this the last straw because thats what it was when i got home from the theater i pulled all the star wars movies made after 1983 off my shelves ill enjoy the original trilogy and not waste any more money
Jan 19 2019,positive,one word to describe the last jedi and that word is disappointing after coming off the force awakens the film had lots of potential jj abrams set up the film perfectly as a star wars fan i was very upset and disappointed with the poor writing from director rian johnson i will give credit though the film is visually stunning to watch
Jan 19 2019,negative,the horrible choreography and ludicrously forced comedy aside this film proves how disconnected this director is with the star wars universe
Jan 19 2019,negative,take everything you love about star wars then chuck it out the window with this movie oh you like luke and his never give up attitude too bad he is a grumpy old man that gave up on everyone and goes out like a pussy do you like all the mysteries set up by the last movie none of it matters and you just need to forget about it it feels like the two directorswriters were playing ping pong with the plot and we all are suffering i enjoyed the prequels more because even with their cheesy writing and bad acting they had a decent plot and stayed true to the characters
Jan 19 2019,negative,it completely destroys all the rules logic and lore of the previous movies for cheap comedy and interesting visuals characters are extremely shallow plot is internally inconsistent  anytime actual suspense is achieved they defuse it with pissant sight gags or slapstick   asian lady is as useless and unlikable as rey is perfect   moral of the holdo arc is that you should blindly bow to all authority   editing is jumpy and disjointed reaction takes are often misaligned  but the cgi and practical effects do blend well and the score is great
Jan 19 2019,negative,a terrible plot with terrible characters what have you done to star wars rian
Jan 19 2019,negative,2 star  1st star wars film i really disliked  first the good visuals acting special effects the falcon jedi templetreebooks yoda  then the bad  1 poes call to hux   2 slow bombing run  3 1st order tracking the rebel spaceship no explanation of how at least in ep4 they explain the empire hid a tracking device on the falcon  in ep8 theres no explanation at all  4 r2d2  c3po have really nothing to do ive got the same complaint about ep7  georges original idea was r2d2  c3po would be the only characters in all 9 films and r2 plays a critical part in every film from 1 to 6  5 canto bight subplot is completely irrelevant to plot  6 why dont finn and rose dont care about the slave kids just the horses completely illogical given finn was a child slave of the first order  7 djs moral relativism and nihilism is successful  what a sad twisted morally devaluing message to give the young kids who go to see this film  8 let the past die  motto of every violent revolutionary philosophy from the french terror russian marxists nazis chinas cultural revolution khmer rouge   9 rey is super powerful without adeequate explanation unless she turns out to be a skywalker in ep9  more of that later  10 skywalker bloodline is considered irrelevant what the hell was the point of eps 16 then  11 snoke origin a complete mystery for moviegoers who have no interest in the expanded universe yes the emporer was similar in eps 46 but we knew there were previous episodes even if they hadnt been confirmedfilmed  12 luke tries to kill his nephew  just doesnt match lukes basic decency no matter what provocation  13 bb8  turning poker chips into missiles that defeat a legion of first order soldiers is on par with teddy bear ewoks defeating the empire in rotj or r2d2 having rockets to fly in ep2  14 maz  phone call not aligned with previous films  never had someone having a phonevideo call of a ship in hyperspace  15 luke throws away the lightsabre rey gives him  just a useless gesture  16 no explanation of why rey got visions from the lightsabre  17 luke drinking sea cow milk  really didnt need to see that  18 porgs  some vegetarians propaganda about not enjoying meat  19 leia flying through space  mary poppins returns  20 ackbars death  unworthy of a hero of rotj  21 no luke mourning of han  at least it is in the deleted scenes on bluray  22 holdo not explaining the plan  ive got no issue with females leaders of the resistance mon mothma was calling the shots in ep6 but at least make them logical  23 reys training  3 lessons in 1 or 2 days not nearly enough  24 no lightsabre battle  very disappointing  25 the ending  resistance down to about 20 people no equipment apart from the falcon with no allies left  nobody answered leias call for help  it felt more like what should have been a negative ending for a trilogy indicating theyd lost and would take a long while to come back compared with a 2nd movies in a trilogy    in summary tlj had some good elements that were completely overshadowed by failures  its the 21st century equivalent of the star wars holiday special    to fix things in ep9  1 snoke iswas darth plageius   ignore pablo hs twitters a twitter post is not canon  2 rey must be luke and mara jades daughter explain with flashbacks  kylo was either lying or was reading a vision snoke planted in reys mind or the results of a virgin birth ala anakin  3 bring c3po and r2d2 back into the middle of the plot      all opinions above are my own and i make the ideas above freely available for anyone to use as they see fit
Jan 19 2019,negative,this movie is the result of sjw identity politics and giant corporations trying to make art thatï 12 12tms what you get get woke go broke will never see anything star wars again and the fact that critics give it a 91 shows how paid off they are
Jan 19 2019,negative,there should be a wish i could unwatch option  there are some many basic plot holes that arent addressed missed opportunities that could have made this a better than average star wars movie    it fails generally across the board the writing direction acting effects and music are the two good things from this movie    this was the beginning of the end for the franchise    i can only hope that with jj abrams back on the helm the 9th movie can have a modicum of redemption
Jan 19 2019,negative,wow i had to come back and redo my review as it was taken off haha well this film has proven to be a flop and has killed the franchise in so many ways its practically unwatchable now  just like doctor who and star trek been destroyed by sjw politics cray cray kk gone into hiding now since its release never to be seen by human eyes i wonder why and disney didnt even fire her lol hollywierd the only place you fail upward slow clap oh and stealing the star wars theorys fan film well done guys well done i know you gave it back but still what a mistake looks like the house of mouse has turned into some mafia style company now even if you manage to make episode 9 the best star wars movie in history im still not going to see it disney are theives plus calling me a rasict and misogynistic for months dont help when im in a relationship with an asian girl im going to make it my lifes long work to destroy any sjw film or show on rt now as its a cancer and should be eliminated this very instant
Jan 18 2019,negative,while the force awakens left me wanting more this movie just left me wanting the force awakens back  the only reasons i enjoyed this at all were because of the fight scenes and poe dameron  rose a new character they seemed to think was a good idea was a complete burden on the movie  reys story really didnt change enough and since snoke died it laves you wondering how they will even work out a plot for number 9  i recommend seeing it not because it is a good movie just so you will be able to understand the next movie which shall hopefully be more impressive
Jan 18 2019,negative,how did this film eve get greenlit
Jan 18 2019,negative,dont know about jedis but its certainly the last sw movie ill pay to watch
Jan 18 2019,negative,to start this film looks beautiful and the actors tried theyre best but does not save this film    luke skywakers character has been dumb down to an old man who say get off my lawn   canto bright scene really has no point it  is filler   lots of sjw stuff shoved down and it makes no sense in star wars   the story set up in ep7 has really gone no where   lots of  plot holes bigger than a crater    it turns a lot of charactersheroes into horrible people  just to name a few things this movie has destroyed star wars and its fan base i hope they can save star wars after this film
Jan 18 2019,negative,it was visually nice but the story wasnt the best
Jan 18 2019,negative,its not a matter of equality its dumb to complain because a character is chinese or black thats just dumb the movie is bad horrible antagonists very but very banal the choice they did were dumb and every twist was expected and when unexpected in the wrong way rey who was an amazing character in the previous movie now is just a doll extra character veery disappointed
Jan 18 2019,negative,the worst star wars movie of all time  the idea of watching it again makes me wanna throw up
Jan 18 2019,negative,awful movie if sjws were to produce a blockbuster motion picture this would be it absolutely atrocious 1 star is for the excellent cinemtography and graphics characters story line and just about everything else has destroyed star wars rian johnson should never ever be allowed to direct  a movie again
Jan 18 2019,negative,what a disgrace this movie is a continuous slap in the face to fans from beginning to end my disapointment is immesurable and star wars is ruined from the absolute molestation of the once great character of luke skywalker character assassination doesnt even do what they did to him justice rey has no real or clear motivations other than its the right thing to do which is a weak motivation if youre being kind ive been a fan of star wars since i was a boy and for the first time in my life i skipped a star wars movie because of this film and have no interest to see any more rian johnson should be ashamed of what he has done in this film for no reason despite suffering a crushing defeat at the end of the force awakens the first order has the resistance on the run why they were kicking their ass an hour ago this movie throws everything set up by the last film under the bus then backed over it 16 more times this film retroactivly made the force awakens awful too this film is almost impressively bad
Jan 18 2019,negative,from any point of view this film is a total bust  the worst of the whole trilogy and it is not recommended at all  i hope that lucas returns to direct the film or another failure is expected as han solo 
Jan 18 2019,negative,ruined every single plot and story built up in the previous film for the sake of subverting expectations stunning visual effects
Jan 17 2019,positive,this movie receives way too much hatred from what it deserves in fact it gets the most undeserved hatred from fans out of all the star wars movies since the prequels the movie isnt bad but its not great either its definitely one of the weaker star wars movies and it may have its faults but i still think the movies alright underrated by audiences and overrated by critics overall this movie was fine
Jan 17 2019,negative,hate what they did with the iconic characters if you want to make something new and bold well make your own movie and dont destroy someones elses
Jan 17 2019,negative,i finally saw this film via illegal bittorrent download many friends diehard star wars fans themselves told me to skip it i should have listened i held out for a year but my curiosity got the best of me  like driving by the scene of a horrific automobile accident i just had to look anyway this film was clearly an act of deliberate sabotage and the fact that it was greenlit is a dismal reflection on where were at culturally in the us of a rian johnson should be shipped in a box with a few small breathing holes to abu dhabi kathleen kennedy too for that matter fit em both in one box and good riddance i will be avoiding episode 9 like the plague and everything else star wars from here on out rj killed the franchise hes a terrorist as far as im concerned at least well always have six excellent george lucas driven films rewatch rewatch rewatch and repeat for a guaranteed feel good i gave this atrocity here one star for john williams score and im not a bot you idiots and im not a republican hatemonger either you soulless scum
Jan 17 2019,negative,i see a lot of people accusing the negative critiques of being bots but they seriously underestimate how many people disliked this movie nonetheless heres a general spoilerfree review for those demanding specifics there are plenty of youtube videos highlighting points here  the story is painfully slow the logic is appalling even compared to the absurdity of the expanded universe original trilogy prequels and i think the humour was worse than the new ghostbusters movie wasteful story arcs that would have been useful elsewhere the main characters build up while interesting was rushed making her seem overpowered overaccomplishing and overbearing      dont get me started about the bombers or the military strategy or admiral ackbars heavily underplayed death    its not a terrible movie to watch if youre not a devoted star wars fan comic reader etc it is just as everyone will tell you a bad star wars movie especially for star wars fans
Jan 17 2019,negative,worst starwars movie so far please stop ruining everything
Jan 17 2019,negative,admittedly this is the only film review i have written to date but this is not a fake account  i have just never felt so strongly about a film before this is because this isnt just a bad film its not even a bad film in a franchise its a bad film which does serious damage to the franchise it is part of    the first major complaint is that we still dont really understand what the situation in the galaxy is and this makes it hard to become absorbed in the film the first order are supposed to be the remaining diehard supporters of the emperor who have been banished to a remote part of the galaxy yet they seem to have more resources than the empire when they ran the entire galaxy the resistance are the military of the new republic who until recently had the resources of the galaxy at their disposal yet seem less well equipped than the rebellion of the originals we also dont see assimilation of imperial technology by the new republic which is odd although the force awakens is responsible for getting the franchise into this situation the situation was not irrecoverable had it transpired in this film that the first order had put all or most of their eggs in one basket with the star killer base and that the rest of the new republics military were just in the wrong place at the wrong time then it could have all made sense however this film just digs the franchise deeper into the hole the very first sentence of the opening crawl states that the first order reign but this isnt a logical development from tfa  or at least weve missed some crucial events in the story which the opening crawl should have alluded to later on the opening crawl even contradicts itself by talking of a rising tyranny are the first order ascending or are they ascendant how come the first order are so powerful and the new republic so weak if youre expecting answers to these questions then your expectations will be subverted    the second major complaint is the vandalism of the star wars universe a lot of what happens in star wars doesnt make any sense in terms of laws of physics but there are rules which were already well established in episode 4 these rules may have been subsequently embellished but they were never broken and this is crucial for a suspension of disbelief with this film we see the arbitrary introduction of new jedi powers and the weponisation of the jump to light speed which effectively invalidates every major space battle which has gone before it not only does these moments of deus ex machina prevent suspension of disbelief in a way which pulls you out of the movie they also introduce inconsistencies with other star wars films    other things pull you out of the movie too  badly timed jokes which ruin any tension subplots which go nowhere contrived situations and so many gotcha doublegotcha and triplegotcha moments that it just becomes tedious   these are only the things which make this movie objectively terrible there are then many other aspects to this movie  especially relating to how characters are treated portrayed or behave which are divisive at best    overall i have a lot of difficulty rating this film  it is visually stunning the score is fantastic and it looks like a lot of talented people have put a lot of effort into it unfortunately its just let down by the story  the overall narrative hangs so loosely that the movie just feels like youre watching a 5 year old playing with their toys worse still the damage this film does oozes into the wider franchise
Jan 17 2019,negative,went to see twice it tried to hard to be funny and scenes could have been cut that didnt make sense
Jan 17 2019,negative,terrible used to love star wars this movie made me no longer interested in star wars at all
Jan 16 2019,negative,pure absolute garbage critics dont know what theyre talking about the fan ratings say everything
Jan 16 2019,negative,rian johnson has ruined star wars ild rather watch the prequel series that i now have a new appreciation for the force awakens was alright but the last jedi does it no justice shame on disney for allowing this franchise to go down this way
Jan 16 2019,negative,they basically took everything from force awakens and shit on it just to prove a point that all your fan theories were wrong
Jan 16 2019,positive,this is such a masterpiece its so amazing that i believe its the best of the sequel trilogy
Jan 16 2019,negative,i am very saddened to see star wars die like this shame on you disney
Jan 16 2019,negative,a disappointing mix of horse goat and pig excrement piled together
Jan 16 2019,negative,stupid movie liked the force awakens and wanted to see its story continued but alas nothing is answered spoilers        snoke dies  reys parents are nobodies  luke attempts murder on a teenage boy  luke dies    hated the movie will not be supporting ep 9 sad
Jan 16 2019,negative,worlds longest and dullest cinematic chase scene
Jan 16 2019,positive,this movie is not a bad movie its not great but not bad people make it out to be worse than it actually is pros lukereykylo story is incredible vfx are probably the best ive ever seen amazing cinematography nice johnson and most of the old actors give it their all leia luke and even yoda cons boring second act involving poe finn and rose rose is easily the worst character since jar jar i wont complain about holdo her actings pretty solid but the character is way too untrustworthy other than that i genuinely like this movie give it a watch ignore what others say even me you can make your own opinion but i think we should all hold judgement until episode ix when we will get answers for everything until then im excited for the next journey in the galaxy far far away
Jan 16 2019,positive,i dont see how some people think this is a terrible movie everyone is a critic now
Jan 16 2019,negative,total demonization of classic characters changes that would have saved this movie and made it amazing to me even better than tfa are 1 tell everyone rey is a mary sue because anakins lightsaber passed on all of anakins previous force abilities sort of a passing of the torch but that she cant control them and needs lukes guidance and training 2 show that the same ability to communicate cross galaxy between rey and kylo was done in the past and thats how snoke influenced ben solo to join him and have that be the reason luke pulled his saber out 3 have carrie fisher have a respectful ending by having her sent into the vacuum of space and cut to her using her last moments of life to reach out to her son through the force and tell him his mother still loves him that would have made me cry like a baby because it would have added so much weight to kylos struggle and also be the perfect send off for carrie 4 no pointless side quest for finn and rose unless it isnt completely pointless and full of sjw propaganda 5 no holdo maneuver just have her lightspeed in the opposite direction drawing the first order away from the resistance as a final act of bravery 6 show more of snoke or at least give us an end of movie scene like in xmen origins wolverine where deadpool grabs his own head so we have something to look forward to 7 show the knights of ren at the end of the movie gather around kylo again to give us something to look forward to 8 dont give us luke cut himself off from the force and thats the only way we could explain his not saving han or being involved in tfa instead show that he couldnt come to their aid because his xwing was busted beyond repair and show an emotionally driven luke who felt everything they went through and saw his friend die but couldnt do a thing about it i dont mind him having some doubts and showing some resistance to joining the fight but at the end of the day luke even an unhopeful luke always saves his friends and family example empire strikes back he dropped his training despite warnings from obiwan and yoda to save han and leia at cloud city so as cool as the snoke room saber battle was itd been 10x cooler with luke and rey struggling to battle snoke and kylo anyway i have about a dozen other ways to make the movie a 1000x better seeing as how this is the worst star wars ever in fact ryan johnson just hand the reins over to me next time you can still put your name on it i just want good star wars but ill end my post here
Jan 16 2019,negative,worst star wars movie to date luke milking weird aliens tossing his light saber away luke was ruined in this movie reys parents that storyline trashed snoke mary poppins leia smh another great subject trashed so many bad parts of this movie outweighs the 1 or 2 actually good scenes
Jan 16 2019,negative,plot holes are just too much to handle anyone that is not white literally has no effect on the plot at all and now that we can just kamikaze a ship in space it seems stupid to build a ship bigger than one person the salt races r just stupid disney needs to remake this movie and actually use the most powerful force users to ever exist thanks for making snoke and luke completely worthless in the plot by far the worst director i will go out of my way to not see a movie from this guy
Jan 16 2019,negative,feminism craptrying to mask itself with twists
Jan 15 2019,negative,this is the movie that killed star wars the protagonist is a flawless perfect mary sue who after growing up alone on a desert planet can suddenly without training or effort defeat a trained sith lord in a lightsabre dual challenge this trained experienced force user in jedi mind powers fly the millennium falcon better then han sole repair it better then chewie and litterally do anything else the story requires with zero training she has not even read how to be a jedi for dummies and is doing things anikin took years to learn on top of this the antagonist is a spoiled brat you cant even really hate him you just want to whip his bum and send him to his room without supper the last to movies spent so much time building up the mystery and suspense around these characters and then poof nothing comes of it shes not special shes just dirt poor average nobody snoke is dead so who carred who he was etc
Jan 15 2019,negative,a hideously nihilistic and nonsensical story that makes the phantom menace look like a competent production the lead director talks of subverting expectations well he did i expected this movie to be good and he subverted my expectations dont waste your money
Jan 15 2019,negative,horrible story killing luke after killing han is killing the franchise for a long long time huge fan
Jan 15 2019,negative,tlj failed as a film for me simply because it took what made the original films and even the prequels a faithful story about the skywalker journey and crapped on it simply to pass the baton it was the equivalent of turning mickey mouse into a serial killer simply because it was different luke lost a hand and took a force lightning beating but still had hope to save his father and friends and protect his sister obi was lost the jedi order his friend and padawan and still had hope that luke might prevail i didnt buy the plot device that luke would so easily flip his script simply from a bad vibe about his nephew and if that was truly the cause then the story failed to sell the intensity of that moment as the catalyst solo and rogue one worked for me because they didnt need to crap on what i knew in order to be independent if the only way to have rey poe and finn be successful is to diminish what got you here then the story will fail lastly the chase theme was a goofy and the hyperspace ending was simply a waste it was lazy story telling
Jan 15 2019,negative,for the fans not a big hit but for someone who has not seen the movie might like it to me it was a bad movie
Jan 15 2019,negative,remember when luke skywalker was awesome and was constantly learning and growing  i like this new luke that is milking sea cows and sits on an island all by himself the whole time and being near zero value to the universe  he might as well just thrown himself on the fire at the end of episode 6  also the lack of leadership is seen throught this movie  leia shows almost no leadership ability her replacement shows even less leadership only poe damron has anysense of leadership during the entire movie
Jan 15 2019,negative,this was all together a poorly thoughtout movie with regards to actually being aligned with what stat wars is i loved the force awakens but this is the worst star wars movie created the dialogue story arc philosophy character loose threads inconsistency with previous star wars movies etc the was just bad dont support this type of movie that is nothing more than a cgi filled political campaign 
Jan 15 2019,positive,a great conclusion to the force awakens that also makes fans hungry for more
Jan 15 2019,negative,terible awful lame ass boring goddamn motherfucking piece of crap
Jan 14 2019,negative,poorly written characters overall bad writing failed to incorporate most of the plot points from the previous episode etc i have no issue to what they did with luke but the rest of the film just felt poorly written and put together
Jan 14 2019,negative,this is a star trek filmreplace general leia with captian janeway and youve got yourself a voyager episode god this movie is bad
Jan 14 2019,negative,an abysmal film that breaks no  destroys the legacy of star wars and uproots everything that our heroes fought for in the original 3 films a truly terrible film on every level imaginable unfunny comedy cringeworthy dialogue disastrous pacing underdeveloped characters and not to mention the complete character assassination of luke skywalker are just some of the many examples as to whats wrong with this film i could go on forever about this movie but there isnt much more to say that hasnt been said already this film truly earns an abysmal rating of 055
Jan 14 2019,negative,this was not the star wars movie i wanted to see it has turned me off to the franchise i havent watched solo because i fear similar disappointment
Jan 14 2019,positive,adds to the list of recent star wars movies that have finally put some effort into blurring the line between good and evil hopefully the franchise will eventually realize less is more and tones down the cgi had the right number of weird goofy references to previous movies with plenty of new canon
Jan 14 2019,negative,as an avid star wars fan this movie is a waste of time and a disgrace to the series avoid at all costs if you value anything within the star wars universe
Jan 14 2019,negative,tlj has given me the saddest experience as a movie fan it just broke my heart as hard as anakin broke amidalas
Jan 14 2019,negative,nice title for a middle movie in a trilogy this movie was off from the start do the opposite theory makes the star wars trilogy and future of the franchise suffer badly besides the filming quality the movie failed on all accounts do not watch the deleted scenes
Jan 14 2019,positive,i particularly found the film excellent it was star wars that most surprised me in the whole saga and look ive been following the movies since the 1980s 
Jan 14 2019,negative,this movie piece of crap
Jan 14 2019,negative,its an awful not star wars movie
Jan 14 2019,negative,poorly written poorly cast poorly developed characters cringeworthy humour and naff action sequences laughably far removed from what the star wars universe is meant to be disneys legacy will be to destroy everything that made star wars unique and dilute it with bland characters unsophisticated dialogue juvenile humour and far too much moralistic social justice messaging respect women comes across extremely strongly and even  inexplicably  dont eat meat  rey the lead character is an insufferable mary sue to whom everything is always handed and the lore of the universe bends to accommodate her her wooden acting is not helped by the completely immemorable and uninspiring script she has to deliver  luke the hero from the old movies has been turned upside down and inside out to the point where the actor disowned the new interpretation of the character and the old fanbase almost unanimously rejected the movie outright  finn is one of the best things about the new star wars movies and his scenes make this car crash of a film watchable  leia is bearable until her miraculous and completely unrealistic even by star wars standards supermanesque space flight  an irritating new character called rose is introduced presumably to add another check in the diversity tick boxes as she serves little other purpose other than to ruin one of finns most heroic moments and simultaneously doom the entire resistance over some airyfairy notion of love trumps hate puhlease  just do not waste your time
Jan 14 2019,negative,impressive visuals cannot save this film
Jan 14 2019,negative,this movie is crap rian johnson is an idiot
Jan 13 2019,negative,how can anyone in there right mind think this is a good movie zero drematic tension as they made the villain a joke in the opening scene not good film making at all cant understand why the critics are  bullshitting everyone oh wait they get disney credentials couldnt tell the truth to save themselves
Jan 13 2019,negative,the more i think about this movie the more i hate it and the less i can forgive this movie was a travesty and should never have made it to release sadly it is now one of the core saga films that will forever have to be a part of the franchise    i liked the holiday special more than this
Jan 13 2019,negative,even mark hamil didnt like it  johnson indeed subverted my expectations  i was expecting a good sequel to tfa which despite its flaws i enjoy and what i got was a total loss of interest for whatever is next  i dont care for episode xi i wont pay a cent for episode xi and you shouldnt either  bravo ryan
Jan 13 2019,negative,crap compleat sjw crap nobody involved in the production knows anything about star wars
Jan 13 2019,negative,this movie was an absolute mess of storytelling and seemingly purposed to change the star wars universe to make some sort of statement that nobody really wanted madeexcept rian johnson and disney rather than service and honor key character arcs  so much has been said her and elsewhere about how this movie upset much of how the star wars universe works  so much has been said about how absurd the plot and sidequest is  i wont need to reiterate all these things here  others have fleshed it out far better than i could  the only redeeming thing i have to say about this film is that its nice to look at but who expects a bigbudget film like this to be filmed poorly  beside the cinematography i have almost nothing else nice to say about it  rian johnson made not just the worst star wars movie ever madebeating phantom menace by a long wayhe subverted any expectation i had that ix will be something id actually want to see
Jan 13 2019,negative,hated it star wars ended with revenge of the sith i dont know what this junk is
Jan 13 2019,negative,plot holes and retcons everywhere a horrific stain on the face of cinema it subverts only for the sake of subverting with out the substance    the new main cast becomes more uninteresting or just downright insufferable while the ot cast is used as a springboard to shamelessly make the newer characters look good it also has plot threads that fall into utter abyss pointless over saturated padding for the canto bight casino planet and the dialogue at times is worse than the prequel dialogue not exaggerating and just over all a bad movie experience the narrative spells a dark future for star wars from if this is where the writers are going it might just be the worst purchase i have ever made and its never coming back this is the type of film thats so bad it should be brought to film schools to teach the next generation of students of what not to do when making continuation to anything it has all the red flags and its just painful and sad to watch    i only give this a half a star because the producers had some level of respect to pay respect for carrie fisher at the end of the credits but over all this travesty shouldnt even be considered mediocrity for how badly this was botched i recommend you stay clear of this trash at all cost
Jan 13 2019,negative,i donï 12 12tmt think i have ever hated a movie more than this one it just plain sucks to call this a star wars movie is an insult to all of the other movies episode 7 was ok rogue one and the solo movie were surprisingly good but this move is just garbage what the he disney take your leftist propaganda and go ruin a different series
Jan 13 2019,negative,never been so disappointed in a star wars movie
Jan 13 2019,negative,disney manages to pull the incredible and make star wars the last jedi even worse that its predecessor the force awakens because wow it was bad copying the empire strikes back a movie that we are all familiar with fans will notice an outrageous ressemblance to a muchbeloved film example imagine crait is hoth and that anchto is dagobah see  the last jedi also seems to swap out a lot of action for a lot of chitchat scenes and i really had a hard time trying to enjoy this movie im a huge star wars fan but im sorry this movie does not do the franchise justice i did not enjoy this movie
Jan 13 2019,negative,the movie gets the star wars universe wrong it throws the logic of it out the window space battles and the state of the republic make no sense certain subplots are pointless boring and annoying and disturb the movies flow even worse they unncecessarily make this the longest star wars movie to date but worst of all the movie erases the nottion of who luke skywalker is from not giving up on his father who happens to be the second most evil person in the galaxy spoiler spoiler spoiler spoiler he now plans to murder his nephew in his sleep because he has a dark side wow     the movie is a missed opportunity to make good on things teased in episode 7 but that is not such a big wonder considering rian johnson wrote the script for the movie before he knew the plot of episode 7 that is why this movie feels ridiculously out of touch with the established universe i am truly disappointed
Jan 13 2019,positive,as a moderate fan of the franchise i really liked  rian johnsonï 12tms unique take on the last jedi
Jan 13 2019,positive,definitely worth a revisit for those that dislike the movie having not watched the film in a year it was quite eye opening to relive it escaping from the internet negativity you will find a very good star wars episode that sets the stage for the finale sure there are some problems but for me they are isolated moments rather than film ruining threads i think people forget just how exciting this film is from its thrilling throne room sequence to the battleof crait undoubtedly though the highlight of the film is the magnificent adam driver as kylo ren a top three star wars character in my opinion  his arc and his scenes with rey are star wars gold    sure there are some minor flaws bu ultimately this is a very worthy addition to the saga protip watch this with the force awakens it gives the sequel trilogy a clearer sense of vision so give it a chance you wont regret it hopefully
Jan 13 2019,negative,im not a bot this movie is extremely bad written there are so much plottholes its absolutely terrifying sorry cant understand how just anybody likes this movie its disrespectful from disney the fans to make something like that
Jan 12 2019,positive,i have been nothing but impressed with the sequels so far and i really enjoyed this movie while i was surprised by the backlash bandwagon that made the film out to be worse than it was im not necessarily convinced these complainers have any grounds to even pretend they are story snobs i mean this is a saga that once gave us jar jar binks and anakin skywalker complaining about sand in his crack while using the force to play with fruit     the force awakens rogue one last jedi and solo have all entertained me in different ways and while they arent entirely perfect  i have enjoyed every experience in the theater watching them i have always been a star wars fan particularly the original trilogy my fiancé loved this flick as did my mom my father who lined up to see all three original flicks when they came out said he enjoyed this one the best out of the entire saga and its spin offs go figure we are all very excited for episode ix
Jan 12 2019,negative,this is the worst star wars film ever it disrespects the original trilogy and completely undoes everything that was accomplished in it rey is a mary sue with no background or explanation to where her power comes from the writing is lazy and stupid this film relies so heavily on cgi that if you take it out you are left with a couple of bad actors apart from mark hamill who tried his best an awful story that goes no where characters who have no depth or background and a film that destroys all hopes and expectations of what fans wanted it to be ps the way the failure of this film was handled was so awful it has made me lose all respect for rian johnson and disney
Jan 12 2019,negative,if you are a star wars fan then you cant disguise how you love this movie that almost ruined all the reputation and extraordinary characters that the series had been established by george lucas what a shame
Jan 12 2019,negative,the feminist leftist pc bullshit is hilarious this movie is so garbage its amazing it every got fundedsomebody was clearly being weinsteined to greenlight this script so much so im sure rian johnson the writer is permanently tasting penis in his mouth and of course it comes from disney
Jan 12 2019,negative,this movie actually gets worse on subsequent viewings not only does it completely trash and disrespect the franchise that came before but it also is just all around poorly made movie
Jan 12 2019,negative,worst movie ive ever seen in my life this includes future movies that i havent yet seen nothing will surpass this heaping pile of garbage
Jan 12 2019,positive,the best star wars episode ever tied with the empire strikes back rian johnson knows how to make a film and deliver a story looking forward to his next star wars trilogy
Jan 12 2019,negative,this movie is an abomination i wish i could give it a negative score the only good thing was how good it looked
Jan 11 2019,negative,this star wars movie is almost everything  except a good movie they not just copy a lot of scenes of the original trilogy they made it worse following a cheap and convenience plot with stupid and childish characters the unique character salvageable was kylo ren who demostrate an advance as icharacter unlike luke who go against the written in previous movies with a stupid logic behind of his actions even this movie violated a lot of rules of the previous histories this is the worse movie of star wars ever created
Jan 11 2019,negative,i feel like im being forcefed by sjws forget social justice make a good star wars movie
Jan 11 2019,negative,from the opening motions of the movie it drives out all knowledge of what happened and what should open out into the open void star wars the last jedi is an utter disappointment for many fans as it completely obliterated any chance of creating an incredible trilogy to look back on for the future the plot holes were glaring at worst leaving out many subplots from the force awakens like the knights of ren the fact that luke purposely left a map so he could be found and how the first order managed to control most of the valaxy after losing almost everything when the starkiller base was destroyed no questions were answered and more questions arose killing off snoke the character everyone was theorizing about and getting excited for instead it was a pointless cone on the ground in a parking lot to just walk around the same goes for almost every character like laura derns as she comes out of nowhere and is obnoxious admiral ackbar is just killed off without acknowledgedment luke just dies from the force and my god does it squander any chance for an epic confrontation of course the special effects are on point as any star wars movie should but it is almost becoming tiresome the plot is weak just a ship flying till it runs out of fuel rian johnson has lost any desire to create something magnificent and creative in parallel to the empire strikes back but throws the opportunity away and loses every fans dream of hope the last jedi is one of the worst if not the worst star wars to have been released the phantom menace is better for what it is worth
Jan 11 2019,negative,my wife bought tickets to this at a fancy theater with food and alcohol got a baby sitter to surprise me for christmas  it took me almost a year to admit to her that it was one of the worst movies i had ever seen  she knew how excited i was to see it  i was loathe to disappoint her   but this movie is a literal spit in the face to the legacy that is star wars  this movie marked its death  the agenda is obvious and insulting  this movie is what you would call emotional abuse    every minute of the 2 12 hour run time is a pain to ingest    when the movie doesnt insult me being a man or being white or having expectations for this series to continue in true star wars fashion the actors and creators take to social media to do it themselves     if i were born any other way this movie would literally be hitler     to the movie itself over bearing and miss placed attempts at marvel comedy  in your face culture politics  useless side quests and dialog that doesnt fit the established characters   poor leadership which causes a mutiny which is later laughed off    i could on and on  but i cant forget to mention the pure disrespect this movie pays to its characters and its audience      pretending to like this movie does not make you edgy it makes you a sell out  this movie isnt good no matter where you fall on the culture politics spectrum
Jan 11 2019,negative,worst writting in the stars wars saga painful not entertaining to watch  that was not luke skywalkeri dont care what mickey mouse says
Jan 11 2019,negative,horrible mess   worst star wars movie ever
Jan 11 2019,negative,craps on the original characters while giving us useless or unlikeable new characters what the heck
Jan 11 2019,negative,judging from the commercial flop of solo im guessing people didnt like last jedi  i certainly didnt its the film that killed star wars but perhaps thats what rian johnson wanted after all the theme of last jedi is let the past die kill it if you have to well rian if killing 40 years of love for star wars was your intention congratulations you succeeded
Jan 11 2019,negative,throw it in the trash
Jan 11 2019,negative,how did this happen
Jan 11 2019,negative,lets hope rain johnson is kept far away from star wars  i doubt jj can save the sequel trilogy     the prequels  especially revenge of the sith  are a million times better
Jan 11 2019,negative,loved the force awakens   hated the last jedi     judging from the reviews here its clear the rotten tomatoes has frozen the score
Jan 11 2019,negative,rian johnson deserves to be punished
Jan 11 2019,negative,when people say this film makes them want to rethink how bad the prequels were you know it must be awful  i saw this in a backtoback showing with the force awakens and although that film has its faults  it really shines in comparison to this muddled effort  first you really miss an actor with the gratitas of harrison ford  no one seems to step in to fill that voice and those cast members who would have been capable of this are either given cringe dialogue or are got rid off and sit out the rest of the film  the horrible profeminist agenda raises its head fullon which wouldnt be as bad if the plot made any sense  or if there was a lot of genuine thrills and spills around it  instead we get a load of hot air surrounded by competent visual and a very underwhelming score by john williams  as a fan of star wars since i first saw it in 1978 uk this is the one that really made me lose interest and feel let down that the good will and expectations raised by the force awakens have been squandered and i have been made to feel like it isnt for me anymore  well if this is the way it is going then thats fine  it isnt for me but just who is it for
Jan 11 2019,negative,an awful evisceration of the whole star wars lore coupled with an sjw fest
Jan 11 2019,negative,the last jedi not only makes everything that happened in the original trilogy pointless it also tosses out plot points set up in the force awakens i dont know who didnt tell rian johnson that this movie was part of a trilogy but they messed up from setting audience expectation and dashing it to timelines that dont sync up this movie was fun to watch in theatre but lost its appeal as the honey moon phase wore off and you begin to realize just how poorly this movie was put together     aside from all that and this has little to do with this movie but the response disney has had and allowed its employees to have is disturbing i will not be going to watch episode 9 in theaters if i here its better than what i would believe it to be ill make sure to rent it or borrow it from a friend to view
Jan 11 2019,negative,this movie is a bastardization of everything you grew up with lukes character is unexplained rey has no motivations finn and rose are useless and poes character arc is completely contradicted not even to mention the vast amount of questions set up by the previous movie that  go unanswered in this one if you were wondering the answers to these questions you will only get middle fingers the only good things are that mark and carrie are still great and the fx are visually stunning but in the end i cannot recommend this film
Jan 11 2019,negative,the worst star wars movie ever the story is really bad and no logic involved the visiuals are great doe
Jan 11 2019,negative,this is the movie that killed the star wars movies the movie is so bad if you like star wars dont watch this movie it will destroy the franchise for you every thing about this movie is bad the main character is a mary sue the plot is one of the worst ive ever seen characters ruin parts that could have made the movie good and interesting parts that could have mad the plot interesting added personality to the characters but everytime the movie had a chance they would never follow through they pull things from their ass and act like its canon this movie put star wars is on life support and the next movie will probably be the bullet that puts star wars in the grave
Jan 11 2019,negative,this is the movie that killed star wars for me poor luke
Jan 11 2019,negative,if you really need me to say any of the flaws this mess of a movie has you must stop visiting this kind of pages any possitive comment on this movie is like literally hurting the cinema as a whole
Jan 10 2019,negative,this movie has some amazing visuals and sound editing it is entertaining to watch and see all the pretty shots and glamour when you look past this initial glow you quickly realize that there is not much substance here there are plot holes everywhere even ones specific to star wars lore and rules this is very jarring and disrupts any immersion you may have in the movie there is no real worldbuilding and things are stated or depicted a certain way because that is what the director wanted the characters are lackluster with no real development that actually matters in the end rey is the worst of all the characters because she has no real motivation or purpose no real flaws no real danger and can do anything and everything she wants to do no matter is she has any training knowledge or experience in the area she is utterly boring it is a fun space movie with the name star wars slapped onto it it betrays all the old material and all the dynamic characters and stories that came before it
Jan 10 2019,positive,lovely film and one of the best in the franchise
Jan 10 2019,negative,this movie sucks i tried to give it no ratings because its that bad but the lowest i can give is a half so just keep in mind that half i gave it means nothing
Jan 10 2019,negative,the take away from this movie is we should leave politics out of the movies pointless subplot the movie is mostly bad so i will point out the things i like      lukeï 12tms conflict over kylo renï 12tms drift to the dark side was interesting and the luke i know would i believe have had that struggle considering what he went through with his father    i like the salt planet not sure why some folks donï 12tmt like that not sure about those silver foxes but they did have a purpose to show the rebels how to get out    i like the rey and kylo relationship interested in seeing how that evolves    mixed on how luke is dispatched i thought he should have had a much bigger role instead of spending all his time wallowing around on his island i do kind of like the parallel to obi wanï 12tms demise but stillobi wan has an amazing story before that happens lukeï 12tms story line was uninteresting and then he died that was an injustice to an iconic character i donï 12tmt think rian johnston understands the character     btw saying that everyone who hates this movie is a bot and leaving a 5 star review is petty and untrue most people felt this movie did not live up to itï 12tms potential everyone is entitled to their opinion if you like it great leave a favorable review but if youï 12tmre someone whoï 12tms upset that people hated this movie leave a 5 star review and then insult everyone who hated it i donï 12tmt think your rating should count
Jan 10 2019,negative,the script is awful i cant complain about the acting because the script is so cringey that of course even the brad pitt would seem like a bad actor in this movie this is basically just a money making stunt which has no interesting plot no character development and really ruins the star wars universe
Jan 10 2019,negative,social justice overload many things in this movie dont make any sense when you think about it only scenes i really liked or even loved were the rey and kylo scenes im only seeing episode 9 for them
Jan 10 2019,negative,this may be the single most destructive movie i have ever seen i created this account because the  at the time of typing this  91 tomatometer score by critics is appalling lets list a few things the last jedi tlj ruined   space battles if you can hyperspace ram into capital ships space battles no longer make sense   leia if theres one thing that could have gave tlj some bit of emotion and bite it would have been if leia sacrificed herself instead of holdo instead with carrie fishers passing we have leia pointlessly living on for no reason   the first order how are we supposed to respect a villain when the first time we see them they fall for a prank call   the rebellion how the first order managed to whittle down an entire galactic government to a handful of survivors within 2 movies baffles me now the resistance is so small and pathetic they effectively dont exist outside of rey and her magical mary sue powers   snoke hes not darth jar jar hes not darth plagueis hes nobody with no explanation what could have been an interesting character is simply killed off   rey her parents being nobodies just makes her an even less interesting character with zero explanation for being a mary sue  at least being luke skywalkers kid would have given her some excuse   finn again they ruined his heroic sacrifice his character arc came full circle he defeated his nemesis and he learned bravery  so they sabotaged his heroic sacrifice in one of the dumbest scenes in cinematic history   kylo ren now the one thing that could have saved the movie is if they really went through with it  if rey joined kylo ren  this would have really stirred things up for the franchise in an interesting and dynamic way rey could try to change the first order from within kylo could be swayed back toward the light side  it would have been interesting  but instead we just end the film with the status quo the good guys vs the bad guys and no interesting grey area   holdo  admiral akbar heres an idea  instead of introducing an annoying new character nobody cares about why not have the heroic sacrifice be done by admiral akbar its a heck of a lot better than unceremoniously killing him off screen   space travel how can finn take some ship to some planet and back why didnt everybody just abandon ship that way how can they travel to a planet at sublight speeds in less than a few months   the salt planet i get that theyve already done jungle ice temperate sky and desert planets but come on  why is this silly salt planet worth going to other than it kicks up red dust so we can think luke skywalker blew up in a bloody mess   luke skywalker luke quite simply would not behave like that if he saw the light in darthfreakingvader he certainly would not have tried to kill his own nephew in his sleep he wouldnt even have thought about it also  after doing something admittedly pretty cool as a force projection he just dies anyway without ever truly reuniting with leia han chewie or anyone weak   those are just some gripes i have plenty more  poe hux phasma c3po rose etc are all useless characters with little to do the casino planet diversion was pointless and boring dj is an annoying character etc you get the point this isnt just a bad movie it has severely damaged if not killed the reputation of this major franchise for me if there is anything positive to come from this movie its that it makes the prequel trilogy look great by comparison
Jan 10 2019,negative,didnt have a single element of a genuine sw movie horrible
Jan 10 2019,negative,director was allowed to abandon key story arcs that defined the escence of star wars extremely disappointed that fundamental expectations for the saga were deliberately ignored or even reversed i understand why critics love to praise and even reward breaking the mold but the approach to this particular film makes a mockery of of those things that were endearing to star wars its unfortunate that hardcore fans would shun the new solo movie in retaliation especially when ron howard did such a decent job hey disney take a hard look at rogue one it worked
Jan 10 2019,positive,although a departure from what generations of fans have expected from the beloved franchise the last jedi takes major risks and should be applauded for its decisions that director rian johnson made
Jan 10 2019,negative,takes everything you loved about the old star wars all of the promise of tfa and flushes the whole lot down the pan cannot believe this was allowed to be released rifht up there with highlander ii just not as funny
Jan 10 2019,positive,this movie is good you guys are just mean
Jan 10 2019,negative,plot inconsistencies uninspiring and empty characters unending plot lines and too many twists to be taken seriously
Jan 9 2019,negative,torture  on so many levels
Jan 9 2019,negative,this movie ruined my childhood i wish the empire destroyed the universe in episode 6 every star wars fans will cringe seeing this movies if you want to satisfy your star wars addiction go watch rebels
Jan 9 2019,negative,im a pretty casual fan of star wars and dont emidietally decline anything in the franchise but i feel this movie contradicted everything the force awakens created jj abrams is gonna have a bad time fixing this mess also the canto bight seen was too long and was blatenly obvious filler id say this could be a really fun movie if your wasted as hell but as a star wars movie it does not like up to its potential
Jan 9 2019,negative,disrespectful unnecesarly long unfunny and pointless most of its characters go backwards on their archs or dont advance the only redeemable quality of this film are the visuals and if for you that makes it a good film youve put star wars at the level of transformers
Jan 9 2019,negative,overall utterly disappointed so many basic and important plot points are completely nonsensical  pacing and tone is all over the place and completely undercuts important moments  it has killed my excitement for any further star wars main line story films
Jan 9 2019,negative,that was not luke skywalker and the movie was certainly not star wars
Jan 9 2019,negative,this is close to being the worst star wars movie
Jan 9 2019,negative,mr johnson ruined what could have been an amazing trilogy
Jan 9 2019,negative,i am a long time fan and this movie is very much the worst star wars movie and also a bad overall movie too many things in the movie contradict themselves it is perverse towards the fan disney should have sketched out a plan for the trilogy does not make sense finn kylo ren and luke offer good performances
Jan 9 2019,negative,definelty the most terrible star wars mode madeever
Jan 9 2019,negative,liked the original  six movies well be prepared to have that all thrown away because rian johnson clearly doesnt understand how to involve continuity of george lucass vision only thing good about this movie is that its visually pleasing to watch
Jan 9 2019,negative,absolutely awful progression of a tremendous and legendary story
Jan 9 2019,negative,the previous film was just a mashup of the original trilogy scripts but this one is somehow worse terrible script badly written characters poor acting stupid sjw overtones throughout honestly i wish i could get my money back
Jan 9 2019,positive,listen to the audience score this movie falls way short of expectations
Jan 9 2019,negative,story was horrible and lore breaking and sadly politics came into the movie which should never happen no matter which side of the political spectrum it comes from
Jan 8 2019,negative,without a doubt this was one of the most disappointing movies i have ever seen dont believe the defenders everything that was set up in the force awakens is thrown out the window for the sake of subverting expectations luke is made to be a joke the canto bight sequence was complete garbage and rey is a legitimate mary sue 1 year on and i am still mad about how poorly this movie turned out
Jan 8 2019,negative,social justice overload breaks every known canon for star wars only reason its more than one star is the quality of effects
Jan 8 2019,negative,this is by far the worst star wars movie ever  this new trilogy had an opportunity to reunite the original trilogy cast and really make something amazing and that opportunity was completely wasted the plot makes no sense and basically this movie disregarded and disrespected everything that came before it in the saga horrible job what a waste negative stars
Jan 8 2019,negative,lucasfilm nowadays is far more downhill than it ever was ever since disney bought the franchise they had been calling the shots on how to make star wars shows and movies one of the results is the last jedi i do not care for this film one bit because there is so many problems about it that just cant go unnoticed and bother me to hell the stupid decisions they make and the various plotholes and killings of characters yes they do kill a lot of characters including snoke i would expect micheal bays transformers films to do that not lucasfilm of all people and killing off the most interesting character of the new trilogy was a bad move entirely we dont know who he is or why he is intimidating or even why he did what he did it pisses me off as a star wars fan thinking about this rey is the most undeveloped main character i have ever seen this is a problem spawned by this first film of the trilogy the force awakens she just runs into fin and goes on this adventure for no damn reason and she is a terrible jedi btw yeah even though she started training with luke she didnt get anything done and also magically saved the day which further proves the feminist message that women are more gifted than men and the force is female bullcrap spawned by kathleen kennedy and rian johnson and kylo ren though slightly the most tolerable character in the movie has the most bullshit backstory about how he turned to the dark side and instead we are given the reason why and that is because luke tried to kill him what that is so wrong on so many levels luke skywalker one of the most beloved characters in the franchise tried to kill kylo ren his own nephew by the way and the son of his best friend han because he was slipping to the dark side why he couldve personally counciled ren and tried to help him somehow why am i supposed to care about this character oh wait knowing the actual character he he would luke wouldnt just kill his own nephew because he had a spec of darkness inside him whatever this movie is basically the worst in the franchise i did not enjoy it in theatres and i do not recommend watching this the characters are written poorly the plot is out of place and the constant killing of multiple beloved characters such as admiral ackbar just proves that i have no respect for disney and the current morons at lucasfilm dont even bother with this film
Jan 8 2019,negative,when are we supposed to realize that were seeing the same old stuff done less well than the original
Jan 8 2019,negative,this was a film that didt live up to its expectations didnt fulfill the set ups of the force awakens and didnt honor the legacy of the original film characters the villains were cartoonishly juvenile and naive and the social politics were front and center to the detriment of the storythe visual effects were good and so was the music score
Jan 8 2019,positive,the last jedi was genius the meta nods and easter eggs to hard core fans and lore were subtlety awesome this movie had so many thrills and feels i love what rian johnson did with his first star wars movie
Jan 8 2019,positive,easily one of the best in the saga the fans who are crying the loudest about this film are mad because rian johnson didnt use every video game clicheof the past 20 years and decided to make a truly original film dont give in to the hate
Jan 8 2019,negative,words cant honestly describe how frustrated disgusted and downright disappointed i was with the way disney sold out a once beloved franchise to nothing but diversity quotas with no relevance to the overall story a stupid evil rich white conservatives plot that made completely no sense the worst part of the whole thing and i mean the time where it got so bad i had to leave the theater and ask for my money back was when they made luke go out like a punk i had that one glimmer of hope that when he was going to fight kylo ren that a fight resembling the one with yoda in episode 2 was going to happen but no he just disappeared into the distance like a freaking jokeif i could give this movie negative stars i would but unfortunately that would offend the snowflakes
Jan 8 2019,negative,horrible plot holes underdevelopedunlikeable new characters the obvious political agenda disgracing established fanfavorite characters etc  this was just a bad movie and the product of bad decisions and im not a bot btw
Jan 8 2019,negative,depends on your history or potential with the true star wars franchise if youve seen each of the movies about once you know maybe you havent seen one or two and youve seen one or two a couple times on tv if thats you and you have very little investment or appreciation for star wars youll love this movie it looks very good and sounds very good and has genuinely emotional moments there are gaping plot holes and stupid things people do that the movie seems to present as completely reasonable but these can be neglected because of the evocative and pretty nature of the movie im just saying if you went into the sequel movies the force awakens and now this one invested in a coherent plot and competent characters who as their character are supposed to be very competent or at least incompetency to be picked up on by the movie you may not like this movie very much also if coherent plot matters to you a load you probably wont be able to forgive this movie what star wars fans or casual admirers were offended by was the bastardisation and nonsensical nature of the luke sky walker we know and love speaking generally to dodge spoilers luke is presented as being in the dumps and struggling but the problem is this isnt an actual character development what we learn about luke in the movie goes against the character himself rey is still a mary sue an incoherently randomly overpowered character which has no real struggle thus not actually being interesting and normally inserted for a specific reason like poor ironically sexist attempts at diversity and female empowerment or a personal directors over attachment to an idea and in fact her sueness is increased in this movie significantly the whole bplot to the movie being pointless bores me i understand how some could blind themselves to this in order to enjoy it but honestly i cant get past the pointlessness and be engaged by half an hour of filler admiral holdo not telling anyone that she even has a plan and leading poe to believe that theyre all going to die without a fight thus causing said bplot and unneeded tension in the movie is actually portrayed as a good decision this isnt really a spoiler but she isnt either jailed or significantly demoted to a normal soldier or firstlevel leader for her responsibility in some of the actions caused by the tension which couldve caused death and the ultimate falling through of her secret plan which annoyed me poe should rank above this pretentious psychopath another nonplot issue i have with this movie is the gross under use of chewbacca as set dressing and an occasional joke source they carry on the sequel trend of the force awakens by betraying the character of chewbacca by having him let out endless cute growls to the extent that its annoying in an attempt to dilute any gravitas menace or reserve of the character of chewie remember in a new hope when we first see chewie in the cantina as a silent deliberate companion while later in the original series chewbacca was tastefully respectably and entertainingly made more whimsical the sequels have turned him into some sort of toddler character seriously to any sw fans reading this would you be surprised if in episode 9 which we need to agree not to watch chewie got scared by lightning or had a makeshift dolly which he pampered no because theyve destroyed the awesome character of chewbacca and replaced him with an imposter imposter chewie imposter luke imposter force this is why people are considering the sequels noncanonical as in not really star wars but pretenders under the name as a final negative the snoke storyline went nowhere any positives beside the aesthetic and tearjerker at the end very good performance from carrie fisher rip very good performance from mark hamill who btw is dead against what theyve done with the series and was tricked but tried his hardest anyway to work with the drivel he got good on him those are all of the positives i can think of right now to summarise i disliked it a lot because i like star wars but if youre not that acquainted with star wars and dont value coherency of the plot too highly youll very much like this emotional pretty picture however one thing that is objective is that this is not star wars this is objectively not the same world that we saw from anakins childhood pod racing in episode 1 up to his redemption and death in episode 6
Jan 8 2019,positive,best saber fight since anakin v obiwan in part 3 plus a luke dichotomy that feels like its been splitting him in half for years no ray is not the protagonist in the film and because of this the film is actually able to explore its other characters that were completely flat and annoyingly whiny in the first one
Jan 8 2019,positive,loved it haters be damned
Jan 8 2019,negative,first movie ive ever actively hated so many plot holes and problems and ruins the character of luke rey is still a mary sue rose is by far the worst character ever makes jar jar look great leia poppins and i could go on i hate rian johnson i hate kathleen kennedy there is no hope for ep 9
Jan 8 2019,positive,a great movie  it added depth to the skywalker line and was worthy of the the star wars mantle  disney has done a great job and it incorporates all of the movies
Jan 8 2019,negative,i would rather watch the room or disaster movie than this horrible film for a 2nd time the main plot is boring the side plot is a complete waste of time the characters are either been wasted finn luke leia poe phasmaagain snoke  or unbearable rey kylo rose dj  their motivations are either unreasonable or not existing at all asking yourself why this or that character is doing what heshe does the answer is  the plot demands it i know rj had nothing to work with but to see how many gotcha moments he could fit into one single movie was not a good call the film was an abomination the good thing is though  ive learned to apprechiate the prequels more even episode ii
Jan 8 2019,negative,this movie is an absolute dumpster fire bad writing terrible plot holes under developed boring characters and saga destroying scenes that affect the entire franchise ie light speed weapons think of that next time you watch the trench run the movie is also terribly unoriginal a complete ripoff of jedi and empire the best way to sum up where we are now quickly is a quote i found by mr plinket    your beloved favorite characters who you thought beat the bad guys and lived happily ever after were actually failures who spent their entire lives fighting a horrifying generations long losing war that took away everything they ever loved and eventually killed them but not before passing the horror on to a new cursed generation because these toys arent gonna sell themselves
Jan 8 2019,negative,where to begin i can see what rian johnson tried to do with the movie but that doesnt work for a sequel that doesnt work for a second movie in a trilogy and it certainly doesnt work for an established saga namely the saga of the skywalker family anakindarth vader luke and leia it wouldnt even have worked if they had tryied to make palpatine or obiwan kanobi reys fathergrandfather this is a saga of the skywalkers  now on to a lot of themes as this is the attempt of rj to introduce into the franchise  unsuccesfully i might add  you cannot introduce independent themes into a mainstream movie even themse that were internally independent of each other lack of internal logic and coherence was massive lack of awareness of overall strategy and tactics was massive the movie wasnt storydriven and the massive speciel effects and beautiful scenes cannot make up for the lack of story also the movie was full of tells instead of showings we were told of reys parents not shown we were told of roses childhood not shown we were told of roses relationship with her sister not shown we were told of purple hair not shown we were told of fins backstory as a janitor not shown  sometimes there werent even tells so neither tells nor shows such as phasma how did she survive why is she badass who was the thief why did rose and fin suddenly trust him why would he ever save them  we were told nothing of skywalker we we shown nothing about skywalker except the meaningless scene of kylo rens childhood attack was that really all that was needed to make a powerful optimistic jedi into a whiny grumbling dark man who cant even defeat an untrained rey  and then there is the mary sue oh i really hate mary sues they dont belong in serious movies they only belong in fan fiction which never gets published  if villains are so weak as portrayed in the movie why even bother with villains where is the threat in the movie hux surely wasnt a threat kylo isnt a threat and snoke wasnt a threat the biggest threat was then revealed to be secretly good purple hair who suddenly liked the whiny pilot hero
Jan 8 2019,negative,nothing like taking a character who stopped at nothing to save his friends when he barely had any power and turning him into the most powerful coward
Jan 8 2019,negative,terrible movie just terrible while i am a star wars fan my problems with this film are not related to that fact i do hate to see what theyve done to the world of star wars but even as a standalone movie this is an illogical and horribly written story the characters are not well developed there are too many attempts at humor all of which are unfunny and misplaced taking away from the emotional impact of those respective scenes each attempt at humor was like someone stopped the movie told a bad joke and then resumed playing it scenes meant to elicit fear concern danger were trumped by the inclusion of such comedic stumbles    the universe of star wars also causes conflicts since this story doesnt match up with the other films weve seen as part of this world in other words there is a major failure in the continuity department be it the ships and technology that are less advanced than those of the prior films or the force powers that never existed prior to this mess i cant understand how these ideas found their way into such a wellestablished cinematic universe its also important to note that there are substantial contradictions or continuity errors with the newest film as well and not just the original trilogy the force awakens presented a lot of new ideas and stories to build upon but this heap of nonsense completely ignored those ripe stories the theme of the film which was explicitly stated by kylo ren within it is that he past must die this film and its creators dont hide that message and it was clearly some misguided attempt to reset the universe and clean house under the guise of subverting expectations that is the moronic theme that others have claimed to be some genius message they didnt subvert expectations other than the fact that we expected a good movie and an interesting star wars story only to have this instead it is anything but those things    overall id give it a 5 out of 5 stars for the aforementioned reasons and because zero isnt an option as well as the other failures i dont have time to list at the moment i will continue to watch the original films and i will treat them as a closed story as far as im concerned this film is not a part of the star wars saga and i dont expect the sequel to fit in either if you havent seen this movie consider yourself lucky and stay far far away
Jan 8 2019,negative,this movie was a mess   it disrespects beloved star wars charactersand therefore fans and poorly manages new ones   the plot was entirely pointless we got no answers to any of our questions from awakeningwhich i liked and was excited to see where it was all going but it turns out it was going nowhere the movie ends with all of the resistance dead and the heroes validly calibrating like 20 of them escaping  then thereï 12 12 12 12 12tms the character development all of the villains are weak baffoons and all of the heroes stumble along from disaster to disaster making no personal sacrifices or growth but failing constantly while continuing to blindly profess virtue where their is only harm done to the greater good over stubborn personal belief the original trilogy even the prequels were based deeply in archetype and therefore had a truth to share which connected with the audience effortlessly on a deep meaningful level the last jedi does the opposite it heavly invests itself not in reality but rather in ideology trying vainly to force its plot to fit its clunky socially contrived narrative resulting in a story that would make a good cautionary tale in hownottobe instead of the archetypical heroic journey that shows one how to be  this movies is visually stunning a cinematic masterpiece of videography and the sound was just as good itï 12 12 12 12 12tms the only quality in the film  i could go on and on in detail about how colossally this film fails but all things considered star wars the last jedi is best summed up metaphorically by its light speed kamikaze attack it ruined space combat ya know warinthestars star wars thereby making the plot of 4 6 and even its reboot predecessor 7 void it ruined star wars period it needs to be expunged this movie is not cannon it cannot be which is a shame because we lost leah to iti
Jan 8 2019,positive,i loved it the first time i saw it in the cinema ive now seen it 11 times in a cinema and countless times at home watching it again tonight as a part of 2019 first sw marathon simply love it and love star wars i feel lucky to be alive at a time where these grand movies are made d
Jan 8 2019,negative,what you get if you take a nonstar wars fan and make star wars movie this is trash and feels like a big fu to all fans this needs to be deleted this movie goes out of its way to be a standalone film when its supposed to be part of a trilogy for the life of me i dont get the reasoning here this movies destroys the character development of nearly all cast members from what tfa established why this honestly feels like rain johnson never watched a sw film before or know anything about the world of starwars
Jan 8 2019,negative,the worst star wars movie of them all and the most disappointing jj abrams set this film up to be decent enough and despite tfa just being a new hope with subtle differences tfas fan service was perhaps needed after such a long time since the original trilogy     the whole canto bight scene is not needed needed rose was a frustrating character would have been a great death for finn if he had have flown into the laser vice admiral holdos deception for no reason was infuriating to watch also fuel in star wars is a silly concept having there been no mention of it before rays parents not explained and snoke not explained
Jan 8 2019,negative,worst star wars movie hopefully it will stay that way
Jan 8 2019,positive,must see definitely a new direction for star wars excellent cinematography
Jan 8 2019,negative,if you dont know by now i got nothing
Jan 8 2019,negative,so i loved star wars like since i was a little kid and so many things in this movie just didnt quit connect with me  why didnt holdo tell phoe the plan so finn didnt have to go on that useless mission  just so he can slap phasma   why do the switch from resistance to rebels mid film  why did rose stop finn from destroying the cannon which destroyed the base  how are they so happy at the end of the film when like 150 men died while at the beginning of the film phoe gets slapped for it but at least he destroyed a dreadnought  how does ray know the force after one training session   how did snoke get killed so easily if he is so powerful  how does yoda still has powers as a ghost  why is there no use of ywings
Jan 8 2019,negative,what can i say that hasnï 12 12 12tmt already been said sad excuse for a star wars movie ryan johnson decides to take a very well known franchise and turn it into his own independent film project he doesnï 12 12 12tmt own episode 8 he was a caretaker and he tried to make it his own he drove the series into the ground and is in denial that it is a bad movie if you donï 12 12 12tmt like it ryan and co will call you names and say you donï 12 12 12tmt like diversity in films did they not notice how well episode 7 did and it was very diverse and had a female lead
Jan 8 2019,neutral,this movie just doesnt hold up too many dropped subplots pointless side plots and literally the slowest spaceship chase in all of movies theyre literally crawling through space as all of the leaders in the movie make the worst possible decisions they can luke teaches rey nothing and snoke just is gone and i dont even want to get started on phasma i actually thought this movie was alright the first time i saw it now im seeing that its subpar disney and lucasfilm this is the greatest most influential movie franchise in history do better
Jan 7 2019,negative,how in the living hell did any professional film critic rate this movie so high  there is not way thats an honest critical reaction to this film  seeing such a glaringly dishonest critic score makes me think the audience score must in reality be far worse than is being shown here    nevertheless my score is as low as can be  despite the visuals that some people commend i see not redeeming qualities whatsoever in this film  if you have not yet seen it dont waste your time      ive been a dedicated star wars fan my whole life the first film i saw in theatres was empire strikes back ive seen every single release on the big screen including the special editions multiple times  with the exception of the last jedi which i saw only once and solo which i didnt see at all for those rare people who havent yet seen or experienced star wars do yourselves a favour and watch the original trilogy it doesnt really matter which edition you watch but personally i prefer the original formats each of the three were spectacular in their own right and empire strikes back is considered by some to be one of the greatest films ever made not everyone would agree with me but many would that the last jedi is both the weakest of all 8 of the saga films episode 9 has not yet been released and that it also does the most damage to both the lore of the star wars universe and to the most important legacy character many people who saw this film wish they had not i am one of them    as for direct criticisms of the actual film there is no shortage of that to be found anywhere i am in agreement with what the vast majority of those critiques assert that the script is poorly written the characters are weak and their actions make no sense and that it seems to be the product of someone who either totally misunderstands the mythology of star wars or who purposefully intended to usurp the lore and legacy of the original trilogy many longtime fans consider this film to be the worst of all the star wars cinematic properties and i am one of them
Jan 7 2019,positive,i really liked this because it took it the franchise in a new direction the past movies should be called the skywalker and solo story in a galaxy far far away every major even center around two families  
Jan 7 2019,negative,complete nonsensical boring draggy mess
Jan 7 2019,negative,the worst star wars movie ever no right direction whatsoever
Jan 7 2019,positive,while this movie is not perfect the horrible 45 is no where near warranted
Jan 7 2019,negative,its the worse star wars film ever rian jhonson kill t
Jan 7 2019,negative,im a fan i have every figure 3 34 and 6 inch for this film i will still buy every one released i have every star wars movie and watch them over and over again except this one the writing in this film is atrocious everything is convenience divisive and not thought out properly you cannot go 1 minute without seeing errors or plot contrivance characters are wasted for agendas including phasma hux finn luke poe and snoke just to name a few what were the filmmakers thinking like i said i spent hundreds on stuff for this film just as every star wars film i am such a loyal fan that i will buy a 6 holdo fig when it hits the stores still did it have to be this bad this film subverting nothing but my wallet and it calls me names through social media for not liking it my advice to disney take your film franchise seriously instead of sending focus groups to deal with spin control avoid this film if you can ive only seen it twice compared to seeing solo 5 times rogue one over 30 times force awakens over 30 times and the rest of the films over 100 times my sheer viewing numbers should tell you what i think of star wars today and how last jedi corresponds
Jan 7 2019,negative,im a fan i have every figure 3 34 and 6 inch for this film i will still buy every one released i have every star wars movie and watch them over and over again except this one the writing in this film is atrocious everything is convenience divisive and not thought out properly you cannot go 1 minute without seeing errors or plot contrivance characters are wasted for agendas including phasma hux finn luke poe and snoke just to name a few what were the filmmakers thinking like i said i spent hundreds on stuff for this film just as every star wars film i am such a loyal fan that i will buy a 6 holdo fig when it hits the stores still did it have to be this bad this film subverting nothing but my wallet and it calls me names through social media for not liking it my advice to disney take your film franchise seriously instead of sending focus groups to deal with spin control avoid this film if you can ive only seen it twice compared to seeing solo 5 times rogue one over 30 times force awakens over 30 times and the rest of the films over 100 times my sheer viewing numbers should tell you what i think of star wars today and how last jedi corresponds
Jan 7 2019,negative,had some cool looking scenes but so many issues with the story and characters that ive got no desire to ever see this again  really dislike this movie
Jan 7 2019,negative,i didnt even finish watching it because so much of the dialogue and characters feel forced and unnatural i rolled my eyes when i saw a purple haired lady taking control of a ship and start scolding the lame and moronic male pilot her only purpose is clearly being a sjw metaphor that men are reckless and stupid and sexist towards a womans leadership and that she was some type of strong leader a strong leader figures out what they have to work with and pushes and inspires other people scolding someone like theyre a child for something that cant be changed now while in a desperate situation isnt a good show of leadership dont get me started on how luke skywalker is treated do not watch this movie
Jan 7 2019,negative,this was the last iteration of the originals that i will ever watch so disappointed in the complete lack of common sense and good story telling beware
Jan 7 2019,negative,terrible absolutely terrible a disgrace a travesty utterly nauseating this stupid trash needs to be erased from history kathleen kennedy and ruin johnson ought to be blacklisted from hollywood for such a disgusting sjw npc propaganda piece done with disney star wars for good its officially over
Jan 7 2019,negative,very bad  first movie i ever saw in theatres was star wars a new hope  been a fan ever since  the military tactics used in this movie are ridiculous  no battle field commander thinks like these clowns
Jan 7 2019,negative,a confused movie    cheesy humor and dark tone do not compliment each other completely removing tension from the opening scene and others    consistency of character from the older movies is almost nonexistent from leia displaying never before seen force abilities to lukes hopelessness    casting was done by a marketing department with obvious forced plot points whose sole purpose was getting the asian market and failed horribly    overt and uninspired political undertones of patriarchy and modern feminism    a director who is more interested in subverting your expectations than telling a compelling story    this is a beautiful movie visually is all i can say that is positive    this movie may have killed the franchise
Jan 7 2019,negative,im at a loss for wordsthis movie is a whole new level off badits visually stunningbut story wisenone of the twists workthe dialogue is horribleand the lazy writing really showsoverall this is one of the worst star wars movies yet and dont even get me started on the luke in this movie
Jan 7 2019,negative,i signed up to this site just to make sure that disney executives understand that the audience score on this site is valid and relevant and isnt some made up hacked or false indication of what ordinary people thought of this movie its real this movie fails on all levels and is the weakest of all the star wars movies this was the only star wars movie screening i have attended where the audience didnt cheer clap or react to what they were viewing the total opposite to the screening of the force awakens where audience members cheered and clapped throughout the movie as for the socalled movie critics were they watching the same film as the rest of us  watch this movie to see how poor writing can create obvious narrative problems i feel the majority of star wars fans didnt like direction taken by the last jedi and the film does have some major flaws hyperspace ramming flying princess leia  bombs falling in space but to name but a few not to mention political ideology and feminist propaganda which has been so obviously placed front right and centre in a star wars film in the original star wars princess leia was a strong female lead character well written and well acted not just placed there to push a view point or an agenda  main stream media insinuates that the star wars fan base is made up of primarily older white males who are all toxic sexist racist misogynistic bigots man babies to name but a few theres a big difference between having an opinion criticising something or hounding someone for no good reason what i personally feel is wrong though is that directors writers the creative team and representatives at lucasfilm keep on attacking the star wars fan base as a unit on all media platforms  i believe that everyone has a right to an opinion about movies and if a successful franchise is being steered in the wrong direction then fans should have a right to express this in a constructive way  director rian johnson cannot handle any form of criticism regarding the last jedi in any way and will retaliate publically with words such as unhealthy and man babies as he is so self absorbed he has stated he will not listen to the fans and ignore them subvert expectations reject all criticism and make the film as he sees it is it not the ordinary fans that by spending their hard earned cash on everything related to the star wars saga which made it the success it is today are we not important it seems so  star wars fans are a broad church and their only concerns are with getting a good story and a good film this is a pr disaster for all concerned especially the person in charge of production namely kathleen kennedy kathleen kennedy who is responsible for firing phil lord and chris miller so far into production of solo and then firing acclaimed director colin trevorrow for episode 9 losing lucas film millions of dollars continuing attacks on the main fan base by the main stream media the loss of revenue is a direct result of the fans becoming disillusioned with the whole franchise dont throw away what took 40 years to build up the force is not female kathleen kennedy it is neither male or female so lets take on board what the fans are asking for and move forward
Jan 7 2019,negative,no the film doesnt honor the sagas rich legacy it  all over it
Jan 7 2019,negative,could not stop laughing on this divine comedy the plot is so fn bad that can be used as the brightest examples of a screenplaydirector failures and be taught in the specialized academies nuf said go watch the youtube jibbers on the topic for detail
Jan 7 2019,negative,my childhood was star wars of these sequals i wanted them to allow me to die happy instead this film leaves me wanting to happily die rian johnson is an absolute hack and this film is a complete piece of shit
Jan 7 2019,negative,this film had great potential but it blew it spectacularly  none of the main cast were particularly interesting and the story even more so i lost count of how many times this film made me cringe i could list all the things in this film that made it cringe worthy for me and i would be here all day instead i would rather point out this films missed opportunities that could of made this film not great but fairly decent one of the missed opportunities was the further exploration of the wealthy elitists on the casino planet and their dealings with both the rebels and first order in weapons sales and how they are exploiting the conflict to their own advantage another missed opportunity was when luke realising that the jedi were just as flawed as the sith and he could of chose the path of a grey jedi in an effort to find true long lasting balance sadly none of the things were explored instead we got the lowbrow swill we have come to expect from hollywood these days
Jan 7 2019,negative,not a star wars film and i enjoyed the prequels more than most
Jan 6 2019,negative,bottom line terrible screenplay with poorly thought out consequences unwanted social and political commentary however it has spectacular visuals so that you wont notice any of that other stuff  went to the first showing of this movie on the day that it was released many of the audience arrived early and stood outside in freezing temperatures waiting for the theater to open energized by the cold we were mostly chatty and excited wow what a change the next three hours would bring this has been the only star wars release which i have attended where nobody in the theater clapped or cheered during the end credits the audience members walked out eerily in dead silence with no discussion of what they either liked or disliked about the film   the movie was full of jokes with the plot being the biggest one of them all out of all of these clever jokes the audience only laughed together once or twice together there was one person that laughed from beginning to end and actually sounded like they might have been drunk she even laughed when leia was blown out into space haha indeed it seemed like the audience may have gasped more times at the movie than laughed at the imbecilic jokes that were offered up in every single scene if my memory is correct there were three collective gasps and only the aforementioned one or two collective laughs which seemed more uncomfortable than amused is that really what they were going for  star wars movies are no longer for star wars fans this has been demonstrated by the words and actions of those currently involved in the production of this franchise why acquire a super successful film property just to rework it into something that is more similar to transformers than the original star wars big budget films that spend everything on special effects while possessing an inconsequential story is what we can expect out of disney from now on the predisney films were able to excite peoples imaginations and keep us buying merchandise books video games and talking about this far away galaxy for decades it seems doubtful that these new films will be regarded kindly in time if they are given any regard at all   if you happen to be a transformers fan then perhaps you will enjoy the new star wars content the new movies are bright and shiny and full of oohs and aahs with none of that annoying story to follow and nothing to excite your brain about star wars is now just pop entertainment they dont want us to think about it and they dont want fans to criticize it this is placebostar wars
Jan 6 2019,negative,i do not believe anyone who says they liked this movie actually watched it or perhaps watched it but have never watched any previous star wars movie
Jan 6 2019,positive,overall good  film  not absolutely  perfect  but better  than  any of the original trilogy   definately one of ny top picks of the franchise
Jan 6 2019,positive,has its great moments has some bad too unfortunately but pretty good over all
Jan 6 2019,negative,worst star wars movie ever it makes solo  attack of the clones and the phantom menace look like the greatest films in cinema history in comparison
Jan 6 2019,negative,i dont have enough words to express how bad that movie was
Jan 6 2019,negative,startlingly mediocre and disjointed from front to finish rian johnson seems to be talented but unable to operate within established frameworks of lore and tone leading to a jarring and awkward movie that seem to be more referential to star wars than a part of the saga it owes its existence to characters behave in abrasive and unrealistic manner and plotting and pacing seem cobbled together like a scrap book of unconnected ideas held together under a vague and poorly developed agenda     it is long boring and suffering from an identity crisis that it seems rian was unable to resolve whatever issues people have with the gender politics asside this is fundamentally a clumsy film with moments that tempt brilliance before their jungian shadow brings your expectation crashing into a dull dissappointment at the absence of any meaningful payoffs a galaxy of lore disregarded by a talented but self absorbed director who seems to forget star wars is only a thing because of the value fans put on it and the dollars they bring     a wasted opportunity by a talented director who just couldnt figure out how to make a good star wars movie and submitted this very rough draft the evening it was due on teachers desk
Jan 6 2019,negative,this movie really killed star wars for me i would have probably accepted it more if it wasnt called star wars just doesnt seem to fit into the entire star wars universe which i have come to know dissapointing the original follow up books and story eg with mara jade etc is so much better effects are great though but sadly that is about it
Jan 6 2019,negative,this is exept the holiday special the worst episode of the franchise after watching the great rogueone one could really think episode 7 was just a misstep but episode 8 showed clearly that the storywriters didnt understand sw at all i really hope the did enough footage of carry fisher and mark hamil to recut it someday into something that could become episode 8
Jan 6 2019,negative,this movie was a disaster none of the characters are either relatable or likeable the plot is nonexistent things just happen
Jan 6 2019,negative,i was let down by the force awakens i was let down by rogue one and ive never been more insulted than by the last jedi heres a fun game to play go through the reviews here and every time you see a 5 star review read it and see if they ever actually talk about what they liked about the last jedi i guarantee you youll just see the same generic nonspecific cookiecutter praises of how well the characters were written  portrayed or how good the themes were or how incredible the plot  subplot writing was but not once will you ever actually see any detailed commentary about why its good the only thing youll see from the 5 star reviews for this move are bland generic and never mention anything specific assuming they mention anything that was in the movie itself    also to anyone who wants to rail against someone by claiming how pathetic it is that anyone could make a nearly threehour review on just the first forty minutes of the movie stop and think about how many problems such a movie would have to have to take nearly three hours to get through talking about just the first forty minutes of it    face it the movies a dud and mark hamill tried to warn us i hope he agreed to do episode ix just so that disneylucasfilm will cut him another cheque despite how hard its going to bomb
Jan 6 2019,negative,this will sadly be the last star wars movie i deliberately of my own free will give my cash to see it was a mess of a film that seem to  urinate on the fans that had been waiting patiently to see nothing but disappointing conclusions and plot lines thrown away in favour of cheap gags
Jan 6 2019,negative,what a waste of money a general with no ability to plan or communicate blames her staff for her mistakes and kills most of her army just so they can die on a old mining base but wait  dont  bother 
Jan 6 2019,negative,the wost star wars by far it achieve to ruin every charcter we loved and introducing 0 new things no sonke back story a weird feminism plot rose that learn us that drugs are not ggood and that jesus is our losrd and savior  oh and remember luke well he is a bad old guy that lost all hope now taht lose stick   duels with a child and drinks elephant milk
Jan 5 2019,negative,so very very bad  its worse the second time  subverts both my expectations and everything that was good about the series
Jan 5 2019,negative,a badly written movie has a lot of plotholes and is boring to watch
Jan 5 2019,negative,this movie is worse than worse
Jan 5 2019,negative,what a shit show man this was just epic bad writing the story makes no sense the entire middle of the movie during the slowest chase scene ever could have been just cut out rose ticos character has to be the worst written in star wars history and jar jar set the bar pretty low the humor was way off there were literally your mama jokes      what the hell were they smoking when they made this dumpster fire
Jan 5 2019,negative,complete utter feministpropaganda trash the women were all strong and dominant while the men were fumbling bumbling idiots disney and critics continue to attempt to gaslight the upset fans into coercing them through guilt into thinking that this is actually a great movie not only is it a bad star wars movie its bad on its own to begin with the resistance or rebellion or whatever they are called anymore ran to of fuel and the first order couldnt find a way to blow them to smithereens pleasegive me a break
Jan 5 2019,negative,so im gonna be one of the few people who rates this movie anything but 1 star now now before the fan boys come out and trash this review hear me out okay d a bit of spoilers ahead only for this review i think    so we have the story beginning with the first order chasing down the resistance if you watched the force awakens it should be blatantly clear to you that rian has dumped that setup this idea is the most prevalent throughout the movie rian has essentially given a very deliberate middle finger to jj abrams    lets skip over to when rey finds luke at the island planet luke asks rey twice why are you here to which rey answers paraphrasing idk man with this alone rian has shined a spotlight on rey showing those watching as to why reys character is horrendously bad she doesnt have any goals she doesnt have any aspirations she is not the heroine archetype that fits the story following that vein in another scene snoke gets on kylos case saying he was bested by a girl who never touched a light saber before you fail hilarious good stuff rian    then theres the thing about admiral purple hair shes just the kind of commander youd want commanding the resistance while leia is recovering from outmarysueing rey literally forces herself back to the ship after being thrown out of it into space no logic required dooooh isnt she sarcasm poe asks her after her rather useless speech only information gotten out of it is that the ship contains the last of the resistance about what the plan is only to get a bunch of sassy remarks from her essentially telling him to fuck off and somehow this lady gets a scene where she becomes a martyr for the resistances escape    moving onto to the point where kylo and rey are in snokes chamber the character who was expected some form of backstory from gets killed off in the stupidest way conceivable and theres no background whatsoever genius     what really got me howling though is when finn arguably one of the most useless characters in the series is about to finally get his spotlight when he flies into the space cannon trying to bust open the doors behind which the resistance is hiding for safety and then he gets saved by rose this is followed by a glorious line from her where she says this is how were gonna win not by killing what we hate but by saving what we love and then the cannon busts those doors open only offering the resistance its rushed and messy demise you know what makes this funnier the fact that roses sister was the one in the first scene who died trying to save the resistance and she ends up being the reason why the resistance ends up in one of the most perilous situations top comedy gold guys your money has been worth it    ff to when luke confronts kylo luke is shown to be a complete badass while confronting kylo this scene surviving a bunch of cannon blasts and answering to every blow kylo deals him and then its revealed that kylo was fighting a hologram this whole while tbh i was quite disappointed with this reveal initially it took me a few more runs before i could really appreciate how much of a big middle finger this was to all the fansluke peaces out after this with a small tribute to obiwans demise in the empire strikes back    see jj made a new hope and repackaged it to the masses rian could have done the same and this movie would be a wellliked film for the short term so why wouldnt he do it this movie is nowhere close to the empire strikes back he could easily have done that    i think rian never wanted it to be that i think he decided to crash the franchise by making a movie with gaping plot holes in its story and its characters doing all sorts of nonsensical actions that would never happen if george lucas or even jj were behind the helm yoda wanted to complete training luke even after luke wanted to save leia and now here yoda tells luke that the jedi texts are worth shit luke ran off from his training to save his sister once he found out now he reluctantly decided to train rey after chewbacca persuaded him to and then tells rey to fuck off after seeing how marysuish she is     better still he gives the biggest middle finger to the sjws every female character in the movie is shown as either useless or outright dangerous detrimental to the resistance even couldnt do that to rey of course thats heresy p    the most deliberate middle finger to the sjws i wonder if they even caught that tbh    this movie kills all its characters all the overarching plot lines everything i only rate this what i do because even as much as i enjoyed all the middle fingers flipped at the audience there is no good story in it it is a very bad movie and im not denying it but yes disney hope you got the message from rian stop trying to milk the cash cow leave the franchise be
Jan 5 2019,negative,this movie is just terrible as much as force awakens was a terrible star wars sequel on its own it wasnt too bad of a movie this one is just terrible in so so many ways i cant begin to describe them here but suffice to say the plot is truly bad
Jan 5 2019,negative,what an utter piece of trash
Jan 5 2019,negative,its a show about how to ruin childhoods    its also a show that lets you know that being a white man means being the scum of the earth or the galaxy every young white boy should know this  you have no future    the show also implies that being a woman  you are a supreme being that dont need training education or hard work to be superior to all and more intelligent    the show is actually a sequel  but one doesnt need to see the previous 7 films in the franchise because this show pays no attention to what happened before this show actually makes a point of that in itself by destroying everything that a lot of intelligent people made before in previous films
Jan 5 2019,negative,you have to be really talented to make this garbage with the star wars licence nice work
Jan 5 2019,negative,this was the absolute worst star wars film to date  i would prefer watching the christmas special over this because at the very least its enjoyable to watch to make fun of  this movie was an absolute flop for me  so many things were wrong and i felt no tension throughout the entire movie because rei is a mary sue
Jan 5 2019,negative,this movie ruined star wars
Jan 5 2019,negative,there are so many issues with this movie i could forgive most the plot inconsistencies this movie has if rian didnt completely destroy lukes character luke skywalker is a hero archetype and even if he wasnt he is a character with an arc of progression he would never have even on reflex thought to murder his nephew based on what he has been through with his far more evil father in order for characters to change this drastically from their established arc they have to go through a tremendous amount of trauma luke did not go through horrific trauma nor does it show him having a changed perspectives on life so his actions are completely out of character i have never seen a worse example of illogical character assination     this movie ignores previously established rules on how important training and struggle is it ignores the lore it even ignores all the set up from the force awakens there are numerous objectively bad plot writing and continuity errors this movie is absolute garbage and should be retconned from canon star wars is a modern western mythology with a hero story this movie destroys that mythology star wars was seen as something good that all people regardless of politics believed to be an example of good that has now been subverted to tell a politically motivated message without nuance    this movie has harmed the fundamental core of modern society and it is the greatest shame this could legitimately be the precursor to a civil war when you destroy the fibers of society that hold it together that hold the different types of people together then society devolves into conflict star wars was a cultural fiber that helped to hold americans of different beliefs together and united them under a common good you destroyed that the consequences for doing this will be seen over the next decades
Jan 5 2019,negative,an unfunny overly long film that seems to take pleasure in perverting the values of established characters and supplanting them with cookiecutter disney heroes and villains        the last jedi takes every interesting thread from the force awakens and annihilates it beyond repair      if nothing else an impressive exercise on how to destroy a beloved franchise in a single film      i wish abrams a sincere good luck
Jan 5 2019,negative,absolutely trash their is no character development no lore no backstory or any explanation of who these new characters aresnoke and decided kill them off old characters from past trilogies are ruined they took everything great from the old movies and threw it out there window and the whole star wars franchise along with it      sure the graphics were the best weve seen and the score was amazing thank you john williams  kathleen kennedy and ryan johnson took this 4 billion dollar franchise and burned it for disney
Jan 5 2019,negative,terrible movie god awful plot that goes nowhere and cuts off any interesting developments even worse directorproducer that actively attacked fans of the franchise for disliking it the only positive is the great visual effects and lighting other than that miss this piece of flaming garbage
Jan 5 2019,negative,the worst movie in history directors and president of disney should be fired
Jan 5 2019,negative,just awful and i dont think that because im not a true star wars fan this is coming from someone who bought every episode 3 lego set has just about every star wars video game and knows the answer to every star wars trivial pursuit question its an insult to the viewer and the franchise watch it for free and be the judge yourself but dont pay for it or youll only encourage more of this crap
Jan 4 2019,negative,such a garbage film nothing happens but destroying beloved characters hope rian johnson gets his trilogy taken away unfortunately kathleen kennedy had her contract extended because no one else wanted the job she might be a great producer but she is a shitty creative lead that has no idea what the hell she is doing
Jan 4 2019,negative,the cinematography was amazing and most of the visuals were also very well done but none of this can make up for horrendous writing plot development and character assassinations  what they did to luke was completely uncharacteristic of that character as had been established by the first three movies and even if you argue it was it was never conveyed nor established in the movie things that cause a massive character change canï 12 12tmt be glossed over it requires involving the audience and showing them the emotion that character experienced i wonï 12 12tmt bother with the rest of this trash the acting was well done and the actors were convincing and believable but what disney has done with star wars is appalling i have never loved the prequels more than after watching episodes 7 and 8  i have so soured on my beloved star wars after these last two movies iï 12 12tmm not sure i will bother seeing the 9th and my birthday is may 4th i bleed mitichlorions yet cannot stand the new trilogy
Jan 4 2019,positive,star wars the last jedi is my favorite star wars movie ever its soo good the writting is amazing all the characters are at there best its much better than any of the prequels the score stakes and scope are all fantastic then ending is great as well and luke skywalker has a great arc in this movie and its just the best editing is pretty good as well
Jan 4 2019,negative,destroyed the whole star wars saga will really just keep watching episode iv to vi and do my best to forget all the last new ones
Jan 4 2019,negative,garbage film terrible pacing gaping plot holes the film has contempt for its audience and seems to go out of its way to make people not want to watch it disney is throwing away money
Jan 4 2019,negative,garbage  many logical issues
Jan 4 2019,negative,the technical side of the movie is good obviously because of the funding the actors play their terribly written characters good obviously because most of them except the purple haired one are good actors     but the story is absolute shit on fire it stinks to the core the shittiest use of character cliches who are for the most part mary sues mixed with very shitty dialogue which not only stinks of lack of imagination but also succeeds in being terribly preachy     it also tries to force a political agenda down the audiences throats but fails miserably since its done too amateurish and lacks any form of imagination     terrible terrible terrible i wont even give it a full star half a star it is and the half is because luke simply played a role in this movie and not a terribly good one
Jan 4 2019,negative,wow another proof that hammering people over the head with a political agenda means you are a talentless hack    from beginning to end unfocused and irrational nearly everything in the plot makes absolutely no sense amazing visuals  sadly not enough to save it godd if you turn off your brain and leave it in another room    on a side note apparently sjw cannot even do their own propaganda right for a movie that should attack men and glorify women all the women in this movie are tragically bad and incredibly incompetent    you can pick from the crazy stalker the worst commander in the story of ever that singlehandedly manages to basically kill everyone and the everything comes natural to me with no effort whatsoever cardboard cutout of a human being    amazing
Jan 4 2019,negative,hollywood has obviously got these critics by the balls this movie is nothing short of a social justice warrior bastardization of one of the greatest stories ever told imagine a fine cup of black coffee made from freshly ground arabica beans and then disney comes in with its 2 french vanilla creamer and 2 spoons of sugar thats basically the last jedi or what should be titled the last mary sue
Jan 4 2019,negative,this movie makes a mockery of the carefully crafted star wars universe lore and internal consistency by introducing several problematic new uses for established mechanisms such as hyperspace travel and the force this latest installment in the saga is no longer able to instill willing suspension of disbelief in me and my friends otherwise a boring and unremarkable movie with at times above average special effects at least the force awakens was a decent ripoff of a new hope this a whole new level of bad
Jan 4 2019,negative,it was the first star wars movie i didnt want to see again immediately afterwards  just watched it on netflix for the second time and my position has not changed  it is almost as if rian johnsom either never saw the original films or wanted to piss core fan group off  i have heard films arent supposed to be made for fans  if fans pay an outrageous ticket price for a stupid storyline that does not get them excited about future installments then disney leaves money on the table because core fans wont just show up because it is star wars      disney really needs to rethink the decision to allow each director to write their own films  there is no way to satisfactorily save this story line in the next movie
Jan 4 2019,negative,looked alright but too many plot holes to be fun
Jan 4 2019,negative,poorly written poorly directed incoherent plot and some of the worst attempts at humor ive seen in a long time almost no character development except that rey is now a jedi master with zero training
Jan 4 2019,positive,while it can be a tough watch at times overall this is an exciting new chapter bringing the force and all the star wars players into new challenges while progressing the overall story anxiously awaiting the next chapter
Jan 4 2019,negative,no rian just didnt do it the hype was real the movie was trash
Jan 4 2019,negative,the worst of the star wars movies ever i did not think that would be possible after the forece awakens but rian and kathleen made it happen anyways so sad
Jan 4 2019,negative,this movie destoyed the star wars legacy for me   not watching any more star wars movies until kennedy and johnson are fired
Jan 3 2019,negative,it is arguably the worst film in the star wars franchise it marks the true intentions of disney clear they prefer quantity over quality ive watched it several times in hope that perhaps my judgement was swayed somehow during the first screening but alas it is complete rubbish from the opening credits to the jedi dust settling at the end the plot lacks a connection with the previous films and leaves little to work with for the third installment i feel saddened that such amazing talent was wasted rain johnson should be ashamed i would be embarrassed to have my name even listed in the credits 
Jan 3 2019,negative,big letdown like breast milk massive milky letdown
Jan 3 2019,negative,cool graphics but the story sucked and so did the sjw bull sht    if i wanted that i would watch transformers except iid have enjoyed transformers a hell of a lot more
Jan 3 2019,negative,never before have i been simultaneously so excited for a movie and so let down prepare to be forcefed a political agenda while watching your childhood burn before your eyes
Jan 3 2019,negative,disney made a stupid sjw feminist horrofic pic  what the fk they eere thinking
Jan 3 2019,negative,ive watched star wars episodes 16 a hundred times each they are my favorite movies of all time and will never stop being amazing to me star wars the last jedi is the saddest excuse of a movie that i have ever seen the plot line is complete garbage and lacks any of the wonder created by previous star wars movies it makes no sense offers nothing new or exciting doesnt continue the story arcs of any of rey finn or po and completely ruins our beloved luke skywalker mark hamill knows and completely agrees imagine walking through walmart and seeing two lightsabers side by side the one on the right has lights sounds collapses for easy storage and promises a lifetime warranty satisfaction or your money back guaranteed the one on the left looks like the other but has no lights or sounds bends at any pressure so you cant have saber battles with your friends has the lucasfilm logo drawn on the back in crayon shows damage from other people in the store and for some reason has foam darts to shoot with even though it has nothing to do with being a lightsaber the one on the left most closely resembles this movie the darth jar jar theory made more sense for a plot line than the one provided in this movie may the force be with anyone going to see this movie youre gonna need it
Jan 3 2019,negative,this movie along with the force awakens have completely ruined star wars for me they took everything that was great about star wars and through it away with horrible writing huge plot holes and terrible useless characters with no progression
Jan 3 2019,negative,two wordsutterly boring
Jan 3 2019,negative,even with the title ï 12star warsï 12tm it wasnï 12tmt what i expected reverse on lore too many politically correct view points force onto viewer why does rey not require training two movies in and no explanation too fluffy what happened to the dark undertone of the franchise real shame
Jan 3 2019,negative,its well made excellent sound and visuals  it has some good performances from some actors  unfortunately thats about all that it can objectively be credited for  the story was different but in a bad way with characters behaving in headscratching ways politics were ham fisted in
Jan 3 2019,negative,contains both good and bad for me the bad is more than the good 2 stars some of my favourite scenes of star wars are in this movie at the same time most of my least favourite ones are also in here odd sensation
Jan 3 2019,negative,this movie was trash
Jan 3 2019,negative,tolerable as a standalone film but as part of the star wars stable it disappoints repeatedly with glaring plot holes trite dialogue and hugely unsubtle social references a real shame
Jan 3 2019,positive,some very good parts but there is also a lot of boring plot
Jan 3 2019,negative,poor story pc rubbish
Jan 3 2019,negative,the worst star wars movie by far i cant consider this canon this movie is not just bad it also damage the rest of the movies with its physics hyperspace ramming seriusly and the chararcter development rey overpower with no need of training the director doesnt understand luke at all what a waste  the new characters are boring etc this is just really poor writing and no respect for the franchise    looks like star wars sounds like star wars but its not star wars at least not for me
Jan 3 2019,negative,this movie script should be given to college students as an example of how not to write a story  i enjoy all the fake paid reviews  they say the same things knocked one of the park  star wars is taking in a bold new direction  please only naive people believe in the fluff reviews  the audience is fair in saying it deserves a 44  i believe that should be lower but money buys votes
Jan 3 2019,negative,a horrible movie ive watched it twice and all i can say is they wasted luke and fucking ruined all reason to ever build a death star when a transport ship with a hyperspeed engine could destroy a planet
Jan 3 2019,negative,this is my least favorite star wars movie and that includes the prequels the good its texturally very nice it looks and sounds great the bad the plot abandons common sense and continuity for the sake of being subversive since a lot of the beats dont make much sense its very effective at taking you by surprise but its not a satisfying viewing experience even the coolest moments in theory like the big character death the slick looking throneroom fight scene and the lightspeed ram are robbed of their coolness by the nonsensical writing ps while that aforementioned fight is one of the best shot in the series its actually one of the worst choreographed slow it down a bit and it honestly looks fucking ridiculous and i dont just mean the disappearing knife
Jan 3 2019,negative,worst star wars film i have ever seen in my life why was this movie even made everything about it defied logic princess leia flying in space like a space fairy was the stupidest thing i ever seen on film who is rey no one who is snoke no one why is kylo ren mad for no reason i mean really did anyone else not see what i saw just thinking back on this movie makes me mad no other movie has ever pissed me off after leaving the theater as much as this one
Jan 3 2019,negative,for me this movie was like fruit stripe gum my first viewing was like the first piece of chewy goodness that created an  explosion of colors and flavors that brought my childhood rushing back in an instant this is exactly what i remembered this is amazing i could chew on this forewait a minute the more i chew the worse it gets ill just get another piece uhthat didnt last long and the only flavor left is peach why do i have to try so hard to enjoy something metaphors aside i keep trying to like this movie but i just give up half way through it just looses its flavor and i have to spit it out
Jan 3 2019,negative,the movie throws the history of the series in the trash doesnt bother with character development while pushing an agenda if you question any of this the heads of the studio will actually namecall and attack your character i pretty much hate this movie and what disney has allowed it to become
Jan 3 2019,negative,horrible terrible a garbage fire a betrayal ridiculous mindblowingly dismal an absolute and unmitigated failure rian johnson and kathleen kennedy should never be allowed anywhere near the star wars universe ever again this movie is a failure on every level a disaster an out of control runaway trainwreck shockingly bad a unique onceinalifetime disappointment traumatizingly unpleasant  it strains the mind to imagine how they couldve fumbled any worse
Jan 3 2019,negative,utter nonsense heavily laced with sjw preaching a shame to see a widely popular franchise fall so low
Jan 3 2019,negative,an abomination in the star wars saga that should never have been made
Jan 3 2019,negative,i think its the last star wars movie i will ever watch i was a huge fan and star wars is part of my childhood  but as long as sjw are running lucas arts all hope is lost
Jan 3 2019,negative,rian johnson is an atrocity
Jan 2 2019,negative,worst star wars film ive ever seen nothing in this movie makes sense
Jan 2 2019,positive,it was a very good and risk taking movie it was well written and had a very diverse cast giving oscar winning performances it was nice to see carrie fisher as princess leia for her final portal as the character and mark hamill returns as luke skywalker giving an equally great performance it was all around a good movie and if you are a true star wars fan you will have an amazing time with this movie i cant thank you ryan johnston and the casht enough for giving us such a quality film may the force be with you all  sincerely mark x smith
Jan 2 2019,negative,it took me an entire year to really understand what i hated about it the plot holes empty characters uninspired set design and disinterest in the overall lore are one thing but the true flaw is how i sat for two and a half hours waiting for anything to happen i waited for something to pay off nothing in this film is worth waiting for this is the episode you say not worth it the number of missed opportunities this film has is uncountable i gave one full star only because it does have one fantastic scene with r2d2 that is it
Jan 2 2019,negative,this was a bad movie the plot of it is essentially recycled from the older star wars movies except so much political correctness why is it that no one was allowed to question the female leader in command everyone was expected to follow her without question even though it seemed like a completely suicidal mission   the fact that rey is somehow a master jedi without any training is beyond insulting why did they kill off luke the most interesting person and why did they give so much airtime to rose and finn when their plot could have been taken out of the movie without any difference in conclusion its fine to have a diverse cast especially in a big universe but just to force political correctness is insulting the whole plot was just recycled and this should not be such a high score for this bad movie
Jan 2 2019,negative,kinda wish i could give a negative amount of stars it pained me to see my beloved series butchered in such a way between iconic characters from the past completely ruined in such a way that even the actors fundamentally disagreed with them to poorly choreographed fights this movie just did everything wrong screenrant nailed a lot of what was wrong with this on youtube but itâtms difficult to capture just how truly awful this was in a short amount of time anything under one hour in this case i am beyond disappointed
Jan 2 2019,neutral,it seemed like the purpose of this movie was to do away with what was built upon in previous movies in order to make some bland by the numbers movie some of the scenes didnt even make sense in terms of some of the characters motivations half of the movie was more or less wasted on a side quest that went nowhere at the end of the movie i didnt feel any kind of excitement for what comes next and didnt even bother seeing the movies that came after this one
Jan 2 2019,negative,this movie totally destroyed my love of star wars  i was so tired of it being defended and told that if i did not like i should not have watched it  well i certainly did not see it since and is the reason i did not watch solo in the theatre  why so late for this review  i finally saw solo at home and it was actually pretty good  it is a pity they threw away everything built up on in all previous movies for no apparent reason other than the jack ass director thought it would be a good idea and somehow someone let him get away with it
Jan 2 2019,negative,it appears that director rian johnsons intention was to completely destroy the star wars franchise as a whole visually the last jedi was stunning and yet the story was a slap in the face to long time fans following up on what directors jj abrams and gareth edwards accomplished with the force awakens and rogue one director rian johnson chose to ignore everything that was established prior to him taking the helm if disney wanted to open the franchise up to a great audience alienating the vast fan base was not how they should have done it
Jan 2 2019,positive,the best of the disney era star wars films the story will come as entirely unexpected and thats a good thing given the way the surprises pan out the run time is hefty but i found myself wishing for more at the end
Jan 2 2019,negative,absolute trash the plot was a mess rey was still an unlikeable mary sue like why was this made
Jan 2 2019,negative,rey is op finn needs more screen time rey has no ark and u cant connect with her i want rey to fail or at least join the dark side or die tho the actor of rey was amazing it was the script and there was a bunch more thats bs and a lot of star wars fan would agree with me the critics loved it but true star wars fans hated it its mostly just bad tho i kinda like the movie  a bit
Jan 2 2019,positive,not as good as force awakens and definitely no where the originals triology level but still better than the 90s prequels what i do like the chemistry of kylo ren and rey and it wasnt a dull movie    the downside of the movie is rey is a little over powered compared to past padawans but hopefully everything is explained in the next installment i also felt though luke wasnt true to character in this film
Jan 2 2019,positive,was pretty good made the force more spiritual and mysterious maybe could of been longer and shouldnï 12tmt of removed some deleted scenes i personally prefer lukeï 12tms depiction here over legendsexpanded universe while this is not the only criticism  a criticism of the film is luke considering killing kylo ren personally i have some counter arguments to this in star wars itï 12tms clearly shown that the force influences and almost control and force people similarly to taking drugs or being poccessed by some supernatural being to acts of violence rage revenge anger intensification of fear worry anxiety in the original trilogy luke feels this pull to consider killing a defenceless vader he kills what he believes to be vader in the swamp obi wan and yoda clearly state the force can influence people that if you let in to fer and anger the force only intensify a these felling into action in the prequel trilogy anakin is influenced by the dark side to kill sand people even the defenceless sand children the   next scene with yoda clearly shows the dark side is the cause of his actions beyond his control itï 12tms a supernatural force
Jan 2 2019,negative,this movie completely ruined the star wars universe butchered the characters we know and love and was just an all in all bad movie     the new characters of this trilogy have absolutely no direction narratively speaking and the old ones either do things that completely contradict their characters motivations in the original trilogy or are just cast aside unceremoniously rian johnson had no idea how to write these characters and left this movie in shambles  who is snoke why is the first order so big leia has force powers luke is a pessimistic hermit everything about this movie sucks except for the cinematography
Jan 2 2019,negative,this movie broke everything that is loved about star wars clearly the director doesnt love or understand star wars lore also building a trilogy without even an outline is a failure from the start i went in optimistic but came out dissalousioned
Jan 2 2019,negative,this was the first movie where i came out of the theatre feeling confused and conflicted i wanted to like it but after thinking about it i realized how bad it truly was     writing errors breaks in established canon errors in direction lack of attention to detail eg the ship count and position of the first order fleet changes from scene to scene plot inconsistencies between this film and the last plot inconsistencies between this film and the rest of the saga plot inconsistencies within this film itself unexplained established character inconsistencies lack of character development etc this film also to its detriment attempts to subvert audience expectations just because it can     you can tell that the new sequel trilogy is being written on the fly with no overall plan for the story after all how is it that rian johnson could be allowed to throw out almost everything that jj abrams set up in the force awakens and end his movie in a way that felt like the end of a trilogy instead of the middle movie
Jan 2 2019,negative,absolutely garbage full of plot holes bad writing and uninteresting characters effects were ok but not enough to make up all the other flaws
Jan 2 2019,negative,dog shite beyond belief did some shit half arsed plot about low fuel which has already been done in the clone wars would have received 100 plagiarism on turn it in
Jan 2 2019,negative,this moviesaga adds nothing new to the saga as whole  sadly that holywood cannot create good movies anymore

Jan 2 2019,negative,really a star wars movie being this bad
Jan 2 2019,negative,very weak plot which doesnt make sense
Jan 2 2019,negative,this was so bad that i dont think they will recover from this failure thanks for ruining star wars disney the sheer amount of insults to fans like me is immeasurable and my night was ruined
Jan 2 2019,negative,destroys the entire saga for us fans not critics star wars is more than just subversive story and poorly planed characters we had theories excitement who is snoke who are reys parents what did reys vision mean what will luke bring to the situation turned out snoke is dead reys parrents are nobody anakinslukesreys lightsaber is now destroyed and luke is dead not to mention other stupid and un logical moves pulled by studios and heroes  all in all this could be okay if it is a standalone scifi movie but as an 8th installment of a franchise that has the biggest fan base in the world and had the best movies in the universe it is not worthy disneysucks ryanrethinkyourlife
Jan 2 2019,negative,nothing short of a terrible addition the franchise that shrinks the star wars universe with a shoddy attempt at being unique it tries too hard to modernize an ot feel but the plot remains a hot mess shoehorned characters bad writingdisappointing
Jan 2 2019,negative,sad its an example of how the disney executives have totally ignored and insulted the fans we are why star wars exists and yet those with a business obsession have successfully destroyed something special
Jan 1 2019,negative,i have never worked so hard to like or understand a movie the more i want tlj the more i hate it the story or director suffers from the dunningkruger effect rian johnson has a cognitive bias in which he believes that he is smarter and more capable than he really is essentially he does not possess the skills needed to recognize his own incompetence with this film theres fan films out there with better plots in short this is the worst star wars movie ever made
Jan 1 2019,negative,absolutely sucked poor writing no if any character creation and development and a very poor understanding of the star wars universe that was created by george lucas dont see waste of money

Jan 1 2019,negative,i still cannot get over that they did with luke skywalker
Jan 1 2019,negative,was disappointed how will the jedi survive if there is no jedi to lead them  and the resistance is bs and they did not explain anything about the new republic just destroyed it in the last movie i love all star wars movies  including rouge one but i hated the last 2 what a joke
Jan 1 2019,negative,an abomination of a movie that not only disregards the original trilogy characters but even ignores everything that happened in the previous movie people will cite the political agenda as the reason this movie is garbage but thats a minor issue it is just bad terrible dialogue the villains are a spoiled brat and a bad joke that was killed off because this director didnt want him in his movie or captain phasma for that matter great actress wasted in this film and so many other reasons that i am too jaded to list them rip star wars you can go join ghostbusters and star trek in the franchise wastebin
Jan 1 2019,negative,it is difficult to select half a star
Jan 1 2019,positive,ok writing 1 star  no character development cheesy dialogue splintered plot and lack of understanding of source material if only they spent more money on writing    superb production 25 stars  cinematography soundtrack costumes special effects and set design are all wonderful what you would expect from a disney starwars budget
Jan 1 2019,negative,looks phenomenal in many parts the rey and kylo story is the highlight of the film but all the writing is just so horrible that it still enrages me thinking about this movie
Jan 1 2019,negative,the movie was not just underwhelming but boring the plot is poorly laid out and there is a whole arc which has no purpose the actions of characters in power also make no sense it seems that the people are aware they are in a movie and it shows   that said the movie is beautiful one of the best visual movie of the year but i came for a story not shiny colors
Jan 1 2019,negative,what an awful film so full of plot holes and takes the story no further
Jan 1 2019,negative,its been over a year now and im still so disappointed in this film  theres nothing i can say here that hasnt already been said a thousand times by fans but it seems that disney isnt listening and doesnt care about the fans  i guess im done with star wars
Jan 1 2019,negative,stupid plot makes no dam sense dialogue is pathetic and again makes no sense  these people are lunatics this is a very very bad film
Jan 1 2019,negative,disappointing followup to an ok force awakens miles below star wars prequels but little bit better then sw holiday special
Jan 1 2019,positive,this was a great movie ï 12 12ï 12âï 12 12 different on and emotional level of what to expect on episode 9 this was more sensational on the emotional standard of star wars  although it may seem us star wars fans was not expecting it it was different for rian johnson to make it in a bold way  but not too bold  canï 12 12tmt wait for part 9 
Jan 1 2019,negative,extremely disappointing direction for the film to take  the first time i looked at my watch multiple times wondering how long until the movie would end  i think im done with star wars at this point
Jan 1 2019,negative,this movie is everything wrong with modern cinema
Jan 1 2019,negative,this movie is the worst movie in the franchise completely ruined by rian johnsons absurd sense of the force and a romance between finn and rose that would never work in a million years 
Dec 31 2018,negative,poor writing poor characters unrealistic decisions and abominable continuity
Dec 31 2018,negative,garbage humor werent the first order merely a remnant of the empire and not a full on galactic threat wtf rian johnson youre storytelling skills are bad the visuals are great but this story sucks 
Dec 31 2018,negative,when i left the cinema i felt like this was a great movie i think the visuals hipnotised me somewhat having seen it again  had time to think ive realised these disney movies have diluted what it means to be a jedi  be able to use the force  a lightsaber also the space chase is boring and is on one level as aposed to the 3d epic space battles in the original  even prequel trilogy speaking of which these new movies are making the prequels seem good there i said it  disagree with me casino scene
Dec 31 2018,positive,a new breath in star wars after the nostalgia of force awakens looks to the future of the franchise while embracing but not relying on its past
Dec 31 2018,positive,a genius film written by a genius man who understands star wars better than its critics
Dec 31 2018,negative,just an overall horrible movie from a legendary franchise  too bad nothing they could have done actually got done
Dec 31 2018,negative,looking for the emoji of a dumpster fire
Dec 31 2018,negative,makes very little sense with what has happened in past episodes this movie is a abomination because it destroys the star wars universe
Dec 31 2018,negative,disney ruined star wars
Dec 31 2018,negative,worse movie of the entire franchise no sense of direction and it appears to be a stand alone film as it throws away any plot points the force awakens had
Dec 31 2018,neutral,last jedi is a good movie but as a star wars fan it ruins the entire franchise for me it feels rushed and so many other so me other things but iâtmm to lazy to type it trust me there are still parts i like  for example  yoda   this is a good movie but not a good star wars movie
Dec 31 2018,negative,ruined the whole of star wars for me

Dec 31 2018,negative,shit movies love the series so much but this movies really sucks

Dec 31 2018,negative,utter garbage disney has ruined the franchise with this garbage i was fine with force awakens
Dec 30 2018,neutral,im giving it an extra half a star because they went through hell its a fine movie but it had some stupid points such as the fight scene in the throne room which believe me made me like the movie more but the choreography sucked the second time i watched it overall i just dont like the story it didnt seem like star wars and the universe its in and god i hate reylo fans but if you know nothing about legends its a fine addition to your collection
Dec 30 2018,negative,baffled at how this film got the greenlight jj abrams set up great plot points in episode 7 none of these were addressed in this film i love star wars but i hate this film lukes storyline was ruined reys potential heritage also ruined snokes potentially interesting backstory never explained choreography in the red throne room was awful terrible film would rather i never watched it and never plan on watching it again
Dec 30 2018,negative,im boycotting all new star wars until they retcon this movie
Dec 30 2018,negative,bad writing bad acting bad choices bad effects bad locations terrible director really disappointing
Dec 30 2018,negative,audience score is all that matters herethe brainwashed california and new york critics are telling us to learn to like these liberal propaganda filmsno thanks
Dec 30 2018,positive,a bold new direction for one of my favourite franchises rian johnson brings his agame with the direction and the cinematographer is a genius the subplot in canto bight while interesting and does serve a purpose could have been paced a bit better
Dec 30 2018,negative,bad plot all the way through destroys all the setup in the previous film
Dec 30 2018,negative,so heres how movie 9 will go for disney star wars     baddies show up   is instantly killed by x wing going to light speed    new dreadnought shows up is instantly killed by x wing going to light speed    kylo ren shows up is instantly killed by x wing going to light speed    the irony all of those save more lives than not doing it cause rebellion die so much    last jedi all those idiot bombers who died at the beginning   1 x wing suicide light speed could have fixed all that    end of last jedi either of those 2 ships they let run out of fuel could have ended it going ot light speed suicidally    force awakens the star killer base   1 droid flown ship going to light speed down the center of that things gun  could end it    well disney how are you gonna dig yourself out of this hole cause retconning previous movies you wrote yourself is just making the hole uglier
Dec 30 2018,negative,mary sue and the sjws
Dec 30 2018,neutral,one of the rare movies in this franchise that i like less the more i see it
Dec 30 2018,negative,if you enjoyed the previous star wars movies and the lore then you will most like hate this horrendous film
Dec 30 2018,negative,they did my boy ackbar dirty
Dec 30 2018,negative,this movie is a horrible abomination of an acceptable movie regarding plot charakters and storytelling i dont even want to start how incredibly stupid and amateurish the script is actually written this is not star wars this is a ton of crap with a nice score and beautiful pictures i guess they should have hired a capable writer and director instead they decided to create this most ridiculous and inconsistent take on a star wars story the world has ever seenand thats including those crappy endormovies from the late 80s
Dec 30 2018,negative,if you are a star wars fan i can guarantee this movie will disappoint you the jokes are bad it clearly has some kind of political agenda tied in with the plot making it very cringy and annoying to watch and the story overall goes against everything star wars this feels like a comedy movie just with a star wars skin and i was very very disappointed in luke the only thing that was good in the movie was the visuals which they are stunning but that couldnt save it
Dec 30 2018,negative,its time for the star wars films to end
Dec 29 2018,negative,competent filmaking terrible terrible terrible star wars film
Dec 29 2018,negative,easily one of the most disappointing films ive ever seen i was genuinely embarrassed taking my father to see this who saw star wars in the theaters in 1977 disney lucas films kathleen kennedy rian johnson and bob iger should all be embarrassed by this disgusting incompetence of a film i pray to all higher powers in this vast galaxy of ours that jj abrams starts the 9th film by saying that episode 8 was a terrible vision or something that could fit into a fantasy world if they dont do this in some fashion episode 9 will be a sloppy and terrible film i feel really bad for jj abrams for having his vision and set up thrown out the window by ruin johnson disneys terrible mismanagement of this once beloved franchise is resulting in fans leaving left and right so much potential instead we get a bad political message and a middle finger to the fans who have supported star wars through out the years we miss you george
Dec 29 2018,negative,the first 15 minutes or so during the opening space battle was really good after that i wish i had left the theater
Dec 29 2018,negative,absolutely awful completely ruined all the possibility and set up from episode vii
Dec 29 2018,negative,this was horrible somebody please let the bad lip reading people voice over this whole movie i think that is the only way i could ever sit thought this ever again
Dec 29 2018,negative,went to see the first star wars film in 77 as a young kid loved star wars ever since until this monstrosity appeared does not have the continuation of the current trilogy instead its been violated with pc propaganda and has killed off the characters who we grew up with and loved this is not star wars
Dec 29 2018,negative,all continuity of the saga up to this point seem to have been reset to star wars square one all signs of legitimate character development have been emotionally re molded to fit the metaphorical toy molds of the exact character traits  that fit the original series so well to trick the younger generation into getting the same feeling the original created  seemingly forgetting that lots of living human beings own physical and digital copies of the original star wars trilogy   that take place in the canon before the last jedi the writing was genuinely jarring to anyone who has seen any of those movies prior like everything has been reset could have done better myself 1 star because i dont want my review to be taken down by  d i s n 3 y
Dec 29 2018,negative,i dont think i can say other than say what others have said this is the worst star wars movie and one of the worst movies made
Dec 29 2018,negative,this movie is its just a migraine you truly feel the runtime trudge you along to such a terrible extent that you hate yourself for watching it its a truly terribly written mess that oddly prioritizes cool visuals and ideas over the integrity of the storytelling there are too many dropped plot points from the force awakens making it feel as if it isnt a sequel at all and the characters are just terrible theres no investment to be had in any of their storylines and even one of the most iconic characters in history luke skywalker is just completely butchered through unfathomable inconsistencies for the purpose of advancing the theme of the movie and its tragically written narrative in conclusion as a long time star wars fan this movie hurts as a viewer who watches movies critically and takes  importance with storytelling its a headache for the average thoughtless popcorn viewer entertaining visually stunning and high level production   but sadly thats just where it ends   this movie or rather now this franchise is a beautiful disaster   time to set the reset button better luck next time
Dec 29 2018,negative,not luke cringey and shallow
Dec 29 2018,negative,awful just utterly awful who was in charge of this mess should i care what happens next it seems like the creators of this movie were trying to kill off any interest in star wars seriously terrible
Dec 29 2018,negative,what happened really every plotline ignored zero character progression in fact some even go backwards so much bad it has easily knocked episode 1 from bottom spot of star wars films
Dec 29 2018,negative,i do not have enough time and energy to list everything wrong with this film its terrible
Dec 29 2018,negative,it made absolutely no sense in the context of the previous film rian johnson was a bad idea
Dec 29 2018,negative,good cinematic movie horrible lore and story wise
Dec 29 2018,positive,the last jedi a compelling and necessary sequel to the star wars saga
Dec 29 2018,negative,the worst star wars movie ever episode 1 is a masterpiece compared to this piece of shit of movie
Dec 29 2018,negative,destroyed the star wars universe rian johnson should be held accountable dor this mess
Dec 29 2018,negative,regardless of the many other debatable aspects of this movie it is indisputable that the plot has bigger holes than the death star
Dec 29 2018,positive,rian johnsons film the last jedi is a fresh addition to the star wars saga although the film presents occasional flaws in the storyline it is ultimately an intriguing and enriching story cinematography and visual effects were executed brilliantly lukes arc shows us how he deals with his failure in a very humane way the romance between finn and rose was lacking chemistry to a degree and ended up being rather cheesy acting and direction were done very well and the visual effects were practically perfect john williams soundtrack added an extra sense of epicness to an already epic story overall an entertaining film that embodies the star wars legacy
Dec 28 2018,negative,ï 12º ï 12âï 12ï 12 russian bot here to shit on your movie
Dec 28 2018,negative,the absolute worst star wars movie ive ever seen i was excited going in to this movie because the force awakens wasnt that bad granted it had its moments of stupidity this movie disregards the rest of the films and decided to rewrite characters and how the universe works a third of the movie was a waste of time and added a character everyone hates not the actresses fault please dont screw up episode 9 and please remake this movie so it isnt a pile of trash
Dec 28 2018,negative,this movie took hot garbage to a whole new level i have idolized the star wars legacy since i can remember and this movie completely disgraced me and many other star wars fans this movie was way worse than the christmas special i wish i could meet everyone who contributed to the entire design of this movie so i could at least get a better understanding on why this movie turned out so rancid disgusting and terrible
Dec 28 2018,negative,the worst film in the series by far the plot is littered with holes and the subplots are frustratingly bad the films treatment of its most popular characters is pathetic and the new characters introduced were forgettable the only decent part of the film was the visuals of the supremacys destruction
Dec 28 2018,negative,this is the movie that ruined star wars for me
Dec 28 2018,negative,space comedy this was a really bad movie
Dec 28 2018,negative,while the force awakens promised great things for the star wars sequels the last jedi undoes its work as well as that of the original trilogy
Dec 28 2018,negative,as a star wars fan i hate it  i have to say the story is idiotic  too many plot holes in the story  an example might be the whole section of fin and rose travelling to canto bight casino can be cut out and it will no difference to the story line  a waste of  45 mins just to give something for characters to do     the character is just horrible  captain plasma need i say more  waste of talent and characters
Dec 28 2018,negative,this movie was terrible especially for a long time star wars fan  i could not believe how bad it was and will not be going to watch another one  it was cheesy and a big disappointment  too bad as i was looking forward to this movie  garbage
Dec 28 2018,negative,jj abrams set the sequel up to be the easiest to make with the greatest potential this film has a great cast with an awful script awful screenplay and awful logic     this film has to be without a doubt the biggest disappointment in the industry to date     ok fine i dont mind the porgs
Dec 28 2018,negative,utter trash propaganda at its worst
Dec 28 2018,negative,its crazy how bad this is i prefer to assume that both this and episode 7 do not exist
Dec 28 2018,positive,one of my personal favorite movies of the 2010s besides iron man 2 the acting is amazing and the characters are fantastic
Dec 28 2018,negative,terrible what happened to luke ugh
Dec 28 2018,negative,rian johnson lack of awareness to the saga mythology character motivation and grand story is painfully obvious and the last jedi ends up being a total embarrassment that not only kills any sense of wonder and hype built in tfa but also tarnishes the image of the iconic characters of the original trilogy
Dec 28 2018,negative,incoherent sjw garbage that ruined star wars and the eight film in the saga this movie is so bad id pay to see a remake as i cannot accept this trash as part of the series luke was way off from the character we knew and loved from the original trilogy and the total mess of strong female characters overshadow the story itself with a massive gut feeling of a leftist political agenda behind the scenes i strongly recommend you avoid witnessing this massive mistake and misuse of cinema
Dec 28 2018,negative,this film is hot garbage which has been overinflated by the egos of hollywood icons in the pocket of disney it would have been a good film if it wasnt for the terrible writing and direction which occurs at the very start of the film where it thematically does a 180 degree turn not once not twice but four times in a row within the first 15 minutes if you dont think that might be jarring the character development arks arent much better eg my twin sister died sacrificing herself for the values we both believe in but hey since your a guy ive known for what collectively only accounts for a day or two im going to throw that all out the window so i can get laid if your looking for a good scifi film with lots of action and a good narrative it definitely isnt here and the special effects whilst pretty dont save this one
Dec 27 2018,negative,i cant belive itthis is not real disney what have you done smh you ruined star wars noooo
Dec 27 2018,positive,there are two things a disney movie needs a moving plot and dazzling visuals its a shame the last jedi could only chose one of these  55
Dec 27 2018,negative,a controversial film that should not be controversial it was a convoluted mess had some cool moments for sure but they kept adding too much or unnecessary parts to the plot or not enough in terms of development it was all over the place star wars fans deserve better filmgoers deserve better
Dec 27 2018,negative,utterly garbage movie that butchers charachters and lore
Dec 27 2018,negative,a year later and iï 12tmm still disappointed saddened angry and confused at why decisions were made with these characters and movie direction etc i know everything has been said and covered extensively on this i guess i just wanted my voice heard as well at my disappointment with my most beloved franchise
Dec 27 2018,negative,lot of plot holes beginning doesnt make sense resistance destroy star killer base and the first order should be weak and almost destroy i feel like i missed a movie
Dec 27 2018,positive,this movie felt new and exciting with many twists and turns which made me stock with the movie
Dec 27 2018,negative,this is not star wars at best its star trek and even that is insulting trek
Dec 27 2018,negative,this is a star wars movie for people who hate star wars it is what luke bryant is to country music or what juan williams is to progressive politics  i am just baffled that so many critics and faux fans are willing to pretend they like this terrible movie as part of a political game played  at the expense of the star wars fandom this movie was made knowing that fans of the original series would not like it it was a torpedo across the bow of the culture wars an agent from orwells 1984 kicking your teeth in and telling you that bad is good you must like this movie because the women are right and then men are wrong and being a white male is basically a crime against the universe
Dec 27 2018,negative,how is it so hard to make a good star wars film they have a simple premis with relatively simple characters its the pop  you make a movie out of the title crawl from empire yet still get it wrong    edit i watched this movie again yesterday and i still feel tge same i can kinda get luke so that doesnt bother me as much as most other viewers unfortunately ray is still an unbelievable and unlikeable mary sue and every other character was just poorly written as if the previous movies never existed  the only way this movie even becomes a 510 is if you look at it as a stand alone and even then you have to ignore the obvious politics badly written characters weird cuts and a storyline that leaps rather than flows
Dec 27 2018,negative,though it may arguably be the prettiest  best shot star wars movie to date the story and character logic was jarringly off it loses extra points for making the retread first order even less feared it also threw away any chance of a exciting conclusion to look forward to infinity war is an excellent example for how to have a crushing defeat caused by mistakes that subverts expectations not this
Dec 27 2018,negative,complete lack of followthrough from force awakens
Dec 27 2018,negative,the last jedi in my opinion is not a bad film its an annoying film as a fan of star wars for the last 20 odd years i have enjoyed all the films in their own way even the phantom menace however the last jedi while beautifully shot in some parts with great special effects and a beautiful score   fails in its most fundamental task  at being a star wars movie i think we all got a bit concerned when the main star of the franchise since its beginnings comes out and says thats not my luke skywalker     so why is it annoying theres a few things     1 a huge part of the plot is pointless and im talking about tbe canto blight scenes with rose and finn the only thing this does story wise is introduce a character that ends up causing more damage to the resistance than thw first order has managed all film     2 they ruin a beloved character now i know why some fans either live this bit or hate it i was ok wjtb it at first then thought about it a bit throughout the original trilogy luke has tbe ideology of a child  everything will be ok he keeps this througout the films and even keeps thus idiology that there is good in people right until tbe end eventually redeaming his father in this film it turns out he tried to kill his nephew as there was darkness in him even though his father was a dark lord of the sith and was redeemed apparently his nephew was too far gone     3there was a plethora of new characters all of while served no purpose  rose leads finn on a mission that gets them in contact witb a criminal that ends up selling them out to he first order holdo keeps her plans from finn so that he sends rose and finn on their mission all ultimately dooming the resistance     4 character chemistry that was created in the first film is neither expanded not used finn and rey the standout characters from thw force awakens have all if 30 seconds of scree  time together in this film new characters that are introduced have no chemistry with the current ones rose and finn have this rushed forced relationship thrust upon them that just seems shoe horned in so that there can be some love story to continue on    now there were some good points especially the holdo sacrifice scene this was a beautiful scene however if she had actually acted when she should have a lot more ships would have survived the score as always was top notch     at least we know that episode 9 cant be any worse can it
Dec 27 2018,negative,i want to punch ryan johnson in the face
Dec 27 2018,negative,well done progressive hollywood you have now ruined star wars add it to your list
Dec 27 2018,negative,will someone more powerful than me kill off star wars please    these prequels and sequels should never have been made just because theyre profitable doesnt mean theyre good fils they arent
Dec 27 2018,negative,by far the worst star war i left the theater on opening night wanting my money back im a huge fan of the series but this movie makes me question my own existence
Dec 27 2018,negative,very poorly written boring movie too many plot holes to count a high speed  chase through space that crawls at a snails pace leah on a couple minute spacenap slowly floats thirty feet back to a ship that is traveling at an extremely high rate of speed and should of left her thousands of miles behind
Dec 27 2018,negative,social justice warrior propaganda mainstream feminism propaganda i really hate what the movie industry is doing with all these new movies  im not paying to watch these bs movies anymore
Dec 27 2018,negative,this movie left little to my and others imagination on what will occur in the final entry into this 3 part saga it effectivly sttunted the progression of the story for the movie that will soon proceed it utterly flawed is how i would describe this entry though it did try to chart some interesting roots for the story in the end the movie favored shocking the viewer over producing a quality experience in conclusion incredibly dissapointing star wars movie
Dec 27 2018,negative,the worst star wars film of them all  even the prequels have more to redeem them than this pile of nonsensical rubbish
Dec 27 2018,negative,felt like the film wasnt written by someone who knew what they were doing it tears down pretty much all of the work that the previous film builds and leaves very little to follow its less science and more fiction with weird boat physics being one of the many cruical plot devices there are some really good scenes but they are very short lived and for some reason in the middle of the film rather than logically at the end the story around those scenes is very staggered mostly unrelated and i think it was trying to be funny but was disappointing to watch the out of character mockery there is actually a yourmom joke it felt like characters were going to learn some lessons but only two of the characters actually showed any development and others had even regressed after their development in the previous film
Dec 27 2018,negative,plot holes non sequiturs shameless non self aware preaching and moral grandstanding sjw characters and no respect for six loved movies before it the last white guy is a shocking example of what weve turned into
Dec 27 2018,positive,the last jedi is an interesting case while this is easily the most beautiful star wars film ever made some of the plot points and characters feel out of place and the tone seem scatterbrained at times regardless of these flaws this newest addition to the star wars saga still remains a fun time despite some noticeable flaws 
Dec 26 2018,positive,an incredible addition to the stories with plenty of twists that keep the series fresh a lot of other movies suffer relying far too much on nostalgic elements and a very predictable formula that fans have become far too comfortable with this movie is great because it takes so many risks and calls into question the values that star wars has established in the past with characters consistently failing to follow such as the entire jedi order to those who say this is out of lukes character you have to remember this movie takes place 40 years after the events of return of the jedi you let me know if youre the same exact person in 40 years
Dec 26 2018,negative,worst movie ever created  rian johnson needs a lightsaber through the head disgusted what he did to this franchise my brother has lost hes love for star wars because of this piece of crap  the one movie i wish that could be remade with new script and director should never allow rian to make any movie ever again  would love to punch him in the face
Dec 26 2018,negative,is it bad that i want the bad guys to purdge the galaxy of this monstrosity seriously what in the hell are the good guys even fighting for
Dec 26 2018,negative,this is sacregidge to star wars full of political propaganda and stupid bathos
Dec 26 2018,negative,i dont understand the critic consensus of delivering all the emotionrich action fans could hope for it seemed to me that this film did exactly the opposite numerous points in this film seemed to abandon the lore of predecessors or present as unbelievable strange or questionable turns of the plot many of the long time fans of the series left theatres with unanswered questions how do you wholesale lose the confidence of the most faithful fan base in all science fiction fantasy i think this should go down as the worst star wars film ever made and an example of how not to continue a franchise
Dec 26 2018,negative,this movie was absolutely atrocious
Dec 26 2018,negative,1 star because it has some elements of a good film  the effects and the acting by the daisy adam and mark hamill  however there were so many faults with the plot character arcs force surprises that just cant be overlooked  this was the first and only star wars film ive ever seen that made me seriously question why i loved star wars so much  even the prequels with their stilted dialogue and lack of a convincing character arc for anakin i still managed to like overall  however this one is pretty much garbage throughout
Dec 26 2018,negative,almost fell to the dark side and punched the screen 15
Dec 26 2018,positive,dont know why this film is so hated sure is defied every fan theory and made its own legacy but the last jedi is a star wars film that dared to try something new and it paid of well
Dec 26 2018,negative,the force is strong with me i lasted the whole film without punching the screen 15
Dec 26 2018,neutral,worst star wars movie ever made with sjw hints all over the place
Dec 26 2018,negative,definitely the worst star wars movie ever created but it was bad even beyond destroying the star wars franchise ï 12 it was a terrible story and it ruined any chance for a future storyline by killing all the foreshadowing set up in the force awakens i hope and pray this is the end of both kathleen kennedy and her puppet rian johnsonï 12tms career and shame on you disney for allowing this beloved franchise to be raped by these whoremongerï 12tms sexual agenda
Dec 26 2018,negative,think about it this movie takes place 18 hours following the last movie in last movie finn couldnt fly now he is suddenly with no training is an expert pilot they are chased at light speed with first order firing on their shields yet finnrose can take a trip to a planet for several hours and then magically return to the ship still being chased and blasted on by the first order nothing in this movie made sense and they trashed lukes character angered and spurned away the fans
Dec 26 2018,negative,terrible movies all around
Dec 26 2018,negative,a 2 star rating mostly visuals and music but all the rest like characters side plots a many the horrible treatment of lukes character the very slow pace and well pretty boring plot were bad i would only watch out of curiosity if you get the movie for free or a second hand store do not buy from official places i would say even pirate this movie there were things i liked in it like the star wars force stuff but no good jedi fights snoke getting taken donlwn like a punk ugh was horrible they built him up and let me down frustrated most at lukes treatment hes the answer to all the jedi and bringing balance to the force not a crotchety old man that drinks himself dumb hes never been the anti hero hes the light side of the force the best of the jedi but nope they put it all on mary sue rey to solve all the problems     oh yeah i forgot also how they treated lea in the movie too she gets killed and blown out into space and literally force saves herself last i remember she never had that kind of training she literally deus ex machinas herself to the ship i was like what is this really happening i had to laugh at what i was watching its supposed to be dramatic and tense but no it comes off as absolutely ridiculous     over all i didnt like it didnt hate it but didnt like it either if your interested pirate it or watch it on a streaming site or get it from the 2 dollar bin at a second hand store
Dec 26 2018,negative,simple remake without inspiration or passion
Dec 25 2018,negative,hot garbage see screen rants last jedi pitch meeting on youtube for all the reasons
Dec 25 2018,negative,i have not heard anyone say a nice word about this film and you will never hear me say a kind word for it half a star is among my most magnanimous gestures not by choice if i could give this movie a lower rating i would
Dec 25 2018,negative,felt like i was watching bad fan fiction the plot was kind of absurd and the characters dull and predictable think ive finally just about had enough of star wars now
Dec 25 2018,negative,oh dear  from a story perspective this film was weak  the only tension was waiting and waiting for something epic to happen and this soon turned to epic disappointment when nothing did  they pulled a lot of surprises in this film  like the untimely death of snoke  but these werent enough by themselves to make the film exciting and there really was nothing else  the sfx fell flat for me too  they tried too hard to be bigger and better than previous sw works without any coherent reason for being so  some of the battle scenes didnt even make sense like the resistance bombers that relied on non existent gravity to deploy their payload and the unreasonable damage that was done to an entire fleet by what looked like a simple ramming maneuver  when it came to character interest things got even worse  the writers treated the old characters with utter contempt luke and leia turned into bit players and a joke and the new characters with complete indifference rey just stood around for most of the film or followed luke on his island like a lost lamb poe and finn did the sum total of nothing  the only memorable character from this film was the annoying asian lady and that was for all the wrong reasons  she was this movies jar jar for sure  in fact the entire poefinnasian lady subplot should have been thrown in the bin and replaced with more focus on the interplay between kylo and rey which was the only interesting part of this story  i wont cover the politics angle because everything has already been said but suffice it to say turning a film called star wars into an antiwar film was a pretty dumb thing to do  sorry but after watching tlj i walked out of the cinema thinking that star wars is done  unless episode ix gets good audience reviews i wont even bother seeing it
Dec 25 2018,negative,this movie is a disgrace and an absolute insult to the original trilogy even the phanton menace is a masterpiece compared to this bad hack attempt at storytelling it undermines much of the interesting setup from the force awakens and leaves me with absolutely no reason or desire to see episode ix it demonstrates a real lack of understanding of how the physics of space work or how the force works it treats beloved original trilogy characters like absolute garbage and wastes opportunities to pick up threads opened by the force awakens and expand on them where are the knights of ren why have luke do such a cool thing to avoid actually figting in a battle only to die afterwards why is rey so powerful without training why is the first order so powerful why is the resistance so weak 1 star for special effects and music other than that the movie gets nothing for plot nothing for character development nothing for understanding the laws of physics nothing for understanding how the force works nothing for any background on how snoke came to power why rey is so powerful without training how the first order came to power and why it is so powerful why the resistance is so small and so weak this movie really is a waste of time i left the theatre with no desire or reason to see episode ix since none of the questions presented by the force awakens were answered in the last jedi why would i waste my time seeing episode ix where they probably wont be answered either
Dec 25 2018,negative,i finally watched this i can only say that i didnt like the previous one and knew this was going the wrong way and boy was i in for one of the most pointless movies ever with a useless plot and the dumbest death of one of the most beloved carachters in movie history just dont even waste your time on this one avoid at all cost hell rewatch every other star wars trilogy or prequels they are wayyy better that this piece of rubbish
Dec 25 2018,negative,compared to the previous movies i did not like the new ones at all
Dec 25 2018,negative,the movie contains some pretty good and badass scenes like the throne room fight or the lightspeed crash scene
Dec 25 2018,negative,so much wrong with this movie clumsy story line with huge holes a massive disappointment
Dec 25 2018,negative,they killed all the iconic characters too bad
Dec 25 2018,negative,this is just horrible it really ruined star wars for me poor and horrible story with a boring 30 minuted casino useless act i feel this movie was made just to angry people and instead of accept criticism and move on disney blames fans for the hate this movie created just dont watch it save yourself from the embarrassment
Dec 25 2018,negative,rogue one gave fans hope for the franchise but this movie was just trash useless story lines  useless characters that no one cares about  no questions answered and luke skywalker oh my god dont get me started there this was a complete waste of time  disney finally killed star wars 
Dec 25 2018,negative,wasted my money  critics dont know what we like
Dec 25 2018,negative,an absolute disgrace and a testament to the evil of identity politics the corruption of social justice and the disease of corporate globalism in our current time
Dec 24 2018,negative,took everything that was built from the last movie and tossed the ideas in the trash the whole rose and finn connection was dumb and uterally pointless just like the casino situation following it why would holdo hide her plans from the rest of the crew nothing would of been lost from it unnecessary just caused pointless mutiny luke was uterally pointless if he wasnï 12tmt in the whole movie nothing would of changed killed him for no reason at all just so many things wrong
Dec 24 2018,negative,i think its terrible the things they did to luke and how ben is weak rey is strong terrible writing and character creation and building lightsabers dont chop off limbs anymore and they are not important like they were in the 6 movies and series and hundreds of books before the whole movie get half a star just because of good cgi and nothing more
Dec 24 2018,negative,at this point even the greatest shills have to admit that beyond its sjw fassade the last jedi is nothing more than a visually stunning hit piece on everything that was star wars     beloved characters got humiliated and are wasted in a subpar storyline full of plot holes and ideologically driven events    this movie is not just a disaster by itself but a disaaster to the overall franchise the subsequent box office disaster of solo says it all    star wars is in big trouble and episode ix is unlikely to save it    the star wars franchise now sadly needs a reset to have fightimg chance to heal and get back on its feet    shame on the people responsible for this mess at lucasfilm and disney
Dec 24 2018,negative,this was my least favorite of all the star wars films
Dec 24 2018,positive,i thought this was an excellent movie it was very creative and full of surprises the star wars universe was rendered much less black and whitegood and evil which created space for far more nuanced characters and motivations which is more interesting i had been curious about snokes backstory and just what was he so his abrupt delish was a touch annoying to me other than that the film delighted me      the little cute bird creatures were unnecessary but if you must have something with little kid appeal it beats having ewoks using sticks to take down storm troopers    5 stars
Dec 24 2018,negative,by far rhe worst movie of the franchuse thanks disney for ruin all the canon will watch all the future sw movies on pirate  torrent versions
Dec 24 2018,negative,i only gave it 1 star because the algorithm ignores half star ratings
Dec 24 2018,negative,worst star wars movie ever and ruined the trilogy
Dec 24 2018,positive,i really enjoyed this movie
Dec 24 2018,negative,this was a star wars episode
Dec 24 2018,positive,i loved every moment of it but my favorite scene is when the asian saves the black dude that could of saved everyone
Dec 24 2018,negative,i am not one to usually post a movie review but this is a really bad movie bad fight scenes which make no sense like slow bombers in this age of star fighters to stupid dialogue to dumb and regurgitated plot lines to senseless dialogue uggggh just one insult to the audience after another  love star warsbut this was awful trash see it once if you must but it will be waste of time disney better get its act together and stop the politicswe just want a good fun movie not a lecture
Dec 24 2018,negative,the worst star wars movie
Dec 24 2018,negative,the most pathetic poorly written inconsistent franchise killing movie you can imagine  finally a movie that is not a better love story than twilight
Dec 23 2018,negative,utter disrespect and total disregard for star wars when they killed off luke in the least honorable way that is not luke he would never give up fuck you evil sith disney and paid off critics
Dec 23 2018,negative,looked good yet was not and from flying leias and the dreadful  portrayal of luke to the general poorly executed script and plot left me feeling why was such a train wreck given a green light
Dec 23 2018,negative,when indy directors decide to make their mark on a movie series that didnt need it
Dec 23 2018,negative,that isnt inspire the real star wars has elements but dont have the essence rian johnson is a mediocre
Dec 23 2018,positive,thought this new edition of the star wars saga was much better than those of a few years ago  bringing back original cast members worked and there werent any characters that irritated the crap outta me  loved some of the visuals too
Dec 23 2018,negative,what da hell is this bullshit 
Dec 23 2018,negative,tfw most of these audience reactions are bots or spam    anyways i was really hyped to see this movie after watching the force awakens i was ready to see this movie well i did and the results are better than the force awakens first the visual effects are improved from the tfa tljs visual effects from explosions to motion capture they are excellent i definitely liked the effects after holdo light speed kamikaze against the star destroyers the characters are on the bland side i do like luke leia rey kylo snoke finn and poe but some of these new characters like rose or holdo lack character development and are eh characters the plotline is better than tfa rather than fighting over some map btw who the hell created that map this plot involves the resistance escaping from the first order and rey on ahch while most of the plot is good some of it involving finn and rose on canto bright doesnt need to be 20 minutes long rian couldve easily cut some parts on canto bright the action sequences are spectacular especially the scenes on crait and snokes throne room i really enjoyed the duel between rey  kylo against the praetorian guards while finn and phasmas duel was rather disappointing and too fast the acting of this movie is really good mark does a good job with his role adam and daisy also do a good job with their roles i like the humor of this movie funnier than tfw from poe and hux to porgs most of the humor is amusing and hilarious and last but not least the plot holesplot twists some of these are really shocking including leia using the force through space and kylo killing snoke luke trying to kill kylo however i dont buy it also i think there are too many of them like the boy using the force at the end but whatever    end score 45  the last jedi was an improved entry from the force awakens highly underrated by fans i recommend rewatching    edit rewatched the movies a few times and it is terrible still better than tfa but just barely im glad tros saved this trilogy
Dec 23 2018,positive,a very good addition to star wars universe that brings brilliant writing good acting twists and a new hope to a galaxy far far away
Dec 23 2018,negative,i think we all know why it sucked so much i cant believe i watched it
Dec 23 2018,negative,complete fucking abomination poor script story telling and just an absolute disgrace johnson and kennedy need to be removed from this butchered franchise id give it zero stars if it would register but it doesntï 12 12therefore one star and to add this is just about the worst mainstream movie in the last 40 years
Dec 23 2018,negative,disney star wars its not star wars its garbage
Dec 23 2018,negative,stupid agenda of the americans and disney to put so much diversify the cast im brown indian  but why to unnecessary push these political agendas in movies there are plenty of movies where i love the different casts like django unchained lara croft etc theyre original with their leads so many movies where i love mexicans and blacks etc but why to spoil star wars apart from that why this rey girl is so perfect its like watching disney movies ohh right its a effing disney movie man even the prequels were better than this bs
Dec 22 2018,negative,ruined the entire franchise
Dec 22 2018,positive,some people do not understand star wars and then there are people who do thank you rian johnson
Dec 22 2018,negative,its hard to walk away from the film feeling like youve gained much in the way of intellectual stimulus granted maybe thats not what youre hoping to get from the movie maybe you just want visual entertainment in that case youll love this film because thats all it really offers just like going to see a fire work show intriguing sights and inspiring sounds is what you get the film is extremely lacking in genuine character development or just generally good story telling my overall feeling after viewing is still why does any of this matter
Dec 22 2018,negative,hated it worse star wars movie ever it made the force awakens look good would rather watch a star wars movie where jar jar binks was the main character
Dec 22 2018,negative,destroys everything great about star wars
Dec 22 2018,negative,this movie destroy the saga
Dec 21 2018,negative,ruined my beloved characters littered with weird plot holes and murdered star wars establishes physics i do not consider this a star wars movie simply a transformerslike film with flashy lights and high budget admittedly aesthetically pleasing graphics
Dec 21 2018,negative,i finally went ahead and watched again after i was so disappointed with it at the cinema and guess what the last jedi is definitely not like a fine wine it is a horrible movie that destroyed the legacy of several key figures it introduced several useless characters and had several story lines that made no sense or didnt add anything at all and dont get me started on dropping bombs in space and turbo lasers having trajectory arc in space ridiculous
Dec 21 2018,positive,rian johnson took a big risk and it paid off the movie is a ton of fun with great acting all around daisy ridley and oscar isaac are the two best performances in my opinion but again the cast was really impressive the movie was shot beautifully and the fight scenes in particular were jawdropping a really really fun movie to see and one that will please the fans if they give it a chance there is one sequence that its a little drawn out and doesnt work very well but the rest of the movie is incredible awesome installment into this saga
Dec 21 2018,negative,if negative ratings were allowed you could count on one from me
Dec 21 2018,negative,the movie was just awful extremely disappointed in the direction this director took the story
Dec 21 2018,negative,not only was this movie complete garbage but it spits in the face of everything that came before it which for a sequel movie that is 8 of 9 moviesthe penultimate installment splits the fandom in half because it creates plot holes throughout the whole series if i could give this less than half a star i would why because not only was this movie awful but instead of sweeping it under the rug like most production houses would disney has spent the past year attacking the critical fan base name calling having their underlings write hit pieces in garbage media magazines disney has failed in one of the simplest business rules the customer is always right as a company you have forgotten that and you will continue to cause malice among the fans until you make an honest effort to smooth things over
Dec 21 2018,negative,the worst movie ive ever seen
Dec 21 2018,negative,late to comment but outraged for a year now may rian johnson be banished to the spice mines of kessel for how well he honored the star wars sages rich legacy
Dec 21 2018,positive,yes i am fully aware that audiences have very polarizing reactions to this film but i personally loved it
Dec 21 2018,positive,i loved this movie and it is probably my favorite sw film while it is not perfect it still maintains that sw feel dont be swayed by all the negative comments see it for yourself this film is different while it still does the empire  return of the jedi storylines like attack of the clones but better cant wait for episode 9 loved this movie so much the critics were right
Dec 21 2018,negative,poor writing the charaters development was very weak seemed like the movie went for to many cheap gags
Dec 21 2018,negative,a true star wars fan would hate this movie it just has plot twists at every corner finn is about to sacrifice himself but nope rose goes and saves the day
Dec 21 2018,negative,an incoherent mess full of plot holes
Dec 21 2018,negative,even prequels were better then this  way better 
Dec 21 2018,negative,very bad movie ruined star wars
Dec 21 2018,neutral,theres not much to say that hasnt already been said about this movie  is it horrible  no absolutely not  did it feel like star wars  it did at times and those moments make the last jedi soarbut theres just not enough of that  whats left is a film that spends too much time and effort trying to shock its audience than it does growing the saga at hand and then trying to overcorrect with the alltoofamiliar that serve to remind us were watching a star wars film when we shouldnt have to be reminded
Dec 21 2018,positive,given time and more rewatches this could become my favourite film in the star wars saga    does exactly what was needed and brings a new and fresh take to the galaxy far far away while still giving the legacy characters their moments to shine
Dec 20 2018,negative,simply horrible it ran a plot hole at light speed through the entire star wars universe
Dec 20 2018,positive,almost perfect loved it
Dec 20 2018,negative,i will put this down below the ewok movies this was the worst star wars movie i have ever seen ever single plot line that we were looking forward too since our childhood the writers flushed down the toilet   this was supposed to be epic like empire strike back answering questions and the crowd leaving no way instead we left with no questions because the movie said  all your questions dont matter the physics of this movie were terrible the story was nothing but a boring car chase in space this movie seem to have a great climate seen every twenty minutes then the exact opposite happen making the movie worse the story of episode 8 was basically gotcha  lastly they just wrote out the last of the remanding character in this movie the is no reason for a part 9 part 9 story should be about leia and what real happens to luke that is star wars all these new characters are just side characters to this long story and the writers have forgotten that
Dec 20 2018,positive,i love this movie so great and if you are a hardcore fan of star wars you will love this one also luke is amazing and mark hamill does an amazing job
Dec 20 2018,positive,not the best star wars but not the worst by far it takes a whole new spin and star wars changes what you know
Dec 20 2018,negative,the last jedi is a disgrace to the star wars franchise heres why the movie wants to be the empire strikes back so badly but still couldnt deliver it had too many ï 12twistsï 12â and i say ï 12twistsï 12â because after a while you could predict what was going to happen there were probably 11 large twists which get annoying the reason the ï 12i am your fatherï 12â scene was good because we didnt expect it there were probably 3 twists in all of the empire strikes back and in the end the bad guys won it subverted our expectations this movie did the opposite the movie was directed by rian jhonson who screwed over any plans jj abrams the director for the previous movie had for the characters ï 12daisy ridley says jj abrams laid out a plan for the last jedi and episode 9 but rian johnson discarded itï 12â express jj abrams probably had an arch for his characters to follow but rian jhonson disregarded it take fin john boyega for example there is a scene in the movie where he ï 12killsï 12â his biggest rival his previous commander captain phasma gwendoline christie from this point there is no real place for finns character to go in the next movie as a result he is on a suicide mission to save the resistance in another scene by flying his ship into their cannon but as we have seen before there is a plot twist which we all expected his friend rose tico kelly tran stops him by crashing her ship into his this was not a surprise as i said we expected this which leaves the next director in a conundrum what to do with finn even though finn is one of my favorite characters killing him off is what they shouldve done it would have been an amazing end to what could have been an amazing character dont even get me started on admiral holdo laura dern who never once shared her plan with her crew not even when she was faced with mutiny did she try to explain her plan what was she so scared of an imperial spy like come on d
Dec 20 2018,negative,completely disappointing as a sequel to the force awakens and just as bad as a standalone movie make a whole new trilogy if you want a new story otherwise please dont cut the legs off the story arch created in a previous movie this is why so many hate this movie including myself horrible writing and story continuity
Dec 20 2018,negative,this movie was a mess the worst part was how they ruined luke skywalkers character  beyond that it was just bad filmmaking  and way too much social justice sermonizing
Dec 20 2018,negative,well this movie made a rather soft and a little overnostalgic attempt at a soft reboot into a mess 1 star only because im really interested in how will try to fix it in the sequel this film as it is doesnt fit star wars and would if it wasnt in the franchise just be a weird kind of boring sci fi flic that really got some major tonal issues and seems based on a humor i just dont get aside from leia flying through space and the speech of rose to fin about saving the ones you love while the gate is melting away those scene were hillarious
Dec 20 2018,negative,terrible movie with a bad story and universe ignoring plot
Dec 20 2018,positive,this movie is the most well made star wars movie for me love most part of this movie but there is still some part of the movie annoys me
Dec 19 2018,negative,should be retitled mary sues wild ride or the last story breaker or rose tico a portrait of fascism or  laura dunham garbage trader or the laststar wars movie ill ever spend money on
Dec 19 2018,negative,the last jedi features action sceneslocations that resemble the prequels a story that never appears to go anywhere and silly moments in which the most implausible or ridiculous of events occurs by the end of this movie i felt as though nothing was accomplished outside of me not looking forward to more star wars films
Dec 19 2018,positive,a lot of people hate it because it doesnt conform to their fanfic
Dec 19 2018,negative,terrible not original idea in it full of pc sjw crap a lot of sequences were woefully unbelievable just in terms of why the heck would they do that a moron would know not to do that it is a shame so much plastic will be in the landfills from the trashed blurays
Dec 19 2018,negative,cons poor writing not a star wars movie had a political agenda really bad acting thanks for ruining luke   pros great visuals and audio
Dec 19 2018,negative,i waited a year after watching this film before reviewing it i let it sink in as a piece of art as a piece of entertainment and as a cultural milestone before writing this review i wanted to make sure my point of view wasnt influenced by the real poison of the altrightish reviews or the fanboygirlpersons gushing over it also i wanted to not let my own nostalgia for the original trilogy get in the way because it was getting in the way something serious up until now so here goes    this film has no character development and no clear climax stuff just happens in space with space wizards doing space wizard stuff also some animals were freed from captivity while slave children were left in slavery wow how this film ever got made ill never know    i took my daughter to see this film because i thought shell be able to see women in central roles rey leia maybe even rose but i was wrong so very wrong rey did little to nothing save one fight with kylo which didnt need to happen leia was comatose most of the film and then rewarded the person who led a mutiny against her chain of command wth and rose was like hey im rose there was nothing for her to identify with in this film she was seven and didnt know if she liked the film or not she never asked for a sw toy or wanted to play makebelieve within the context of the sw world thats pretty bad if you ask me    the rest of the film was either forgettable or so bad it hurts your head to figure out tlf is a super terrible film one star and im sticking by it
Dec 19 2018,negative,star wars  the last jedi is the latest creation of a pettyminded middleaged jealous kid whos trying to make a name by destroying the lifes work of a real visionary with politics and social justice ideology anyone who disagrees has to look at mark hamils face when he realizes after the premiere that this kid has just killed his character just to prove hes on the longer lever mark has repeatedly tried to warn the fans during the filming and that should bring him this smallminded revenge anyway the child has managed one thing he has brought his name on everyones lips and no matter how the star wars francise goes on you will never forget him and his deeds if he tried to gain immortality in this way he somehow succeeded
Dec 19 2018,negative,god the prequels were better than this
Dec 19 2018,neutral,the finnrose side quest was boring at best the only reason to see this movie is the kylorey throne room fight scene and the very emotional on screen goodbye between mark hamill and carrie fisher
Dec 19 2018,positive,its pretty fun movie with questionable moments but with fantastic action and characters its a good time
Dec 19 2018,negative,what should i say critics you sck
Dec 19 2018,negative,crappy movie  bad movie
Dec 19 2018,negative,alright where to start  what is dumb the opening scene bombers are stupid in so many ways none of it really mean anything  reys training its not and her solo lightsaber shit would get her killed by one decent fighter  casino planet all of it its dumb and a giant waste of time  phasma wasted useless  admiral purple a condescending bitch who should not be in charge of anything literally getting most of her people killed because shes a moron  what is bad rey rey is a terrible character who cannot close her mouth or really emote and is a helluva mary sue who can just do thingsbecause no aim no ambition no real difficulty except for maybe five minutes  rose rose is a character that im just not sure why shes there the most significant thing she does is teleport somewhere she should not be and nearly kill finn then kiss him zero chemistry zero reason for her to be alive  all military tactics anyone who has picked up a history book about war read it for like twenty minutes could outdo every single person in this film as long as they had average intelligence these tactics and ideas are mind bogglingly illogical    overall this film looks really nice sounds great and sucks in every other area
Dec 19 2018,negative,horrendously terrible acting stopped watching after 15 minutes of cringe
Dec 19 2018,negative,visuals and cgi were very good  acting was very good    story character development backstories all garbage  horrible star wars movie
Dec 19 2018,positive,i think this movie gets way more hate then it really should you have great twists and great action that holds you on your edge of your sit i think it deserves the score critics gaved it die hard sw fans will bash at this movie just because it ruins the sw lore that is not the case there is still a lot you can do with this franchise my only problems with it were the scenes that were repeated such as the throne room showdown that is almost identical to the one from return of the jedi and the luke plot points were way to complicated for me other then that a great movie again this movie gets way more hate then it really should since criticality this is a good movie
Dec 19 2018,negative,what a shitshow they really broke the whole saga totally cant beliefe all the plotholes that got through quality assurance  dont watch it if you ever want to enjoy star wars again  thanks for nothing disney
Dec 19 2018,negative,an absolute disgrace single handedly ruined the franchise
Dec 18 2018,negative,corporate media produces predictably uninspired politically correct drivel as usual
Dec 18 2018,positive,i see the cycle of hero villain and the journey
Dec 18 2018,negative,destroyed what could have been a great finale to the series
Dec 18 2018,negative,this was a terrible movie poor storytelling time wasting scenes and dull plot points abound the director should be ashamed of himself the film has no connection to previous starwars films to the point that it is jarring
Dec 18 2018,negative,a failure to not only rival but exceed the prequels the only thing that i can give this cinematic blunder is mark hamills acting the beautiful animation and cinematography and the score the confusing hole ridden plot and flimsy mary sue of a main character ruin the movie to think we abandoned the expanded universe for this
Dec 18 2018,negative,this is  such a bad movie poor script and most of the acting was underwhelming the message some lines presented to us  were idiotic  kill the past just obey and pictures with burning books   especially for a germanl like me  evoke really bad moments from history without giving them a sattisfying meaning for our present time if not for star wars there was on the whole no redeemng quality i would never  like to see this garbage again i  really do not know what the so called critics have learned or studied maybe they have just  a bad taste disney i would recommand you to sell the franchise to somebody with a better managemand and sufficient artistic skills    on hte other hand maybe its is simply  true that hollywood in generell does not know any more how to entertain nomal people well obviouly we cannot write symphonie like mozart any more or skapespearean sonnetts maybe the time is just over     one wish i do have let the old characters out heroes  alone put your hands off from polititic propaganda because some characters in last jedi were pure feminist or   philisophically speaking  even worse nihilistic propaganda
Dec 18 2018,negative,this is the worst film in the history of the universe  johnson is the worst filmmaker since cave drawings were a thing  this movie needs a full retcon  the critics are out of touch  the audience knows what we like and this isnt it
Dec 18 2018,negative,absolute garbage as a film in general and as a part of the star wars saga
Dec 18 2018,negative,question would you eat a burger that looked amazing but tasted like literal trash no you would not
Dec 18 2018,negative,so many opportunities missed sad to see the franchise has become unnecessarily crammed with social justice propaganda so much for a galaxy far far away
Dec 18 2018,negative,it is a good film on its own but is not true to the trilogy it reached my expectations but they were low hopefully the next film will make me love star wars like i use to
Dec 18 2018,negative,worst movie ever just signed up to downvote this
Dec 18 2018,negative,worst movie in the history of movies
Dec 18 2018,negative,it was just so bad it was clearly to rushed the humour was adolescent and out of place for a star wars film it works in marvel but not here the acting was really bad compared to the first one and it tried so hard to make you emotionally attached to the cast but just failed laura durn just comes across as a gross rude biatch and lets not even get started on the forced diversity rian johnson would ne much more suited to filming kids movies where substance and quality isnt as important
Dec 17 2018,negative,worst star wars movie definitively has placed this last trilogy in the dumps 
Dec 17 2018,positive,i liked a lot about it the main thing i disliked was rose  also to the people complaining about reys parents apparently not being important people whatsoever im pretty sure its a fake out and that kylo was just lying to rey when he said that i could be wrong but thats my thoughts anyway
Dec 17 2018,negative,never before have i left a theater angry before  all elements of the story that the force awakens left any true star wars fans looking forward to were aptly cast aside in favor of ridiculous plots and virtuesignaling      this movie was the worst thing that could have ever happened to the star wars universe and one of the biggest missedopportunities in ours
Dec 17 2018,neutral,great visuals horrible writing and story telling
Dec 17 2018,negative,ruined my childhood
Dec 17 2018,negative,wtf this movie could have been so much fucking better i love star wars and when this movie was announced i was excited to see one of the best movie heroes  luke skywalker  back in action again but instead hes a crotchety old motherfucking coot this whole mother fucking movie is an sjw fuck fest filled with crylo ren leia poppins  and marey fucking sue i honestly dont know what else to say about this pile of shit that is clearly not star wars that hasnt been said already a much better title for this fuck sjw fest is disney wars the shit jedi i really fucking hate this movie and for this reason since i cant give this piece of shit zero stars im just going to give this shit hole a fucking half star after i saw this film i was done with star wars untill kk and ruin johnson are out of office im fucking done with disneys version of lucsfilm and star wars until they finally get their shit together
Dec 17 2018,negative,why do this to luke why do this to leia dont do this to the fans
Dec 17 2018,negative,one of the worst movies ever made in context of the star wars universe
Dec 17 2018,neutral,could and should have been way better
Dec 16 2018,neutral,wasnt that good and was to long
Dec 16 2018,negative,not entirely bad the kylo  rey story continues to be compelling but overall this is the second worst sw movie after phantom menace absolutely zero payoff on the story arcs built in force awakens several completely useless characters like rose dj holdo and phasma     just a terrible star wars movie
Dec 16 2018,negative,the last jedi really detracts from what has made star wars good before as it eliminates key plot points that would have made the ninth movie better and was overall a damaging movie for the franchise
Dec 16 2018,negative,one of the most visually and amazing sounding films it has one of the most disappointing stories that has set the wheels in motion to bring down the biggest franchise  focusing more on being politically correct this film scrapes all previous rules in a world built over the last 40 years and rips off many other films trying to be original i feel sorry for jj abrams he took the massive star wars pressure and restarted the franchise with a familiar story with lots of stories that needed to be answered only to have rian johnson shit all over them i honestly have no idea what we are supposed to be looking forward to in the 9th film jj has his hands full please dont let rian johnson back in the building again
Dec 16 2018,negative,insulting to fans of star wars
Dec 16 2018,negative,if possible i would give it zero stars     it was a beautiful film     dozens of plot holes i question if rian johnson has ever seen a starwars film before because this was not one     it was painfully slow paced it didnt make sense how this happened more moments after tfa characters choices didnt make sense     it was trash
Dec 16 2018,negative,this movie was plain awful
Dec 16 2018,negative,it was frustrating to watch this series get hijacked by the radical feminists  having luke get cucked and having the purple haired lady ruin the movie has basically undone all of the good parts of the entire series  luke is killed off in the most useless way han is killed in an even more ridiculous way and leia is obviously winding down due ot her reallife death  its a just a mess
Dec 16 2018,negative,i am a huge star wars fan and even loved the prequels but this is by far the worst film that i have ever witnessed
Dec 16 2018,negative,i really tried to like this movie it was visually stunning and beautiful and every frame was flawless sadly that is the only good thing about this sorry excuse for a star wars film the political input plot holes and destruction of the original trilogy characters is so egregious that i honestly dont even think my love for this franchise can handle it i watch movies to be entertained and to see an interesting story unfold not to be subjected to propaganda and porgs
Dec 16 2018,negative,so bad i have just seen it once and i cant see it another time
Dec 16 2018,negative,painful to sit through  the professional critics must be being payed off unless theres another explanation why theyve collectively lost all judgement taste and reason
Dec 16 2018,negative,the first time i saw this movie i was into it but felt uneasy about the writing specifically the character work of luke after sitting down and watching it again i found myself finding more and more holes usually multiple viewings bring out the good that you missed the first watch but the last jedi is the complete opposite the throne room fight scene with two guards that simply dance off screen and wave the poles around leia in space rey lifting rocks to save the day holdo the main cast not interacting with each other at all the millions of dollars put into the visual and audio work cover it for a little while but underneath that is just a bad movie
Dec 16 2018,negative,well  a truly rotten movie nothing makes sense  just a very good marketing product that hype and nostalgia managed to hide the mediocrity
Dec 15 2018,negative,horrible what they did to this movie with left wing crap
Dec 15 2018,positive,now initially when i first watched it i didnt really know what to think  and therefore i went along with the negative backlash however after watching it again with some friends i realised that its actually quite a well thought out clever film  with over arching themes and character arcs  regardless if you agree with them or not  i understand the criticism but i think people are taking this too far  for example this film isnt really pushing a political agenda  anything that may suggest that is more due in part to episode 7  i think the most prominent criticism is directed at this film when it should be to 7 instead  not to say that this film is free of criticism in fact there is lot to complain about especially if you are a star wars fan and you grew up with the original trilogy however i dont view these things to take away from the overall quality of the film so therefore im giving credit where credit is due  this film actually put some thought into it suppose to the force awakens which was more big flashy explosions regardless if you agree with the decisions in the film or not they did try  which is better than nothing 
Dec 15 2018,negative,looks really good an john williams did an excellent job  but besides these cosmetics this movie is a shame to every other star wars film out there
Dec 15 2018,negative,just awful breaks all the old characters and makes them look selfish or bitter or just goofy and the new characters is either a mary sue or a space janitor that effectively adds nothing of consequence to anything no seriously anything he tries to do to help doesnt help he ends up getting captured and gets busted out by movie magic like a code breaker being in the cell next door or a ship going into hyper space as he is about to get killed but honestly these movies are a huge let down to see there was absolutely no plan whatsoever with this franchise reallly shocks me with how well the marvel universe has been managed
Dec 15 2018,negative,honestly just the worst movie ive ever seen in the cinema highlights everything wrong with disneys corporate takeover of the star wars franchise this movie doesnt exist to entertain it exists to make money never watching this abysmal pile of dung again
Dec 15 2018,positive,despite it being the most polarizing film of our time the last jedi fails in many areas but delivers scenes so beautiful and emotional i simply love it
Dec 15 2018,negative,worst star wars film ever made
Dec 15 2018,positive,while its another dazzling special effects movie with a team of thousands of animators and the budget to match the characters lost some of their integrity and core the disgruntled luke reys insane jedi gifts without any real training and many other inconsistencies caused the movie to plod on longer than it needed to be were left with a completely broken rebellion most of our favorite characters dead and only the idea that this insane battle will go on forever without ever really conquering the empire knowing that is the case makes any future episodes a bore not the best feeling leaving a movie and certainly not even close to the campy ending of the original star wars but its still fun to watch 40 years later the last jedi wont be remembered in the same way
Dec 15 2018,negative,but he don even say that ya girl rey wasnt the freaking las jedi so whatï 12tms with the name
Dec 15 2018,negative,almost unwatchable havenï 12 12 12tmt been able to see solo and wonï 12 12 12tmt watch the 9th movie because of this terrible mess of a movie and i aatnin live to watch all of the other star wars movies really sad to see how pathetic a wonderful franchise can get
Dec 15 2018,negative,im giving this 1 star because its a star wars film but thats all    this garbage is on par with the star wars holiday special for how it trashes the legacy of the original films  and while the holiday special as well as splinter in the minds eye demonstrated that lucas was prepared to go low to make a buck were 40 years past that now and somebody at disney and lucasfilm should have identified the issues they were creating with this film and changed course same way they did with solo and rogue one    all we can hope for now is that jj can pull the rabbit from the hat and somehow retcon the last jedi in the same way rian johnson used the last jedi to retcon the force awakens    my suggestions and i hereby relinquish all rights and claims to these ideas are that  1 rey must be a skywalker  the episodes are about the skywalker family history  reys parents are luke and mara jade who became pregnant to luke but left before he could find out and then left rey on jakku to hide her from darth plagueis  either kylo was lying to rey about her parents or snoke planted a false memory in reys mind for kylo to see the same way he planted a false vision in kylos mind for rey to find  2 snoke turns out to be darth plageuis nicely tying the sequel trilogy to the prequel trilogy  a tweet by pablo hidalgo denying snoke is darth plagueis does not  canon  snoke being plageuis would explain snokes backstory in one stroke and explain why hes able to do things with the force that nobody else has been able to do in any of the previous films  3 kylo or chewbacca must die  chewbacca will not let the murderer of his friend han survive and would hunt them down so either kylo dies or chewbacca dies or both die  4 rey is now the luke of rotj  her jedi mentor is dead she must construct her own lightsabre  she must suffer a loss though she didnt know luke long enough to form a strong bond  plus rian had his character so whiny and negative in tlj that rey couldnt have found him likeable  my vote is on finn dying  5 bring r2d2 and c3po back into the main story where they belong and make r2 in particular critical to the action  lucass original idea in the late 70searly 80s was that the two robots would be the only characters in all 912 episodes  r2s memory wasnt wiped at the end of rots so in anh and tesb hes definitely making noises and taking action to try to steer luke away from joining the rebellion and risks to his life but without success  just dont give r2 rocket propulsion  one of lucass worse ideas for the prequels  6 leave the way open for another trilogy in 1020 years  which will be about droid liberation  the droids are still slaves in this sequel trilogy so luke never did anything to progress droid liberation no matter how much he might have thought about speaking up for droid rights when he and the droids walked into the mos eisley space bar in anh
Dec 15 2018,negative,a disgusting and disgraceful entry into the star wars world poorly written terribly exercuted bad movie that should be called out for how bad it is
Dec 15 2018,negative,i went in to the theater to watch this movie from an objective standpoint and with an open mind neglecting that i am a huge fan of star wars i truly tried to view this movie as a cinematic experience separate from what i was familiar with and even with all of that this movie was absolute garbage i made a profile on rotten tomatoes because i hated this movie so much i felt i needed to write a lengthy review about this dumpster fire anyone who enjoyed this movie has no cinematic taste nor a love for star wars i hated this movie more thank i hated jar jar binks
Dec 15 2018,negative,ive heard all i want to hear about this that awful opening leia flying like superman luke being completely out of character holdo not telling anyone her plan roses utter delusion when saving finn i wasnt even particularly attached to star wars and even im kind of offended by what rian johnson did here when i saw the force awakens while i was painfully aware of how similar it was to a new hope i also wanted to see how the story progressed but it didnt progress the last jedi took everything backwards they should have just let jj abrams do the whole trilogy
Dec 14 2018,negative,worst star wars movie ever made and thatâtms saying something
Dec 14 2018,negative,the prequels were sadly better than this the director should never be aloud to make another movie because of how awful it is
Dec 14 2018,positive,so fun bursting with ideas
Dec 14 2018,negative,horrible story bad interpretation of star wars science took a great character and made him horrible and then there is roseworse than jar jar binks
Dec 14 2018,negative,how the hell did paid critics give this abortion of a movie 91  if this doesnt show that disney owns the media or everyone has a bs agenda nothing does this movie spit in the face of all the fans who have been there since day 1 rather  than tell a story the rain a hole wanted to push his agenda on the fans and gave us a steaming pile of crap his film has ruined star wars for me and many others thanks dick
Dec 14 2018,negative,bad bad movie 91 for rotten tomatoes seriously wow
Dec 14 2018,positive,it star wars not the kylo ren and rey show thought it was a great movie 
Dec 14 2018,negative,rip star wars your great narrative now only exists a long time in a galaxy far far away social justice has infected this once great story
Dec 14 2018,negative,worst in star wars franchise history
Dec 14 2018,negative,horrible story telling and terrible acting im done with the franchise
Dec 14 2018,positive,amazing film  i saw this on the first day and it blew me away
Dec 14 2018,negative,this movie fails on so many levels it fails as a star wars movie it fails as a sequel to tfa it fails at character development and it fails to be fun     every time i watch tlj i find another thing wrong in the movie so i dont even know where to start with all the problems it has even the prequels with all their problems didnt have the utter contempt for star wars that this movie has    all i think that should be said is that this movie just drove modern star wars into the ground and we need to stop enabling lucasfilm and disney into thinking they are entitled to our money just because they slapped the star wars label on a garbage fire like the last jedi
Dec 14 2018,negative,it was pk the story line was really bad the story arch was stupid i hope the next one is better or are they kill starwars
Dec 14 2018,positive,it was pretty good but there was a lot going on
Dec 14 2018,negative,worst dismay starwarsfilm ever  aaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh  i have seen it twise on big screen and sky it is worst secont time so poor bad script  the last jedi has a narrow minded view of space and give people with no influence or power too much screen time  the music and some effects were ok but were hacked and cut together in suck a way it seem to look outdated the film went down hill fast the casting was poor and didnt work bad cgi made it worse  the only actor who was ok was po the rest were trashing their prevous rolls in franchise even bb8 is now as usesless  as the snowman in frozen its like a bad wizard of oz remake with marypoppins   the villian is just a projection so cant be killed fin is lion po tin manbb8 totorey dorothy  and she cant get home
Dec 14 2018,negative,one of the worst films ever made when you consider the budget acting talent and universe available to rian johnson
Dec 14 2018,negative,i liked tfa but all the promise and potential set up in that film was squandered and sacrificed to rian johnsons ideological obsessions     an insult to sw fans and a truly abysmal miserable and depressing film
Dec 14 2018,negative,absolute garbage deliberate attempt to destroy the franchise in order to push the sjw politics down everyones throat no wonder everyone hates it
Dec 14 2018,negative,it destroyed all of the plot that was intended to be develop from the force awakens and just gave the finger to the fans of the original movies just because they focus on their feminist agenda and not in making a good movie lost my interest for star wars future films
Dec 14 2018,negative,stupidity in the form of movie
Dec 13 2018,positive,nobody seems to get the whole theme of the last jedi the theme is about failure what the film is trying to tell us is that every one fails or makes mistakes or gives up at some point in their lives poe failed to keep the fleet safe even though the resistance took down a dreadnought finn and rose failed to see djï 12 12tms true intentions rey failed to redeem ben solo luke failed to see how strong snokeï 12 12tms influence was on ben but it was lukeï 12 12tms sacrifice that gave the galaxy hope to fight the first order in the future was luke wrong to try and kill ben yes but he couldnï 12 12tmt do it ben was still family perhaps one day when the fanboys have a niece and nephew who look up to you youï 12 12tmll know what it means to love your family and not look for every lame plot hole as an excuse to hide your foul behavior behind failure teaches us to get back up on our feet and try again no matter what obstacles are in the way
Dec 13 2018,negative,this movie has been out for a full year and has zero approved quotes on rt terrible plot holes a complete disregard for 30 years of star wars fandom and a lack of any true story continuity as they attempt to switch to a woefully unprepared director forcefeeds social justice themes into scenes where they only take away from an already poweful message characters break their own plot and momentum     a travesty only buoyed by critcs assuming that hardcore fans would love it when they are the ones punished most by this abomination
Dec 13 2018,negative,i watched this in theatres when it came out just recently tried watching it again on netflix its horrible anybody who supports this film is obviously a sjw supporting the obviously political bias throughout the movie or paid off like the critics were here on rotten tomatoes that being said i dont mind politics as much as i do bad writing reverse character development massive plot holes mary sues and the wrong character dying its unbelievably terrible this movie isnt a movie and i will never consider it as such its a slap in the face to true star wars fans
Dec 13 2018,negative,visually stunning but terrible movie   the worst space chase of all time with pointless side quests and everyone was incompetent  neither my kids nor i care about episode ix now
Dec 13 2018,negative,i wish i could give this a zero no other movie that ive seen has evoked this response in me this film not only shits on every other star wars film up to this point but also leaves it in a place where it is impossible to recover critical heroes primarily luke seem to have regressed to embarrassing lows for no purpose except to inflate already completely over the top characters mainly rey not only is the character writing extremely poor its also completely incoherent more times than i can count a character will act in a way that makes no sense and goes against everything already established in their background    there are several painfully awkward attempts at humor that honestly feel bad it physically pained me to witness these flat jokes get delivered at the worst times in the worst ways since when is star wars a comedy anyway excluding jar jar    the villains in this trilogy are hopelessly inept there isnt even an iota of tension when the good guys have to overcome them im confident that an ordinary child from every day life would have a fighting chance to defeat the first order with no outside help    the political agendas of this film are so in your face its offensive even if you agree with them feminist and anticapitalism themes are bursting through every scene    i cant recall watching any other movie and realizing afterwards that a full 30 minute portion of the movie could have been removed with absolutely no impact to the storyline thats right there is a 30 minute chunk of this movie that is so irrelevant that if gone the plot would remain 100 unchanged    to be frank i am blown away by the staggering lack of quality such a large studio has produced in the last jedi i didnt think it was possible to spend so much money on a movie that makes every other movie associated worse merely by its existence    my final complaint is that the critics of this film were so clearly paid off the disparity in criticviewer ratings is nigh unprecedented to the point that its not clear whether they were watching the same movie this really hurts the credibility of both rotten tomatoes and imdb my expectations were set high after reading glowing critic reviews even going in with low expectations would have disappointed grievously
Dec 13 2018,negative,this is by far the worst movie of the star wars franchise its political message and man hate were of epic proportions
Dec 13 2018,negative,i grew up with the original trilogy playing with the toys and pretending to be a jedi  when i was in my 20s i saw the prequels which were admittedly flawed but i still watched them multiple times and enjoyed them  the sequels have none of the optimistic fairy talelike magic of the original the last jedi looks good visually but it makes little sense has characters with little charisma and tries to be too smart and stylish at the expense of the franchises spirit
Dec 13 2018,negative,its been 1 year since ive seen this just wanted to help the world remember how bad it was
Dec 13 2018,negative,i thought the prequels were as bad as star wars could get boy way i wrong  this movie had about 30 minutes of good story the rest is force fed garbage there is so much wrong with it i dont even know where to start so i wont just google some reviews
Dec 13 2018,positive,as a life long starwars fan and reader of most of the books i have to say i loved this movie anytime i thought i knew what was going to happen something unexpected happened if you read the books it was not a hard thing to imagine luke getting pretty dark
Dec 13 2018,positive,i dont know that ive ever had a more satisfying film experience in my life thus far except maybe since watching the originals as a kid but this time i got to see it in the theater for the first time on opening night to feel genuinely surprised as an audience member is a rare thing these days and they managed to capture that mystery and wonder of star wars while also letting the franchise evolve and breathe and subvert expectations it was a treat and a substantive meal at the same time and if it were playing at my local theater this afternoon i would kick off work to go buy a ticket instantly
Dec 13 2018,negative,this is not star wars stupid made up force powers a bunch of mary sues and a boring plot  it gets half a star because the throne room lightsaber fight was cool hopefully episode 9 will be better because i enjoyed a force awakens and i like rey
Dec 13 2018,negative,this was hands down one of the most beautifully stunning movies in the star wars universe  each shot had its lighting and coloring meticulously choreographed to convey themes and dazzle the eyes    unfortunately this wasnt an avant gaurd independent film designed to use imagery as the primary means of story telling  johnson clearly had a series of stunning images in his mind and then threw up some flimsy character breaking reasoning to shoehorn the movie into the scene  as a result fans have been left to do johnsons work for him and are ardently defending the movie by writing the script for him      it was also predictable that this movie caused so much division  the third wave producers have gone out of their way to broadcast in interviews and every chance they get that they will be focusing on sjw issues but rather than presenting the issues and examining through various organic scenarios they just slam their beliefs one after another in your face  the impression you leave with is that they clearly hate the fan base and believe them to be all a bunch of misogynistic sexist racist capitalistic bigots that need some women to take over because men sure are dumb but we love them anyways  its the sort of presentation that puts you off even if you agree with their stance    the pacing was off the interactions were off the tone was all over the place  if you took away the star wars name and instant love it generates this movie would be as loved as sky captain and the world of tomorrow
Dec 13 2018,negative,this was not a star film
Dec 13 2018,negative,weird every page of these ratings seem to have just the right amount of 35 star reviews by people who have only rated this or a group of star wars movies almost like the audience meter is being artificially propped up well heres my half a star for this trash can fire of a movie wont make a dent but i hope the score goes to 1
Dec 13 2018,positive,an excellent addition to the star wars universe   rey and kylo are much more realised characters and their dynamic together works excellently the choice for luke to be a very different person to when we last saw him in return of the jedi was a good one it makes him more interesting and realistic after a thirty year period  the effects are of the ridiculously high standard weve come to expect from disneys star wars films and the cinematography is state of the art  although this movie can feel a little bloated particularly in the subplot concerning finn and newly introduced rose it remains a highly entertaining visually stunning movie that takes a risky path a welcome change after the familiar and fanappealing the force awakens
Dec 13 2018,negative,this was a big fat morty 
Dec 12 2018,negative,it seemed like they made this film without even seeing tfa  finn and reys relationship is abandoned finn is just comic relief instead of being a possible jedi and kylo ren is even less imposing of a villain  snoke was a disappointment in every way  he could have been a solid villain but wasnt  and why even have luke skywalker in these films if this is what you do with his character  if he was snoke that would have been something interesting at the very least  tfa wasnt perfect but it layed the foundation of what could have been a good trilogy of films  unfortunately all that hard work was wasted
Dec 12 2018,negative,what to say  the absolute worst sw movie ever made
Dec 12 2018,negative,take that load off your back jarjar
Dec 12 2018,negative,as an xwing series and heir to the empire  thrawn trilogy fan i hate seeing this type of film and subpar writing doing such damage to a universe of unlimited potential  i fail to see how paper thin villains cringe worthy mom jokes and a dozen teeth gritting scenes advance the genre or expand the fan base  whats tragic is the amount of material and writing talent that already existed and was simply discarded as unwanted  i dont think a single objective person could read the timothy zhan michael stackpole or aaron allstons stories and not cry at the opportunities which have been squandered by the new trilogy    as a sign of my objectivity i graded rogue one 45 stars and solo 35 stars    my hope is this latest trilogy is simply spun off as an alternate universe and some of the great legends writers are brought onboard for story consulting and canonical veto authority
Dec 12 2018,positive,why the star wars fandom is so divided over the last jedi              star wars the last jedi had perhaps one of the most mixed reactions in audiences that a film can get  the film divided the fandom into a spectrum from those who hated it to those who loved the film  for me personally i enjoyed the deep themes the movie carried but had some problems with small pockets of the story  but how and why exactly did this occur  the answer in more complex than one might think                 the first thing that divides the fandom is the downfall of luke skywalkers character  when we last left off with the force awakens we see rey holding out a lukes lightsaber to with a desperate and awed look in her as if luke truly is her only hope  the movie starts with this scene being sharply interrupted with luke ignoring rey and disregarding the lightsaber  as rey persists asking to be trained luke continues to ignore her and continue with his hermit way of life  the reason this upset so many people is because so many fans had high expectations that luke would be this kind of ultimate badass savior that was going to fix the rebellion  people needed luke to be the hero that was going to save everything for them and in a way that was the rebellions hope too  but luke wasnt instead luke was just a crabby old hermit going nowhere  luke was back to living the life of the farm boy the life he once longed to escape  to some fans this was the ultimate disappointment and ruined the movie for them because they needed luke to be the hero  on the other side of the fandom however the fact that luke wasnt the hero is why they enjoyed the movie  they enjoyed it because it showed that our heroes are not gods they are people and they will fall and make mistakes and disappoint us  this is one of the reasons i enjoyed the movie because i saw it as realistic  no one should have had the weight on their shoulders that luke did and it torn him apart  and honestly if i was the last jedi and i had to try and save the rebellion and start a whole new age of jedi all by my myself i might have a mental breakdown too  the movie teaches us that not everyone can be perfect all the time and even the strongest most dependable people can face emotional and mental crisis like luke  not all heroes can live up to the pedestal they are always put on  and i think the movie is beautiful for portraying this theme                 this idea of being disappointed by your heroes continues when reys parentage is revealed  so so so many fans wanted rey to be a skywalker or a kenobi but instead reys parents were nobodies and i think this let a lot of fans down because weve been so used to people like the skywalkers the solos and the kenobi kenobi saving the galaxy fans have gained trust in their names  thats why when we found out that rey comes from no one fans were let down because they expected that if rey is going to be great she must come from something great  but that just isnt the case at all in this movie or throughout the entire franchise  in the end scene credits we see the lowly janitor boy using the force to sweep up the porch and look up to the stars with hopeful eyes  finn is stormtrooper who was expected to be nothing more than just a soldier but instead became a rebel hero  rose tico is nothing but a mechanic and ends up risking her life for the rebellion  all these characters are nobodies but they become something more  and what do we see from our expected heroes  we see luke who has fallen apart and refuses to be a hero  we see ben solo who has fallen to the dark side and become kylo ren  we see those who are expected to be heroes fall into nothing  and those who are nothing become heroes  from this star wars teaches us two themes  one that our heroes will let us down  and two that a hero can come from anywhere and be anyone                 the next issue of story that most fans can disagree on was the major plot device used to keep the other characters occupied while the main story continued with rey luke and the kylo ren plot  finn poe dameron leia and new character rose tico are left wondering how the first order is tracking their movement across the galaxy  finn and rose embark on a wild goose chase of a mission that has a sort lets destroy the death star again feel to it as they escape to find the device directly  meanwhile poe leia and the rest of crew attempt to outrun the first order  they then try to find ways to fight against them especially after they loose a large majority of their crew in an attack that hospitalizes leia  this is highly obvious that this was just a plot device was created just to keep these characters busy and relevant to the story                 with this subplot of the story comes a lot of issues and concerns from fans  the first being admiral amilyn holdo  many fans saw her as very arrogant and power crazy character when she becomes leias temporary replacement  many fans were also up upset that admiral ackbar who holds the same office as holdo was not entrusted to carry out the secret plan created by leia  holdo a new character who has not been around for long and is no way a senior officer to ackbar  which out ranged a lot of fans and i personally agree with them that was kind of a dumb move on the writers part  especially with ackbar being such an iconic and beloved character i would have enjoyed more screen time from him instead of having him killed off   most fans including me also disliked holdos cocky arrogant behavior and the way she treats the everpopular flyboy poe dameron  though in her last scenes before her admiral death she pulls off the secret plan shed been hiding from the crew the whole time and gives the rebellion a huge win but destroying the huge fleet that been chasing them  however i argue her own death could have been avoided if she simply told poe and the rest of the crew her plan instead of hiding it from them for absolutely no logical reason  she could have been clearer with everyone about what they were doing and what was going on considering everyone was also risking their lives and would have saved a lot of time and more planning could have gone into it to prevent more deaths                 another problem character was rose tico  a lot of fans were giving her crap for trying to stop finn from leaving to find the tracking device because she doesnt know what hes been through  and theyre right she didnt know   i argue that rose was just standing up for what she believed in even if she was just a lowly mechanic opposing a rebel officer she was fighting for her life too and wasnt even going let finn a rebellion leader bale  and once finn explained to her what he was doing she gladly embarked with him on his journey  another large complaint with her is the fact that she messed up the fan favorite ship of finn and rey by becoming another love interest for finn  some critics would argue creating a love triangle builds drama while others argue this is simply an overplayed cliché  i personally like the intense drama it can build but i am personally rooting for finn and rey so i would lying if i said it didnt make me frustrated at the writers for disrupting the series main power couple  overall however i have to agree with critics that rose tico was a dynamic character and likable character as opposed to most fans who simply didnt like her for doing things that seemed to be natural to her character or anyone in her situation for that matter                 another large complaint about the movie from fans was that the big villain snoke was killed off too quickly  in both the force awakens and the last jedi snoke is hyped up to be an allpowerful allknowing evil being  rey and kyloren despite being on opposing sides team up to fight snoke  this scene is arguably one of the best in the movie and gave fans including me the iconic star wars action they craved after sitting through so much exposition  when kyloren outsmarts snoke and makes the final blow knowing that the series is a trilogy this raises a question to the audience of okay so whats next whos the bad guy now  rey and kyloren are then faced with a choice either join in good or join in evil  they both end up parting ways as rey chose the light and kyloren chooses the darkness  some argue that killing off the big bad villain loses audience hype for the final movie  however i would argue that by having kyloren be the one to outsmart snoke and kill him is kind of genius  this shows kylorens capabilities and potential and helps reveal him to be the true villain of the series  it also shows character growth as kylo was easily defeated by rey in the first movie who no training at the time to killing snoke the big bad leader                 after touching base on the controversial scenes i would just like to elaborate on what i consider to be one of the best scenes in the movie  this being the very last fight scene between the rebellion and the empire  the scene completely revived lukes character as a whole  luke used a force ability unknown to fans in which he had the ability to project himself in another location  which was a pleasant surprise to fans and critics alike including myself  luke uses this to charge kylos army without being hurt by a fly  this distraction allows for the rebellion to escape to safety  however using this ability uses the last of lukes energy and he dies becoming one with the force shortly thereafter  this scene was the most satisfying to everyone overall as we got an amazingly shot fight scene we saw lukes character redeem himself and we now had hope for the rebellion                 despite the a few natural storytelling pitfalls i enjoyed the movie overall and reflecting on the movie while writing this review i realized just how deep the themes of the movie go  i think some fans will never appreciate the movie for what it is because they dont see the deep themes the movie was trying to convey  all they see is the movies pitfalls and a screw up of some of their most favorite characters  when in fact their favorite characters like luke and kylo making mistakes is in fact perhaps one of the most realistic things to come from the movie  so this brings us back to our main question why is the fandom so split over this movie  though there are many reasons to love and hate movie the main reason i believe that divided the fandom is seeing some of our most beloved heroes fall off the pedestal we put them on  whether or not you think that makes them wussy or all the more human is for you to decide
Dec 12 2018,negative,the movie wasnt good it completely screwed up poe finn hux and luke the cassino scene was slow and boring the hyperdrive destroying the capital ships ruined star wars combat forever and leia tpose flying part was very stupid also in an effort to subvert expectations it left jj abrams without many of the plot threads he set up in force awakens like snoke and reys parents
Dec 12 2018,negative,there is nothing good about this movie  sjws ruin everything
Dec 12 2018,negative,this is not star wars saga is a fan movie
Dec 11 2018,negative,this movie had no redeeming qualities and spat in the face of the original trilogy
Dec 11 2018,negative,this absolute piece of crap movie shouldnt even be considered star wars canon the top critics should be ashamed of themselves giving this turd a fresh rating     we cant offend disney uhhh 5 stars  pretty much every top critic on this website    there are so many things wrong with this movie i dont know where to begin awful just awful
Dec 11 2018,negative,uninspiring unoriginal and ignores all context of the star wars universe
Dec 11 2018,negative,what more can be said about this dumpster fire of a movie and then the attempt afterwards to blame the fans for the absolute mess it contained news flash disney if people dont like your story dont accuse them of being sexist white male pigs because a lot of them may not be doesnt make me want to go and see the next film when youre vilified for justifiably criticising something ok so poor parts about this film the story for one it was disjointed incoherent filled with plot holes poorly scripted and filled with so many gotcha moments the whole film might be recategorised as a giant practical joke from moment one where jedi prodigy jake sky walker throws his fathers lightsaber away to the moment where rose tico robs horribly castrated finn of a half way decent character ark this film just has to spit on everything that you could attempt to love about it oh and canto bight the most pointless scene in the entirety of star wars clear lazy script writing someone obviously thought  i want to put an asian character in here and i already have this black guy that i have no idea how to use ima have them do some pointless menial task for half the film i find it ironic that we who disliked the film get called racists when the only 2 characters of colour were pushed to one side through the whole film anyway i could list more problems but my arms would fall off basic summary dont watch this film unless you want to be angry depressed and have a future that includes the headlines before turning the gun on himself
Dec 11 2018,positive,exellent visuals compelling characters and a story that wasnt afraid to deviate from the status quo highly divisive but i loved it
Dec 11 2018,negative,this movie is an emotional rollercoaster ride      first you are excited     next you start watching it and kind of just like it because its star wars     you start to notice within about 30 mins the story is really bad and that the whole movie is a really unsubtle leftwing political statement     after the movie you walk out kind of happy but shell shocked   within a few hours you start to think about what you just saw and get really angry   you start reading news articles and film critic reviews about how the movie is a master piece and its a minority of womenhating racist fan boys that hate it  which makes you even angrier    this movie ruined the franchise i didnt care about fan theories or the diverse cast  i cared that the movie wasnt an escape the story was absolute crap and that hollywood and the media has raised virtue signalling above honesty     i will never pay to see another star wars movie
Dec 10 2018,negative,oh where to start     the movie tried to hard to be funny i can appreciate a few funny parts here and there but got to the point where it felt like i was watching kylo rens undercover boss spoof on snl    tried to hard to be unpredictablethe killing of snoke reys background phasmas anticlimatic demise ect i get why youd want to keep the fans guessing and wondering whats going to happen next but this movie tried throwing us through so many loops it left us with more questions than answers and more disappointments than happy surprises theres point where you dont have to be too obliging to fan theories and being a chaotic mess that it was the film failed to find that happy medium    the main protagonist rey played by daisy ridley is well deserving of the title mary sue a character who is unexplainably good at anything put in front of her from flying the millennium falcon to mind tricking the storm trooper to lifting rocks and besting the main antagonist kylo ren and luke skywalker with a light sabre despite having no training if theres no challenge or hardship for the protagonist to struggle and overcome it makes them uninteresting    a few of the plots made no sense like the infighting in the resistance the attempted mutiny was unnesessary and forced    leias mary poppins in space was the dumbest thing ive ever seen that includes movies that attempt to be dumb for a humorous climax i was tempted to leave the theater    uninteresting characters rose finn holdo hux dj even kylo
Dec 10 2018,negative,i usually buy every star wars movie to watch over and over not this one if i do itll be just to laugh at with friends a very badly written star wars movie absolute joke
Dec 10 2018,negative,too many plot holes to count did disney pay for the 91
Dec 10 2018,negative,thank god for the mandalorian otherwise i would be done with new star wars not even my kids like this trash
Dec 10 2018,negative,what a way to drop the ball on a 4bn investment the sw brand was so strong that it was simply impossible to screw it up enter rian hold my beer johnson    all previously set up plot points were tossed out and werent replaced with anything new this might be a blessing in disguise for jj abrams as he tries to wrap up a story with a clean slate but a lot of viewers arent invested in where the trilogy is going is it even going seems quite directionless    multiple infringements on the sw universe and disregard of all previously established lore im not interested in the political clutter that surrounds the critics vs supporters man babies vs soy boys etc it is just simply an utterly poor movie in terms of story telling and as a pivotal installment in a trilogy it fails harder than anything has ever failed in human history    the star rating only goes towards the cinematography this movie is a visual feast the picture and sound are stunning one of the best i have ever seen
Dec 10 2018,negative,such a slap in the face to star wars fans destroyed everything luke skywalker stood for and trashed everything good about star wars i hate you rian johnson
Dec 10 2018,negative,now that mr hamill is done with whatever this is he can get back to more pressing business his voiceover work for dc also whats with mr del toro coming out of nowhere
Dec 10 2018,negative,an evening of cutting off skintags is more satisfying than enduring this hershey squirt of a film
Dec 10 2018,negative,a complete disgrace film franchises of this stature should be listed like building so as to not creatively destroy the very foundations upon which the saga sits
Dec 10 2018,positive,loved it excited to see where this finishes
Dec 10 2018,negative,story was bad a plethora of inconsistencies characters were terribly written visually it was as pretty as a post card and just as 2 dimensional no matter how much gold you use to wrap a pos it will still be a pos btw rt does not count 12 stars just saying
Dec 10 2018,negative,not even worth a cinema review
Dec 9 2018,negative,my expectations were certainly subverted 
Dec 9 2018,positive,i thought this movie was good sure there were a few plot holes but it didnt affect the plot a whole lot the main reason why people dont like this movie is because it didnt do things they wanted it went in opposite direction that everyone was expecting this didnt bother me that much overall i really like the character arc with luke the struggle within kylo ren and the feeling of being lost with rey i understand why people dont like this movie and i respect that but i personally love a lot about this movie
Dec 9 2018,positive,the movie for the fans leaves to be desired with a narrative that escapes of the standard star wars bringing an ignorant luke and that seems that it has not learned nothing during all this time the personages are well taken advantage of or as in the case of luke negatively but at the same time the film is visually beautiful and manages to bring the graphic essence of star wars as well as the perfect execution of the soundtrack of the master john williams
Dec 9 2018,negative,this sucked 45 audience vs 91 critics something is wrong with one or the other and it is not the audience that is mistaken
Dec 9 2018,positive,the best star wars film since empire
Dec 8 2018,neutral,visually beautiful intellectually thoughtful but sacrifices plot to explore too many social themes maybe there will be payoffs in 9 who knows
Dec 8 2018,negative,although there are many epic scenes in this movie the movie leaves fans disappointed because they never gave certain characters in the movie much character developement took new characters out of the movie too quickly and the fact that they put ports in the movie put they had nothing to do with the plot
Dec 8 2018,negative,movie is messy doesnt make sense and tries too hard to be marvel movies subplots get picked up and abandoned characters have no development major plot points dont make any sense ultimately it is clear that this was directed by an amateur trying too hard to set himself apart though some of this blame falls on disney for hiring him or really hiring more than one director for an entire trilogy all around a bad movie that tries to hide behind flashy cgi 
Dec 8 2018,negative,they ruined the franchise  nothing makes sense  its basically extreme feminist social justice propaganda  luke skywalker is like the opposite of himself and is completely ridiculous like hamil argued himself  the plot is stupid and character arc is not thought out at all and why the hell are they trying to be funny like its a marvel superhero movie  im never seeing a disney starwars movie ever again horrible in every way
Dec 8 2018,negative,the first that i saw it in the cinema i thought it has somewhat ok parts of it didnt make any sense at all but sure  rewatched it for the first time in ages yesterday with my boyfriend and i was bored senseless when you know the twists  the whole thing is just mindnumbingly boring and gives the film almost nothing to look forward to i was happy when it ended
Dec 7 2018,negative,completely awful moviefirst movie ive ever been upset watching so many things i could say just let down sums it up
Dec 7 2018,negative,wow wow nobody could have ruined star wars faster this movie sucked in every way but to have luke skywalker sucking milk from an alien titty says it all
Dec 7 2018,negative,this has been the worst star wars to date  they destroyed the character of luke and had one of the worst storylines ever
Dec 7 2018,negative,the only star wars thing it has is the title awful dialogues too many contradictions useless characters pointless scenes nerfed luke i felt very disappointed
Dec 7 2018,negative,confusing and inconsistent plot no character development bad jokes nice effects though
Dec 6 2018,negative,if you are satisfied with good visuals and have little attachment to episodes 16 you may like this movie  however if you grew up with 16 and episode 7 left you brimming with questions you were exited to have answered this movie will feel like a slap in the face
Dec 6 2018,positive,the more i think back the more things i find that i dont like about this movie but at the same time the more i realise these flaws ar just a small part of such a vast grand emotionally resonant movie some questionable narrative choices really annoy me but its strong themes of learning from failure solid acting incredible action rousing score and breathtaking visuals make for a wildly entertaining time and a wonderful addition to the star wars universe
Dec 6 2018,positive,the most underated star wars movie
Dec 6 2018,negative,it took a while after watching the film for everything to sink in and realise how much this movie has ruined the star wars saga there is so much i hate about this film from the bombers wrap drive sucide attack no reunite of han and luke the numerous events with disregard to the physics of space the more i think about it the more it sucks
Dec 5 2018,positive,the last jedi is a new experience of star wars which is dedicated to youth who sees the film as a modern version of great stories a great cgi animation as well as new and old characters of the saga which grow transcendentally although for an old fan it seems insufficient with plot holes and expectant villains like snoke who fall it is true in some points but in the end the film is surprising and creative
Dec 5 2018,negative,rip star wars  i will miss you
Dec 5 2018,negative,aight the movie was lacking the punch that the original star wars films had by throwing useless plot points at you that take up 14th of the movie along with technology still being the same after some 50 years this film is lacking for its critical acclaim
Dec 5 2018,negative,this is incredible disney has introduced admiral ackbar one of my favourite characters from the original trilogy you gotta love admiral ackbar everyone remebers its a trap admiral ackbar gets immediately  sucked out a window and replaced by a purple haired lunatic with no character development or likeability well frick this and many other moments felt like a slap in the face from the director rian johnson who basically created a high school  spin off of empire strikes back neglecting to make any meaningful contributions to character or creativity to better the health of the franchise oh and snoke is the worst villain of all time who wears a bath robe to a final showdown at this rate well be seeing marvelstar wars crossovers within the decade god help us a nice metaphor which suits this film the last jedi is a puddle on the side of the road going on and on because its really long but never going more than an inch deep into anything rip ackbar
Dec 5 2018,negative,what a shockingly bad film  disneys and rian johnsons treatment of star wars fans is reprehensible  im hoping this trilogy is discarded and rebooted properly as soon as possible  a real shame though  disney had a chance to do something great with mark hamill harrison ford and carrie fisher but sadly we will never get to see it
Dec 5 2018,negative,felt like the writers of this movie had not seen or did not care about its predecessor or the saga its a part of
Dec 5 2018,negative,2 years to get the slowest car chase in history
Dec 4 2018,negative,i felt violated by rian johnson metoo
Dec 4 2018,negative,if you want to watch an entertaining movie you might find this one good enough for you if you want a star wars movie move along it will break your heart
Dec 4 2018,positive,i love this film  not to get into any debate about subversiveness but it takes the next generation and improves upon the tenets of the old
Dec 4 2018,negative,was embarrassingly bad
Dec 4 2018,positive,this is a really good movie
Dec 4 2018,positive,interesting continuation of jj abrams revived series feels a tad too comedic at times which gives it a tone problem packs some interesting twists into the finale
Dec 4 2018,negative,really unfortunate  i dont think the director truly understood the source material rian johnson decided to do his own thing and painted star wars ip over it  the movie feels like a low budget  bmovie spinoff you find in the 5 discount bin at a retail store
Dec 4 2018,negative,i rather watch attack of the clones and the phantom menace again than that boring disgraceful scene on the casino planet
Dec 4 2018,negative,as a star wars fan i found this movie to be an insult to the legacy of the franchise the story was garbage classic characters were perverted and destroyed this abomination ended my desire to see anymore star war movies in the future
Dec 4 2018,negative,awful plotholes and wrought with political propaganda they have run out of ideas folks
Dec 4 2018,negative,how tf was this a good movie it was all crap and all she did was swing not even her lightsaber at a rock and now shes ready to fight the empire wow critics have such bad taste these days
Dec 4 2018,negative,takes a dump on the whole franchise
Dec 3 2018,negative,i would say about half of this films runtime does nothing to advance the plot and is made irrelevant shortly after happening finn and roses trip to the gambling planet was a particularly weird detraction from the main plot the other main i have is that the villains dont evoke any real fear or strong emotions from me they are weak and incompetent unlike darth vader boba fett or sidious i think the characters and are interesting in and of themselves but unfortunately the situations they are placed into are mostly bland and uninteresting
Dec 3 2018,negative,while the visuals and score were outstanding it is clear that the director had no respect for the audience the franchise or even basic writing principals    juxtaposing serious a thought provoking moments with slapstick belonging in a spoof like spaceballs having pointless side plots a halfbaked suspicion plot characters not communicating like they have ever met before contrived force abilities throwing away key characters unremorcefully having simultaneous plots taking different amounts of time failing to adhere to the chekovs gun principle ressurecting cpt phasma introducing rkv weapons in a setting which has classically never had them and for good reason  they make all space combat pointless  but worst of all  not taking itself seriously after establishing that it was a serious film  for these crimes against the artform i relegate this movie to bottom of the trash pile directly next to m n shamalans avatar the ladt airbender movie    congratulations on killing a 5 billion dollar franchise
Dec 3 2018,negative,you think it couldnt get any worse than the force awakens and then it does bad acting cardboard characters illogical scenarios and zero respect for the mythology  coated with more than a dash of pc propaganda
Dec 3 2018,negative,this is an abortion of a film it bins everything sw7 sets up and replaces it with incoherent sjw guff
Dec 3 2018,negative,cant believe they are giving this guy a trilogy hope he eats a big meal before he sits down and pops out the trilogy
Dec 3 2018,negative,the misandry is strong with this one
Dec 3 2018,negative,rian johnson killed star wars with this movie between the plot holes character devolution and sjwesque motivation i cant choose which is worse rey is also a mary sue character she has no development potential
Dec 3 2018,negative,the worst star wars movie disrespectful with previous movies disfigurement of characters no story contradictory in its message its a flop
Dec 3 2018,positive,this film is better than the rise of skywalker despite its own major flaws the main issues are the weird comedy the disregard for the characters in particular luke and star wars lore eg the holdo maneuver and the pointless side quest with finn and rose that contains some preachy animal cruelty content however at least this film wasnt a clone of one of the original films so it has that going for it but it was still somewhat painful to watch
Dec 2 2018,negative,really this was the first movie since jaws 4 that i walked out of the theater feeling ripped off bad star wars and just a bad scifi movie as well deconstructing the star wars mythos and the heroes journey is not what was expected and perhaps not what was wanted by many viewers and fans i felt the humour was poor out of place and handled with sitcom levels of skill not worth a rewatch even for free on tv
Dec 2 2018,negative,the critics scores for this film are outrageous it had several fun and exciting moments but these were overshadowed by plot holes and cheesy dialogue that made a lot of star wars fans like me cringe this kind of carelessness might be forgivable in a standalone scifi action movie but not in a star wars sequel its a real shame because the new characters especially rey and kylo had a lot of potential i really hope they can get star wars back on track after this sloppily written mess but it may be too late
Dec 2 2018,negative,movie has messy plot with consequences not affecting the heros in any way expectations are left shattered and unsatisfying with choices not making sense for any of the characters
Dec 2 2018,negative,this movie destroyed the star wars universe jj abrams help
Dec 2 2018,positive,the best star wars film in 37 years
Dec 2 2018,negative,i came to the theater a few minutes late and the first thing i saw was the crank call from poe to hux  as i took my seat i couldnt believe that this is a star wars movie  lucas prequels had quite a bit of infantile and idiotic comedy but this went beyond the pale and it presaged how bad the rest of the film turned out to be  it was a lazy clumsy ideologicallycharged script that deliberately ignored the star wars canon and most of all logic  rian johnsons focus it seems was the oftquoted subversion of expectations and moronic comic relief  there is no rhyme nor reason for much what happens in this movie potentially brilliant characters like rey luke finn or poe are completely wasted and the final episode of the trilogy is set to fail in terms of storyline because of continuous need to fix the multiple messes that johnson had made in tlj  speaking of which its clear that there was no plan for a story arc binding the three films  disney is flying by the seat of their pants and no one is willing to admit that giving full creative control over to rian johnson was a colossal mistake that this franchise will never recover from  so long star wars its been progressively worse since the phantom menace and tlj put the final nail in the coffin  i wont be there for any more of these wretched films have a blockbuster december 2019 opening night without me
Dec 2 2018,positive,this film compared to the previous one devolops its own plot going beyond the usual rhetoric of good against evil trying to create some pragmatic moments
Dec 2 2018,neutral,ive watched every star wars film more than i like to admit each time ive watched this one the less i liked it ill never be able to turn away from a movie with lightsabers and force mythology but this is definitely swept into the prequel junk pile to be occasionally muddled through
Dec 2 2018,negative,a truly atrocious soufflï 12 c  inconsistent ill considered inedible drizzled in a thick creamy sauce of bitter disappointment clearly so bereft of energy inventiveness and the giddy wonder that distinguished its predecessors choosing instead to hide behind faddish partisan politics baffling and inconsistent character development and excruciatingly ill judged humour all i ask of disney now is that continue to render this type of appalling entertainment and make it easier for me to walk away from this faux star wars ill stick with my blu rays of the originals and as before i paraphrase genesis 97 go forth and multiply disney
Dec 2 2018,negative,the first star wars i never finished watching it was so bad
Dec 1 2018,negative,this movie is decent by his own but is completely incoherent and ridicule when you consider it happens just after the force awakens and the other star wars     the more you ask legitimate questions the worst it gets the hell are y wings instead of these shitty bombers if luke exiled himself because he wanted to die why did it left a map behind him rey is able to take down the personal gards of a sith lord because she practiced against a rock shes able to lift a ton of bolders because she was told once by luke to breathe and reach out  where is the military of an entire galactic republic why the first order has so much ressources did fin and rose accomplished anything except directly cause the death of a large majority of the forces of the resistance if kylo is an conflicted between light and dark is there any real bad guy since snoke is dead why did rian took out the scene where luke cry for han but kept the green milk scene do you know theres only a couple of days between the moment shes a worthless slave on jakku and the moment she saves whats left of the resistance etc etc etc    rian ruined his movie and the one of jj abrams because he destroyed anything new and interesting that jj brought every mystery box ruined by simple and ridicule answers or no answers cool and new elements were ignored rey never truely failed yet she didnt progress we dont know why shes so invested in the fight who she is or why the hell she is so god damn strong plus we still only have a small group of rebels sorry resistants against an empire theres nothing new luke was ruined and had a shitty death we could have a true epic fight but we got a dance yhea     plus the movie has inherent defaults like its shitty humor    i hated it and the more i think or watch it the worst it gets but id like to say that the people who personally attacked the actors or the staff that worked on the film just because ot was bad are the worst kind of person
Dec 1 2018,positive,im surprised this movie got a lot of hate ive been a fan of rian johnson and star wars for a long time and was excited when i heard that he would be doing one movie part of one of my childhood franchises i loved the plot screenplay action scenes and the way rian handled the characters but i was disappointed about the revelation of reys parents i did expect more but that just makes us wait for answers in star wars 9 if it will be answered then
Dec 1 2018,negative,absolutely abysmal plot which destroys all the characters that we loved and care about from the original trilogy start wars is dead
Dec 1 2018,negative,finally got around to putting in my review despite seeing this day one in theaters as i have with all star wars movies this flick was one hot piece of garbage riddled with plot holes questionable decisions and the halting of any momentum the new trilogy was building up rian johnson kathleen kennedy and disney should be ashamed for letting this mess reach the big screen
Dec 1 2018,negative,illogical story packed with thiny veiled sjw references and forgettable characters if you want to watch a movie with a marysue character in space with some flashy effects this is for you but this isnt star wars
Dec 1 2018,negative,the worst movie ever made i have the complete star wars saga i do not consider this movie or the last one to be star wars movies do they will not be adding to my collection
Dec 1 2018,positive,much better than the force awakens but still no match for the original lucas films which we will never get to experience again sadly you could see the political correctness of our times all over this film 
Nov 30 2018,negative,an atrocity not only to cinema but to western civilization
Nov 30 2018,negative,the sar wars sequel that made the prequels shine
Nov 30 2018,negative,a movie needs more than just pretty visuals to be good an entertaining this would be a fine movie if it was a sequel to a different movie however as a result of it attempting to continue a story established in previous films in a lackluster way that shows little care for the preceding plot points and expectations it fails miserably subverting expectations does not equate to a good movie if you ordered a medium rare steak and are given a well done steak the steak doesnt become delicious just because it subverted your expectations
Nov 30 2018,negative,this movie successfully ended my 40 year love of star wars my two teenage boys didnt like it either too bad
Nov 30 2018,negative,horrible movie an insult to star wars but you do not need my opinion to see that never watch
Nov 30 2018,negative,cant believe what they did to my favorite character  and every contradiction in this movie wrecks the whole star wars universe
Nov 29 2018,negative,this is probably the worst movie from all the saga it appears that it was made to troll all the fan theories or made shocking twists just for the sake of it not really because of a coherent reason or natural progression from the previous movies character wise or even comedic wise luke its made here a complete waste of character and is a disgrace for the whole star wars community and fandom from the old days specially im sorry for mark hamill he was asked to go through this you can feel he was not happy in a looooot of youtube videos he talks about this luke was extremely disrespected and wasted in the most incredibly ultra super way possible in this joke of a movie such a potential for the sake of twists or trolling the fandom this is the greatest mess in star wars ive ever seen just no they should remove this from canon episode 9 cant fix all of this garbage it just cant star wars is finished ill pretend this never happened haha
Nov 29 2018,positive,shocking somewhat dark and an overall beautiful piece of star wars film the last jedi subverted my expectations yet excites me to see more star wars films from the brilliant filmmaker rian johnson
Nov 29 2018,negative,im still lamenting over how terrible this movie was i have to pretend i never saw it just to get me through the day were not buying your political agenda i didnt see solo as a way of giving the finger to rian johnson and kathleen kennedy and many others did the same
Nov 29 2018,negative,terrible movie wastes potential and doesnt live up to the earlier installment
Nov 29 2018,negative,you dont have to look far to see much more in depth ratings than this one as to why the last jedi is a total disaster but i will sum up some of the major disappointments    positives looks and sounds nice    negatives everything else    the director just threw up his hands and said screw it i want awful forced inauthentic pointless social justice and explosions and thats about what you got the story telling is objectively horrendous the plot holes are gaping and numerous its truly a shame that they so thouroughly ruined what had the potential to be a grest film with inane descion making and pointless gotchyas      etc etc etc i suggest you watch any number of you tube videos on the subject as to why this is such a collosal train wreck
Nov 29 2018,negative,it was the worst experience on a theater ever i will not support e9 after this crap im sorry for mark hamill and carrie fisher they had to endure this poor recreation of a movie i still cant understand how every critic is saying that he casino part shouldnt be part of the movie and still give a perfect score if you review a movie with 30 minutes bad and stupid storytelling i believe that they would not give such high scores but i think is political incorrect to downvote a story with a black actor and an asian actress from stupid holdo holding the plan to that luke luke goes from left his friends to talk to the most sadistic and evil person in the galaxy becuase he has hope but your nephew is lost and must be stabbed in the back becuase you felt he may be tempted by the dark side some normal person does not even contemplate murder     like luke throwing the lightsaber over the shoulder the fans will do the same thing with your lame product wake up disney
Nov 29 2018,negative,this was so bad as time went by i just got more and more ratty what was ryan johnston thinking
Nov 29 2018,negative,a pretty disappointing movie whose sole purpose seems to be to shame every male character relentlessly many of the characters were alright but admiral holdo was wholly unreasonable and generally cringey to watch she ruined that entire segment of the film theres more that isnt worth dredging up dont waste your money
Nov 29 2018,negative,why did they have to make luke a coward and then kill him for no reason why did the people who made this movie have so much contempt for the fans of the series
Nov 29 2018,negative,tragedy of luke skywalker the wise
Nov 28 2018,negative,not worth watching could hardly sit through it
Nov 28 2018,negative,i can not believe the complete utter disregard of the original series i am so sad to see the movie being made by people who could careless about the fans and george lucass life work disney is dead to me
Nov 28 2018,negative,so many things i didnt like about this movie i wont restate so many things that have already been stated over and over again rj and kk changed up the formula and tried to apply  and copy  the mcu humor formula its clear that a majority of people on earth do not appreciate the way the movie was made and do not agree with the way the story was told  my half star is for the visual effects and scene settings john williams was awesome per usual
Nov 28 2018,negative,awful  you cannot make a worse movie if you tried
Nov 28 2018,negative,star wars the last jedi honors the sagas rich legacy while adding some surprising twists  and delivering all the emotionrich action fans could hope for  thats a joke right spoilers below    proceed if you dont care about them    i have watched the more recent starwars films only once while in theater and that was all i needed to know that the great icon is now dead the movie series that kathleen and jj created disrespected the legacy and added no twists to the movie finn loves any girl as a typical guy kylo did what any sith does and betrays his master ray was told to not have parents and she doesnt luke was done being a jedi so he let himself die    pretty straightforward in that sense but overall i refuse to even bother with the franchise now only purchasing the hd blu ray set of episodes 16 with original content and keeping my old vhs tapes of 46 in a special box for safe keeping i highly recommended avoiding the movie for any reason as it isnt worth sullying your love for starwars    i sincerely hope disney gets its act together banishes jj and kathleen from its massive ip before it loses what little value is left no one cares about the toys anymore or takes the movies seriously anymore its just a reason to go to my local movie theater get some beer and take a nap while starwars plays in the background      however rouge one was miles better in my opinion characters had depth progression and gave light to the actual lore unlike 78 where ray goes from zero to jedi wielding zero in 3 seconds the explanation of her powers and how she randomly knows how to do things isnt explained and her jedi training doesnt feel at all realistic luke was on dagobah for quite awhile and getting constant training from yoda ray didnt get that kind of training shes just all powerful so deal with it right    i would give a zero star but that apparently isnt a thing like metacritic offers
Nov 28 2018,negative,this is the single worst movie that has ever been created and politics and contemporary morality aside just from a movie standpoint this is the worst crap anyone has ever made ever they did the force awakans a lot more justice just through cinematography and not abundantly horrible plot writing what was even the plot with this movie none at all
Nov 28 2018,negative,the last jedi is a step backwards for a sequel at best it is just treading water its biggest sin is not progressing its story were in the second act of a three act story and very little has been done to develop its main characters in any meaningful way by the end of its conclusion you feel cheated because nothing really mattered     none of the actions of the characters mattered in the grand scheme of the narrative and they are ultimately still  on square one no different from where we saw them at the end of the force awakens rey is still the same highly resourceful super capable hero who has no real connection to any other character finn is still the cowardly bumbly fool poe actually develops a bit but its its really questionable and hard to understand     the villain is also just as unconvincing as he was in the first entry as well kylo hasnt become more menacing his motivations are still loose at best they play with some ideas but never commit to anything     its a frustrating film to watch if you want to see the story go in some direction as a star wars fan you will probably love the visuals you will love all the throwbacks you will get excited to see those classic characters on the screen but all of that fades away as the credits roll and you start to actually ask questions or you feel a certain emptiness to everything that just took place
Nov 28 2018,negative,a semidecent movie on its own however as a star wars film its just the worst if you grew up loving star wars like i did avoid this movie as it will ruin everything you like about the star wars universe
Nov 27 2018,negative,wow how can you screw up a franchise well this movie did
Nov 27 2018,negative,so i really took my time to rewatch the film again since seeing it at the cinema when it was out last year i wanted the dust to settle and time to pass so that i could with distance process what id experienced firstly let me say from the outset that the original trilogy episodes 46 are their own entities completely untouchable for all sorts of reasons but in a large part due to the nostalgia i have when i relive my childhood when i watching them i love them any other star wars film is fluff theres some decent fluff rogue one and some terrible fluff episode 1 and mediocrity in between the force awakens didnt blow me away its probably somewhere on the passable fluff scale it made some major mistakes like resetting han solo to square one in terms of his characters development and the plot was pretty much a retread of episode 4 never repeat yourself it had some better elements  some interesting questions were posed and there were some intriguing setups which held promise to be paidoff in the sequels i got excited for last jedi i got giddy when they announced the title this had potential it had the promise of something darker perhaps something with a bit more meat on the bone and then i went to see it my overriding feeling and there were lots of conflicting thoughts and emotions when i left the cinema was one of disappointment let me be clear  i never expected to rekindle what i felt when i was a kid watching episodes 46 but that was fine im older bringing lifes experiences to the table which now gives me new perspectives and expectations on what i want from these films i purposefully underplayed it so that i wouldnt be disappointed hell part of me convinced myself that it was going to be awful before i even went into the cinema for the first 10 minutes i felt quite positive there was the rather heavyhanded comedy moment but i could live with that it was feeling fun and well like star wars should feel  epic bombastic a visual feast i was sold then luke turned up and a little part of that child in me started to cry what what the hell have they done to our luke this is not the skywalker we came to love this is not the luke i spent years dreaming i could be this is not the luke of the original trilogy his actions his motivations his reasondetre all a complete betrayal of the character that we know and love then there was more setups from the previous film that are never paid off some may say that was a brave unexpected bold storytelling move but it just seemed like lazy writing to me there were whole sections of story that seemed redundant casino planet in my mind that whole section could have been cut and you wouldnt have missed it from the film there was mary poppins in a star wars film there were multiple characters doing all sorts of inexplicable things there were some positives  it felt sweeping and epic and the design was as you would expect from something this prestigious sublime but there was political correctness there were social zeitgeist characters who seem to have been included by a tickbox committee and there was a narrative disregard for what had come before my 1 12 stars are for those positive aspects i have mentioned but im afraid that even after a fresh viewing a year later the film just isnt star wars to me its something else posing as a star wars story which has the audacity to rewrite the original trilogys lynchpin character as something we know he never was and never could have been i think it may be time for me to put any holes if seeing a fully satisfying new star wars film to bed or maybe its time to rewatch the originals again and remind myself of why some things should just be left alone 
Nov 27 2018,neutral,spoiler warning in general it is always nice to subvert the expectations of the audience once and a while its nice to have some unpredictability in your films the audience can be drawn in as they cant necessarily predict what will happen next however when you are doing nothing but throwing curveballs at the audience it will eventually stop being special and come full circle to being predictable again what im trying to say here is that killing your mysterious and seemingly allpowerful villain halfway through the movie killing one of your main characters before they receive any development at all having a rebel leader act like an incompetent leader only to have a super secret plan to warp into a star destroyer it really all comes across as an overreaction to criticism that the force awakens wasnt original enough so they tried to force in as many twists as they could possibly think of it is an exaggeration to say that the last jedi is a truly bad film its not the acting is generally quite good well executed and polished actions scenes its just kind of boring and doesnt really contribute anything to the overall series and based on many of the main characters being dead may actually be detrimental to it
Nov 27 2018,negative,this is the worst star wars movie 0 redeeming qualities
Nov 27 2018,negative,what they did to luke in this movie should get them sent to the hague no i dont mean the fact that he died
Nov 27 2018,negative,very lame willie coyote and the road runner was more exciting  what can they build on now
Nov 27 2018,negative,killed star wars for me and everyone i know who was also a star wars junkie  i was disgusted 10 minutes in and wanted to vomit it all out when it was over
Nov 27 2018,negative,this movie sucks the story is a bad joke and ruined star wars for me
Nov 27 2018,negative,all is already said its a bad movie and much worse for being a star wars movie it also destroys itelf it has zero logic all the movie is about a chase how the empire cant reach the rebels but theres vessels coming in and out no fucking sense    dumb bombers grumpy skywalker no sense if you follow the script of the 7th filmwhy snkoke wanted to meet rei wheres the training for kylo he only insults him    just horrible
Nov 27 2018,positive,this is definitely a movie that a is true to the star wars series as a whole and b needs at least three viewings to actually understand that the first time i hated it the second i liked it more but still had some major issues the third time i really enjoyed it i think it is great and dont understand all the hate
Nov 27 2018,positive,i liked this film it doesnt deserve a 45 or a 91
Nov 27 2018,negative,good sound and visual effects terrible script writing
Nov 26 2018,negative,this is the worst star wars movie ever i hate this movie so so much
Nov 26 2018,negative,star wars the last jedi is one of those sequels that is highly anticipated but fails on almost every level with bad decisions an unsure genre and plot and just plain uninterest displayed throughout the whole thing
Nov 26 2018,positive,i think the movie does the job if you are a star wars fan you will love it if you are a regular movie buff you will be satisfied
Nov 26 2018,negative,a plothole swiss cheese mess not angry just disappointed
Nov 26 2018,negative,they just took everything star wars and urinated on it while shoving sjw themes down our throats
Nov 26 2018,negative,the worst of all the star wars film unenjoyable unwatchable terribly written so many plot holes characters are destroyed by becoming the opposite of themselves for no reason its a shocking film rian johnson has no idea about space or gravity or how a vacuum works its a joke hes a terrible writer and director its lazy and creates more questions than it answers no real story absolute mess of a film and i love star wars it is my absolute favourite film franchise ever but this is such a let down i am genuinely gutted about how abysmal this film wasis     only positive is the music
Nov 26 2018,negative,easily the worst movie ive ever seen in my life
Nov 26 2018,negative,i went to see a star wars movie and i ended up watching a scifi movie with star wars elements basically its like when you think you bought the real deal and then later when you look inside you notice it is a cheap knock off from north korea
Nov 25 2018,negative,the worst movie i have ever seen
Nov 25 2018,negative,incoherent and disapointing
Nov 25 2018,negative,let the past die kill it if you have to  seems to be disneys attitude towards the whole star wars franchise
Nov 25 2018,negative,my caps lock is off yet rotten tomatoes seems to override that for some reason   amazing visuals cannot negate objectively bad fan fictionesque writing   cheap laughs cannot distract from disregarding the nature of established characters   subverting expectations for the sake of subverting expectations cannot excuse builds ups that lead to disappointment  giving the fans what they want does not mean you need to cave to their every whim and desire but it is far worse to simply spit in their faces instead  blaming your failures on the very people who made your success possible and labeling them as something they are not cannot not save you    i actively tried to like this movie to feel what the movie wanted me to feel i just ended up depressed    and finally rotten tomatoes adjusting algorithms to not count reviews with zero stars is still not enough to bring this movie above 50 laughable leaving this movie half a star as a result just know lucasfilm you didnt earn it
Nov 25 2018,negative,star wars the last jedi is probably one of the weakest narratives in the entire series     despite its highly polished exterior the inner workings of the movie itself were contradictory needlessly subversive and goes on for entirely too long than it needed to
Nov 25 2018,negative,destroyed star wars
Nov 25 2018,positive,i liked it i feel like they made some mistakes however on repeated viewings i found that many issues were simply oversights on my part and required further analysis and research
Nov 25 2018,negative,leaving aside the bizarre choices made in this film it doesnt even work on its own terms this is a sequel yet plot points established in the previous film are abandoned or ignored theres no continuity even within the film itself characters do and say halfbaked things that contradict what we already know about them cringeworthy jokes fall flat and give everyone a inappropriate bipolar vibe two plot strands are merged despite one seemingly lasting minutes and the other lasting weeks characters forget things that they knew in their previous scene it is an utter mess a confused disjointed headache ill never trust a film critic again
Nov 24 2018,negative,goddamn its the worst star wars movie
Nov 24 2018,negative,abysmal which means worse than attack of the clones   you rian i will hate him forever
Nov 24 2018,negative,one of the worst movies ever made by far storyline  potholes  the pc just everything about killed star wars entirely
Nov 24 2018,negative,the last jedi tries to copy the comedy seen in the marvel cinematic universe and fails at nearly every turn damaging any depth or investment in any important scenes preceding or immediately following an occurrence which happens surprisingly often this film will likely only be enjoyed by casual movie goers and sjws npcs this film is poorly written poorly paced and leaves little room for the preapproved preestablished follow up movie due to putting an immediate end to all plot lines but one which we all know how how the single surviving plot line is going to play out in the end dont we to this films credit every single performer in this film brings their agame each performance is believable and heart felt sadly that is really all that can be said that is good about this film most of the score is recycled from prior films in the saga this film forgets that it is a sequel itself and that it is continuing a long running saga that started over forty years ago
Nov 24 2018,negative,kylo ren is the only good thing about this movie
Nov 24 2018,negative,one of the worst films i have ever seen
Nov 23 2018,negative,boring long and infuriating pointless the parts that should be cool and awesome like meeting luke again after forever are dumb and stupid what was even up with the milking alien the entire movie was a big disappointment and real boring
Nov 23 2018,negative,a very disappointing movie the last jedi suffers from way too many subplots plot holes and unneeded throwaway characters possibly the worst thing about this movie is the rosefinn subplot which has the worst romance and most uneeded character in the franchise even worse than anakin and padme rose even jar jar was there to provide some comical relief for the children and is way too preachy about rich people and animal abuse other negative things are out of place and forced comedy  lukes horribly written character captain phasma somehow coming back from the dead general snoke turning out to be a nobody among many other things it isnt all bad however the soundtrack and action being high points of the movie although i somewhat liked it on my first watch i realized how flawed it was my second viewing it now being my least favorite star wars movie
Nov 23 2018,negative,story was contrived they didnt follow thru with several story threads this is a sequal not a stand alone movie charcters under devloped some just inserted for reasonsnot really story reasons the action sences were good until your second or third veiw then you can see the flaws like a bad wrestling match it is a star wars movie it just doeant feel like one
Nov 23 2018,negative,make it end this is worse than the prequel trilogy
Nov 23 2018,negative,i dont care who did this film its just bad    bland characters and humor that is just not funny by any standard     ignorance of the heritage of the previous films and concepts that were introduced    you may argue that star wars is silly from the get go with starships that make noises a socalled force that clearly doesnt exist and blasters that shoot rays of light which are visibly slower than the speed of light    however all previous films have kept these premises up the way they are while this film ignores or changes them as if that never happened    previous films may have had flaws but were entertaining and at least had a gripping story which was in itself not contradictory to a degree that is insulting to the audience    im not even a diehard fan with models and costumes but i always was positive about star wars luke skywalker chewie and solo including the well written probably most famous villain of all time darth vader    this film killed the greatest franchise of movie history singlehandedly
Nov 22 2018,negative,horrible hopefully jj can fix this mess
Nov 22 2018,negative,what hasnt been said already its just bad
Nov 21 2018,negative,a visually breathtaking film with some ups but far too many downs to make it an enjoyable viewings experience to any traditional star wars fan its a clunky far cry from what makes its predecessors so great star wars done wrong
Nov 21 2018,positive,despite this movies flaws star wars the last jedi has too many great moments that for me over power the plot holes in this film  heck if this movie fixed 3 to 4 things i would say it was a great film  sadly this film is not all it could have been  star wars the last jedi gets a b
Nov 21 2018,negative,sjw racist and sexist movie
Nov 21 2018,negative,moral of the story men are stupid and bad and failures in every way even you childhood heros women are great and amazing and are secretly right about everything even when you cant see it this is the movie that killed star wars
Nov 21 2018,positive,can be good at times the first act is slow but the climax makes up for it
Nov 21 2018,negative,this movie is beautiful and its enough   a real deception a millenialization of the star wars franchise
Nov 21 2018,positive,the last jedi takes a lot of risks and liberties with the star wars universe and general acts outlines of movies    it is understanding it did not play well with some but i respect gambling and taking risks with preconceived notions of how things are supppsed to go so high marks from me
Nov 21 2018,positive,excellent film and charts new exciting ways forward for the star wars franchise
Nov 21 2018,negative,force is female nuff said
Nov 21 2018,negative,the red star wars logo represents the franchise bleeding to death
Nov 21 2018,negative,disney destroyed my childhood shame on you jj
Nov 21 2018,negative,come on disney do better please
Nov 21 2018,negative,one of the worst films of the year the few good seeds planted in the force awakens have completely been trashed here there is nothing in this film that makes sense the writing is awful this whole new sw trilogy may be ok for little kids but is is an insult to anyone who knows a little of the sw world
Nov 21 2018,negative,such a bad movie en every aspect sjw shit everywhere boring characters
Nov 20 2018,negative,absolutely terrible tactics combined with a story that takes all the plot threads from the previous movie and sets them on fire not worth your time
Nov 20 2018,negative,this movie is nothing like star wars and has ruined the future for this franchise change my mind
Nov 20 2018,negative,the movie consciously destroys the character of luke skywalker to pave a way for their new hero rey who could not be more of a mary sue even if she tried useless sublots that literally made no difference in the movie but to push a political agenda cue entire casino subplot the worst character in star war history was introduced here rose and i cant even remember the name of the sleezy guy who betrayed them in the end which again was obvious and pathetic to use a twist this movie rendered the death of one of the greatest movie characters ever han solo by making kylo rens act of killing hi useless as he is still undecided and not a complete villain pointless agenda push
Nov 20 2018,negative,visually stunning but terribly inconsistent not only with the other films but within itself
Nov 20 2018,negative,a pretty bad movie overall ignores lore adds nonsense and often times feels like a movie removed from what was supposed to feel like a trilogy i dont recommend anyone to watch this
Nov 20 2018,negative,the half star is just for the audiovisual effects which are good enough to be enjoyed but only if you abandon physics  logic this movie is more a conglomeration of plot holes than it is an actual story and what fills those plot holes is a notsosubtle politicization typical to current leftist hollywood the character motivations and decisions are 99 emotional 1 strategic there is no sensible military strategy in any battle and it is especially lacking in space battles given the advanced technology available to them the allure of the original characters is taken advantage of their virtues and vices are changed on a whim just to support a plot that cannot stand on its own in any fictional universe most of the newer characters are singledimensional and do not make sense in the context of the larger mythos several pivotal moments ignore the physics of reality dragging leía into the hall from open space and those established in previous star wars films having a hyperspace jump where the ship doesnt actually go into the alternate dimension of hyperspace and thus wouldnt interact with a physical obstruction overall the pacing feels inconsistent everything feels contrived forced cheap convenient or nonsensical basically the conceptualization writing and directing all suck then the actors and postproduction staff were forced to polish the turd what a shame
Nov 20 2018,negative,terrible full of political propaganda a disgrace to the star wars name
Nov 20 2018,negative,as a follow up to tfa  so much more was expected to break the story of a trilogy open instead we got a tiny isolated island in a huge ocean of opportunities
Nov 19 2018,negative,utter rubbish more holes than swiss cheese pointless side plots and completely craps on all that came   before it
Nov 19 2018,negative,a cluttered mess of dramatic liberties taken with the classic characters and the new characters that we have grown to love while visually it looks great it doesnt do justice in the story or character department the humour ruins the dark tone and feels unnatural this is truly the worst star wars film
Nov 19 2018,negative,absolutely pathetic horrible and an insult to everything star wars
Nov 19 2018,negative,destroyed the sequel trilogy period and my real problem with the movie is neither the character arc of luke skywalker nor the impressive power of rey and not even the blatant pushing of political agendas my problem is the complete ignorance of everything jj abrams set up in episode 7 and even the rules of that universe far away themselves resulting in major plotholes and a total absence of logic would it have been enjoyable as a standalone movie probably not but i really cant tell i just know that as the eight episode in a over 30 year old franchise it was a total failure it got me from overly hyped to utterly desinterested
Nov 19 2018,negative,bring back george lucas
Nov 19 2018,negative,the few fantastic scenes and shots such as rey and kylo ren fighting the royal guards and the ship going light speed through the dreadnought are not enough to redeem this piece of garbage the entire movie feels pointless with far too many parts that leave the viewer saying why the hell diddidnt   do  for example why the hell did ruth kill herself and fuck over the entire rebel army just to stop finn from sacrificing himself when watching it feels like the movie was written by an 8 year old who saw a star wars movie once and the scene with leia forcepulling herself back to the ship from outer space is just unforgivable
Nov 19 2018,negative,a horrible ride that feels less like starwars and more like a progressive agenda it spits in the face of the classics and george lucas will never enjoy star wars like i used to
Nov 19 2018,positive,if there is any movie that can make me look at a movie franchise differently it is this movie  its full of twists and has really awesome action scenes  this movie is one of the best star warsmovies of all time
Nov 19 2018,negative,it doesnt deserve to be called star wars
Nov 19 2018,negative,this is genuinely the dumbest movie ive ever watched
Nov 18 2018,negative,a truly terrible film that throws away all the characters and story that came before it while not a fan of the prequels i find it terribly disrespectful that lucas was cut out of the creative process that originated this franchise with him out of the loop the final product feels like fanfiction written by people who arent fans of the series in the end all the viewer is left with is a hack script with simple characters meaningless side stories unrealistic character arcs pointless plot twists and the untimely and meaningless end of the skywalker saga
Nov 18 2018,neutral,visually impressive with some well done action scenes but the plot is just terrible the entire movie is just the rebels fleeing from the first order and when its trying to be something else the plot only works because of 2 characters not communicating everything in this movie just feels wasted and wrong especially what disney have done with the humor tone and characters luke snoke phasma every character feels so wasted and there are scenes in this film that does not work at all for example the casino stuff but there are good things in this movie the visuals the action and the relationship of rey and kylo but overall very frustrating movie
Nov 18 2018,positive,beautiful story i greatly enjoyed watching it
Nov 18 2018,negative,starts off with a yo momma joke which that totally sets the tone right it was disappointing and misleading from tfa turns an epic star wars adventure into a cringe fest but also gets the original characters wrong
Nov 18 2018,negative,the worst movie any franchise could have made garbage pos made by political agenda bs
Nov 17 2018,positive,pretty good slow chase story with heroes and cavalry coming for help the life of mice luckily some have the force great effects good acting and rather funny at the beginning
Nov 17 2018,negative,if you think jar jar binks was the worst character in star wars wait till you meet rose tico in this film
Nov 17 2018,negative,completely hollow film
Nov 17 2018,negative,it took me a month to get through this pile of crap i seriously fell asleep the first time i saw it when i woke up it was over and i wondered what i missed when i went back to the part i could remember i got bored a second time and i decided to not bother with it for a while the next two weeks id go back and try to watch it but everything about it was such a disorganised mess that i ended up putting it off for a bit longer i finally got through it after a month of going back and forth this film did nothing for the series i mean we could literally skip it altogether and would be much happier we did
Nov 17 2018,negative,if you are a fan of the original trilogy the prequels or the expanded universe before disney you will despise this movie numerous plot holes ruin the continuity of the series and a strong political undertones leave a bad taste character assassination is a terrible device and i dont know how anyone tolerated this movie in theaters take away the star wars title and its a bmovie
Nov 17 2018,negative,this is not just a terrible star wars movie a bad movie the plot doesnt make sense the characters actions dont make any sense and then when you add in the star wars lore nothing makes sense even down to the fact fin was the toilet cleaner in the force awakens who could not fly flies two ships in this movie and that is the least of my complaints there may not be one scene that has any logic in it im a huge star wars fan but this film just killed the whole franchise for me
Nov 17 2018,negative,what were the top critics smoking
Nov 16 2018,negative,it took me three sittings to watch this movie right through to the end i rented it all the way fighting a mixture in of boredom disbelief and disappointment this movie sucked incorporate that with the incredibly obvious political agenda the namecalling and absolute disrespect the audience received from the film makers makes this my most hated movie of all time no stars wouldve been more appropriate   i felt like this movie actively disliked me for the unforgivable sin of  being a fan that didnt appreciate malice and animosity intertwined with the harmless joy of star wars
Nov 16 2018,positive,the story picks up where the force awakens ended which is new for the star wars movies and its refreshing the force is used in new ways just like in the force awakens i really like seeing how powerful the force actually is luke skywalker is a really different character and it works he feels responsible for what happened to all his students and his mistake with ben solo we learn more about rey how powerful she is and about her parents i really liked seeing rey and luke together theyre chemistry was really good poe is in the movie more than force awakens we get more charater development find out how much of a hot head poe is made me love the character even more i really liked snoke hes intimidating but unfortunately he doesnt get any character development finn is great once again and hes with a new character rose i liked them both together and i liked rose leia has a much bigger role and i loved every minute of her on screen r2d2 porgs chewy c3po and bb8 were all awesome kylo ren is scarier i enjoyed seeing him every minute he was on screen he gets more development hes one of the best villains ever captain phasma still doesnt get any development shes in the movie less than the force awakens but i did really enjoy the scene she was in it was a little emotional the action was very fun the music was great and the movie looked great
Nov 16 2018,negative,it is sad to watch a legacy die
Nov 16 2018,negative,worst star wars film  ever
Nov 16 2018,negative,where are the ywings this movie is inconsistent with the star wars universe and is used primarily as a platform to spew gender and identity politics its an entertaining movie to play for your toddler though as the jokes are roughly pg5 and the action scenes are slow and riddled with these jokes the effects are decent but what can you expect from a movie made in 2017 if the story isnt good then the effects dont matter either disney can produce whatever they want they have the rights but where star wars truly lies is with the fans and the content created there is more powerful and creative than anything rian has added to the franchise
Nov 16 2018,negative,bad casting choices bad writing and a lot og missed opportunities
Nov 16 2018,negative,the animators did an excellent job with the cgi space scenes but the story is very lacking the force awakens setup a lot of good potential future stories dont expect to see any of those plot points expanded upon in this movie you could tell the writer of this movie isnt a fan of the franchise and doesnt understand the universe and characterizations of the old characters
Nov 16 2018,negative,what this movie doesnt have in common with the other disney produced star wars movies is that it doesnt feel like a star wars movie i loved tfa and i really liked rogue one and solo but this movie feels out of sorts the plot set up from tfa is completely ignored and turned into what feels like some art house indie film experiment
Nov 16 2018,negative,the half a star is for the title only
Nov 16 2018,positive,three years ago i created a rotten tomatoes account just so that i could be part of the angry mob of fans who were review bombing this film hence the low audience rating it absolutely is a victim of review bombing  i am one of the ones responsible for this i was there when it was happening the rating has been wrongly manipulated i recently remembered that i did this and so i have come back here to change my review  to set things right    after not watching the film for years and being angry at it any time i thought about it i eventually decided to watch it again just to give it another shot i had cooled off considerably and so i went into it with an open mind and i noticed suddenly and to my great surprise that the film is incredible i watched it again and again and again holy smokes i love this film with all of my heart it is truly brilliant it takes a strong look at how failure can impact and shape us and how we can still learn from and grow beyond our failures it also makes it very clear that nobody is too big to fail and nobody is so smart that they cant keep learning it brilliantly showcases the balance of the force like weve never seen before it introduces incredible new characters like rose and dj i adore roses optimism her courage and her heart for others finns growth into fullon rebel scum is absolutely awesome and culminates in one of the most powerfully moving moments in all of star wars it gives us the most awe inspiring luke skywalker scenes at the battle of crait lukes pacifistic last stand to rescue the resistance is the ultimate jedi move it gives us the genius force connection between rey and ben whose actors are both incredible in this their fight together in the throne room is beyond cool i never could have dreamed we would see a jedi and a sith turn and fight back to back like that it expertly builds upon reys conflict of searching for belonging for family getting to see leia use the force is wonderful and carrie just crushes it through the entire film the reunion between luke and leia is beautiful and also i mean come on the milk scene just rules this film is visually stunning and packed with so much heart i know that this film is going to age extremely well the entire sequel trilogy will age like the prequels did the young generation who grew up with these films will love them and their love will eventually trump the ridiculous hate     and speaking of hate all the hatred coming toward these films that is rooted in sexismracism is not a valid criticism of the films and these criticisms should be thrown out along with the people who spew such vile things racists and sexists should not be able to enjoy star wars they ought to have to choose between one or the other and everybody should choose star wars over being hateful anyway im glad that ive finally seen the light and i wanted to share my story and celebrate the brilliance of the last jedi
Nov 16 2018,negative,i cant add anything that already hasnt been said
Nov 16 2018,negative,please someone tell me this was a joke no omg
Nov 15 2018,negative,the worst of all star wars movies  see the tons of videos on youtube for reasons  the critic ratings here are a joke  bought and paid for
Nov 15 2018,negative,why is disney determined a murder star wars
Nov 15 2018,negative,a complete sjw shtshow ruining a great character of sw history very annoying to see rey being completely capable of doing anything beating anyone and succeeding in everything she does if this was a game it would have come with an invincible mode at default who cares for such characters who enjoys this for real and who was responsible for such uninspiring story telling  leia turning into mary poppins and the whole rose tico part also contributes that this movie became the last star wars product i would ever want to see awaiting a new generation of writers producers directors and lucasfilm employees until this franchise i dead and buried to me
Nov 15 2018,neutral,its just meh theres some good some bad parts     riann johnson clearly hates star wars fans and has decided to ignore any criticism as being either a russian bots or b sexist fan boys     sometimes bad writingdirecting is bad writingdirecting sometimes a character doesnt work deal with it     your core audience matters that doesnt mean you have to pander but you cant intentionally alienate people either and hope to succeed
Nov 15 2018,negative,not interesting at all no story telling boring caracters  rian johnson give up star wars and go away 
Nov 14 2018,positive,best fing movie of 2017
Nov 14 2018,negative,i heard rumours there were fake accounts giving 5 star reviews i see now its true  either way last jedi is the last star wars film ill ever see
Nov 14 2018,negative,all the fake five star reviews here wont stop this from being a pile of trash
Nov 14 2018,negative,rian johnson took a stinky steaming brown dump on the most beloved film series of all time
Nov 14 2018,negative,by far the worst movie in the saga
Nov 14 2018,negative,another great franchise hijacked  appropriated to push political propaganda
Nov 14 2018,negative,this is a dumpster fire of a film it looked amazing and the actors did the best that they could with what they had to no avail this movie single handedly blasted a shotgun shell of plot holes through the entire star wars saga and killed the desire to continue to see and experience star wars as a fan i am no longer a star wars fan thanks to the intellectual abortion that was rian johnsonï 12 12 12tms still born story the director seems to be out of touch with society and doesnï 12 12 12tmt seem to comprehend the very basics of storytelling i could walk down a busy street and ask anyone to write a better star wars movie and they would surpass this film with flying colors i am only sad that i have this film half a star it deserves no stars i would take away every star in the sky and present this film with a black meaningless void a void large enough to fill all of the questions this story creates the biggest one being why
Nov 13 2018,negative,this movie was made by someone who didnt understand star wars and injected an unnecessary amount of pc culture into the movie
Nov 13 2018,positive,a different approach to star wars that works but is brought down with bad pacing
Nov 13 2018,negative,the worst depiction of luke sky walkers character i feel for mark hammil  rey gets zero base on how or why shes such a skilled fighter and force user  the whole movie is based on plot holes and cuts away from any and all interesting ideas started from the force awakens  its just a poorly made fan flick
Nov 13 2018,negative,fa  not too bad curious to see where it goes ro a welcome surprise and obvious has love for the franchise as a whole tlja disgrace absolutely blah the first sw film that i didnt see multiple times and is the reason why i skipped solo and will be boycotting the new film and tv series tlj left me uninterested where the story is going and has almost completely turned me to the dark side i hope disney does the right thing and gets rian fired kathleen replaced and gives it to someone who wont run a beautiful saga such as sw into a garbage compactor also its never nice to have pr where u mock the fan basescum
Nov 13 2018,negative,tis is the worst star wars movie and ive seen the christmas special
Nov 12 2018,negative,last jedi resulted in being an abysmal film the worst star wars film of all time topping the force awakens  a horrendous direction has been taken by the new creative heads for this wonderful franchise and story   their plot and character decisions have been horrid  george lucas is missed
Nov 12 2018,positive,ok i enjoyed the superb visuals and the production design was as amazing as ever perhaps even greater than ever some of the twists i very much enjoyed but overall the plotholes and lack of tension were the greatest downfalls of this movie considering a huge chunk of it is an extended chase sequence in space i never really felt the pressure from the first orders attack also the whole finnrose relationship seemed contrived and while i liked benicio del toros presence i feel like his character was just a stand in for lando calrissian essentially and the casino planet was like something out of the prequels it also really ruins the supension of disbelief that they had to cross the entire galaxy to find the codebreaker and that maz durr would now exactly where he was and what he would be wearing and then it just so haappens that they ened up in a cell with the tonly other person who could run this mission and then on topof it he was just chilling in the cell by choice as he couldve helped himself out of it at any moment lols that whole subplot is like somethng out of a spoof in much the same way that the force awakens aka new hope reloaded felt like a carbon copy of a new hope this feels like a bit of a retread from the empire strikes back i dont really appreciate what they did with leia and luke either i feel their characters arc couldve gone much differently i did enjoy it and the visuals are certainly eyecatching i just wish it had gone somewhere else i guess still way better than the force awakens
Nov 12 2018,positive,45 on audience score seriously  this movie is incredibly underrated
Nov 12 2018,negative,worst film in the franchise jokes were misplaced and the narrative quite predictable
Nov 12 2018,negative,the visuals were great and the acting is good but this is not star wars
Nov 12 2018,negative,disney rips up actually good and interesting script of story    disappointing 100    maybe you could rate it better if you could understand anything that happened in the movie
Nov 12 2018,positive,this movie was great people say its a copy and paste star wars movie but it had a completely different story and had great twists that made you think saying thispvie was  the same as a new hope or as empire because they break on board the enemy ship is like saying that an oven is a toaster cause it heats things this movie was great and made for a fantastic sequel we saw growth in characters and we learned once again that the star wars saga isnt about the rebelion and the empire its about the characters its about kylo and rey the rest of the movies just a frame work for their story like the first two prequels were for anakin    it was great 9 out of 10
Nov 11 2018,negative,an utter disgrace to star wars
Nov 11 2018,negative,as a stand alone film it is watchable however as a star wars film it is terrible  firstly the film is not at the same level in terms of imaginative worlds and story telling as episodes 16 what annoys me the most is that disney have tried to make it too politically correct and feminist when you look back at episode 16 decades later they are still classics what makes this so is that they are distant worlds but familiar  episode 79 you can watch and you can tell they are influenced by todays feminism and race equality also to make women look strongindependent they need to make the men either evil or foolish if it was true equality they would have some evilfoolish women too  rey is so perfect she can fight flyrepair the millennium falcon and use the force with no apparent training  all in episode 7 it took luke episodes 45 to achieve less
Nov 11 2018,negative,awful storyline boring charakters only nice visuals and sounds
Nov 11 2018,negative,if i look at the last jedi as star wars episode 8 which it is there are so many problems with this movie it ignores a lot of things previously established in the star wars lore rose and holdo have got to be two of the worst characters i have ever seen and it acts as if the force awakens never existed rian johnson seemed to just forget that he was making a sequel and went off to do his own thing as a star wars fan this movie was just awful
Nov 11 2018,negative,have you ever read a misbound book that had pages from a completely different story randomly inserted into it its happened to me a couple of times    the weird jarring sensation before i realised that what i was reading didnt belong is what watching this film felt like    only this time i couldnt exchange the faulty copy for a good one and if the whole print run is affected im not buying any more    analogy ends
Nov 11 2018,negative,a bit biased but i grew up with some of these characters   rian johnson has no clue who they are
Nov 11 2018,negative,i should have broken a leg the day i went to see this movie it would have been less painful
Nov 11 2018,negative,movie was garbage honestly feels like placing your foot in a bear trap lets just say i didnt go and do that again xd
Nov 10 2018,positive,i have to say im sick of all the hate towards this movie first everyone complains about awakens being too predictable and now everyones pissed off that they didnt guess the whole plot on their youtube channel when i first watched the last jedi there was a moment when i had no idea what was going to happen i was at the edge of my seat the entire time waiting to see what was coming next sure it wasnt perfect there were characters and scenes that didnt really need to be there but that has happened in every episode jj binks i dont like sand ewoks you name it the amount of hate towards this movie in particular is undeserved and to be honest embarrassing if you hate corporate agendas then direct your hatred towards the corporation and not the people they hired the more support shown to the star wars films and projects the more inclined disney would be to respond to our requests
Nov 10 2018,positive,everyone seems to hate this movie because they were disappointed that it wasnt a movie in which characters sit down and explain their shocking origin movie sequels need to be unique and develop the story naturally with some twists and turns along the way and tlj does that very well my only complaint would be that rey is not a very compelling character at the moment yet some people seem to think thats because shes a woman weird long story this movie has great action some absolutely breathtaking scenes cinematography and great special effects
Nov 10 2018,negative,if you enjoy to watch propaganda forced politics sjw mary sue the destruction of the star wars universe and legacy a film full of non sense and plot holes go for it
Nov 10 2018,negative,another cashgrab there is so much potential in the idea of star wars which only episodes 4 5 and perhaps  3 and rogue one make decent use of it no most of this saga is just expensive poor quality the producers dont care about how society actually evolves but are instead more invested in filling and agenda 
Nov 10 2018,negative,visually impressive as expected but that is all i have good to say  the plot is nonsensical  the script is weak  the humor rarely hits home and is badly timed in relation to dramatic moments  i was less than convinced luke skywalker would ever consider murdering his sleeping nephew  as a fan of star wars this movie is just disappointing
Nov 10 2018,negative,honestly the 3rd worst star wars movie
Nov 10 2018,positive,i thought the movie could of been better there were some amazing visuals and some of the scenes were perfectly done editing was a bit of an issue in my opinion and if it been done better i think it would of been a better overall movie it just seemed like the movie was constantly at a pace that wasnt star wars and had they of taken more time to perfect the story then i think the movie wouldnt of been so divisive
Nov 10 2018,negative,worst star wars episode ever an insult to the fans community
Nov 10 2018,negative,the critics must have been watching a different movie this should be around 30 rotten not 91 fresh solo was better than this movie by far this movie has soooo many problems that it just make me sad if they removed all the scenes with rose including the entire trip to the casino and that pointless subplot thing had luke not vanish in the end remove luke milking the cow things take the part with chewy and the plastic chicken let leia die in spaceredo the battle with snokhmmm not much left that is salvageable
Nov 9 2018,positive,it hits all the star wars marks with a bunch of surprises that will make non star wars fans curious about the franchise which unfortunately gets blown up by the next one
Nov 9 2018,positive,excellent movie great twists and fantastic plot
Nov 9 2018,negative,this travesty has ruined star wars for me spare yourself the torment and just go watch a new hope again or something
Nov 9 2018,negative,such a disappointment i wanted to believe i liked it when i first saw it but when im honest with myself i totally hated it
Nov 9 2018,negative,there are too many bad things to say about this movie to fit into a review that isnt a novel but its bad the writing the creative decisions the tone and the betrayal of the way the underlying universe works are all disgusting how this movie ever got made is beyond me
Nov 9 2018,negative,that half a star is for the lightsaber scene and opening scene only i saw the midnight screening of tlj and i have never felt more let down by a franchise in my life the use of yoda just because he wanted to was more reminiscent of the holiday special than it was of a once great jedi master i dont need to see what hyper space looks like part of star wars magic is that we dont have to see it leias mary poppins in space moment was so cringeworthy and a stain on what was such a wonderful performance otherwise raes mirror of erised moment no thank you and dont even get me started on the casino scene     there is so much more that is wrong with this film but the worst bit about it all is that rian johnson was meant to get it he made looper he made brick but he couldnt make star wars since when does a star wars end with what looks like an advert for a new star wars experience and disneyland that weird scene with the kid holding the resistance crest    in summary despite the obvious alreadymentionedamilliontimes issues this film has no one seems to be pointing out that it didnt even feel like a star wars movie sure it had the names skywalker solo kenobi and ford mentioned in it but that doesnt make it a star wars movie
Nov 8 2018,negative,this movie was a jumbled mess that didnt stay true to any of the previously established character archs
Nov 8 2018,negative,all being said the worst course our beloved saga could possibly take we need a really new hope
Nov 8 2018,negative,a terribly written followup to abrams story of force awakens
Nov 8 2018,negative,this movie sucked ruined star wars they need to remake it the story makes no sense too many holes and destroyed all the characters and everything they stood for
Nov 8 2018,negative,i dont see how anyone who was a fan of the orginal series could rate this attempt of a star wars movie as good unless they were paid to do so or were a bot set up to prop up the ratings  the vast difference between the audience and critic score should clue you in to something is not quite right here  so many things were very wrong with this movie the major issue is it is supposed to fit in with the other star wars films but totally misses by ditching the history lore and backstory and seems to just make up new stuff to try and be new and unpredictable  the director and producer must have been unfamilliar with the franchise or disliked it and it shows  also the characters lack any building of their own story and the lead rey is probably the worst example of a mary sue i have ever seen  there is no struggle or jedi training for her she just is the best out of nowhere and since there was no build up of her backstory there is very little attachment garnished for the character a lot of the other characters are that way in this movie they are shown like cameos but so little time was spent having them provide anything if value to the story they are just there and gone with no attachment to the movie  pacing is off and some side stories should have been edited out in favor of  development of the main story line  there are tons of other nagging incongruities that should not be in a star wars movie that only a first time watcher of a star wars film would not catch definitely the worse  star wars movie ever made even worse than the ones with jar jar  the original star wars trilogy movies were blockbusters with big shoes to fill for this film to fit into and it doesnt even seem to even try to come close to equalling the previous standard that was set by the movies that made sequels a thing  the last jedi is not a sequel but something in star wars name only and was thouroughly dissapointing to watch
Nov 7 2018,negative,in this case the low ratings people are giving are honest anyone who   enjoyed this probably also liked the emoji movie
Nov 7 2018,negative,it is star warsish  i recognize some of the people and ships but the story just doesnt feel like star wars  good movies have good stories and compelling characters  this movie has neither  i thought rogue one was good so disney is capable of making a good star wars film  maybe rian and jj  just are not the right people for this job
Nov 7 2018,negative,they killed the franchise
Nov 7 2018,negative,story makes no sense i  try to find one character which was well potrayed or written there is no one luke the saviour of the galaxy is an attempted murderer of his nephew after leaving one of the greatest alive which was his father his sister turns into supergirl rey needs to traini like daisy ridley but her character might have been not well developed one star for sfxdepartment made a good job
Nov 7 2018,negative,if you look at this movie and only this movie you might think that it wasnt bad maybe even good but if you look at it as a star wars movie and how it should fit with the other films in their universe you could see what a colossal pile of garbage it was i am sick of it being praised by critics for subverting expectation everything that tfa set up for the new trilogy which made us want more was shut down in an underwhelming manner that let anyone who gave a damn about the franchise down george lucas the creater of the star wars franchise stated that star wars is meant to rhyme something which rian johnson is happy to throw under the bus to subvert expectations its almost as if rian johnson hadnt seen any star wars films because it seems as if he has no idea how things work in this universe looking at you hyperspace ram also i remember when  star wars was the simple good vs evil theme and not stuffed with virtue signalling like the poes toxic masculinity vs the calm female leader holdo this movie was clearly made by someone who doesnt care about the fans people who really care about this franchise and instead opting to attack them on social media
Nov 6 2018,negative,rian johnson wanted to subvert expectations i expected a good movie expectations subverted
Nov 6 2018,negative,horrible plot worse then the prequels
Nov 6 2018,negative,dropped subplots dead characters great special effects recycled ideas poor writing strange ideas and a cowardly luke skywalker   poor entry in this beloved franchise and hopefully the last
Nov 6 2018,negative,not spending another dollar on disney star wars
Nov 6 2018,positive,huge sw fan and thought this was awesome  love how they develop the characters stories more from tfa
Nov 6 2018,negative,how can you give this abomination 91  it was terrible
Nov 6 2018,negative,the worse hideous shit ever
Nov 6 2018,negative,watched again recently and my initial thought that it was okay was wrong reflecting on the story none of it makes sense the best part and maybe the only part i enjoyed was the red guard fight scene
Nov 6 2018,negative,garbage this destroyed the star wars universe  luke is acting like a total emo man child the lead is a mary sue with no real training
Nov 6 2018,negative,this movie proves you can smear shit on a blank canvas and people will still call it modern art    and yeah im such a manbaby for not liking this filmeven though im a fucking woman get over yourselves
Nov 6 2018,negative,i created an rt account just so i could voice my displeasure with this movie    i have loved star wars since i first saw the movies as a kid in the mid80s i have watched the original trilogy dozens of times and never get sick of them tfa had its issues but was accepted as a reboot and good start from disney to get their new characters integrated into the saga jj opened lots of questions for the new trilogy to answer and i looked forward to that i was excited after tfa i liked rogue one as well and saw both of these movies in the theater multiple times    then the last jedi official trailer was released which was amazing and everyone was excited the hype was real then i saw the movie in the theater and was disappointed i hated flying leia poppins killing off luke in that terrible ending before he had a chance to showcase his jedi skills after 35 years the cheesy cringy jokes hux is now a pussy kylo isnt intimidating at all the entire boring canto bight side plot the space chase plot because they couldnt catch the lighter ships or hurt them at range killing off snoke so easily and how overpowered rey was with no training   the official trailer was a lie to get us into the theater none of the terrible bs from this movie was in the trailer    after seeing this movie i now feel like there is nowhere for ix to go nothing left excites me and i just dont care anymore i didnt see solo because i wasnt interested in what lucasfilmdisney could offer me and i thought that han was miscast the last jedi has basically killed star wars for me going forward and took the force awakens down with it i still love the ot and the ptespecially the fan edits but have no interest in seeing what kk and her story team can offer me going forward the new clone wars has potential as long as dave filoni is in charge and kk keeps her grimy hands out of it    i thought the special effects cinematography and sfx were quite good in tlj so i gave it 15 stars instead of 5
Nov 6 2018,positive,doesnt deserve all the hate from fanboys who feel it doesnt fit their idea of star wars this film fits right in with all the others is it empire no but then nothing is the casual star wars viewer will probably find nothing wrong with it the basement dwelling 40 year old virgin in the boba fett costume probably hates it
Nov 6 2018,negative,it was the first star wars movie that i was disappointed and the worst of the series  the legacy of past generation was delivered in the most disrespectful way and the plot twist and revealing were so unsatisfying
Nov 6 2018,negative,who the hell thought this movie was a good idea
Nov 6 2018,positive,the film is a disappointment  if you generally look at good movies on boxxy software you will like it
Nov 6 2018,neutral,the movies plot is fucking gae
Nov 6 2018,negative,overall this movie was not good in my opinion  effects  35  other than some good performances and some good cinematography the only really good thing about this film was the excellent visuals by the cg team very well done guys  performances   155  i thought most of the leads did a pretty good job with what they were given daisy rey mark luke john finn oscar poe adam kylo and carrie leia all performed quite well in my opinion i didnt think kellys rose performance was stellar regardless of kellys performance i dont think the few horrible peoples vitriol was appropriate  cinematography  25  for the most part i thought the cinematography was good  script  05  a 05 is really harsh but i thought about this for a long time if ever i had to give a script a 05 tlj is the one to get it this script was a mess i want to keep the review short so ill direct the reader to redlettermedias star wars the last plinkett review as i agree with a lot of what was said there  pr  055   this pr category is my review of how a studio or production responds to criticism or praise ideally a film doesnt need to respond if it does need to responds that response is fair and honest  disney was unfortunately very bad with the way they handled the criticism of this film instead of listening to the criticism and considering its validity they immediately framed the criticism as hate from the internet trolls by selecting a few horrible reviews and propping them up as being the opinion of all those that disliked it    overall ive decided to give this film a 055 as my enjoyment of the film was heavily impacted by the terrible direction and story i certainly appreciated the brilliant effects and the decent performances but unfortunately so much of this film relied on the script
Nov 5 2018,negative,the main characters dont know each other at all
Nov 5 2018,negative,hey i just wanted to say thanks for shitting on lukes character just so that you can make marey look good yeah im a woman and i hate maray with passion and identify with luke skywalker more shocking right i wonder if i will still be called a manbaby or better yet a russian bot  anyways extremely great writing i must say not lazy at all   i have one suggestion please make a fanfiction writer handle the project next time because let me tell you they will be far more passionate and imaginative better than the disaster you gave us   also please listen to mister mark hamils suggestions next time he deserves some respect    anyways i would have loved to give this movie 12 star but since rotten tomato wont count it for audience score i sadly had to give this two stars 
Nov 5 2018,negative,the special effects are good thats it  maybe if youve never seen another star wars film youll enjoy this as you wont have to suffer the ridiculous backpedaling and changes to core features of jedi and historically great characters honestly it could be forgiven if it were not for the fact that most of the new characters are flawed and not flawed as in have vices and weaknesses flawed in that they are a complex mix of mary sues and god awful military tacticians
Nov 5 2018,negative,almost have to see the next one to see how much more they can mess this up lmao gave one star since the movie is gorgeous however the story is terrible and have no idea where they are going with this series disney certainly ruined something that should of been a slam dunk for them 
Nov 5 2018,negative,well done rian johnson an absolute masterclass on how to destroy your biggest money making franchise
Nov 5 2018,negative,it shits on all the saga has established so far
Nov 5 2018,negative,probably the worst star wars movie to date  completely breaks all established lore and world building within the star wars canon  characters have bad dialogue  really bad dialogue  kind of writing that makes you roll your eyes constantly  its a shame since the force awakens really wasnt that bad  what a horrible way to send off luke han and now leia  get your act together disney and lucasfilm
Nov 5 2018,negative,uninspired sequel filled with more plot holes than spoilers
Nov 5 2018,negative,star wars is the most influential franchise for boys in america for the last 40 years  was disney incompetent with this movie or were they trying to actively ruin the star wars that fans loved  serious question  sometimes the timing and delivery of humor is off and it just does not work  sometimes plot twists are telegraphed and big reveals are predictable sometimes actor chemistry just does not work  sometimes bad luck happens to a movie but this is bad enough to question whether it is by intent      i am suspicious that disney wanted to break the masculine influence on star wars in an attempt to make it more inclusive  in so they have destroyed many significant characters to the franchise and abandoned its traditional narrative of action adventure and escape  i understand that if you want to bring in a new group of female characters to dominate the show you will have to kill off the men literally and figuratively but did they need to kill off all of the male fans in the process  this has gone beyond inclusion and turned into a cultural genocide of brain cells  poor story poor characters poor humor drags on far too long trying so hard for diversity it forgets to be a good movie at the same time  we all think diversity is a good thing but this terrible movie may have set the cause of inclusiveness back a full generation  where are the girls to take the mantle when a man fails where is the female to take leadership when her male commander falls  where are the females characters uniting people  star wars fans deserved a great and inclusive movie disney just forgot about the great movie part
Nov 5 2018,negative,half a star for joda being a puppet instead of cgi this joda reminds me of the old star wars movies rest of the movie is garbage actually episode 1 2 and 3 are not so bad compared to this movie thats a pro as well
Nov 5 2018,negative,critics clearly dont know the difference between throwing in unexpected garbage thats meant to be new or exciting and actually good story telling if this was a book series that i was reading i would have given up a third of the way through because of how disconnected from tfa and the rest of the entire franchise it felt any story lines started in tfa were messily wrapped up like someone thinking that they can use gum to stick together pieces of wrapping paper on a package sure it works more or less but its messy and disgusting and such a severe disappointment that by the time you get through it youre underwhelmed and annoyed by whatever was inside i endured all this for what amounts to a heaping pile of dog feces yikes the way luke was handled was incredibly poor for starters it felt as though rj had never seen a star wars movie in his life but maybe glanced at a couple wiki pages and called it good im almost surprised he even got lukes name right it wasnt character development though i know not all character development needs to be positive it was more like character assassination he didnt even remotely resemble the luke we know from previous movies and media in general then there was the poor attempt at making kylo ren a better more fleshed out villain this was the only character rj spent any time on and he couldnt even make me care about him not even a little i was bored by his narrative and absolutely appalled at the use of luke as his final catalyst towards the dark side it was lazy writing to try to draw sympathy from viewers unfortunately it doesnt work like that using a well defined good guy like luke in a way that suggests he might even consider killing his own nephew rather than speaking with him first or attempting to get through to him in any other way is poor writing at its most obvious people like to suggest that rey is a mary sue but kylo ren fits that profile even better than she does in a lot of ways they should have taken the ruthlessness of kylo in tfa toned down the whinyness of him and let him move from kind of comically annoying villain to something more extreme more raw we could have watched him follow the events of tfa with the realization that he needs to stop throwing hissy fits and show his power in a more stoic way like vader no need for a sad backstory either offer us someone who doesnt care about right and wrong and maybe secretly never has he was just trying to fit in a true psychopathic villain who cared only about himself and his own agenda instead they tried to make us sympathize id rather not have that especially when it didnt work anyway  further rey was taken from being a potentially strong female lead like jyn erso in rogue one to a pathetic little girl who suddenly cares only about helping our villainous manchild kylo rj blamed antifeminists and racists for all the hate on this movie but i am both a feminist and of course completely against racism tfa brought in some inclusion thay would have been fun to explore but rj sidelined all the diverse characters and instead focused on whitemanpainren what even was the point in finns and roses little side story it was a mess and poe having a fiery temper and causing division among an already small resistance group like theirs only feeds into stereotypes of the hot headed latinx it was stupid it was pointless we gained nothing from it but sort of racist character development and rose i was hoping i would love her but she was written so poorly has rj never interacted with a single woman in all his life or does he get all his info on them from bad movies thats legitimately what it felt like  and reys parentage she didnt have to be of skywalker blood but giving her no connection back to the main story doesnt give a sense of anyone can be a jedi we already knew that it just feels like it was added to be a surprise so no speculations won out over others in the end a poor decision that cuts her off from any possible meaning to the rest of the franchise and continues to make the sequels feel like they dont belong in the sw universe at all  it was lazily written and full of failed shock value under the guise of subversion from the formula of the franchise it didnt feel like a star wars film at all it would have been better as a stand alone movie with no connection at all to the sw universe but even then it would have been poorly written racist and sexist it would have been a blist movie at best without the major characters and drooling kylo fan girls to help prop it up people thought the prequels were bad but this outdoes all 3 of them in how terrible it is at least the prequels added something to the story and mattered to some degree this movie was pure trash
Nov 4 2018,negative,complete garbage movie with storyparts of the spaceballs plot  but spaceballs was more fun 
Nov 4 2018,negative,can you go back in time as in rebela and retcon this awful  crap film  that destroyed not not just our childhood heros but years of our lives enjoying the eu
Nov 4 2018,negative,shockingly bad lucasfilm should be ashamed of themselves
Nov 4 2018,negative,the worst star wars filed ever
Nov 4 2018,negative,this was just as bad as the prequels cringy plot holes everywhere rushed some things just jumping the shark in general merry poppins leia  tit milking ftw
Nov 4 2018,positive,i like daisy ridley as the face of the new star wars trilogy shes very proper reminds me of keira knightley but if keira knightley did weights and couldnt act so good in that sense she reminds me of arnie or sylvester stallone or grace jones but what she lacks in delivery she more than makes up with force and perfect elocution    but brawn acting aside this is the most star wars star wars movie to date its an epic unmissable adventure full of plot twists space battles and lightsabre clashes    it continues to borrow closet characters movie sets and plot points from the original trilogy however that does add to the feel of the star wars universe and i think the last jedi has recovered from a lot of the mistakes of its predecessor the force awakens     one example is kylo ren removing the mask to mature from bad boy to sith dark lord with a heart of pure evil there are moments when shivers will run down your spine at the site of him on screen the creation of a dark force is a real accomplishment in this instalment not seen since anakin went loco at the jedi kid party in revenge of the sith    a really odd point is that there are quite a few references to snuffing people out at first i thought it might be some kind of nicholas cage reference but then carrie fisher takes a dive in the deep black and the whole cinema is stunned into silence but just as the dark force awakens so does the light and we learn about a whole new dimension of jedi abilities and mind tricks    the expansion of jedi skills is both creative and entertaining there are further examples of how the force works and some really great scenes demonstrating the full extent of the new force the norce in action disney superstar daisy rey is very keen to find out about the norce and picks up from where she left off on a yoga retreat in county kerry learning about becoming a jedi in three easy lessons however after lesson two daisy rey faces a crossroads when chewbacca turns vegan and she has to make a decision before everyone turns full namaste finding the balance between dark and hormones rey rushes off to fight the first order by herself resulting in a faceoff with the mysterious supreme leader snoke    snoke is basically the emperor but with the lack of a back story a larger army more loyal apprentices stronger powers and a much creepier voice like snoke is definitely into some weird stuff    meanwhile back on prayer island luke is singing songs to the star wars puffins porgs  learning how to become one with the matrix    there is a lot happening in this movie and its got a finger in a lot of different pies across the universe there are some preachy lessons about how weapons are sold in mass conflicts about how egomaniacs make poor decisions and about how disposable life outside the empire really is    the mantra of the movie appears to be out with the old a message that star wars is evolving for a new generation perhaps with new characters and new adventures the revolution has begun and its about to get a whole lot bigger with even more inconsequential destruction and mass scale murder that neither makes any sense or makes you feel like there is any purpose to your insignificant existence
Nov 4 2018,negative,no plot to get in the way of exploding spaceships and light saber battles  overall overly bloated and boring
Nov 4 2018,negative,this movie was terrible  i gave up seeing star wars movies in theaters after the prequels but eventually gave tfa and rouge one a chance at home  i liked them and looked forward to finally seeing a star wars film in a theater again  well thats not happening after seeing this mess of a movie
Nov 4 2018,negative,omg this movie is shit as fuck it betrayed everything
Nov 4 2018,negative,this movie destroyed not only  my expectations but also  my love for the star wars  franchise   rip
Nov 4 2018,negative,a steaming pile of lazy insulting tripe that has killed star wars for good for so many people anyone saying that negative reviews are because of bots should explain why solo was a massive flop nobody went to see solo because of this abomination people voted with their feet or maybe the bots were responsible for that too and maybe the bots will also be resposible for rian johnson now having his trilogy quietly taken away from him which disney has done   the last jedi is a bad film in its own right but as a star wars film its a total disgrace
Nov 4 2018,negative,the worst star wars movie ever made rian johnson has probably never seen tfa i do not believe that the man has seen ot  the movie does not tell anything about the world it is set in and therefore the galaxy just seems so blank with nothing interesting happening in it new characters are boring or annoying rose is the worst character ever written she is only used as a tool to address current  political topics and agendas she uttered the most stupid line not even anime character would say something like this the movies also full of technical issues dismissing laws of physics and common sense like when the fact that shots from the supremacy have a ballistic curve in space there is no curving in space because there is not enough gravity and even if there was they are shooting laser which can be but still only slightly bend only near a giant star  planet does not posses this amount of gravity and luke dies which does not need to be commented  but the worst thing that this movie did is that because of it there is nothing exciting to be looking forward to in the next film all the good characters are dead resistance is basically in the state rebellion was at the star of new hope  the new characters are boring and had almost no growth
Nov 4 2018,negative,some good visual elements  they had a good hand and played it badly
Nov 4 2018,negative,honestly my least favorite movie experience ive ever had so disappointed in the pointless and unsatisfying story a positive is that it is breathtakingly beatiful full of plot holes and thematic imconstistincies and my least favorite movie ever made  not that its objectivley the worst movie i just personally hate it
Nov 4 2018,negative,worse movie kathy and john destroyed star wars with there political  stunt
Nov 3 2018,negative,i just cant get over what they did to luke skywalker  taking the greatest and most wellknown hero in the galaxy an icon of optimism beloved by millions and turning him into a bitter hateful sarcastic codger  it is unforgivable  there are tons of other problems with the film which have been thoroughly discussed  i would highlight that there is no supervillain in the film except for snoke but he amounts to very little and is nothing but a sidecharacter in this film  rian johnsons fundamental mistake was that he decided to make the movie he wanted to make just for him just to satisfy his creative impulses and in doing so he didnt respect that the entire star wars universe and franchise was built by the blood sweat tears and talent of other people  rian johnson behaved as though he owned star wars instead of acting like the respectful temporary creative custodian of the franchise  the treatment of luke was inappropriate and crass in that regard  i find myself struggling to care about the remaining characters though i still think kylo ren is a good character  i give two stars for that i will say the reykylo dynamic was good and interesting  also two stars for the visuals and sound the film was great in that regard  but the story as a whole was wonky and uninteresting  and what they did to luke i will never understand  i fear star wars is dead  the most memorable scene in the film is after rey and luke have the staff battle where rey is holding out the light saber basically begging luke to help his sister and the good guys  luke turns his head away form the lightsaber like a selfish bitter coward  on so many levels this scene in particular disgusted me  that is not luke skywalker  they desecrated luke skywalker and this would only even be conceivable if george lucas himself gave the order not rian johnson
Nov 3 2018,positive,this was all i wanted to see form star wars  this movie has gorgeous special effects surprising plot twists and magnificent cinematography  i see lots of comments with arguments like star wars isnt a spaceopera anymore have you ever seen star wars or did you just listen to interviews with george lucas because to be honest it never really was rey is a mary sue like luke had to do lots of training to blow up a death star he just can randomly fly and use the force without training this movie cheats with the force that leia scene was ridiculous before esb you couldnt move objects with the force before pm you couldnt force jump and the list goes on and on  people cant enjoy movies anymore becaus they feel themselves too important because they can write reviews to be honest nobody cares if you even read this it is a freaking miracle    may the force be with you and be a good boy leave cast mebers alone the actor from jar jar wanted to commit suicide because of fans
Nov 3 2018,negative,rian johnson killed star wars
Nov 3 2018,negative,i cant begin to express my disappointment with tlj  it could possibly be one of the worst movies ive seen in the last 20 years in any genre  im not joking its p9 from outer space battlefield earth mac and me bad  the sequel did not answer any questions brought up from tfa and character development was nonexistent  i feel this movie was meant for money and propaganda purposes only such as feminismracial diversity  it was shoved into my face forcefully like im supposed to be impressed  there was no instance in any scene i was lost in the sw lore besides yoda and luke together it was just unfunny jokes and pointless plots one after another  the finn and rose romance is one of the most forced romances ive ever seen on screen it will make you cringe and leave the theater  in the prequels at least lucas tried to make it a space opera but fell flat on execution  bottom line disney kathleen kennedy and rian johnson ruined the allure of star wars and made mark hamill and the original cast completely irrelevant  all sw fans want is good storytelling acting and the rest will fall into place  im just glad i was given a free rental to watch this garbage  i know for sure im not paying money to watch ep ix i guarantee it
Nov 2 2018,negative,dead of the trilogie
Nov 2 2018,negative,the movie that broke star wars for good there are so many reasons why this is garbage i dont even have to get into them but i wish rt counted all the scores under 1 star then this trash would be under 25
Nov 2 2018,negative,they murdered the little life that was left in star wars
Nov 2 2018,negative,speechless how do these people have jobs im floored
Nov 2 2018,negative,nothing i can say that isnt already in the other negative reviews this movie attempts to taint the memory of the star wars like no other novel video game or christmas special has my young kids and i hated it has caused them to lose interest in star wars
Nov 2 2018,negative,emotion rich  the only emotion we can gather from this is disappointment that they killed off luke before they killed off the thing that looked like luke in this film   then theres the confusion about the refueling issue is this really secretly a spaceballs sequel
Nov 2 2018,negative,the amount of soy and pc culture in this movie is sickening and it runes the movie completely dont watch
Nov 1 2018,negative,terrible flaming dumpster fire of utter garbage ruin johnstain is a fraud  sucks
Nov 1 2018,positive,gets a lot of flack for being the empire strikes back of the sequel trilogy i love this film for its ups and downs camera work is great acting is on par with empire if not better story is great this is the gem rise of skywalker dreams it was this good
Nov 1 2018,negative,i would pay to not watch this
Nov 1 2018,negative,hate this movie turn the heroes of my childhood into cowards that abandon their family
Nov 1 2018,negative,this movie is an insult to our intelligence
Nov 1 2018,negative,the day star wars died its unbelievable this story telling and massive changes to the star wars cannon made it to the big screen rip luke 
Nov 1 2018,negative,a view of the modern feminist hollywood
Nov 1 2018,negative,this is even worse storytelling than the first in the sags reboot
Nov 1 2018,negative,this movie is nothing compared to the original trilogy  i expected a good move my expectations were averted
Nov 1 2018,negative,when a director wants to subvert expectations its easy to execute it poorly  that is the case here  we can look at the horrible treatment  of luke the dead ends to every story arc from the force awakens the garbage new characters lack of character development or the attempt at humor the film fails on so many levels    the visuals  do not save it
Nov 1 2018,negative,this movie was bullshit at best and at worse it was the pinnacle of how to ruin a franchise as quickly as possible disgusting for my eyes and ears need to see some clone wars episodes to get back to a good day mood
Nov 1 2018,negative,this movie is terrible luke unrecognizable rey is too perfect kylo is not an intimidating villain and luke death doesnt make sense hyperspace ramming strange that nobody used it before and was performed by a forgettable character rose tico is not interesting
Nov 1 2018,negative,star wars the last jedi was said that it would be the darkest sw movie we got a cringy buddy comedy which has no idea what it wants to be all the characters donï 12 12 12 12 12 12 12tmt get any justice and everything is thrown out amazing start leads to horrific disgust
Oct 31 2018,negative,the film that killed the greatest ip of all time
Oct 31 2018,negative,just so bad story and disgrace of all star wars fans
Oct 31 2018,negative,the movie that made me stop caring about my favorite franchise good job dividing the fan base star wars will never be the same
Oct 31 2018,negative,it was horrible and disrespectful it doesnt deserve to exist
Oct 31 2018,negative,this movie was a god damn disappointment not only they killed one of the most beloved characters from the series but he also died from the hands of the worst character from the trilogy the choice for the actors for the last jedi were terrible and a big bunch of money grabbing bastards i dont think the trilogy would be better of unfinished but if this was gonna be their comeback they would have been better of dead in our hopes and dreams the problem is for example marvel studios created thanos in the mcu where they kept on telling that he exists because the movie didnt do something of this sort and was dead for over 7 years returning killing key characters replacing them with characters that are worse then teesing that this is not the end makes this movie terrible
Oct 30 2018,negative,worst star wars film in existence a slap in the face to the franchise
Oct 30 2018,negative,meh money would have been better spent elsewhere i dont even feel like buying the lego sets
Oct 30 2018,negative,an absolute abomination of a film but if you like a crap story full of sjw moments unnecessary scenes and pathetic jokes yeah this movie is for you
Oct 30 2018,negative,pretty much had everything in this youtube video in my head as i watched kind of a disgrace maybe hire a director that cares about the franchise next time 
Oct 30 2018,negative,this movie was so terrible it hurts no worries about developing any characters all the characters from the originals are just old and sad and i still dont really even know what the story is supposed to be about this was the worst
Oct 30 2018,negative,the worst movie of the star wars franchise  a complete mess of a film  get the full review on our podcast dysfunctional nerdcast available on all podcast directories  we also offer celebrity interviews along with all pop culture news including comics toys movies conventions and more
Oct 29 2018,negative,the film was illogical and stupid for the most part it dragged everything out too long introduced unnecessary subplots and characters the visuals were good though
Oct 29 2018,negative,absolutely crap absolutely worth seeing only to see how crappy it is
Oct 29 2018,negative,lost for words    all that money invested for what a group of 5 year old could write a better story    regardless of all the shills this will remain one of the worst if not the worst film ever long after theyve gone    rip star wars
Oct 29 2018,negative,this movie was really hard to watch i really dont know if i can watch star wars after this trash
Oct 28 2018,negative,long boring and not true to the characters  the worst parts were 1 poe being a whiney annoying loser who i think by now has killed more members of the resistance than the sith  2 rose and finn who took two good characters and put them in an irrelevant sjw side mission that slowed down an already terrible movie and 3 luke so unfaithful to the original that even mark hamill came out against his own performance  the silver lining that earning it one star is kylo ren who continues to be awesome despite the terrible script and even worse directing
Oct 28 2018,negative,this movie was appalling the characters make no sense the side quest was pointless the ruined a beloved character worst movie of the series
Oct 28 2018,negative,would love to see the movie that all the critics got to see
Oct 28 2018,positive,leah does not have the force so how in the world did she survive when her part of the ship was blown to bits
Oct 28 2018,negative,good movie if it wasnt star wars but a terrible star wars film
Oct 28 2018,negative,simply bad writing  no sense with sagas history  no sense in carachterssold and new action or motivations
Oct 28 2018,negative,johnson has ped all over all we could care about a travesty of a movie
Oct 27 2018,negative,if this was a standalone scifi i would probably be more positive about it but as a star wars film it feels like its dragging down the franchise as a whole
Oct 27 2018,negative,made a account just so i can put a rating on here looking through audience reviews there is no way the audience score is so high it should be much lower     very disappointed with this film everything was thrown in the trash from everything built up to this point i really liked fa and rouge one but this was no good
Oct 27 2018,negative,it is pretty simple the last jedi ist not a star wars movie   all the awesome fan theories 
Oct 27 2018,negative,poor writing butchered characters two entirely different tones during crucial moments no closure from luke this entire film is wishy washy and is a mess as soon its run time starts help us jj abrams your our only hope
Oct 27 2018,negative,wasnt a great movie with lots of issues it didnt follow through from the force awakens properly after it set the foundation for a fresh trilogy    we still do not know who reys parents are after the big fuss from tfa snoke turns out to be easily killed and there were many decisions that couldve been changed     for example admiral ackbar shouldnt have been killed off so cheaply and he shouldve been the one who did the light speed run not holdo who means nothing to star wars fans also luke shouldve fought kylo ren with a green not blue lightsaber for continuitys sake there was no reason for him to have the blue one at all    and finally there is rose the bit when she stops finn from saving those who we love by flying into the cannon only for her to claim that she is doing just that is just senseless    i have to admit that it wasnt until i had come out of the cinema when i realised the issues with the last jedi it certainly took a while for it to sink in given the high hopes i had after seeing rogue one a year later
Oct 27 2018,positive,not the empire strikes back film star wars fans wanted but it has some very rewarding scenes mostly involving daisy ridley and the ageless mark hamill
Oct 27 2018,negative,i did not enjoy this movie at all you could have easily removed the entire center portion of the film and still not miss anything its opened too many plot holes and everything they built in episode 7 was pissed on and discarded for what felt like no continuation of the previous movie  they ruined lukes character that was built on over 40 years and relied too much once again on trying to quickly establish a new plot absolutely crap
Oct 27 2018,negative,has its moments but generally unengaging and dull  410    picking up where the force awakens left off rey meets luke skywalker and tries to convince him to help the resistance  he is initially hesitant but eventually decides to train rey in the way of the force  however kylo ren also wants to track down skywalker and uses rey for that purpose  meanwhile the resistance are locked in deadly battle with the first order and while they have some minor victories it seems like a futile struggle    im not generally a star wars fan but to my surprise i enjoyed episode vii  the force awakens  it grabbed my attention from the word go and held it all the way through  a rollicking adventure with engaging characters  moreover the blending of the old characters and the new was very well done with the feeling that the torch had been passed to the new generation    unfortunately episode viii doesnt come close to the engagement novelty and adventure of episode vii  its essentially one long actiondrama with little in the way of engagement or originality  the reykylo ren relationship had potential but went nowhere new or interesting and was snuffed out pretty quickly  them possibly working together held my attention but the intrigue was shortlived  the movie simply degenerated into action sequences after that    on the upside no need to waste my time on episode ix or x or xi or
Oct 26 2018,negative,the last jedi fails to coherently continue the story established by the force awakens while also ignoring the history of previously existing characters by changing their personalities and motives for the sake of subverting audience expectations     the last jedi feels out of place in the star wars franchise because it is not true to the films that came before it
Oct 26 2018,negative,worst sw movie ever created i cant believe anyone can like this piece of horrible writing and character destruction its worse than the worst fanfiction ask any sw fan to write a script it would be better than this not kidding kennedy and johnson really really messed up on this one they destroyed beloved characters a whole franchise and its huge worldwide fanbase i cant believe no one at lucasfilms tried to stop this disaster    well done rian johnson and kathleen kennedy i am done with sw the saga ends with episode 6 i will never pay for any sw related stuff again if boycott is what youll understand then boycott it will be
Oct 26 2018,negative,the only good things about this movie are special effects and watching videos on youtube criticizing the movie well done disney
Oct 26 2018,negative,this movie proves that you cant throw money after shit and expect to strike gold  how the hell can this movie have a higher rating on tomatometer of the star wars movies than return of the jedi  ive heard the director made this a film with a theme of failur and boy did he hit the spot and made a failure  there is so many things wrong with this movie i cant even go through them all watch the critiques online that goes through them  story  is boring and leads nowhere you can pretty much say that the movie has no story at all and only plot shit just happens but doesnt mean shit to the story since there is none  characters  are either boring nonprogressing or pointless why are villains made into fools that is not what makes a good villain  comedy  is not funny and misplaced   this was the first star wars movie i didnt watch in theater since i was dissapointed on the force awakens this movie was so stupid that it doesnt seem like star wars anymore will never watch it again and probably never see another disney sw movie
Oct 25 2018,negative,couldnt be worse doesnt even deserve half a star if you like star wars you will hate it
Oct 25 2018,negative,this movie revolved around a pointless and listless spaceship chase for 2 hours that made no sense and then proceeded to destroy one of the most beloved characters in the star wars universe saying that it was terrible is truly and understatement
Oct 25 2018,negative,full of pointless boring story arcs and inconsistencies with the five previous films as well as itself this movie deserves a one star only for the special effects     while some of the characters had some small amount of promise coming out of tfa this promise was not only not delivered on in a way that shows personal growth for them but was reversed into a nonsensical  mess by the end     entire chunks of the movie could be removed without losing anything of value while some of the few actually interesting scenes and ideas were scrapped and can only be found in the cut scenes on the dvd    much like tfa the film doesnt really grasp what makes star wars the legendary series it has been managing to outdo the divisiveness of the prequels tenfold unlike tfa however this story adds absolutely nothing to canon while simultaneously creating plot holes big enough to slip starkiller base through    its not even really amusing as a popcorn flick which at least tfa managed to do hamfisted social messages and gotcha moments masquerading as creativr and meaningful subversion of expectation are not enough to carry a film along especially not one in such a treasured franchise    if you know anything about the star wars universe give it a pass your sanity will thank you
Oct 25 2018,negative,absolute trash with no regard for lore characters or developing a coherent story
Oct 25 2018,negative,you call this shit cooking throws tray
Oct 25 2018,positive,does the casino planet plot point go on for a little too long sure ill give you that is dj pretty useless yup but everything else is flatout amazing the scenes between luke skywalker and rey are not only engaging but even philosophical at times    the imagery of certain locations could be hung as a painting the characters are vastly interesting and while this might not be the best movie in the star wars franchise it still has some of the best scenes and mythology in the star wars franchise    910
Oct 25 2018,negative,if russian bots hate the movie they seem to have more idea of star wars than ruin johnson
Oct 25 2018,negative,i buy the front row of premier seats for the first midnight showing of every star wars movie so i had all my friends there ready to watch this solo was the first star wars movie i havent seen on the first night since return of the jedi because of this movie not a boycott just apathy this movie has damaged the magic that star wars had i dont think itll be easy to put the genie back in the bottle weve seen behind the curtain star wars is now lead by people who do not care about it at all its a plot hole filled mess an insult to star wars fans its such a shame because this movie lost us the casual fans we need to keep star wars alive i couldnt convince my casual star wars fan friends to see solo they simply didnt care anymore     why why did they do this did nobody watch this movie before it launched it isnt devisive its just bad it is the best looking bad movie ive ever seen     space mary poppins space mary poppins
Oct 25 2018,negative,basically takes a dump on the franchise that i have loved all my life i wasnâtmt a fan of the force awakens but this was even worse
Oct 24 2018,negative,impossible to invest in story or characters as none of it makes any sense it bears no logical connection to any of the other sw films and even as a standalone film it is poorly written     the directorwriter should be utterly ashamed of himself what a mess
Oct 24 2018,negative,i am a generation x so loved the original star wars trilogy as i grew up but i am not sure what has happened with the disney versions of the new star wars i dont know but it has lost its magic not much about the mystical force or great battle scenes or the classic journey of training to become a noble jedi it is like just bunch of kids running around and what did they do to lukes character they made him into a depressive who has lost all hope in life sorry a spoilerand he leaves on a whimper no great final jedi battle just fades away mmmm great visuals as to be expected but something is missing disappointed
Oct 24 2018,negative,when this movie first came out i was one of the many bots that claimed that it wasnt bad and the if someone didnt like it that person was a loser nerd but after months of listening to the critiques and watching solo i definitely see why the last jedi gets so much heat and i too dislike it i still do not think its the worst star wars movie ever made that would be the christmas special but its still bad
Oct 24 2018,negative,boring stupid enraging the entire movie saga has built up the idea of throwing away the past and starting a new future but instead because disney realizes this means they cant sell jedi toys anymore they completely do a 180 in the last 10 minutes of the movie now its a battle of good vs evil again why why did you do this    now lets talk about subverting expectations if this movie actually accomplished what it was leading up to then it would successfully subvert expectations and result in something amazing and new    but nooooo these idiots think subverting expectations means that you dont write a real conclusion to anything every plot point will instead result in a nope like charlie brown missing the football and falling on his back i cannot enjoy anything about this movie because now its just annoying    i wasted my time and money on this gross misuse of a decadeslong franchise sorry disney you failed to shove star wars through a mold to make it like marvel movies this isnt marvel    im voting this 1 star because rotten tomatoes does not calculate halfstar ratings into the audience score if you look at the actual audience ratings youll see an incredible amount of halfstar reviews but the average rating is still 29 out of 5 why is this its because in a lame attempt at blocking automated bot attacks youve just blocked out the opinions of the majority now instead of real people giving their feedback you have bloated art critics pasting their premade review to praise this dumpster fire manufactured for two year olds
Oct 24 2018,negative,extremely boring  long  like incredibly long and boring  i was so bored  only giving it one star  thats being generous    plot  i cant remember it  except the part no its gone  rent only  canto bite me  entirely forgettable     salt  underground bunkers  crystal foxes  killer gorilla walkers  some finale    rip admiral ackbar  i didnt get to say goodbye  an ignoble death  not many ot characters left  sad    didnt like this movie at all  i mean  come on  kathleen kennedy
Oct 24 2018,negative,i cant recommend this movie at all definitely the worst in the saga with the attack of the clones the film fails miserably in the presentation of each old character and in the development of the new ones is also too long and pretentious being extremely boring and has really really badly written dialogues which makes me wonder if the screenwriters read something more than the newspaper or if they really think that the public has some deficiency mental the argument is most of the footage uninteresting trying to be epic in scenes that are completely irrelevant and ironically destroying any emotion in those that should be with abusing bad jokes and a silly humor
Oct 24 2018,negative,i feel psychically abused by this
Oct 24 2018,negative,this movie has too many plot holes too many inconsistencies legendary characters like luke are treated with disrespect and the rest is just an overall mess at the very least the visuals are pretty
Oct 24 2018,neutral,relationship between rey  kylo is stupid and forced the movie is meh
Oct 23 2018,negative,just did not like to much stuff made no sense
Oct 23 2018,positive,while its far from a perfect star wars flick it takes bold new steps into a new era of the fandom rian johnson delivers great chemistry between our two protagonists rey and kylo renben solo and advances their story in  satistifying albeit some small ways even in his mideighties john williams delivered one heck of a score that accompanies his prior work masterfully while some segments slow the film down it makes up for itself it with a fantastic climax not the best disneyera film but far from bad 910
Oct 23 2018,negative,shadiversity from youtube perfectly sums up my thoughts and feelings on this complete disgrace of a film star wars is dead and the last jedi killed it 
Oct 23 2018,negative,unholy crap that movie goes nowhere with its story or characters it just throws a lot of characters into the dumpster of stupidity it skips all the interesting struggle of luke that could have motivated his new self and could be interesting vice versa it spends a lot of time with a supposed mental struggle between rey and kylo that you feel neither connected to nor does it produce any tension with all the largely nonsensical twists you dont feel anything but anger at how much they could have done and how much they screwed up instead yes it looks nice nice effects is what money can buy quite reliably  most character actions feel scriptforced rather than character driven
Oct 23 2018,negative,huge disappointment hard to believe the critics watched the same movie i did the story was terrible by any measure luke skywalker was portrayed as some defeated old loser instead of the hopeful hero fans know and love the story gave me no reason to care about the new characters introduced in the force awakens i cant imagine what would make me want to see the next film
Oct 23 2018,negative,this movie is terrible they have killed off every major actor from the best trilogie 45 and 6 and there is no character progression for rey a person who can do everything without training and defeating kyloren someone who has been training his whole life also they kill off snoke now the most useless and forgetible bad guy what is left is a political feminist sjw bullshit  so kathleen kennedy thanks for destroying this franshise
Oct 23 2018,positive,though visually dazzeling  star wars viii suffers under its huge amount of plot holes and forced characters making it  after the end of episode vii a missed chance
Oct 22 2018,negative,the only positive of this movie is how beautiful each shot is a more indepth look peels back the pretty wrapping to reveal the heaping trash compactor beneath the continuity of this film is that there isnt any continuity lucasfilm would be better served by either retconning this film or pretending it never happen much like star trek beyond did with into darkness poor storytelling and horriblywritten characters make this movie fall flat the faceplant isnt complete without the complete dismissal or denial of logic science character arc or what came before in the hopes of subverting expectations rian johnson the director crafted elements that broke the canon of the entire star wars universe many have come out in defense of some choices saying they are explained away in tlj novelif its not apparent to moviegoers the people who fund the movie then its a moot point not everyone who watches the film will go out and buy the novel so the excuse is just that an excuse     the subplot underpinning the movie unravels at its culmination as the duos sidequest finn and rose does not accomplish what they set out to do worse the quest ends in a manner that both finn and rose profess wouldnt work finn had potential in the end and of all the characters that carried over from the force awakens his was presented the best others did not get away unscathed as they suffered from emasculating counterparts    the female characters in this movie were atrociously written and give the viewer no cause to root or care for them screen time for each turned into a modern politicallymotivated moment to emphasize the personal beliefs of the crafters rather than constructing a grand narrative worthy of the star wars title unfortunately for women everywhere they do not have heroes to look up to from this movie as all women were shown to be incompetent even the heroes of the ot era did not come away unscathed     if you are excited to see this film you may enter with high hopes but this is where franchises childhood dreams and heroes go to die the art of subversion is lost due to rian johnsons impotent writing skills the entire movie is set up to make viewers disregard all that has come before to forget the past and forge ahead anew only to turn around and hand you the very things it promised not to deliver when all is in ashes  and the emptiness of the experience resonates you will realize how utterly the last jedi fails save your money and your heartache rent dont buy
Oct 22 2018,negative,i am not a bot    this movie feels like a joke parody of star wars episode vii the force awakens which was criticized for being a rehash of the original star wars  this movie feels like it is making fun of the force awakens by also blatantly copying visuals and plot threads from the original trilogyexcept this time they just reverse the result of each storylineit gets so predictable when you have a gotcha moment every 10 minutes    what kind of business decision is this  they took an adventure fantasy franchise aimed at people of all ages and culturesand turned it into slow space chase scenelike mad max fury road or speed but this time in space at 1 mile per hourand on top of that lecture the audience about social issuesin an adventure blockbuster that is supposed to entertain people of all ages from all walks of life  lucasfilm what were you thinking  disney you gotta micromanage lucasfilm more now because its clear that kathleen kennedy isnt doing her job properly    did disney even watch over the production of this film  did anyone  how the script got green lit is baffling    what do i like about the movie  mark hamills performance is really goodits visually stunning which is partly why the plot holes go unnoticed by many peoplei cant think of anything else    the job of act 2 in a trilogy is to set up a hook for people to anticipate act 3this movie did nothingnothing to set up the 3rd and final movie of this trilogy
Oct 22 2018,negative,you cant just keep rehashing the beats of the original movies someone has to know whats in the magic box this is just a cheap plastic toy from a cereal box
Oct 22 2018,negative,its shit people only like these movies because its star wars
Oct 22 2018,negative,the force awakens was a shameless remake of a new hope     rogue one was a new hope the opening crawl    the last jedi is empire strikes back the opening crawl    the rebels evacuate their base after destroying the death star they seek refuge on a remote icy planet where they are attacked by giant armored transports forcing them to flee again    im genuinely excited to see episode 9 the return of the ewoks
Oct 22 2018,negative,40 years of star wars down the drain luke skywalkers character was ruined massive plot holes and its boring and fails to build upon the mysteries of the previous films this was the first sw film i only saw once in theatersuntil i completely skipped solo because as a life long fan whos read every book i dont care anymore
Oct 22 2018,negative,disney are view and expect the audience to view rian johnson and jj abrams the force awakens was just ok but could have been developed into something decent in this movie as some kid of new michael powell and emeric pressburger there not they cant produce films that people wholeheartedly enjoy and are able to rewatch with wonder    i watched this film in the cinema and rewatched to give the film and its makers a chance i was right the first time around but was left with a feeling of anger after a second watch the production values are excellent its well shot and the sound design is great the problem with this movie is how its written and directed its just awful meaningless set pieces after meaningless  set pieces are knitted together with creditworthy humor and ham handed sentiment     the major bad taste after watching is the way the producers and director wasted talent carrie fishers last appearance is blunted and absent does the director regret this i wonder sticking her in amber for the majority of the movie and removing the expected mother son relationship after the death of solo luke is just silly being on an island can turn even the most driven jedi into acting like a teenage girl who has been grounded     the director said that the negative reception was like the negative reviews that did not really happen when the empire strikes back was released that disingenuous and arrogant tone can be seen wen watching this film best avoided
Oct 22 2018,negative,while entertaining on the surface it does so by way of too many cheap jokes and in the process uses completely mindless changes to both the recent story line and the saga as a whole to completely violate everything loved and established about star wars star wars is dead to me now i will not give them another dime until they remake the saga from scratch in line with the originals
Oct 22 2018,negative,the worst star wars film in my opinion neither luke nor leia acts like luke or leia the guy who saw a little of good in the baddest guy in the galaxy decided to kill his nephew because he saw a little darkness in him
Oct 22 2018,negative,the only redeeming qualities of this movie are the action scenes and sfx  the character and story narrative choices range from forgettable to eyerolling to nonsensical  you will leave this movie scratching your head
Oct 22 2018,negative,amazing visuals horrible story horrible characters horrible plotholes
Oct 22 2018,negative,all in all the worst star wars film ever made not only does it mishandle the legacy characters it fails to build any meaning full motivations for the new characters who are supposed to carry this franchise foreword the best thing i can say about this movie is that it looks good but then every star wars movie looks good
Oct 21 2018,positive,in my opinion people are being too harsh on this film while it did raise several questions i still loved the action performances visuals and even the story sorry i actually liked this one
Oct 21 2018,negative,i really didnt like the last jedi im a huge fan of the original star wars trilogy as i grew up watching them so those are obviously my favorites in the series although i am less fond prequels i did enjoy most of those as well  i also really liked the force awakens although the plot seemed to be a rehash of a new hope i enjoyed and was excited to see where the story would go next     prior to watching episode 8 i avoided reading any reviews because i didnt want to be influenced when i finally watched episode 8 i was underwhelmed to say the least i really hated the way luke skywalkers character was written and treated it seemed like a slap in the face to the original trilogy it also made no sense how reys character was so powerful with no real training also the scene where leia flies through space like mary poppins was probably the single dumbest thing ive seen in any star wars film the entire subplot involving the casino seemed unnecessary and pointless and would probably make the film better if had been excluded i also didnt care for was the whole subplotconflict between laura derns character of poe the whole script just seemed like lazy writing to me after this entry i honestly could care less about episode 9
Oct 21 2018,negative,i have watched this movie 10 times and i have found something to hate about it everytime i see it that i cant unsee this is an unembarrassed to star wars ugh why 
Oct 21 2018,negative,were it not for branding this film would have been lambasted for its generic plodding nonsensical showing
Oct 21 2018,negative,ruined star wars in favor of social justice drivel
Oct 21 2018,negative,this movie was not only a horrible joke on long time star wars fans  1 most things that happen in this movie break the original laws of the star wars universe and im not just talking about the little things lucas did   jedi no longer have to train they can just get more powerful by accepting that they can use the force apparently as is displayed by rae as she basically trains alone majority of the movie and by the end she moves rocks even yoda found difficult with great ease   yoda comes back as a force ghost and can use the force to effect physical objects in the real world which means no one ever had to fight all the back to the 1978 star wars and luke can just transcend whole galaxies by using the force but somehow thinks hes too weak to beat kylo ren    2 this was a big one   a new hope luke as a child never knew who he was grew  up with his aunt and uncle and was a farmer on a desert planet think about that for a moment how horrible is your life as a farmer in the desert suddenly he finds out that his existence is much more he can use a mystical power that is apart of the very fabric of life itself and he plays a vital role in the known galaxy and he is the key to its salvation he is willing endure whatever it takes to save his father in the process and even loses his mentor and a hand in the process flash to tlj and now luke has seen kylo ren rising so he runs and hides like a coward and leaves his friends to their fate   sorry but that was lazy pathetic and effortless writing and despite abrams and johnson trying to say that people didnt like the movie because of chauvinism women are not the issue in this move at all   its a horrible lack of imagination which makes it even worse because if they couldnt figure out how to make a decent movie they should have used one of the many books for reference because though the writers of those got paid millions less they were millions of times more creative than this piece of trash   to quote jcvd in the expendables 2 i want my money back
Oct 21 2018,negative,this movie was beyond terrible i just dont understand how such an amazing space opera that was the original trilogy could be regularly butchered this film in particular had the most incoherent plot  underdeveloped characters and ridiculous and gimmicky plot twists did the critics see the same movie that the general public did because i have no clue what movie they saw star wars the last jedi was awful
Oct 21 2018,negative,worst star wars movie in the series random subplots that donâtmt push the story further everything setup from the force awakens is trashed humour is cringeworthy the hux mum hole at the start eek  loved star wars for as long as i can remember but this is trash i have faith jj will turn things around in episode 9
Oct 20 2018,negative,star wars the last jedi manages to completely wreck the engaging premise set up by its predecessor forever tarnishing the star wars saga in the process
Oct 20 2018,negative,it was a disappointing movie  the light saber fight i did not find very good 
Oct 20 2018,negative,there was so many plot holes the movie was a ginormous piece of space swiss cheese
Oct 20 2018,negative,the movie is garbage and a propaganda film disappointed that disney would allow this franchise to move in the direction they did  strong diverse characters led by rey finn kylo ren and poe dameron only to be lost in in your face blatant political correctness and the lack of use of strong characters that made star wars special is just a slap in the face to fans  and unfortunate for new fans  my kids will not watch this movie again
Oct 20 2018,negative,the film tries too hard to be different a spanner is thrown in the works every where possible however it is a 2 star rating from me rather than a 1 star because its not too much a disaster that cant be fixed in episode 9
Oct 19 2018,negative,hi my name is greg i am 23 i have never taken the time to review something online before i never thought it necessary that has changed    this movies ruined star wars for me this movie    this movie ruined luke skywalker     the unpredictability of the the force awakens does not make it good every twist seems to come with its own plot holes and at times even shake the foundation of star wars   i studied political science at one of the most liberal colleges in the country i am no foe to political correctness but i believe that the constant pc pushing was so nakedly obvious and so shoved down my throat that it drastically took away from my viewing experience when admiral holdo goes into hyperspace and destroys the opposing ship the moment is supposed to be glorious all i could think about was how that one instant ruined space battles for the entire star wars franchise every space battle should just be hypspacing transports into battleships     when rose crashed into finn to save him how could she even be remotely confident that he would not die why did she rescue finn if he was going to save the rebellion wasnt her whole family murdered by the first order     why is luke skywalker not luke skywalker luke was always hopeful and optimistic luke was an icon of hope why turn him into a shmuck what is there to gain god im so dumbfounded   why make luke a  holigram magic thingy if youre going to kill him anyway    its been a long time since i first watched the last jedi these thoughts have festered in me for a long time if you liked the movie im happy for you i dont mean to take away from your experience at all but for me this movie ruined star wars     i can only hope that jj abrams rises to the challenge of repairing rian johnsons torn up plane before it crashes     thank you for reading
Oct 19 2018,negative,george lucas please take back star wars
Oct 19 2018,positive,visually stunning a powerful script and does great justice for the vast majority of characters sometimes the norms of star wars need to be subverted and this movie does so in a spectacular way  a good reminder fans need to let go of the past and embrace a less narrow future for sw0
Oct 19 2018,negative,i honestly have no clue where to start on this film it is pure garbage i cannot even write a lengthy response to my review because i am still lost in the amount of trash my mind is swimming in    pathetic absolutely pathetic the amount of disrespect they did to the characters makes you want to vomit in disgust     flying princess leia after getting exploded into space seriuosly    why in the world are you trying to even find luke skywalker just have leia fight snoke or kylo ren i mean she got blown up and survived  so who needs luke you got freaking flying princess leia    unbelievable 
Oct 19 2018,negative,absolute garbage being contrarian for the sake of being contrarian is adolescent and pedantic rian johnson somehow did more damage to the star wars legacy than all three prequels combined which i did not think was possible i am not sure if anyone thought it possible but rian johnson has such an inept intellect that it can achieve amazing feats
Oct 19 2018,negative,terrible movie it ruined the franchise forever
Oct 19 2018,negative,1 star  1st star wars film i really disliked  good visuals acting special effects the falcon jedi templetreebooks yoda  but so much bad  poes call to hux   slow motion bombing run  r2d2  c3po have nothing to do  canto bight  irrelevant to plot finn and rose dont care about slave kids  rose advises finn to run away devaluing every rebelresistance fighters loss of life including her sisters  djs moral relativism and nihilism wins  let the past die  motto of every violent revolutionary in history from french terror to russian marxists to nazis to chinas cultural revolution to the khmer rouge  rey is powerful without explanation unless she turns out to be a skywalker in ep9  skywalker bloodline irrelevant  what the hell was the point of eps 16 you idiot rian  snoke dead  mystery from start to finish for moviegoers like me who have no interest in the expanded universe  luke tries to kill his nephew  luke who faced the emperor without weapons to redeem his father now sees a dream and decides to kill his nephew in cold blood  old bitter luke  similar to young whiny luke  are we back at toschi station  bb8  turns poker chips into missiles that defeats a legion of first order soldiers is on par with teddy bear ewoks defeating the empire in rotj or r2d2 having rockets to fly in ep2 but not in ep4 5 or 6 when they would have been handy  maz  a stupid pointless phone call  lukes lightsabre being thrown away and no explanation of why rey got visions from it  luke drinking sea cow milk  really didnt need to see that  porgs  some vegetarians propaganda about not enjoying meat  leia flying through space  mary poppins lives  ackbars death  unworthy of the hero of rotj  no mourning of han  drop the canto bight sideline and include the deleted scene  purple hair not explaining the plan  rebels resistance were told the plans in ep47 why so why would the resistance change tack and wont tell its members what is going on is ludicrous  reys training  3 lessons in 1 or 2 days not nearly enough  in tesb it is implied lukes training is at least a few weeks reys should have been at least that long  timeframe  too short  all up it appears that by the time we get to the end of tlj were about 4 or 5 days on from when poe was in the village on jakku at the start of tfa  no lightsabre battle  luke isnt really fighting kylo and luke fights rey with a pole  the ending was like the ending of a trilogy not the ending of a middle film    in summary what a dismal failure tlj was  its the 21st century equivalent of the star wars holiday special or the two tv ewok movies  its the quantum of solace of star wars    where to from here they have to fix things in ep9 rtegas you tube edits     1 snoke iswas darth plageius   ignore pablo hs twitters  2 rey must be luke and mara jades daughter  born 1820 years before tfa  3 the evil of the first order needs to be seen on screen  4 there has to be a time gap of about a decade between ep8 and 9   5 c3po and r2d2 need to be brought back into the middle of the story plotlines      all opinions are my own and i make the ideas above freely available for anyone to use as they see fit
Oct 19 2018,negative,how can you sht on fans and keep your job kathleen kennedy
Oct 18 2018,negative,i thought this was a better film than tfa but still not worth watching again its an insult to fans of the star wars movies predisney no depth flashy visuals but that is to be expected when you just dump a pile of money on a movie bad story numerous plot holes and not enjoyable to watch
Oct 18 2018,negative,worst star wars movie period phasma and snokes potential were wasted in the worst possible way rey is still a mary sue character that never received training or character development the casino planet along with its political messages have no place in a star wars movie luke skywalkers character was utterly twisted to the point where he is unrecognizable the list goes on
Oct 18 2018,negative,such a missed opportunity
Oct 18 2018,positive,this was a wonderful movie
Oct 18 2018,negative,terrible work here seems like ryan j actually tried his worse to make the fandom feel miserable while watching this piece of garbage critics say is good just to push their own political ideologies which dont fit into sw after watching this movie and with all my sorrow i find myself quiting sw for good this marks the death of the franchise no storytelling no character development no seriousness no epicness the movie is dumb and long turning painful to watch
Oct 18 2018,negative,i wish i could give this a big fat 0 stars i cant believe people are giving this more than 1 star it sucked really bad the star wars series was just killed in every way possible im a life long fan and they shot themselves in the foot the force awakens was bad enough the way they killed off han solo at least let him save a planet by flying the falcon into the planet death star or something along that line still sick from the experience pissed off fan here
Oct 18 2018,negative,by far the worst star wars movie ever
Oct 18 2018,positive,overall really enjoyed the movie especially what they did with luke rey and kylo it was a bit over long and the rest of the plot was meh but overall i enjoyed it besides a few really stupid scenes
Oct 18 2018,negative,an ok film if you are new to the star wars world and on its own it passes the time not strong narratively but the effects were good worth seeing if its on tv but not worth paying for
Oct 18 2018,negative,this is an awful film nice effects but subverting expectations by having a story that makes no sense i am shocked by the critics rating it makes you question if they actually watch the films they review i wonder if they revisited the film now they would rate so highly
Oct 18 2018,positive,ya there is some dumb stuff in this movie but i love what they did with luke i enjoy watching it and think its easily in the top 4 best star wars movies
Oct 17 2018,negative,this bullshit film has completely nonsensical plots destroys any concept of logic or consistency in the universe and is nothing more than an sjw cash grab the only good thing this movie has is good looking expensive visuals
Oct 17 2018,negative,the worst star wars movie ever and also just a pretty bad movie in general cant believe the world i live in anymore honestly
Oct 17 2018,negative,this movie crapped all over the legacy of our most beloved characters what is the point of snoke he lives and dies with no backstory or reason who decided to turn luke the representation of hope into a angry old man subvert our expectations thats not good enough one bad even with ben solo would not do that to the good hopeful luke finally does he just randomly regain hope at the end not graduallybut just conveniently when he needs to also he just assumes kylo ren is evil when the old luke even believed in the goodness in darth vader the movie would have still have done luke justice if the movie had kept the theme of balance between good and evil if luke had affirmed that if the jedi disappear then the sith will disappear too but no the whole theme of the past must die and the jedi must end instead they build this up and are just like but hope  also vice admiral holdo is written as such a shitty leader like she ignores the worries of her followers and withholds her plans in a time of crisis and just thinks that people should just trust her just cause this movie looks great and its not hard to watch but there are so many problems having to do with continuity with the past movies and just some real bad characters and character progression stories like why did they spend so much time in a canto casino like why were the characters more concerned with the enslaved animals and hardly noticed the enslaved children caring for the animals i dont want to be here all day but ill suffice it to say that if you loved the original trilogy and the mythology dont watch or prepare to have your favorite characters be twisted and changed until theyre almost unrecognizable
Oct 17 2018,negative,as a lifelong star wars fan i felt this movie was horrendous there isnt a meaningful story arc here and it fails to respect the source material its full of plot holes and inconsistencies that will haunt the franchise moving forwards such a shame
Oct 17 2018,negative,rian johnson has in my own opinion brought us a star wars masterpiece set aside the originals being legendary masterpieces as the story continues i have grown even more love for the franchise amazing
Oct 17 2018,negative,stunning visuals might distract you through this thorough destruction of everything you loved about the franchise
Oct 17 2018,negative,specifically setup an account so i could rate this awful excuse for a star wars movie the disney era has reduced an epic tale of redemption to a thinly veiled sjw rant telling everyone theyre sexistracistrussian if they didnt love the film a sad fall from grace for the franchise that defined the film industry for generations sad doesnt even begin to cover it the hishe version was better
Oct 17 2018,negative,good enough to see the obligatory one time just to feed your curiosity of seeing a new star wars movie lacks action an interesting plot and any new additions of a great story to the star wars universe sad
Oct 17 2018,negative,without doubt the worst movie i have ever seen
Oct 17 2018,neutral,it was ok kind of meh
Oct 17 2018,negative,terrible star wars movie  lore breaking and does a complete disservice to all those that have come before it ryan johnson is a terrible director i give it 1 star for music effects and locationset design  everything else sucked
Oct 17 2018,negative,where to start with this movie first let me say i enjoyed tfa as a reasonable reboot and really enjoyed rogue one i wish episode 8 was anything other than what we actually got   in general i wish tlj was not set right after tlj like picking up exactly after tfa  that really hurt the scope of what the movie could do this dawned on me pretty quickly as i sat there in the cinema  this is my second review here so im not going to go over all the bad aspects of this movie rather id like to speculate how it could have been better trying to keep as much of the movie as possible  lets keep the themes of the movie destroying the past and the consequences of failure lets keep the characters but lets tweak the story and change the tone and tweak the politics lets also round out the characters so that their actions are driven by motivations we can relate to  this critique mainly focusses on the b story for the most part the a story of luke and rey has its issues but the holdopoefinnrose story drives the movie along and has the most issues  let me state thar im baffled that people ascribe an sjw element to this part of the movie because well almost all of the resistance leadership figures make terrible mistakes poe disobeys a direct order resulting in an unnecessary battle and high casualties  and later instigates a mutiny holdo doesnt reveal her plan or explain why so causes a command fiasco finn and rose fail in their mission then allow a complete untrustworthy stranger dj to hear a crucial piece of information that dj later tells the fo this results in a massacre on the space transports with the resistance survivors retreating to a base with just one way in and their call for help going unanswered an overall political failure they attack the fo ground forces with terrible losses and the remaining survivors are so few in number that they can all comfortably fit on the millennium falcon i dont see this as a win for feminism people  so its a disaster for the resistance yet it doesnt feel like that this is not due to the politics diversity or the actors involved its down to a confusing story which cant make its mind up over the tone it wants to portray  first dump all the wtf moments that took people out of the movie poes mom joke luke goin fishing luke milking a spacecow leia poppins topless kylo keep phasma for episode 9 as shes just wasted here drop the almostoutoffuel shlock instead have the resistance fleet make jump after jump with the fo in pursuit with resistance ships dropping one by one as their engines finally give out  fail to make the next jump in time it would be more visually arresting at least    lets fix the holdocantrevealthe plan problem holdo would reveal she isnt completely sure how the fo is tracking them  is it really some kind of tracking technology or does they resistance have an fo spy on board the uncertainty means she has to have a small circle of trust such are the stakes involved when confronted by poe she reacts angrily genuinely and forthrightly  condemning poes own decision to disobey orders highlighting the lives lost and the fact the bombers would be more useful now rather than earlier not the cartoonish flyboys comment she actually makes ie poe cant be trusted to know the plan after his recent actions above all she needs to show the stress of command  its all on her now just a change in dialogue and tone would solve a lot here   also you know just let admiral ackbar do the hyperspace ramming  keep holdo alive for episode 9  rose and finn need a better reason to go to the casino planet it should be about eliciting help  either from some kind of political gobetween on the planet or someone directly in power at least wed get some meaningful interaction with some of these alien characters lets keep dj not a code breaker but a so called gobetween or power broker  also lets give a compelling reason for rose and finn to get to know each other i suggest the slave kids i found it unbelievable that rose and finn would end up in a situation where they are releasing space horses from captivity but not the kids themselves lets have the kids would ask finn and rose to save them rescue them from a horrible situation this would cause a classic dilemma between the kids needs and the needs of the mission an added layer is that rose came from this background and finn was taken from a family he never knew  this adds more pathos to the dilemma however this plays out it would be at least be better character development for all concerned it would be a showdonttell approach to that part of the sw universe instead of the heavy handled dialogue we are subjected to it could play out on a more nuanced way and drop the spacehorse rampage sequence  we dont care   so finn rose and dj still get captured by the fo and the escape plan gets betrayed by dj note that in the movie rose and finn really allow this to happen by letting dj overhear the plan rose and finn still manage to escape  get back to crait on a fo ship   now in the movie what happens or doesnt happen next is a huge problem with finn and rose noone interrogates them as to how the plan went wrong and how the mission failed in the movie finn and rose screw up so bad that many lives get lost on the transports but they face no consequences i really was wtf here rose and finn should really feel guilty and conflicted about what has occurred  that would provide a real motive for finn to try to sacrifice himself and perhaps a more realistic motive for rose to stop him drop the stupid line from rose about saving what we love  instead use something along the lines that both are responsible for a tragic mistake and both now have to stay alive to make up for it  on crait make the fight a bit more desperate people die in the movie but noone seems to be actually wounded or hurt that i can see   on the millennium falcon the survivors seem like have they just come out of a broadway show they should instead be traumatized survivors there should be wounded people in the falcons passageways it should seem desperate the resistance has barely survived   and this is the emotional hole at the heart of the movie its hard to see what the resistance has lost except for a lot of people we were never made to care about no one important has died  luke excepted and we know hell come back as a force ghost anyway its hard to care about episode ix based on this movie
Oct 16 2018,positive,i loved this film  what they did with luke was a perfect echo of obi wan i thought it captured the magic of star wars the lure of the dark side and the plight of the rebellion beautifully i love that it was an attenuated struggle meant to imply the years of slow destruction that led the resistance to this point forget what you wanted to happen and accept that this could be something better i will say minus milking a space whale
Oct 16 2018,negative,great effects terrible story plotholes all over the place dialogue that makes no sense or is cringy af disney hasnt planned ahead and it really shows rian johnson didnt know what to write so he just did nothing with the material set up by jj i just copy the same stuff to reboot a francise abrams
Oct 16 2018,negative,this film is a spectacular abandonment of reason continuity reason and intelligence there are some pretty special effects of course but there is a almost incalculable amount of nonsense and thoughtless idiocy it is really disgraceful
Oct 16 2018,negative,the last jedi not only ruined the entire star wars saga and all of its mythos its directer is so unwilling to accept criticism that hes now blaming russian bots for poor reviews im making my voice heard that we are real people who hated a crap movie
Oct 16 2018,negative,not much to like hereits why star wars died and is dead only watch the old stuff
Oct 16 2018,negative,the last jedi is a visually stunning film with a disater of a script  its amazing how poorly the characters both old and new are treated  the gaps in continuity and logic are glaring and frequent
Oct 16 2018,negative,continuity be damned you would have to be very desperate for something that is called star wars and looks like star wars to enjoy this film
Oct 15 2018,negative,mediocre i truly thought that that the star wars franchise would have a chance with disney taking over after seeing the force awakens and seeing rogue one but disney does what disney does best push out movies as fast as humanly possible to make as much money as fast as humanly possible
Oct 15 2018,positive,wanted to see more of snoke poe is my new favourite hero need more info on rey though  i did like it like others didnt
Oct 15 2018,positive,while im not happy with disneys execution the movie as a whole i found enjoyable plus i loved the surprise ending one thing thats overlooked is that for the first time ever in the sw franchise i have no idea what will happen in episode ix ive watched so many films that its rare if hollywood ever surprises me even if i dont like the film i will always give credit for writers and directors breaking the mold and not following the same tropes this movie definitely surprised me i do want a better execution of ideas from sw movies so i hope they up the quality next time
Oct 15 2018,positive,45are not real fans
Oct 15 2018,positive,a beautiful and inspiring film
Oct 15 2018,negative,ruined star wars for me
Oct 14 2018,negative,i thought  the force awakens was terrible with the mary sue character rehashing of the exact same plot and deterants and sjw agenda but oh boy was i wrong this travesty of a movie shouldnt even be mentioned anywhere near the starwars franchise single handily one of the worse movieseven without the brand ive seen the only slight redeeming factor is the fight scenewhen you dont factor in destroying established premises like blocking off warp jumps and cgi they ruined all aspects of the star wars universe that we loved all for the sake of sjw agendas money and ruining the starwars franchisewhich at this point feels like they did on purpose it was a big middle finger to fans and its sickening    paid shills that work for firms that skew public views onlineyes there are people paid to do that are suggesting the outrage from the fanbase are hacking russian trolls but that is just as ludicrous as calling this a starwars film
Oct 14 2018,positive,a better film than most people give it credit for plot holes and a lack of character development keep this from being up there with the greats in star wars
Oct 14 2018,negative,somehow even worse than the force awakens  after over 30 years luke skywalker uses the force once and dies from what i can only guess is a heart attack like seriously he doesnt even fight he just dies
Oct 14 2018,positive,this is a solid entry into the star wars franchise however its a lackluster film when compared against the other great star wars films for starters with the set up from the force awakens the force should currently  be expanding maybe even adding new interesting forceusing characters in this film we get a retraction of the force a retraction of the jedi again and a completely nonsensical retraction of the dark side we also get the near decimation of the entire resistance which following the destruction of the death star in the force awakens really doesnt make a lot of sense a lot of the questions set up by episode 7 such as who are reys parents will kylo rejoin the light what has luke been doing get very very unclear unfinished nonexistent or unsatisfying answers in this film     as far as the portrayal of the force in this film and forceusers we continue to get the almost completely inexplicable rise of rey who has undergone a mere 3 days of training compared to characters such as snoke and kylo ren who have had a lifetime of training being an equal match for the strongest force characters in the trilogy it continues to make no sense divert the plot into nonsensical storylines and drag down the overall trilogy     outside of the force users with the regular characters such as poe and leia this film was 50  good 50  bad on the one hand everything felt very star wars it was slightly entertaining to watch and kept a torrid action pace however often times the plot sunk its teeth into some of the most minimal explanations as to completely fantastical situations such as a single resistance ship with some 300400 resistance fighters basically able to fend off the entire first order with some 5 star cruisers for almost the entire film     overall i would rate this film close to a 70 but since we have such high expectations for star wars and since the profitability of the franchise and the rabid dedication of the fanbase to what is many peoples favorite franchisesaga i have to give this a lower rating since its a weak entry into the overall star wars universe the film just doesnt pay close enough attention to what it means as an overall star wars film to give it a higher rating
Oct 14 2018,negative,i will admit this movie is visually stunning the colors and the cgi effects are for the most part beautifully done  that does not however make a movie  the plot if there actually is one was either not well written or not edited correctly  important character moments are missing between rey and luke and rose and finn  characters are disrespected most noticeably luke and finn  rian johnson managed to take the original hero who wouldnt give up on his father and turn him into a loser who was going to kill his nephew because he was starting to lean toward the darkside rather than attempt to turn him back to the light  dont even get me started on the treatment finn faced in this movie his plot was the one i found the most compelling in the force awakens lets face it rey is just blah and too perfect  finn actually went through trials and tribulations and evolved from a character that was basically a coward just trying to get away into a man willing to pick up a lightsaber and fight kylo to defend rey  then in this movie they turn him back into a bumbling idiot whose moment of self sacrifice is ruined by rose and if they were supposed to have chemistry then it didnt show on screen      the plot holes in this movie are big enough to move a planet through and the lack of respect paid to the force awakens which was the first movie in what is supposed to be a trilogy was so annoying that i could barely sit through the movie in the theater  a trilogy needs a beginning a middle and an end  the movies can stand alone and have their own self contained plots but there needs to be some sort of overarching theme that connects all of them  there should be set ups and pay offs that are used throughout all three movies which is something most writers learn in school  if you arent going to use the shotgun dont put it on the table  with these films there is nothing except for the settings that connects any of the potential plots of the force awakens to the last jedi  the ending of this movie feels like the ending of a series and didnt leave me at all interested to see what happens next  there are no questions or plot threads remaining that i feel can be properly paid off in episode 9 that wont feel rushed because of the mistakes made in this movie    i could write a paper with all the reasons why i dont like this movie but i understand that some people did enjoy it and more power to them  we all have our opinions and thoughts and as i said at the start i will agree that the visuals are stunning  its a shame the story cant measure up to them    also a book attached to a series of movies should not need to be read to allow someone watching the movie to understand what is happening  a book especially in star wars can add to the universe but i shouldnt have to buy 12 books to fill in all the plot holes in one movie  if the writer of a film has to direct the audience to a book to fill in the gaps then they failed to do their job properly
Oct 14 2018,positive,as the conflict between the first order and the resistance grows so do our heroes from both the original and sequel trilogy the last jedi evokes a characterdriven narrative akin to the empire strikes back to wonderful effect    the last jedi is an excellent sequel to the force awakens the writing is thoughtful and well done and left me wanting more the growth that nearly every main character experiences throughout the course of the film is immensely satisfying the last jedi pays homage to the legacy of the past and also looks forward to the future    adam driver daisy ridley and mark hamill in particular are spectacular and very engaging when on screen the rest of the cast is fantastic as well even if not every line of dialogue is a masterpiece    i have seen the last jedi many times since and enjoy each return if you are eager to delve deeper into the characters from the force awakens and watch the new galactic conflict unfold then you will most likely enjoy this movie
Oct 14 2018,negative,im a long time sw fan up to a point of exploring expanded universe and im registering here just to put this review cause i had enough what a ruin of a franchise it felt like new director just decided to cut any piece of story that was built by force awakens not that it was any good either but not as bad apart from visuals  there is nothing good about this movie i can go into a lot of details but to make it short nothing happening on the screen makes any sense the only way you can enjoy it  erase memory of any previous sw film shut off your brain and blankly observe the picture   how it has 91 critic approval rating is beyond my comprehension
Oct 13 2018,positive,an amazing piece of art
Oct 13 2018,positive,warning this review doesnt contain any spoilers per se but it does mention stuff you specifically wont find in the movie    i know this film is very controversial there are choices i feel were misguided but at the end of the day i just came to be entertained and the film was very good at that    it looks great with some visually arresting shots and sets snokes throne room and the salt planet are especially eyecatching action is very impressive including one of the best fight sequences in star wars    the cast is all likable especially liked the new character of rose whose determinism contrasts well with the reluctant finn dialogue is good    one of the strongest aspects of this film is that director rian johnson manages to defy expectations about what will happen on the other hand he seems so intent to go his own direction that he fumbles a little with carrying on the plot he seems almost resistant to continue what jj abrahams set up in the last film you still dont learn supreme leader snokes origins not even a single line of dialogue though im not entirely hating the character even if he is a clone of emperor palpatine hes got a bit of style and drive to him the knights of ren are barely mentioned supposedly the first order has several forceusing fighters so where are they phasma was set up in the first film to be a big villain but she is barely in this unlike some people i dont mind the casino planet and the resistance infighting though i do agree that the reasoning of the rebel upper command could have been better reasoned still i think those subplots could have been easily shortened    i get that a lot of fans may feel betrayed but i found this to be a stylish scifi action film
Oct 13 2018,negative,a disgrace to the star wars series they ruined what made luke awesome 
Oct 13 2018,negative,i guess ill take it from the top     the opening scene with the exchange between poe and general hux corny cringeinducing humour sets the tone for this rough ride which ends in a your mam joke as dameron proceeds to smoke the entire turret offensive of a dreadnought in his solitary exiled xwing the first order officials lack the cunning and brutality of their original trilogy empire counterparts and its hard to take hux seriously as it is without johnson ridiculing him further with the dialogue the resistance manage to destroy the fleet killer dreadnought whilst losing half of their fleet including all of their bombers after orders from leia are refused by poe who seems to have had a personality transplant from jj abrams vision of the character in the first instalment of the trilogy    rey is on the isolated rocky terrain of anchto searching for jedi master and hero luke skywalker who has abandoned his friends family and comrades in yet another personality transplant the new hope has seemingly lost hope after luke is presented with his fathers longlost lightsaber by the eager rey in what can only be described as the cinematic embodiment of rian johnson taking a big stinky corninfested grinning turd on the chest of the entire star wars franchise and fan base and smearing it to spell the statement fuck you faithfuls skywalker tosses the iconic hilt over his shoulder as if to say bollocks to his family and the resistance     a fantastic opportunity to give leia a heroic and shocking demise which wouldve made sense with the sadly already passed fisher unable to reprise her role passes johnson completely by johnson squats for the afterturd having leia supermanning through space without a scratch on her face after a high intensity impact to her ships bridge in a ridiculous force feat that ignores the sagas lore completely     the intense and intriguing duo of phasma and snoke are made a mockery of by johnson as both are killed off with no backstory or development whatsoever the almighty snoke is ousted with ease by kylo ren at that who he has just spent scenes making a mockery of with insults of his character and power in an intergalactic bullyfest     canto bight not even going to bother    abrams potential avenues set up in tfa are mostly completely ignored with such bollocks as reys parents revealed as nobodies     another fantastic and heroic opportunity for roses character to save her fellow resisters with an act of selfless martyrdom is sunk like a led balloon by the weak as piss johnson     we do get to see amazing force projection by luke in the final scene as he confronts ren which was rather cool but is it what we really wanted after a piss poor showing of cowardice from our childhood hero who shouldve went out on his shield in a bout of elite swordsmanship with the vengeful ren     an amazing performance from hamill against his better judgement too just shows his professionalism and it is up and away his best display as luke     the visuals sets costumes score etc are all of the absolute finest quality but when the script and storytelling is so shit it truly is a case of clutching at straws this film just feels like a massive opportunity missed for the most anticipated star wars movie of all time what a shame     2 out of 5 stars
Oct 13 2018,positive,everyone just shut up this is a great movie yes it had problems with lukes character but im the end he was the hero of the story so just stop arguing about the questions it didnt answer not everything is about what you want
Oct 13 2018,negative,pros great cinematography and special effets actionpacked movie with a good amount of twists and turns to keep things interesting adam drivers performance as kyle ren is a highlight as well as carries last performance as leia    cons story and characters are nonsensical to the point of breaking immersion some characters do not act like in previous movies and no good explanation is given to justify this change countless plot contrivances and some serious plot holes one of the main bplots is completely pointless some dialogue is poorly written ridleys performance is subpar at points boyega is wasted overall is not a good movie and it has nothing to do with main character being a female or poc in the movie its just not a good movie period
Oct 13 2018,negative,the visuals were amazing and there were some nice surprises in the movie however the surprises dont hold their appeal into the second viewing for obvious reasons and the rosetinted glasses also came off revealing all the cons i had forced myself to overlook in the first viewing as someone who loves star wars and has invested 100s of hours and over a 1500 into the franchise i can tell you this if you want to watch star wars you should find a different movie as this abomination doesnt deserve to stand with the rest of star wars video canon anything else to say about the movie would be even more negative i would rate this lower but i dont want rt to censor my voice by claiming my rating is an outlier so its getting 15
Oct 13 2018,positive,nowhere near perfect but not horrible like everyone is saying
Oct 12 2018,negative,pointless villain jedi magically becomes a master instantly we get a female general and shes an utter failure of a leader and a suddenly infatuated lover who would condemn her own people to severe peril than let someone shes hardly acquainted with attempt a desperate act to save them what is this mess
Oct 12 2018,positive,another classic chapter to the greatest phenomenon in all of cinema
Oct 12 2018,negative,poor storytelling with little to no character development for the new characters introduced in this trilogy subplot unrelated and inconsequential to the greater story of the movie and the saga as a whole johnsons use of poorlytimed comedy delegitimizes the dire situations the protagonists find themselves in let the past die because star wars isnt special anymore
Oct 12 2018,negative,rian johnson clearly hates star wars spaceballs will be canon before this abomination is
Oct 12 2018,positive,so great screw the haters all of them
Oct 12 2018,neutral,massive wasted potential feels like an ealevel rushed dlc to the force awakens  while the first sequel film played it safe and minus a few cracks put up a great fundation for another adventure the last jedi doesnt really achieve anything beside creating controversy for the sake of controversy  an ok riide for the most part with some great moments but someting feels off for most of the times and when i start to think about it the internal logic fals apart the tone is worse than prequel awkward yet when i think further signs of great ideas began tp show that could be amazing with better exdcuting and im saddened how bad it fall on its face the way we got the movie
Oct 12 2018,negative,this movie is a plague that should have never been released i have no idea what they were thinking breaking the successful story threads of 40 years in the skywalker saga it also makes no sense to have broken the narrative threads from the force awakens disney could have made non skywalker sw movies if they really wanted to change things instead they had legendary iconic heros trodden out before us only to be shot and killed in humiliating ways and replaced with flat annoying soulless characters kathleen kennedy and rian johnson are clearly primarily responsible for this historic cinematic tragedy shame on anybody at lucasfilm who didnt speak up during its production and have the humility and integrity to seriously question what was happening regardless of what happens in episode 9 it almost seems inevitable now that one day 1020 years down the road that disney will eventually retcon this sequel trilogy and replace it with something better and more similar to the eu maybe the events of this sequel trilogy were never supposed to happen because sidious was screwing things up somehow in an unfair way and so the whills in a once off fashion decide to reverse all of it boooom the sw universe is reset to right after the return of the jedi you can now begin making 20 good eu movies money but this shouldnt be attempted until lucasfilm knows what theyre doing
Oct 12 2018,positive,great film interesting character arcs deconstruction of the star wars mythos and evaluating it in the modern world its  a must see a franchise changer
Oct 12 2018,negative,terrible film  story was all over the place had the most boring 30 minute sub story of any movie ever
Oct 12 2018,negative,whats left to say that hasnt been said this is by far the worst major studio production ive ever seen in a theater there are hundreds of hours of analysis out there detailing everything wrong with this film but i think they all miss the point if you were to make a film with the intention of giving a massive middle finger to all fans of the franchise the very people who made it a monumental success for 40 years you simply couldnt do a better job than this film from that standpoint its a masterpiece as a film its a complete travesty
Oct 12 2018,negative,the movie was full of terrible writing choices and missed opportunities this movie single handedly killed my interest in star wars as a movie universe and short of revoking it from canon i doubt i will ever watch another star wars movie after this
Oct 12 2018,negative,congratulations rian you killed this trilogy 
Oct 11 2018,positive,once again a star wars movie has been breaking box office records why you may ask it had good action scenes good special effects memorable characters like rey and the most important of the all it had a good plot however the reason i gave it a three and a half star was because it didnt have a good lightsaber battle and lukes character wasnt treated the way we expected and seriously why did you have to kill snoke so early in the trilogy
Oct 11 2018,positive,this film is not bad but boring at times and it fleshes out some characters like luke sky walker in the most unsatisfactory way
Oct 11 2018,positive,i loved the movie as a star wars fan i dont see why hardcore nerds are disliking it  it just disappointing on the fans side of things when it is a great movie and much better than the prequels and this new trilogy so far seems to me be holding up quite well to the original trilogy i cant wait for episode 9
Oct 11 2018,negative,359 fresh reviews its hard to believe that 359 checks werent written by the disney corporation its probably time to create a tomatometer for each of these critics after reading and rereading the critics consensus above i can only retort in luke skywalkers own words amazing every word of what you just said was wrong
Oct 11 2018,positive,last jedi is up here with a new hope  nooooope  more like 6575
Oct 11 2018,negative,never in the field of galactic conflict was so much ruined for so many by so few
Oct 11 2018,negative,not only is this a bad movie but it manages to make all the other movies worse
Oct 10 2018,negative,poorly written badly executed sets a new low in beloved franchise do not pay to see it
Oct 10 2018,negative,bad writing a bunch pointless characters destroys what the original trilogy built up only positive i can say is the visuals were really good but this movie is overall bad and sucks
Oct 10 2018,negative,terribly put together to push feminism down the viewers throat by far the worst star wars episode to date and doing worse than episode one and three is a difficult taskbut they pulled it off
Oct 10 2018,negative,the worst movie to ruin a line of greatness nice job
Oct 10 2018,negative,rian johnson wrote a comically childish plot not sure how on earth this movie got 91 fresh in rottentonatos i could understand some positive reviews but this movie is so off the mark it defies belief
Oct 10 2018,negative,only a handful of entertaining scenes and shots everything else is garbage everything thats wrong with disneys star wars and their sjwfeminism agenda it spits on the star wars franchise poor george lucas poor  mark hamill
Oct 10 2018,positive,i dont have a problem with people disliking this film i just thougt it is pretty good it isnt the best movie ever made but its great and yes i know the casino subplot is quite silly and they didnt have to invent holdo completely new just to have a woman sacrafice herself but none of that destroyed the film for me the canto bight scenes arent great but theyre not worse than for example the scenes in jabbas palace in rotj its just star wars i thougt also the score is as it was expectable very good since its john williams but what i thougt was fantastic was that in a movie like star wars an idea of a man in 1977 they brought us to a point where the hero almost became the villain and the villain well didnt become the hero but he stated the goal of the movie quite crlearly i mean he said let the past die    my conclusion is that you can hate the movie alright carry on but if you dont even give rian johnsons ideas a chance you are missing something this movie beautifully adds to star wars which is also why a new trilogy should exist to add to the ideas of a few people 40 years ago unless the force awakens this movie isnt afraid of moving on it just walks with the time and if you want to see your typical star wars just watch iv v and vi but dont hate the new ones for not copying their prequels
Oct 10 2018,negative,i was not satisfied by the time the movie ended it was a fake episode 5 conclusion that put the star wars universe to shame
Oct 10 2018,negative,i made a rotten t account to make this one post this is the first time watching this movie disney what are you doing who is this weird character calling himself luke that isnt luke none of the new characters are compelling at all all whinny kids that belong on a cw drama please stop please
Oct 10 2018,negative,the plot is a mess jammed with cartoonish plot twists superfluous characters and a blatant disrespect for the source material
Oct 9 2018,negative,this was not a star wars movie rian went out of his way to disrespect fans with this film and then coupled that with a pr campaign to bully fans who did not enjoy his take huge miss for disney and lucasfilm
Oct 9 2018,negative,poor narration plotholes out the ass that just come off as half assed storytelling poorly written characters great visuals though
Oct 9 2018,negative,awful writing and awful movie
Oct 9 2018,negative,destruction of a franchise
Oct 9 2018,positive,a visceral bold and necessary monstrosity that gets heavyhanded in parts i can look past the prequelesk nags like i have before a shocking new vision leads us on a terrific ride with so many feelings badass
Oct 9 2018,negative,this movie is a total disgrace
Oct 9 2018,negative,i think the best testament to how bad this movie is is that when youtubers critically review this movie with all the things wrong with it that the youtube video ends up being longer than the movie the biggest fault for this movie is there is no place to go who cares about kylo ren he has been beaten multiple times by rey rey has proven unbeatable in all things she beat luke after practicing swinging on a rock for 5 minutes what else matters  this movie took my excitement for star wars from a 8 or 9 and pushed it to a 1 or 2 i doubt i will even go see the next in theaters and just wait for it to go digital
Oct 9 2018,negative,the girl sitting next o me in the cinema fell asleep amd i saw two other people walk out half way through i however was fascinated by how a star wars film was simultaneously boring and irritating me
Oct 9 2018,positive,absolutely amazing i know its far from perfect this movie did not deserve the hate it got from part of the fanbase  visually stunningwith great plot twists and amazing action this movie is the only one that comes close to the greatness of the original trilogy
Oct 9 2018,negative,this movie made me vow to never watch a star wars movie ever again
Oct 9 2018,negative,atrocious pile of utter garbage    when i asked for a force awakens sequel i didnt want a film where there are billions of plotholes pointless and annoying characters rose phasma hux that woman with the purple wig whatever the fuck her name was and complete disregard for beloved characters what the hell where you thinking rian johnson you completely ruined everything that made star wars great once by giving us a enormous pile of shit called the last jedi where absolutely nothing eventful happens and where you carelessly disrespect everything jj abrahams gave us hope to look forward too reys parents the identity of general snoke rey finally getting to interact with and learn from luke skywalker and finn actually doing something useful  the only thing that was memorable was maybe the special effects but i mean thats nothing new for the star wars franschise absolute garbage dont watse your time nor money on this flick
Oct 9 2018,negative,luke leaves a map to find him so that people wont use the map and find him because he doesnt want to be found    holdo refuses to tell anyone there is a  plan which results in poe finn and rose making their own plan which results in the deaths of many members of the resistance    rian johnston gives a middle finger to jjs tfa and almost every one of the plots set up  reys parents  who cares  who is snoke  who cares
Oct 9 2018,negative,i  was so disappointed by the writing and direction of this movie  i cant even bring myself to watch it a second time  i cant believe im saying that about a star wars movie
Oct 9 2018,negative,atrocious franchise building
Oct 8 2018,negative,im a real boy not a russian bot  this movie destroyed everything we love about luke skywalker rose tico is ass canto bight is ass broom boy can go fuck off kylo is still a bitch no love for chewie r2 and 3po rey well i just dont care about her  phasma wasted hug more like who gives a fux saw this 5 times in theaters and bought the blu ray just to be sure it wasnt me so many months later and not a day goes by where i dont think about how they destroyed our legacy characters for no reason i literally depressed over this i cant believe i dont like a star wars movie
Oct 8 2018,negative,everyone is entitled to an opinion but i think its very rude of disney to get their employees to leave pretend reviews extolling how great this film is and call people butt hurt fanboys the bottom line is if they dont like it they dont like it simple as that please focus on the job
Oct 8 2018,negative,pretty terrible way to ruin a franchise
Oct 8 2018,negative,i love star wars while there were some cool effects in the movie im not sure theres ever been a worse story line horrible horrible writing im only leaving a review because it was so discouraging 9 better be a perfect film because 8 screwed over fans
Oct 8 2018,negative,itâtms been over 2 years and this movie is still a shameful disgrace to the franchise
Oct 8 2018,negative,visual treat  emotional dive and a total memory wipe watch this movie and theirs never going back
Oct 8 2018,negative,i have never left a movie more confused from character directions to how the star wars universe even works
Oct 8 2018,positive,its been almost a year and i still cant stop thinking about this film   i think mr johnson did a phenomenal job in fleshing out all the characters  im not sure what people are so upset about is lukes fate that much different than obiwans  if leia feared the dark side  in  her own son what could we expect from luke  i actually thought it was brilliant that rian johnson chose to make it  a brief moment of uncertainty in lukes mind  this is bens story after all and it needed to be something big to turn ben to the dark side   you might think luke was sacrificed for this purpose and rightly so but luke will always be a legend we got to see him as a real person who makes mistakes as human and i think the star wars story is richer for it   i know there are many other criticisms i was just glad this wasnt another death star movie and the dialogue yes im saying it  is better than any star wars movie to date   leiawipe that nervous expression off your face threepio that cracked me up i think she was channeling han in that moment  as the middle movie in this trilogy it pays homage and respect to the films that came before it while still remaining a great stand alone film
Oct 8 2018,positive,the plot was interesting it brought out more of reys powers and brought luke but story progression was slow 
Oct 7 2018,negative,the last jedi goes completely nowhere and leaves plot holes the force awakens left us to be unanswered or just down right abandoned the part where snoke died having known little to absolutely nothing about him killed all the expectations fans had come to expect the luke skywalker that we all grew to understand didnt feel or act like luke at all the reveal of reys backstory was very cliche just plain disappointing and makes her a very boring character to know i hope disney gets there act together and understand what the fans want to see and come to expect in a high budget film
Oct 7 2018,negative,horrible film wasted characters nothing left to look forward to for episode ix
Oct 7 2018,negative,id put it lower if i was able to
Oct 7 2018,negative,if you like plot holes unfunny jokes pointless characters and boredom then this film is for you
Oct 7 2018,negative,the force awakens ended with luke skywalker meditating while lifting huge boulders above the cliffs of achoogesundheit    then rian johnson happened     he loved the idea of luke throwing away the lightsaber so much he set his film immediately after the remake of a new hope thats the only reason a sight gag    that decision left no room for character development between movies     and left nothing for them to do in this one    the ending of the farce awakens had to be changed from an epic reveal to luke using the infamous joey tribbiani smell the fart acting technique     in short the people making these movies are a bunch of numpties
Oct 7 2018,negative,only the name star wars makes this a movie anyone would seeterrible jokesawful actingridiculous writingdestruction of both previous characters and mythology throughoutnot only the worst star wars movie but one of the worst movies i have seen in my lifethe franchise may never recover from this disaster
Oct 7 2018,negative,well i have to say this is not a very good star wars movie i want to like it but i just cannot to put it simply the story progression is boring and i can describe in one scene at when the resistance leadership is gone the way they developed that scene to progress was boring unconvincing and really felt out of place at the time and unfortunetely there were quite a few plot holes like this throught the movie it really feels like there is nothing left to follow up on anymore because you are not left with owe and excitement at the end of this movie sadly its more convenient for them to put all the blame on russian bots for all the negativity this movie has received hate to break it but the reality is much harsher then some russian bots
Oct 7 2018,negative,this movie isnt even worth writing about if you love star wars you will hate this movie because it shits on his own legacy rian johnson destroyed the whole saga
Oct 7 2018,negative,i cant believe what they did to the star wars universe every single character has been destroyed the new characters are ridiculous shallow or irrelevant there is nothing left to the next episode i dont feel any interest in seeing the next episode i was a huge fan of star wars but i regret that i saw tlj i want to unsee it
Oct 7 2018,negative,fuck rian johnson he fucked up the star wars franchise
Oct 7 2018,negative,visually the best star wars to date the cinematography and effects are insanely good sadly the story arcs the main plotline  the character development  are abysmal
Oct 6 2018,negative,the jokes are bad the plot is paper thin and questionable to put it lightly directorial decisions mistake gotcha moments for solid storytelling eg leia surviving in the vacuum of space holdos nonsensically secretive plan too often the film comes across overly political and more importantly unfaithful to its source material worst of all the films narrow focus never allows the viewer to feel immersed in what should be a galacticsize conflict its just bad the film wants to be irreverent it wants to be guardians of the galaxy and it wants to selfconsciously subvert expectations in the end it just felt as if the director tried too hard to make a film that hollywood would love without actually caring what fans would like which i suppose one should have seen coming when the director actually admitted he hopes half the people who see his movies leave the theatre thinking thats the worst movie i have ever seen well pretty close to mission accomplished
Oct 6 2018,negative,most disappointing filmgoing experience ive ever had gets worse with subsequent viewings cant being to stress how bad this missed the mark at one point in the beginning opening night in the theater i leaned over to my son and said well this isdifferent and all he could say was that he hated it and hoped it got better it never did this film managed to completely destroy everything disney had built up with the force awakens and kill any interest from a great many people in seeing this trilogy through this is pure garbage i want to forget it ever happened trump will be gone in a couple years yet we are stuck with this junk for the rest of our lives 
Oct 6 2018,negative,i felt betrayed   i gathered my family to watch this the movie did not stay true to the prior movie nor did it stay true to the marketing   in review i wish luke skywalker had more of a tony stark final lap
Oct 6 2018,negative,i could have understood many subversion plot points social commentary and general defiance of audience expectations however and ill point only two of many questionable things on this movie giving forces ghosts the ability to act with the real world and using light speed as a weapon this is not being a brilliant writer and subverting expectations this is destroying the films universe death no longer matters and space battles are useless  points for the acting cinematography and special effects they where all good overall terrible writing and execution from any objective point of vew its  hard to believe that anyone actually think this is a good movie i guess some people just need to believe it to be so
Oct 6 2018,negative,this is by far the worst star wars movie i have ever seen not because of the actors involved they did was they were told to do and they did it very well this movie is bad because the script doesnt make any sense star wars wise one of may favorite movie characters off al time is luke skywalker he was murdered in all thinkable ways by the film director who was also one of the script writers rian johnson what he did to luke skywalker scriptwise is complete nonsense there are other many problems with the script of this movie but i will not go into more details it is already bad as it is i have no expectations to see episode 9 after this tragedy
Oct 6 2018,negative,this would have been decent as a standalone nonstar wars movie unfortunately this was had the title of star wars on its label i will not be watching solo or any other garbage disney sw movies
Oct 6 2018,negative,this movieis just the worst i could go on about everything wrong with it but the main problem would be how luke skywalker one of the best heros cinema history was handle ryan johnson the director made luke into a character that should of never appeared in the filma deadbeat quitter that gave up on the jedi and fighting evil and finding hope this movie indeed the name of star wars
Oct 6 2018,negative,i didnt expect that sw could be so bad i will go onto next sw only under condition of money back guarantee coz this one was not worth a penny
Oct 6 2018,negative,terriblebadly miss timed humor plot holes you could drive a truck through reys terrible character development lukes character has been completely butchered  doesnt seem to care that his good fri nd han is dead force ghosts now able to control lightning snokes interesting character wasted with no back story etc etc etci could go on  a huge mess of a film cant see how they can come back from this for the next movie  very disappointing
Oct 6 2018,negative,the is not how you properly subvert expectations lukes character was completely different so much so that even mark hamill calls him jake skywalker
Oct 6 2018,negative,well the next movie cant be this bad
Oct 6 2018,negative,this movie ruined your childhood heroes and made luke look like garbage its complete crap wish it was never made the solo movie was hundred times better
Oct 5 2018,negative,the only good thing about this movie was that luke was in it even then hes a shell of his former self poor mark hamill had to play the worst version of luke in the second worst star wars movie ever
Oct 5 2018,negative,an insult to star wars fans everywhere worst by far in the entire franchise and yes im including jar jar
Oct 5 2018,negative,a flawed movie that can barely stand on its own it ruins previously established rules in previous movies and contradicts even its own scenes moments later in complete disregard of both episode vii and the ot the villains act incompetently the heroes forget who they are and are suddenly reduced to a small group despite it being said that they are the republic and most importantly luke skywalker hero of the previous movies is reduced to a hermit that has given up who chills in the background and doesnt even mourn for his fallen friend han neither does he acknowledge his sister to be in danger all this time the plot drops plot points that were raised in episode vii in complete neglect of abrams work and instead chooses to do nothing with it  even a bad or an unexpected direction would have been welcomed but rian chose to write nothing instead to subvert expectations for the worst for being the longest movie in the franchise    from here on out i will go into greater detail    you cant run out of gas in space momentum keeps you going also there is no reason the first order wouldnt be able to catch up but they cant fuelgas is a nice concept but there is no way a ship would actually stop in space where momentum will keep you going and there is no gravity   the 1st order should have either    a launched more tie fighters   b  sent a star destroyer ahead at lightspeed to intercept   the your momma joke was dumb took away from a serious moment the way hux took it completely changed his character from a menacing guy with a position next to kylo to a dumb phoney that is easily tricked   why not use bwing bombers instead of the slow useless bombers the last jedi had they are supposed to resemble ww2 bombers but their pacing is off rian really wanted to have those in the movie to go for style over substance  bombs falling in space no propulsion shown no sound effect to suggest propulsion apparently the novel explains them to be magnetic in that case how come they dont cling to their own ship besides thats side material the enemy ship being magnetic wouldnt make sense either as there was no established reason for it to be  when the doors open to drop the bombs why wasnt everyone sucked into space in revenge of the sith they have been  why is hux a bumbling fool in viii despite being threatening and competent in tfa   leia blaming the loss on poe was dumb she was still in charge and could have pulled the bombers back   poe made the right call in destroying the dreadnaught   a its weapons have further range than a star destroyer and would have killed them all in a chase   b  it carried 275000 people which is a huge win for the resistence and acceptable losses   c it is faster than the raddus and would have caught them in a chase  finn healed instantly from a spinal injury just another thing setup in tfa and thrown away in tlj the transition is jarring as episode vii closes with finn falling into a deep coma making fans wait for what will happen next only for him to wake up right away  how can finn pilot a ship in tlj despite not being a pilot in tfa and being unconscious between the 2 films he flies to canto bait despite having said before that he can not fly the speeder in the later part of the movie may get a pass because its a speeder and not a flying ship but it is flying too  why do they assume there is a new technology to track through hyperspace   a you can already track in hyperspace if there is a beacon on board as shown before  b  why not scan the ship for beacons   c leia has a beacon on board constantly sending a signal out so rey can return   why only use 1 tracker at a time   how do they know which of the several star destroyers is the one actually tracking them   why does poe recommend calling maz finn met maz not poe they dont even know each other  the casino plot was pointless general holdo should have at least confirmed there was a plan 40 minutes of filler because she didnt and poe got cold feet because of it not to mention nothing they do there goes anywhere they get captured and immediately brought to the resistance hideout later on with no accomplishments as the battleship is taken down by holdo  a poe is still the best pilot you have   b  poe even with a demotion is high on the chain of command especially how small the resistence is   c poe asked 3 times for orders before comiting mutiny   saving the animals and leaving the slave kids was dumb first off all these animals have been captive for all of their lives they wouldnt know what to do if set free  rose is a fucking idiot and why kid slaves in a world where there are droids that cant get tired arent those evil people supposed to be rich opportunists and speaking of that making money out of a war situation is not a bad thing but they are labeled as bad guys because of it the kids literally only exist to make them look evil even if it makes no sense  a your friends are literally running for their life you dont have time for this   b animals born and raised from captivity will die in the wild as they have no idea how to even live in the wild  c as a janitor finn should know that the rich are not inconvenienced at all by this and that the slave kids will have to clean up the mess they caused rescuing the animals  the cgi was bad the people vanish then reappear in the casino after the animals bust through the wall thanks for the bluray some poor guy had to get to confirm this  leia getting blown into space and flying back in was nonsensical she shouldve been frozen to death never has she received training in the force too this was done to subvert our expectations  there was no space lock when letting leia in so everyone should have been blown into space the bluray cut this scene short  in the theatrical release it lasted longer and showed leia flying up to the window looking into the hallway as poe comes running along   conveniently being locked up in the casino with the guy you need is convenient such writing  what would the code breaker had done if rose didnt have the mcguffin necklace to break the lock    why does luke throw away his light saber   a episode 7 set it up as heart filles but what emotion are they going for in 8 do they expect me to laugh it completely breaks the tone something the movie does a lot put a shirt on kylo any need for this to be in the script  b  its his fathers and would be something to remember him by   c it was given to him by obi wan and should be something to remember him by as well   why does rey translate what chewbacca says to luke luke understands wookie why does rey know wookie anyways and why is the first thing luke says when he sees chewie what are you doing after 30 fucking years  how does rey understand wookie despite not being able to understand him in tfa and with no time passing between 7 and 8   rey beating luke in a fight with no training makes no sense she is a mary sue that literally can not lose she did nothing to earn this strength and didnt even believe in the force not too long ago  luke milking a sea cow  not really a flaw or anything but this is the hero of the galaxy right there thats what rian decided for him to do there and why did he hide anyways he made a map no way he went with the intention to die when he made that rian clearly didnt watch tfa  yoda shooting lightning was dumb since when can a force ghost affect things and if they can where have they been they couldve saved their loved ones in other movies  how does yoda hit luke on the head with his staff how can he even touch him he is a ghost while we are at it lukes force projection kisses leias head later on  crashing at light speed looked cool but new plot hole why havent they done that before they could easily make light speed missiles it wouldve been possible for the death star and the federation ship in tpm why the fuck didnt anybody just shoot an empty vessel with a hyperspace jump in there the death star was crafted and brought to the finest military standards as confirmed in rogue one and the other movies side material goes into that in detail but should be ignored for the understanding of the movie alone  this hyperspace jump dated past movie space battles as well as upcoming ones effectively as this solution will now always be in mind whenever a space battle comes up  why sacrifice your admiral to crash the ship why not use a droid or autopilot or a less important crew member who would gladly do it to save everyone especially given how dangerous the first order is   at least 5 characters accidentally say rebellion instead of resistance during the movie but there is no rebellion that war ended a long time ago and most of them werent even alive back then   when committing mutiny you need to throw the commander in the brig or at least take their gun away didnt happen   tasting the ground to say its salt not snow on not hoth having a person taste the ground is just so weird the viewer wouldnt even know of this planet being a salt planet if it wasnt for that there are several elemental planets in star wars but this one in particular is just a clean white sheet of salt keep that in mind  after saying its salt the movie immediately forgets that and sends snowtroopers into the base not stormtroopers selling more toys i didnt even mention the porgs and how chewie was reduced to being in scenes only for them that and to be shouted at by rey and luke   rose crashing into finn was dumb   a should have killed them both but surviving is possible yet there was a risk   b he was trying to save those he loved what do you mean that will make us win you made it so he couldnt  c now everyone should die since no one destroyed the cannon    rosefinn kiss was fine as a scene but there was zero chemistry between them rose only made fun of him for being a coward that is called a hero    it should take finn 2 hours to drag rose back to the base from that distance not just that but why has nobody shot them thats a blank white sheet they are walking over and considering how long it took them to make that distance with a speeder this is literally impossible the writer wanted to have them back at the base and gave us no explanation  why is phasma the only trooper with armor that actually works and she was held on gunpoint in tfa why was she scared by the gun then no explanation between the movies why this is the way it is in fact we get nothing from cpt phasma zero character oh why does she want execution by a laser axe to make it hurt in her own words when blaster fire would be a much more painful slower death why have such impractical weapons around anyways  rey knowing how to swim despite having grown up in the desert mary sue    rey shooting 3 tie fighters with 1 shot was dumb it was her very first shot too took han a lot more time to kill a few fighters in the other movies at his prime  why did rey go to snokes ship and try to turn kylo after previously saying how much she hates him    when rey leaves snokes ship kylo was unconscious why didnt she kill him    how exactly did rey leave the ship well somebody mentions that she takes the supreme leaders ship only to show up in the falcon later on that was in the hangar there still who to believe   how did rey lift all the boulders at the same time with no training oh yeah mary sue she didnt even believe in the force like a few weeks earlier luke on the other hand did and struggled with lifting his own ship   they forgot how time works the ship had 16 hours gas but rey spent multiple days with luke and still gets back in time   snoke insulting kylos mask was dumb snoke was perfectly fine with his mask before too and it was shown previously that kylo didnt like not having it on why is he not wearing it ever again then he betrays snoke from zero to hundred but never wears the mask again because he said so  what happened to the knights of ren another thing setup in vii thrown away in viii  why did luke leave a map to find him in force awakens if he didnt want to be found in the last jedi   luke force projecting was almost cool except   a how could he kiss leia on the head but not die from blaster shots  b how could he hand leia the trinket   c how did poe know luke was stalling   d why didnt luke tell anyone the plan   e why the fk died luke that way he dies from what stress and couldnt he show up in person then if he dies anyways it couldve been because he wanted to trick kylo into thinking he is still alive but that explanation is not given by the movie  f why didnt the trinket disappear at the same time luke did   g the solo movie made the scene worse when luke hands leia the trinket dice its meant to be a reminder of han but han gave that to his first girlfriend if anything leia should be insulted he kept the dice as a reminder of his first girlfriend   h if the dice meant anything to leia why did she leave them behind   i poe notices that this is just a projection but kylo doesnt   lukes mechanical hand   a why does it look like anakins when his hand was severed 30 years later and is clearly an upgraded prosthetic in empire   b  why does his hand vanish when he becomes one with the force his clothes dont so why would his prosthetic hand    leia says they have everything they need to rebuild the resistence but this is dumb   athey have no allies   b they have no money   cthey have no ships   dthey have no men   ethey have no weapons   f actually they are left with nothing now    the visuals are the only good thing about this movie
Oct 5 2018,negative,only gave it one star because its beautifully shot and the soundtrack is amazing    i have been a star wars fan since i was 5 years old i have been to every premiere since revenge of the sith in 2005 i have never genuinely disliked a star wars movie until i saw the last jedi    this movie completely destroys 40 years worth of star wars legacy and seems to do so to spite longterm fans of this franchise utterly disrespecting the legacy of luke skywalker the force the jedi and george lucas tlj tears down everything that has been built to this point simply for shock value as the director himself claimed brick and looper were good movies but this is an incredibly horrendous fail the number of plot holes cringy unneeded jokes wasted characters and ruined moments are uncountable the subplots are horrendous and i honestly thought i was seeing the wrong movie i cant even take time to write out all the dumb things about this movie and its plotholes because if i did id be here all day the movie is also insanely political which it should not be to try and push the agenda of rian johnson kathleen kennedy and lucasfilm  i have honestly never been more disappointed by a movie in my entire life 2 years worth of excitement buildup and speculation wasted by this garbage film
Oct 5 2018,negative,good production value terrible story with nothing really happening and lots of missed opportunities to make something great all in all a forgettable experience that managed only to alienate audience thanks to some of the most incredibly condescending pr strategies ever concived in movie history
Oct 5 2018,negative,worst star wars movie ever made by far they claim its good because it subverts expectations but that is utterly absurd  all it did was demonstrate that they obviously did not map out a three movie story arc from the beginning this is star wars ad libs an absurd fan fiction it is a movie that feels as if it was made with contempt for the franchise and its fans and rian johnson does his best to make that clear elsewhere as well im not some star wars super fan babyraging about the movie not being exactly what i wanted there is some good to it  the visuals the score some of the actors but the storytelling is disastrous and the actions of the characters make absolutely zero sense this whole trilogy has been a farce how do you make a new star wars trilogy by just thinking it up as you go along its absolutely preposterous     i could go into further detail about why the film is so disappointing but there are countless articles reviews and youtube videos which already do so lukes character in this movie is jarringly incongruent why did he leave a map if he never wanted to be found how could a character who even saw the good in vader decide to kill kylo just for being influenced by snoke etc  the use of hyperdrive as a weapon causes sooo many problems the bombers in the initial battle scene make zero sense the superman leia scene reys character arc or seeming lack thereof etc there is really so much more though     im just glad rian johnsons new trilogy was supposedly cancelled lets just hope somehow this isnt the end of the series as it should be  
Oct 5 2018,negative,one of the worst star wars movies in a long time so many wrong decisions with characters and a lot of unnecessary scenes     the only decent thing about it is the effects which seem fairly average compared to the visual spectacle george lucas wanted to achieve with the original films and the prequels    had any thoughts about what was going to happen from the force awakens well get ready its all thrown out the door in this film many things teased in episode 7 are not explained or are underwhelmed here    interesting characters from the original like luke skywalker are looked over in favour of the new cast whose decisions in this film are nonsensical almost entire scenes where there is no advancement of the plot the audiences time is wasted    this star wars movie lacks the emotional and interesting storyline and characters of the original trilogy and the lack of appealing visual performances of the prequels it just isnt a good star wars movie
Oct 5 2018,negative,greetings comrades     but seriously i liked episode 7 and rogue one diversity and all and this film sucked disney you cant first insult your fanbase then pretend were all russian bots     fire kennedy and johnson and get your act together
Oct 5 2018,positive,a dizzying whirlwind of the beautiful star wars galaxy that continues the story of the new generation of a long time ago in a galaxy far far away
Oct 5 2018,negative,i feel like a lunatic for not liking this am i delusional please help
Oct 5 2018,negative,a disappointment of the first order
Oct 5 2018,negative,just the worst star wars movie ever
Oct 5 2018,negative,how the flying fuck does this movie have a 91 can we not admit that its fucking terrible that luke is annoying and a quitter that finn didnt even need to be in the movie the movie is boring af just like you cant call anyone crazy you cant say a star wars movie sucks ass i loved episode 7 aka episode 4 remastered but this was complete trash just admit it you fucks
Oct 4 2018,negative,tried 3 times and its still terrible
Oct 4 2018,negative,first off i am not a robot nice try disney but you cant blame your lack of good ratings from actual fans on robots this movie could have turned the sequel franchise around instead it just shoved it deeper into a hole of crap disney when are you going to get that nobody wants political and cultural agendas shoved down their throats the propaganda alone is enough to give this movie a bad rating but on top of that the plot sucks so many holes and pointless characters and stories whoever wrote it should be fired they basically took empire strikes backs plot copy and pasted and then poked at it with a stick and called it a movie im ashamed for the star wars enterprise and lucasarts you are better than this jj abrams good luck youre gonna have a hell of a time trying to redeem this trilogy
Oct 4 2018,negative,terrible movie  im not a russian bot  poor storyline  what rian johnson did to luke skywalker and the lore etc was terrible  it is the first star wars movie that i will not buy on dvd 
Oct 4 2018,negative,this was one of the most disappointing films that i have ever watched in my life time the plot holes the pointless scenes the horrible acting force awakens wasnt the best film but set up some good scenarios for the last jedi but yet disabled johnson decided to take some icemeth and totally ruined up the film im not a hater im a fan who has been lover of star wars for over 10 years i just want to see star wars head in the right direction and become a good as the originals
Oct 4 2018,negative,if i could give 0 stars i would have i went out of my way to sign up and write a review because of this obsurd notion the original bad reviews were because of russians im in my 30s american and have loved the star wars movies and franchise since my childhoodgames comics toys etc star wars the last jedi broke my fandom i loved force awakens i left the theater happy and ready for more i saw it twice i watch it everytime its on starz i like rey finn kilo and poe cool characters and with han solo there to tie everything together was a great movie not prefect but really great     the last jedi is an abomination i went in the movie theater so happy and excited and i left hurt feeling like i was abandoned and that my devotion as a fan was tossed away and i was slapped for watching that first who is funding the first order last movie they had their death star blow up and they come back wealthier and with more ships first act boring the bank and forth comedy at first seemed out of place the slow bombing run was kinda stupid then leia dies and i thought it was prefect kilo finger on the trigger but pulls back for his mother and the other fighters finish the job and then in the cold of space she super man flies i was shocked and mortified and my theater has very loud laughter at it then the purple haired admiral was annoying and the whole slow chase was boring and then with no rhyme or reason a fundamental part of star wars is changed tracking in lightspeed like what that is a fundamental rule of star wars which is you cant track in light speed oh well whatever luke and rey are on screen for very little time and they are the main characters snoke dies which was a moment where the movie could have been saved it was a great screen until kilo tells rey shes nobody well thanks assholes so on to a weird casino world with no fuckin point and a worse chase seen than anything in the prequels in fact all the prequels worst moments are better than those whole dragged out casino world trash the intelligent  narrative which is that money fuels war or wherever was so cliché and not needed in a star wars movie at this point in the showing i hate the movie then purple hair lady says god speed  she forgot what universe she was in for a moment its may the force be with you then she does the coolest thing in the movie which is kamakazi her ship into another so the rebels can escape only problem is they broke another star wars rule because if lightspeed could be weaponized then you ruin the original movie where you could have kamakazi the death star and id you mix it in with droids from the prequels you could have technically kamakazi the death star with droid ship so nice scene but wrong for star wars they end on salt hoth where luke projects himself into battle is cool and then he dies and some orphan kid used the force at the end when it was over i stormed out and it ruined my whole day i was in shock for 48 hours over what trash i saw dumb story killed admiral akbar for no reason and with no time to soak it in awful director who had never seen star wars before   in short im not russian this movie was awful ruined my fandom and if ryan johnson and disney thought that script was so good they should have made a new scfi movie franchise and test it there star wars is star wars you bought it for 4 billion and you broke it i didnt watch solo i havent rewatched tlj i wont be going to a disney world in 2019 you all messed up bye
Oct 4 2018,negative,some major writing missteps result in an okay but pretty forgettable film  for all the merits this film has it has a bad joke or boring scene and for every bad element it has a good one  510
Oct 4 2018,negative,just not a good movie
Oct 4 2018,negative,the visuals of this movie are exactly what youd want in a star wars movie every thing about this movie looks like it should be in a good star wars movie sadly the last jedi doesnt feel like a star wars filmthis movie constantly drags behind making it nothing more than a slow chase across a star system at the very least there are plenty of plot holes and sub plots that dont make sense in the movie at worst they completely contradict previously established cannon its ok space adventure film but its not fit of bearing the name star wars  
Oct 4 2018,neutral,star wars the last jedi is a disappointment with lousy writing and a lousy story it definitely shows that it is a disappointment not even a great performance by mark hamil himself can save it this movie crashed the sequel trilogy and is now in a gigantic hole that its gonna have to take a miracle to get out of the last jedi falls short of my expectations and is an embarrass to the star wars saga
Oct 4 2018,negative,im tired of last jedi defenders and lucasfilm employees saying that people that didnt like this movie are racists misogynists and now russian bots  are you serious  im sick of these nonsensical attacks on the fans that it actually drove me to create a rottentomatoes account so i could add my rating  i will admit this was a beautiful looking film  ive rewatched it just for the visuals alone  unfortunately the story cant hold up  i would much rather watch fan fiction by the guy next door than this  its clearly pushing political ideology at the expense of a good story  dont cite to me that star wars has always been political vietnam bush administration etc i know  it was never this overt and agendas werent shoved down your throat like this in the ot and pt  this movie is a cynical mess that ruins 40 years of mythology and shattered the fandom  this movie has done so much damage to the star wars fandom and i dont know if it will recover  thankfully solo got me back on the star wars bandwagon great movie  the promise of the force awakens was squandered here
Oct 4 2018,negative,its a political propaganda and a horrible movie at the same time the whole thing it would be a shame to call it a move twice  is full of plot holes the critics are simply afraid of the gender bullshit which terrorizes and keep the culture detained nowadays
Oct 4 2018,negative,trash horribly written 
Oct 4 2018,positive,one of my favorite star wars movies 
Oct 4 2018,positive,a decent film overall but felt unnecessarily and overlooked many key elements from the previous installment it did not continue the story along and felt more like a place holder film to lead to the final film
Oct 3 2018,negative,this movie is beyond terrible
Oct 3 2018,neutral,this was hands down and pants off the worst production that has ever had the star wars brand attached to it     on the upside the actors worked their damnedest to salvage the script handed to them and it shows the special fx is also in line with what you would expect of a modern day multimillion dollar production     but that is where the praise ends there are bewildering inconsistencies between this entry and the force awakens a disastrous filler arc nearzero character development and plot holes so glaringly large that even the death star couldnt possibly erase them in a single lazer blast    all in all this film insults your intelligence as a viewer with its antics i firmly believe the writers as well as director rian johnson should consider a new line of work
Oct 3 2018,negative,the first half of this movie gives an extreme sense of deja vu because its the empire strikes back back poorly made reys just as poorly written as last time but now shes even more powerful with the ability to do a training sequence that makes you question if they had anyone on set who knew anything about fighting and a fight sequence where she proves to be a better fighter despite her lack of training than any jedi master also leia survives the vacuum of space somehow but they dont bother explaining that speaking of poorly written characters finn is just as inconsistent as ever going right from wanting to run away from the fight to joining a suicide mission
Oct 3 2018,negative,too much sjw propaganda for me bad jokes but what they did to luke was absolutely unforgivable i will never pay disney to watch another star wars movie im done
Oct 3 2018,positive,the most complete and shocking film of the star wars franchise seeing the batton being passed to a future of rebels makes this film great this film is for those who understand moving forward cant wait to see the final trilogy
Oct 3 2018,negative,one of the most consistently disappointing movies i have seen in my entire life had some good moments and some good cinematography but the bad and the disappointing far outweigh these things
Oct 3 2018,negative,horrible movie filled with plot holes boring at times not worth watching
Oct 3 2018,negative,the movie was a complete shit show with side plots that dont even matter and no character development this movie takes a huge piss on the entire franchise
Oct 3 2018,negative,not a russian bot  plot was full of holes  too many forced jokes  literally half of the movie was inconsequential  obvious political preaching  pretty much took a big steamy one all over luke skywalker  half a star because the special effects are good
Oct 3 2018,negative,a very pretty utter drek of nonmovie going against all that is star wars  for gotcha filled nonplot
Oct 3 2018,negative,watched it again and it still sucks
Oct 3 2018,negative,a tremendously disappointing film that runs overlong is crammed with bad humor and tragically retells the heroic luke skywalker character as a grizzled old failure drooling blue milk down his beard this was the end of star wars for me
Oct 3 2018,negative,more destroyed legacy characters more focus on noncharacters created by disney lucasfilm in order to chase a new fanbase which doesnt exist and ridiculous things like hyperspace ramming which break from canon and result in no star wars film ever making sense please complete star wars ix before moving all three pieces of terrible fan fiction to the noncanon legends series were they belong thank you
Oct 3 2018,negative,so this showed up on netflix and i figured id check it out as ive enjoyed the series generally i gave it 10 minutes and thought it was horrible so i convinced myself to give another 10 in the end i watched about 23 and it was like a train wreck where you dont really want to see the carnage but you cant look away because its unbelievable i cant believe this is what star wars has become its absolutely ridiculous the acting was decent but the fact that the writing and story are so horrible makes the good acting cringey its like watching a bunch of kids play dress up i spent the whole time either laughing at the ridiculousness or with my face scrunched up as i wondered if it was some elaborate joke the fact that its rated so highly and has legions of fans backing it make me feel sad at the state of the film industry and the human races intelligence alltogether
Oct 3 2018,negative,a complete disgrace to the star wars name 
Oct 3 2018,negative,not just a bad star war but a bad movie in general
Oct 2 2018,negative,undoubtedly the worst star wars movie completely wasted opportunities one being that it couldve been a good movie stupid convoluted agenda pushing and terrible plot decisions rip star wars 11977  2017 gets 1 star for being beautifully shot
Oct 2 2018,negative,getting worse with each movie 
Oct 2 2018,negative,i really hated this movie this is the only movie ive ever felt strongly enough about for which to write a review
Oct 2 2018,negative,disappointed thought they would have reeled this movie back from episode 7 instead they continued to diminish my interest in the franchise
Oct 2 2018,negative,had a few good moments but a bad plot full of holes stringing together individual set pieces the director wanted to force feed the audience regardless of coherence contrived and ridiculous choices and situations to force dramatic moments and twisted characterizations inconsistent with previous movies including the force awakens not just original movies  the cast and crew do a good job but it feels the director rian johnson detested any previously established material and deliberately undercut it and tried to replace it with his own unique appeal turning the movie into an awful mess of plot holes force fed and inconsistent moral soap boxes and jarring character changes
Oct 2 2018,positive,in todays day  age it seems that if we like the old stuff we cant like the new stuff this is a ridiculous notion i am both a fan of what george lucas created  what disney has done this movie is by no means perfect but it is a well welcome addition to the greatest film franchise of all time its fine if you do not like it but dont shove down peoples throats that they should hate it or like it too enjoy the movie i personally loved it and welcome it as a awesome addition
Oct 2 2018,negative,a meandering plot few interesting characters crude humor way too long one of the few times ive ever felt ripped off by a movie the only reason it gets as high of a star rating as i gave it is for the performances by the actors and the special effects but in terms of story youre better off watching the holiday special
Oct 2 2018,negative,an absolute insult to the legacy of star wars incredibly poor quality and inconsistent screenwriting lack of development for new characters and the destruction of luke skywalker s character no longer is he filled with hope hes stuck moping around on his island drinking green milk thats right the same guy who saw the light in darth vader tried to murder his own nephew kylo ren speaking of which kylo ren is back and now hes shirtless theres a  completely useless scene where finn travels to a casino and he frees some space horses and gets a parking ticket snoke turns out to be nobody just like reys family in fact he gets killed in this installment they introduce this purple hair character after leia flies through space like mary poppins who is even worse than jar jar binks and to add even more insult they kill of luke skywalker at the very end of the movie skip this one go watch the ot or a marvel movie instead
Oct 2 2018,negative,a story that makes little to no sense and not in your wishy fan fiction sort of way the movie is visually appealing as always but that cant hold up the plot
Oct 2 2018,negative,worst star wars film ive ever seen attack of the clones was a snoozefest but the last jedi took that to new levels the cgi was bad the story was bad everything was bad im not captivated by the characters at all and i dont want to see what happens next
Oct 2 2018,negative,the last jedi ended every setup from the force awakens ruined primary characters and left us with nothing left to have hope in for the next star wars movie
Oct 2 2018,positive,great movie that takes all these fanboy theories and flips them on their heads with unpredictable and fresh takes on a new star wars story i love how the jedi orders hubris is finally addressed and its burned to the ground of course luke would ultimately learn the lesson that the force is bigger than the jedis the characters are developed and tragically complex rather than two dimensional heros
Oct 2 2018,negative,spoilers i sort of figure this is up late enough that everyone who wants to must have seen it by nowbut still spoilers    star wars movies havent disappointed me like this since the prequelsand even with the prequels you could always still see the good story in there behind the lousy cg terrible acting and writing this movie its a mess sure but more than that it feels like it goes out of its way to insult the fans and wreck the franchisewith what feels like intent out of malice the character arcs of all the characters are rolled back finn goes from being fully on board with the resistance to flopping around in a leaky waterballoon suit to being a mutineer who only cares about ditching out to go find rey poe gets reframed a flyboy who just wants to blow things up and spends the whole movie ineffectually trying to overthrow his superior officers rey goes from fierce and determined with a real destiny shes pursuing to utter weakness just following along begging to be taughtright up until she doesnt need it bb8 is now a comic relief ninja able to singlehandedly or nohandedly take out rooms full of armed guards by firing poker chips at them and commander imperial walkers without anyone noticing to clear entire bays full of walkers and lukepoor luke it turns out he wasnt headed to find the first jedi temple in the attempt to unlock the riddle of the rise of the first order to figure out who snoke was and to be able to find a path to beat them after all the map as it turns out wasnt something he left behind so folks could find him when the time was right hes a sad old geezer now whos given up on the resistance on the jedi and who just wants to crawl away and die in the warm embrace of a green milk spewing seagiraffe    which yknow fine but the movie is all about space combat in the star wars universe but doesnt understand how tactics work none of the combat or plans hold together or make any sense its all about how rich people are oppressive and evil but doesnt understand how economics work selling arms to a tiny political faction is not the only way rich people get rich in a postempire republic    the comedy is absurd and cringy its not that theres too much of itgood comedy can all but take over in an adventure movieits that its all bad and dumps cold water on whatever interest there might have been going on onscreen at the time    but worst of all of this it feels like theyve just scorched the ground for a final movie all the legacy characters are dead now the final boss and his flagship are dead the resistance is all gone down to a couple dozen folks all the mysteries have been wasted to a point where any answers dont even matter anymore if they had just gone ahead and had a last fight between rey and kylo they wouldnt even need a third moviebecause thats the only unresolved plot point left im not even sure what the next movie or any movies after this even have left to work with    so is it a dumpster fire yes it is a big space dumpster fire but at least do its own thing well kind of its so intent on not being empire strikes back that it sort of accidentally becomes empire strikes back they start out fleeing from a base under attack from a space fleet end up splitting ways between a jedi training scene where the hero confronts evil in a place of darkness and ends their training early to go help their friends and another scene set against an opulent space resort culminating with a failed confrontation with the dark lord from which everyone limps away so yeah theres even atats sort oftheyre gorillas now on a snow planet sort ofits salt they even do the one thing folks have been begging them not to dothey introduce another death star laser weapon    its really bad you guys by now its too late to help at all but hopefully this helps you commiserate if youre looking for good videos to help get out your ire on youtube i cant recommend enough that you check out angry joes reasons why last jedi made me angry the screenrant pitch meeting for last jedi and mr plinketts last jedi review they are all worth checking out if you need some closure theres also a great trailer for last jedi overlaid with hurt by johnny cast that felt nice    heres hoping the next one is better
Oct 2 2018,negative,good production music and certain story elements but overall abandoned much of what makes a star wars movie star wars i did not like the way the represented luke as he just didnt feel like the luke that was established in the original trilogy many plot points also did not make sense questions brought up in the force awakens were just brushed aside leaving me as well as others feeling empty when leaving the theatre after all the build up a huge disappointment and while rian johnson should take much of the blame the whole disney version of star wars as been trending in a poor direction well see if they get their act together in episode ix but for many it will be too little too late
Oct 2 2018,negative,this movie struggled to be mediocre even at its best parts  the surprises and plot twists are all underwhelming the plotline with the pinkhaired lady was confusing and pointless storylines opened up by abrams were closed by johnson in the most disappointing ways possible luke skywalker is nothing like he was in the original trilogy even the epic fight scene was poorly choreographed im disappointed that i spent 1200 to see this movie and will likely be avoiding star wars going forward
Oct 2 2018,negative,luckily im not a star wars fan if i was id be mightily narked off by this poorly written mess of a film that seems to this that it not the upcoming episode ix is the end of the skywalker saga someone buy kathleen kennedy a whiteboard and some nice marker pens before its too late
Oct 2 2018,negative,very crappy  story that severely breaks  star wars  lore on several points    rian johnson has severely damaged the star wars universe just to push social justice
Oct 2 2018,negative,the obvious disconnect between lucas film and the paying customer brought to life on the big screen never will i support another star wars movie
Oct 2 2018,negative,it just felt off and odd and unnecessary
Oct 2 2018,negative,plot hole riddled back story ruining water of time worse than the prequals
Oct 2 2018,negative,you destroy star wars for us the fans who thought it was great
Oct 2 2018,negative,worst star wars ever
Oct 2 2018,negative,watched this movie long ago but did not rate it while i went to every previous star wars buying vhs dvd and blueray of each one this one was done so poorly i gave up on star wars wont go to another one until they replace the people who created this garbage 
Oct 1 2018,negative,just the worst movie ever killing the star wars franchise for me  threw out well established characters themes and lore for a politically correct narrative that overtook the story so heavy handed in its approach as to make it bitter to swallow  strong characters and plot is what we need and after that then make them whatever sex and orientation you like      misplaced and jarring humour and complete disregard for the plot points set up in the force awakens a movie i actually enjoyed  i had no issues with the character and set up here but the same under ruin johnson created a terrible movie     ill stick with the first six movies from now  star wars is otherwise finished for me
Oct 1 2018,negative,forget the past kill the past but hey let me grab these book from the past so i can learn
Oct 1 2018,negative,this movie is the culmination of all that has gone wrong in the new star wars trilogy i dont even know where the begin first and foremost they have completely ruined the original spirit lore and lifeblood of the original films even episodes 13 kept with the spirit of what star wars is all about despite the atrocious acting the new series underscored by this film has completely disgrace the star wars franchise it starts from the very very beginning of the film when poe was making  jokes to the new order officialsthis isnt guardians of the galaxy wtf are you doing it just went straight downfilll from there the rebel ship dropped bombs which somehow had gravitational force on the new order fleet what the hell was with leia doing that whole superman in space thing it made zero sense whatsoever that luke died because he pulled his force muscle or whatever wtf did they make yoda look like a puppet again as if they didnt have cgi technology the entire casino planet part was completely unnecessary and totally pointless and lastly the acting of finn and rose were so bad it should be the highlight of all the criticismthat bad
Oct 1 2018,negative,not worth the time it would take to write an actual review  this is film making brought to its lowest  nearly every decision made behind the camera was unapologetically stupid  people like forbes say that because a movie with the star wars brand makes money the producer kathleen kennedy deserves to keep her job  without the brand this movie would make nothing  disney seems very keen to destroy the brand so well get to see that soon enough
Oct 1 2018,negative,easily one of the worst movies in the entire franchise disney could not have screwed up any worse with every opportunity they were given the fact that top critics appraise this movie for god knows what reason is disgusting ryan johnson should be replaced he knows nothing about the lore characters or history
Oct 1 2018,negative,pretty awful movie rey is a mary sue rose feels like a fanfiction character phasma again does nothing overall pretty bad
Oct 1 2018,negative,it makes the prequels look like fine art
Oct 1 2018,negative,spoilers in review  subverts expectations very poorly and ties up loose strings early who was snoke what was his past oh nevermind hes now dead rose was a charismatic character but her decisions in this movie were idiotic and stupid finns arc could have been wonderfully completed in this movie with him originally being in the first order to him dying for the resistance but then nope rose had to save him and kiss him awkwardly it was interesting to watch but ties up too many ends and leaves an unsatisfying taste in your mouth
Oct 1 2018,negative,adam driver portraying with a depth of emotions comparable to kristen stewart and a plot that concurs most of the concept star wars has teached us so far a new hope for us all can ony be the death of lucasfilm studios
Oct 1 2018,negative,terrible  incredible let down
Oct 1 2018,negative,johnson you rotten this saga shame on you difficult to go up the level after that  fortunately rogue one was good because i start to say that disney is doing anything
Oct 1 2018,negative,rj took a massive dump on previous plot lines set up in tfa what luke skywalker means to franchise and to star wars fans everywhere with this garbage ive never left a theater angry until this movie
Sep 30 2018,negative,truly awful characterassassination movie will never consider it part of true star wars saga the cast should be ashamed of having taken part in this disaster
Sep 30 2018,negative,disgraceful to established characters stupid plot
Sep 30 2018,negative,the force awakens wasnt perfect but it was enjoyable and it made me excited for the next film the last jedi was a slap in the face i dont find myself looking forward to ep9 other than to hopefully wash the bad taste out of my mouth
Sep 30 2018,negative,this movie was written and directed by one guy and it feels that like the prequels no one elses input was considered unlike the prequels however that were overcrafted out of love this one feels like a lazy first draft that was rushed before the deadline ill give you an example    the main action in this movie is that the first order can track the resistance through hyperspace even though weve seen several cannon ways of accomplishing this like homing becons embedded spies or detection by a powerful force users tech wiz fin and newcomer rose not only simultaneously deduce that it is a new technology but also which ship it is on where it is located on that ship and how to disable it thats just bad story telling that could be fixed easily have holdo quarantine fin in the brig because of the possibility he is a spy sending a signal back to the first order while poe escorts fin back he recounts a memory that he thought was only trooper scuttlebutt that a super technology was being developed that could track through hyperspace poe allows fin and rose to overpower him steal a skiff and go on their crazy adventure  i just accomplished many things that the movie didnt i actually created a situation where poe actually acted impulsively on bad data rather than because its the only logical alternative to dying gave a reason for holdo doubting poe and not sharing her plan with him respected fins character arc from the last movie gave holdos character some depth as a beleaguered commander making tough calls in a desperate situation and closed a glaring plot hole in the film     im not saying that my solution is great film story telling and if you thought for a while you could probably think of a better cooler way to fix the story but i hope it shows you how deeply confusing and disjointed the story telling was there are dozens of examples    why did the resistance ships have no fuel the capital ships werent deployed in the force awakens and their literally just leaving hq they should be amply fueled and supplied     how were the first order able to mount such an overwhelming attack immediately after the route in the first movie    why did fin and rose park on the beach    why was holdo unaware of a ship leaving her fleet and jumping to light speed    why did poe abandon the attack on the cannon if it was clear that the resistance would die if the cannon wasnt destroyed    why did luke disappear how did he know where to send his projection    why did the first order not attack with a swarm of tie fighters once the resistance was down to one crippled capitol ship     why did hux recall ren because the capital ships couldnt cover him we didnt see them covering him before    why wasnt snoke aware of the new super tech that was on his personal flag ship    how did phasma survive and for that matter why wasnt she executed for high treason      why is rey so good with a light saber that she can fight off a whole squadron of praetorian guard    how did fin and rose get back to the base     why didnt hux scramble tie fighters when an xwing flew towards his ship in attack mode     if rey stole snokes personal craft why was she on the falcon wouldnt the support of two ships be better than just one      all these problems are the result of laziness in story telling and all the fan service in the world wont fix that
Sep 30 2018,negative,1 star for the visuals a half star because its  star wars movie and that is about the only good thing i can say about this movie rj didnt see any of the ot and luke skywalker isnt luke skywalker they used the people from the ot to draw us old fans in but then they deliver this heap of garbage they shouldve gone with something totally new in a different era in the universe
Sep 30 2018,negative,the movie that killed star wars and literally sparked a rebellion amongst its fans
Sep 30 2018,negative,killed one of cinemas favorite characters then actually killed him in the movie the hole plot centers around one persons reluctancy to share her plan with anyone making the whole movie avoidable the new characters aside from poe are complete trash my favorite part of the movie is when rose is lecturing finn about how slavery and animal abuse is bad while he was literally taken from his home as a baby to fight in the first order i wish they would have explored finn if they wanted to make that point in the movie instead of throwing in one of the most dumb and useless subplots in all of the movies and yes i think that anakin and padmes falling in love sub plot from episode 2 was much better because it actually advanced the star wars story all finn and rose do is fuck up and get the resistancerebels killed i could go on and on but if you like star wars you wont like this
Sep 30 2018,negative,this movie is fucking awful fans new and old will hate this movie
Sep 30 2018,negative,extremely disappointed with the movie if it was a standalone movie with his own characters ruin johnson spelling error intentional could have pulled off what what he tried maybe but even then the store was weak didnt make sense in spots and had so many plot hopes that that well it was just a bad story tood poorly
Sep 30 2018,negative,out of all the star wars movies the last jedi was a film set in the star wars universe but lacked the story that usually goes with it a movie filled with dissapointment and inconsistencies from the star wars universe that lacked any development in the story the whole film felt like it could have been improved as it deprived viewers of what they wanted in a disguise of a twist that lacked creativity
Sep 30 2018,positive,as a girl who grew up watching the original star wars i think this film is amazing
Sep 29 2018,negative,worse than the prequels
Sep 29 2018,neutral,makes the prequels seem welcoming
Sep 29 2018,negative,long time star wars fan sorry but didnt enjoy this film to me it feels like it destroyed too much of what star wars built
Sep 29 2018,negative,after this movie i stopped trusting tomatometer this movie although beautiful is full off plot holes the worst sw movie ever
Sep 29 2018,positive,dont understand why everyone thinks this one sucks
Sep 29 2018,negative,massively disappointing
Sep 28 2018,negative,hot pile of  garbage
Sep 28 2018,negative,doesnt have a credible villain or hero all characters are a bunch of noobs they dont know what they are or what are they doing and finally makes all other 7 movies pointless making the jedi pointless
Sep 28 2018,negative,whole finn rose thing was filler pretorian guard fight was cool
Sep 28 2018,negative,it was horrible and completely pissed on the fans
Sep 28 2018,positive,while not as good as its predecessor the force awakens the last jedi offers some really great thrills fun action and great performances from the great mark hamill as luke skywalker the late great carrie fisher as leia organs and adam driver as kylo ren
Sep 28 2018,negative,when i was asked if i liked the film the best response i could come up with was is it possible to like a film but hate every detail about it  i was visually entertained  thats about it  unfortunately i cant just sit and watch mindlessly and as soon as i started to think about the things that were going on my enjoyment would plummet  i always thought star wars was about good stories  this film broke the narrative and led every set up from the previous film to a dead end
Sep 28 2018,positive,it was disappointing  ridiculous nonsensical scenes like that one of leia floating through space after surviving an explosion are throughout the film  annoying and pointless side stories are in film  it does have great action and special effects and the cast does what they can to make the movie work  it also sets the stage for a potentially great third film  because of that it feels like a place holder
Sep 28 2018,negative,dysney ruined star wars
Sep 28 2018,negative,i once called myself a star wars fan now i have to clarify that i am a star wars legends fan i literally hate everything about the new canon
Sep 28 2018,negative,very dissapointing great effects and acting it looked amazing but the plot was damn awful totally destroyed the original trilogy luke skywalker what was the point hyperspace ship ram why didnt the resistance do that to the death star rhian johnson was looking for the surprise factor unfortunately they were detrimental to the plot
Sep 27 2018,negative,without a doubt the worst film in the franchise the characters are shallow and the plot makes no sense
Sep 27 2018,negative,easily my least favourite star wars film to date the list of problems is endless the plot is a mess the humour is sickeningly forced and the disney political agenda comes through as heavy handed as ever rian johnson threw out everything that jj set up in the force awakens the films only saving grace is its visuals yet that alone cannot undo the damage this film has done to the entire fanbase and to all the star wars films to come
Sep 27 2018,negative,rian took some risks but failed in the most complete way this movie replaces simplicity and heroism with thinly veiled political dialogue about the resistance feminism and the military industrial complex nothing really happens in this movie it makes absolutely no sense characters face no challenges in this movie how it was created and approved is completely beyond me
Sep 27 2018,positive,this was good albeit flawed star wars film if you can set aside the off kilter humor and its handling of familiar characters and times such as the force you can have a really good time
Sep 27 2018,negative,i love you jarjar binks please come back all is forgiven
Sep 27 2018,negative,awful  try making a movie that appeals to your fanbase  rian johnson ruined this film  very little continuity from the previous film  highly inappropriate humor moments jj abrams did a pretty good job setting this film up for a great story to be told why is luke hiding who is rey whats up with snoke the knights of ren etc  its unbelievable how the director could completely disregard everything and make this flop  there were some nice visuals but thats pretty much to be expected with a movie of this franchise  ive been watching star wars movies for about 35 years  you guys totally lost me on this stinking pile of putrescence
Sep 27 2018,positive,loved every minute of it  a lot has been said about this flick but thats all i got for now 
Sep 27 2018,negative,there are so many flaws honestly they didnt do much right here the other films are truly timeless this film felt like it was written to be relevant to current events and times the space casino with entertainment felt like earth it didnt feel like a space casino
Sep 27 2018,positive,solid installment of the franchise
Sep 27 2018,negative,kinda forgettable large section in the middle that has nothing to do with the rest of the plot
Sep 27 2018,negative,awful messy and silly  not even just a bad star wars film just one of the worst films ive ever seen  theres not 1 good thing i can say about this film other than i wish i hadnt watched it
Sep 27 2018,negative,for me this is the worst star wars film ever made they took evrything i know and love abot star wars and completely fd it up shame on you
Sep 27 2018,negative,im being generous by giving this a 2 for the special effects alone i raise this above a 1 like many of us die hard star wars fans im shocked how bad this is i saw this in the theater last year now a year later i got to see it again on tv and if anything its worse that my theater experience its all about the writing this is what they came up with
Sep 26 2018,positive,i liked this movie i got to see this free and kylo ren and rey where awesome and luke was great as well
Sep 26 2018,negative,this movie has great scenes and has some exciting action but this movie relies on plots that were never mention in either the original or the prequel trilogy dont believe all the subverting expectations garbage because the movie still sucks ryan johnson decidedly threw all the questions introduced in episode 7 in the garbage the movie is mostly spent on a tiny ship with hardly any conflict or lack of tension we see in other star wars films go watch the phantom menace its better than this
Sep 26 2018,negative,too many plot holes wasted movie time i have watched it once and do not want to see it again kathleen kennedy ruins star wars
Sep 26 2018,negative,an inconvenient truth the worse movie of the saga
Sep 26 2018,negative,really bad movie  insulting to the franchise
Sep 26 2018,negative,this movie felt like a waste of time the majority of the plot focused on the purple haired girl as the antagonist only to later reveal that she just didnt feel like telling anyone her plan rey who apparently has no parents hardly trained on the island since luke was too old and whiny to do anything not to mention snoke was killed off without having any backstory this movie was horrendous but gets 2 stars because the yoda scene was pretty koo
Sep 26 2018,negative,i love the original 3 hated the 3 prequels and then loved the force awakens this is probably the worst of them all i dispise it and the director and writers i will never watch another star wars film again
Sep 26 2018,negative,just a puddle of missed opportunities could be great but it was horrible by far the worst episode of the whole saga
Sep 26 2018,negative,i wanted to like this movie so much i thought maybe was just in a bad mood the first time i saw it so i tried to watch it two more times it was so disjointed i just couldnt get through it then i showed it to my 7year old and he lost interest after the first 5 minutes i tried fast forwarding through the nonaction parts to find a point in the movie that would engage him and got to the last battle scene before he showed any interest at all when the big astral projection surprise was revealed he looked at me and said thats dumb
Sep 26 2018,positive,loved it even better on second viewing intelligent thoughtful entertaining lets hope the stupid vocal minority doesnt result in us getting a safe boring episode ix
Sep 26 2018,positive,i give this one 5 stars for the beautiful plot imagery and dialogue best star wars movie yet acting and story were phenomenal best dialogue yet in star wars also
Sep 26 2018,positive,good movies but i understand why some people may not like it it is slow at times 
Sep 25 2018,negative,to bad i cant give 0 stars
Sep 24 2018,negative,this movie is dissapointing for star wars fans as well as the average movie goer looking for a good scifi action movie  it fails to deliver on so many elements that the force awakens introduced to us  the portrayal of luke skywalker is abysmal  in fact none of the characters have development   too much is copying elements from the empire strikes back  for non star wars fans  the plot is boring as over half the movie is a slow chase through space  so much is left unanswered that its hard to care for any of the characters  the story is a mess  too many elements just thrown in like the canto bight scene which is both degrading capitalism while pushing animal rights  nothing wrong with animal rights but is that the theme we are looking for in the sequel to star wars  check out ivan ortegas work editing the film for star wars fans on youtube to see why so many are disapointed in this latest installment of the star wars franchise
Sep 24 2018,negative,the movie completely ignores the previous films not just force awakens  it ruins the tone and characters of the franchise from beginning to end
Sep 24 2018,negative,complete destruction of the star wars franchise
Sep 24 2018,negative,whats missing from the star wars franchise since the original trilogy is any sense of vision and passion this is the worst of all for its sheer pretentiousness and as with most of the comedy the attempt to subvert expectations falls flat
Sep 24 2018,positive,contrary to most people i thought the last jedi was an improvement over the force awakens
Sep 23 2018,negative,alert  watch the youtube discussions of this film    i encourage everyone to read some of the now noncanon books and other stories about star wars  they far exceed the capacity of this scifi tragedy    star wars used to get people through rough times  it encouraged young people to rise to the occasion and strike at evil while learning enough about themselves to make their own judgments    this movie throws away all of that  there is nothing to learn nothing to explore and nothing to love    this film would not spawn novels video games and dreams in its likeness but the originals did
Sep 23 2018,positive,this movie has everything i wanted in a star wars movie
Sep 23 2018,negative,could be a good movie if it was a stand alone film and didnt belong to the star wars universe
Sep 23 2018,negative,horrific writing plot  half a star for special effects
Sep 23 2018,negative,worst film i had ever seen  full of plot holes character motivations made no sense and it contradicted lore from previous films
Sep 23 2018,negative,finally attempted to watch this movie after avoiding it due to negative responses from fans this movie has zero respect for the established universe of star wars     even if it wasnt a part of the star wars universe the character arcs would still be terrible and the poorly written story would still have zero satisfying resolution
Sep 23 2018,positive,its time to let old things die    well i certainly hope not   the last jedi is actually the first star wars movie i actually enjoyed watching which was a very pleasant surprise  as with the beginning i was like here we go again  the same music same big yellow letters as a introductionwhich was porely translated fort the netherlands by the way    it made me cringe like really this again  and then the movie starded  immediatly you felt like you are back in this fantasy world only with a lot of new charackters at least for me  i was impressed by the way they give you the same ambiance but in a more modern setting   nice    i do however was a little bit in a lost because of the new charackters because it had been a long time since i ever watch star wars   but it was resolved quickly  as with all the movies the story isnt to complicated butt very enjoyable and easy to follow with a beautifull mythical underlining   and when whe got to ahchto  wauw just wauw  the island is so beautiful and its funny to see how luke has made it its own which whe can see when rey follows him around  and humour is all around  the not so subtle irritation of the locals on ahchto towards rey  the way luke throws away the lightsaber as soon as he gets it the bound between the porg and chewbacca its great star wars always had this kind of humour in its films    so much hidden gems  the way the lightsaber of kylo looks more like a sword compared to reys sable   the visuals in general are perfect and compelling and there is a lot of attention to details like no red footprints when luke walks towards kylo  and the vulptex amazing so beautifull    there is so much to love about the movie and it really reignited my interest in the franchise  the actors are wonderfull in their roles although i would have loved to see more of rey and luke training for me that was the best part   and personally i think people are going to miss the big lightsaber fights  but i havent enjoyed a star wars movie like this one in a long long time    go watch it right now
Sep 22 2018,negative,a deconstructionist ploy at starwars that falls flat on its face into a puddle of bantha feces and is then trampled by a herd of nerfs without a nerf herder
Sep 22 2018,negative,great looking film with great effects but it is a huge departure from the tone of the prior films and it creates a luke skywalker unrecognizable from the original trilogy episodes 46
Sep 22 2018,positive,another visually stunning star wars movie that is actually quite hilarious but wastes so much potential
Sep 22 2018,negative,terrible what johnson did to the franchise
Sep 22 2018,negative,this is one of the worst movies ever made  story is terrible and self conflicting film structure makes almost no sense characters contradict the lore and this middle film in a trilogy destroys all the plot threads and setups for the final film  this movie is absolutely terrible
Sep 21 2018,negative,its really good if really good is a radioactive dumpster fire
Sep 21 2018,negative,the most incoherent plot ive ever seen in a movie and that is saying something visually stunning hence 1 star but uncompelling otherwise the other problem is that the whole movie feels like an exercise in nihilism nothing means anything and history cycles if thats the case why should i care
Sep 21 2018,positive,it was a great movie that everyone seems to think they could have wrote better enjoy the star wars movie 
Sep 21 2018,negative,feels like a retroactive attack on the core characters from the previous films drastic changes that arent adequately explained just to bring forward a rushed new generation
Sep 21 2018,negative,even though the storyline of the last jedi is intriguing the movie fell flat finns character devoplment went backwards when compared to the force awakens rose who i assume is supposed to be a strong independent woman was poorly written due to the cliche of her sacrificing for the things she loves the chemistry between the two characters and the plot in which they were written especially that of the casino scene is why this movie horrible failed for the audience
Sep 21 2018,negative,what a waste of time
Sep 21 2018,negative,this is the best looking star wars film to date and makes for an entertaining roller coaster ride filled with action unfortunately the positives of this film is dragged down by the many plot holes dropped storylines from the force awakens and the disregard towards the established star wars lore
Sep 20 2018,negative,contrived irritating and crammed with forced comic relief the last jedi is emblematic of what happens when a studio is more concerned with a product than an artwork and appears to serve no purpose aside than setting up socalled twists that dont so much subvert expectations as they do undermine everything episode 7 created
Sep 20 2018,negative,this is quite frankly the worst star wars movie visually just like every star wars movie its spectacular the choreography story writing plot story arcs or lack there of it doesnt follow the lore of the universe it didnt follow a single plot point from 7 the worst sequel ive ever seen and ive seen speed 2 zero character development if you just came to watch something that looks cool this movie is for you but just put aside any hopes for character development or plot
Sep 20 2018,negative,awful movie hides under the subverting expectation guise but does nothing for the star wars universe except ruining it no innovation it only checked off props and settings from previous movies
Sep 20 2018,negative,worst star war movie ever because it made the events of episodes 16 pointless  way to destroy a beloved franchise  but one star for state of the art special effects
Sep 20 2018,negative,mess of a movie to many plot holes things that make no sense or  just there to further the plot but with no meaning bad movie bad writing  and as a result  i dont care about what happens next not expecting nothing at all from ep 9
Sep 20 2018,negative,i want my money back great visual but story complexity ruined the franchise
Sep 20 2018,positive,ok everyone can agree the canto bite scene is not that good but the battle on crait and the rey training scenes are so good
Sep 20 2018,negative,amazing visuals and cinematography but a lazy storyline multiple sub plots that made no sense and didnt mesh well with the film before it the force awakens
Sep 20 2018,negative,poor lazily written script
Sep 20 2018,negative,not for fans they stuffed it full of marvelstyle hint hint too obvious funny moments and the result is a half comedy half space action movie without the sense of danger doom and gloom that made the rest of the saga so engaging theres always time for an argument and a bad joke in the face of danger no wonder the audience hated it and the critics loved it
Sep 20 2018,negative,all thought  visually stunning out of all the star wars movies the screenplay and a majority of the cast seemed off and didnt make me fell as if this is the star wars movie that the fans asked for
Sep 19 2018,negative,the new it remake was an amazing movie
Sep 19 2018,negative,a movie made out of fillers no story
Sep 19 2018,negative,the worst film in the star wars saga
Sep 18 2018,negative,worst star wars movie ive ever seen not my star wars not my luke skywalker rian johnson find some respect for the fans and show it if you are a star wars lover dont watch this movie and youll be ok i hope may the force be with you btw the force has no gender
Sep 18 2018,negative,decorated emptiness
Sep 18 2018,positive,while this movie may be divided and clearly the internet has a mutual feeling all the way i will say that i actually liked this movie because of how daring it was to do the complete opposite of every theory being thought up at the time sure i can see why some dont like this movie but i can also see why some like this film   no matter if you like this movie or not i think its perfectly clear that all of us as a fan base care deeply for this franchise and want it to be heres a real shocker fun i may be of the minority on this but seriously are we really willing to let differences in opinion ruin what used to be a fun and exciting franchise where we could laugh about the mistakes and still have long discussions about why we love this franchise
Sep 18 2018,positive,just how it needed to be
Sep 18 2018,negative,went and saw it in theaters and i left and wanted my money back now i am disgusted a bunch of idiots are spamming new 5 star ratings in an attempt to shove all the real critique to the bottom of the ratings in a hope to hide it
Sep 18 2018,negative,star wars the last one youll ever pay to watch
Sep 18 2018,negative,dont watch this if you are a star wars fan it will turn you towards the dark side and ruin stars wars forever for you just stick to the originals and the prequels and avoid becoming a disillusioned fan until the day you die
Sep 18 2018,negative,just a movie and thats what if feels like
Sep 18 2018,negative,none of the main characters have an consistent behavior instead just ranging from incompetent to perfect master of everything lazy story telling and the plot doesnt hold up to scrutiny poor depictions of the older star wars characters this movie is an overall disappointment and failure
Sep 18 2018,neutral,if some body asked me to describe this movie in one word  pointless would be that word    i remenber liking some of it but when i think back really i just want to create a fanfic of it and not in a good way like the noncanon star wars stories but in a i gotta fix this      they couldnt pull out any concept they were triying  most of the movie happens in one place but a lot is happening a lot of nonsense happened  holdo is bad but she is not she is a hero she is a bldy idit she just needed to say we have a plan i just wont tell you  canto bight you might think i will trash this one but i have to say i really liked the concept of war and how powerfull people get money because of it buuuuut yeah its trash this is bathroom breake   rey is no body but even a no body can be the greatest mary sue in history its a nice think to say but it didnt came out motivational it came out poiinttlleesss  just like snoke  and phasma  and the first order in general  and lukes daily rutine and his way of training and his mother loving dead    i actually liked leia using the force liked rose sister benicio del toro luke first leason the viasuals but bombs falling in space and light speed is now a effective weapon sooo yeah
Sep 18 2018,negative,the worst star wars movie ever
Sep 18 2018,negative,terrible movie the old characters are treated like trash and the new characters have no depth i was checking my watch throughout the movie
Sep 18 2018,negative,this is a rubbish star wars film and a rubbish film full stop genuinely confused as to how critics all like it
Sep 18 2018,negative,in the words of yoda the greatest teacher failure is  lets hope this failure of a movie will teach the director something
Sep 18 2018,positive,what a let down   never again
Sep 18 2018,negative,a disappointing moviethe story was not crafted well the characters did not grow and it did not make the force awakens better only made it worse the sequel trilogy is on lifesupport after this movie
Sep 18 2018,negative,by far the worst star wars movie of all time poor mark hamill
Sep 17 2018,negative,not the sequal star wars fans were build up in force awakens
Sep 17 2018,negative,wow the worst star wars movie easily so predictable cliche and uninteresting
Sep 17 2018,negative,the movie started off good and then fell flat on its face i was so disappointed by the end of this film one of the worst made so far
Sep 17 2018,negative,this is the worst movie i have ever seen as i sat in the theater  wondered to myself in the first action scene how does that make sense it defies the laws of science it makes no damn sense not to mention this had many  i mean many plot holes this movie has no place in the star wars universe
Sep 17 2018,negative,this film shames star wars  rich  legacy they might as well have remade the wizard of oz with the witch playing dorothy dorothy as the wizard scarecrow as the witch in drag and so on ooops now ive gone and given rj an idea for his next film
Sep 17 2018,negative,one big meh with a handful of good moments
Sep 17 2018,negative, no characters development   overly long   boring   themes contradicted incessantly  its bad does nothing to really advance any story character or plot and will probably be made an utterly redundant and pointless film between 7 and 9
Sep 17 2018,negative,a decent space wizard movie but an abomination of a star wars movie
Sep 17 2018,negative,i created an account just to review this movie  it was a train wreck from start to finish  congrats on ruining a franchise
Sep 17 2018,negative,worst movie in the star wars franchise generic riddled with plot holes and absolutely disgraceful to the star wars name good bye star wars ill come back when kk and rj are gone
Sep 17 2018,negative,dreadful film everything you have read about what is wrong with it is true  poor writing inconsistent tone depressing story nothing much happens apart from some excellent cgi  explosions the villains are a mocked all the time which diminishes them as a credible threat the new characters holdo and dj are wasted and their behaviour is ridiculous leia flies through space without so much as a suit luke milks the mammary gland of a sea cow and drinks the liquid with relish did we really need to see this and there is a whole sequence involving the rescue of space horses from on a casino planet that has no point to it whatsoever avoid this debacle if you enjoyed any of the first 6 star wars films
Sep 17 2018,negative,do not watch the story line doesnt follow the cannon this was not only not enjoyable for fans but just boring for a new watcher so many flaws to point out in this movie not enough space to put it
Sep 17 2018,positive,so many strong female characters
Sep 17 2018,negative,the movie has just a handful of nice battle scenes in the force awakens the main  purpose was to find luke  this ner order was powerful and the only hope was to find luke so is perfectly reasonable that you expect to see a all powerful jedi master tosing around the atats and showing why he is what he is ans in the meantime training reybut what you see her is another bad interpretation of what the fans want the director doesnt have the slightest idea of what the real star wars fans where waiting is a total disaster
Sep 17 2018,positive,dont fool yourself  it was just okay parts were good parts were great parts were meh parts were bleh this wasnt a 91 film on the same level as the bourne ultimatum of wonder woman of the fellowship of the ring forget the argument its a good movie just not a good star wars movie you know it wasnt as good as those other nonstarwars classics even though this scored the same level overrated should have scored around 80 on rotten tomatoes more or less  dont fool yourself
Sep 17 2018,negative,oh boy what a bad movie  the story make no sense  there is no character development even worst it redefines what a mary sue is and oneup itself on that department
Sep 17 2018,positive,it was an inspired addition to the saga definitely in the top 3
Sep 17 2018,negative,pros some interesting geologies and geographies mostly great fx  cons unthreatening villains misplaced humor betrayal of legacy characters illogical character choicesactions plot hole extravaganza missed opportunities poorly written characters etc
Sep 17 2018,negative,ill give it the one star for the visuals which are inevejtable given
Sep 17 2018,negative,like allowing a 14 year old to make a star wars movie except its a grown ass man
Sep 17 2018,negative,a technically well put together film that tells a dull and boring story that wastes times ignores canon and is generally awful
Sep 17 2018,negative,trashed the legacy of the previous 7 mainline films  rogue one and solo   didnt answer the questions set up in the force awakens which was excellent also some plot points either make no sense or add nothing to the series  total trash
Sep 17 2018,negative,just tried to watch it for the second time   this movie destroyed everything the characters the canon the lore and the fanbase  no more money from me for this masterpiece or its sequels
Sep 17 2018,negative,this movie ruined star wars for me
Sep 17 2018,negative,fantastic visual effects absolutely second to none  however given that that this is star wars the worlds biggest scifi franchise in addition to now having disneys money behind it this is a bareminimum expectation  this film failed to capitalise on any of the plot points set up in the previous film and did a great deal of disservice to the characters it borrowed from the original trilogy    on top of the character issues the film played out like a string of highlights from episodes 5 and 6 strung loosely together with the universes slowest chase scene and the first order who were introduced as a very dangerous adversary at the beginning of the force awakens have been reduced in the last jedi to a bungling troupe of clowns whose repeated incompetence from the outset is the only reason that the credits werent rolling a few minutes into the film    on the whole this was a very poor showing and has ensured that the upcoming episode 9 instead of riding the crest of a wave has a mountain to climb to try and recover the franchises credibility moving forward into the next phase of films
Sep 17 2018,negative,the most difficult question is this does it get points for at least trying i dont think so since it tried and failed
Sep 17 2018,negative,visually my vote is 5 with no problem but i had a lot of trouble to follow and agree with the plot of the movie because for me many actions done by the characters dont reflect their characterization and so their feelings this last criticism is well summed up by how it should have ended youtube channel there are many things about the first and the second movie not told and explained making the understanding of the film confusing and hard to follow lastly there are some nonsense scenes which i didnt like making the plot very weak
Sep 17 2018,negative,rian johnson decided to take each story element jj introduced and add a twist too it sadly this movie takes star wars in the wrong direction
Sep 17 2018,negative,fails in every department   they hired a novice director gave him complete control  a sad mockery of star wars  watch episodes 16 dont waste your time on this rubbish
Sep 17 2018,positive,this is the one that took me from yeah i like star wars just fine to a fullon diehard fan of the franchise
Sep 17 2018,negative,simply put worst star wars movie ever
Sep 17 2018,negative,taken the franchise in a horrible direction
Sep 16 2018,neutral,dont believe what you read middle of the road star wars film this is a popcorn film nothing ground breaking and not as bad as the prequel films subverts aspects of the original trilogy without really creating anything new or expanding the star wars myth some great moments some cringe worthy moments positives looks great sounds great great fight scenes great score negativesvery boring middle act subplot poorly written new characters terrible humor terrible dialogue poor character arches tonal inconsistencies dont believe the reviews not a ground breaking film star wars fanboys and fan girls will like anything with star wars slapped on it or hate it the reviews and star wars fans are polarizing and strange just another big loud diversion type film not awful and far from great unless you only watch popcorn films for children these films will never be as good as the originals the originals are brilliant films cannot expect corporate films to replicate a genius like lucas was in his prime 
Sep 16 2018,negative,this was bad any expectations of future star wars movies have evaporated
Sep 16 2018,negative,after seeing this movie i wish my mom had an abortion and discarded me like i will discard this garbage of a film
Sep 16 2018,negative,worst star wars movie i ever saw  aint watching eps 9 have no interest
Sep 15 2018,negative,not a fan despite advances in technology and film making this movie has lost something from the first three installments
Sep 15 2018,negative,honestly the only thing good about this movie is the visual effects and even those have some iffy aspects about them laser mortars that bend in space i am not a fanatic of the franchise but i do love me some good star wars and sadly this was not
Sep 15 2018,negative,no more jedi whats the point in watching anymore
Sep 15 2018,negative,mr plinkett summed up the movie nicely the prequels are terrible but harmless this film ruins the entire original trilogy and the future trajectory
Sep 15 2018,negative,i loved the force awakens and rogue one this was terrible chrome dome
Sep 14 2018,negative,like was nothing like he was in the original trilogy characters existed for no reason and bathos just happens way to often
Sep 14 2018,negative,this films destroys the star wars rules doesnt develop the characters kills luke in a ridicule way is long and boring the visually good aspect of it doesnt redeem it
Sep 14 2018,positive,not what you might expect but im a fan boy and i thought it made up for the phantom menace and the other prequels
Sep 13 2018,negative,please stop doing this to star wars at this point it dosnt need another movie it needs help
Sep 13 2018,negative,will just make you feel empty and disapointed afterwards with not much intrest for the next film pretty much everything that was built up in the force awakens was ignored and made it seam like the movie tried to be the first in a new trilogy instead of the second visually stunning but thats about it alot of plotholes and missed opportunities summs this film up
Sep 13 2018,negative,terrible movie this makes me almost forgive the character jarjar
Sep 13 2018,negative,i love star wars but this is not even the worst star wars movie but even the worst scifi movie ever
Sep 12 2018,negative,by far the worst sw movie yet so so sad
Sep 12 2018,positive,after an appalling start where the characters stumble through some awful dialogue and the actors give some unconvincing performances the film thankfully picks up and becomes an enjoyable romp its no force awakens but its not the phantom menace either
Sep 11 2018,negative,at no point does this film even attempt to have a reasonable plot    id rather watch a transformers movie thats how bad the last jedi was
Sep 11 2018,negative,poor writing plot holes and more original trilogy shake and bake layered with arbitrary twists i feel bad for the actors who are doing great work with poor material especially boyega who was totally wasted in this film kylo ren continues to be the least compelling villain ive ever seen and rey got flattened out into a cardboard character not to mention the poor pacing and plethora of plot holes i wont even be bothering with the next one
Sep 11 2018,negative,too many reasons not to like this movie
Sep 11 2018,negative,star wars the mary sue chronicles this is how you kill a franchise
Sep 10 2018,negative,while a frustrating film in terms of structure the last jedi still leaves us eager to see what kylo ren will do in episode ix and gives us a good last oorah for luke skywalker  if you can get past the unneeded subplots and hamfisted decisions
Sep 9 2018,negative,what happens when you write a movie by politically correct comity the last jedi from the assassination of lukes character to half of the plot being made useless this movie ruined not only the franchise but undermined everything astablished in the first movie rays parentage the intire character snoke useless disney would do well to chill this up to a dream sequence and start over i gave it 5 star because 0 was not an option
Sep 9 2018,negative,subverting expectations simply for the sake of subverting them isnt a compelling reason for doing so its like rian wrote his script in such a way that he wanted everything to be a surprise regardless of how compelling the surprise is and the end result is vapid and unfulfilling
Sep 9 2018,positive,loved every minute of it those weird  fans  claiming it was bad need to learn to appreciate hardwork
Sep 8 2018,negative,worst of the worst terrible movie full of plotholes they killed starwars
Sep 8 2018,positive,fair for a star wars movie i hope that as we get further away from lucas influence that the dialog continues to improve to something more than a bad translation from the original ancient greek
Sep 7 2018,negative,i dont understand the world we live in when his movie is rated 91 its unbelievable bad in so many ways
Sep 7 2018,negative,everything sucked the story sucked the characters sucked and the ending sucked
Sep 7 2018,positive,i had a blast at this movie i really liked the force awakens its callbacks an mirroring of a new hope worked in my opinion i thought it was a brilliant way to regain the trust of the star wars audience and get its feet before restarting the franchise my caveat to that is that i didnt want episode eight to do the same thing and it didnt it went in a very different direction save for a couple of small things i loved lukes arc he has the strongest character in the film and mark hamill did such a stellar job the last scene that hes in is wonderfully shot and an excellent tribute to the series while also holding up on its own the relationship between rey and kylo was fascinating and compelling i cant wait to see where that goes other than that the movie had a lot of plot problems some spoilers here so skip ahead if you need to but why did any of finns stuff happen like what was accomplished other than a cloud city reference he goes to get a guy doesnt get the guy and then hes got a girlfriend when he gets back woooooo oh boy why didnt laura dern tell anyone that she had a plan seems like some needless conflict that only exists for the audience hey whats chewbacca up to porgs i guess why didnt youknowwho show up to talk to luke before rey left that woulda been helpful probably buuuuut im mostly nitpicking here really while most of these things could have worked better in another draft of the script ultimately they were meant to tie into the films greater theme of failure which is appropriate for the middle entry of a trilogy just hope they do more with poe next time i god damn love oscar issac so much
Sep 7 2018,negative,this movie was absolutely trash and the casino scenes didnt feel like they belonged in star wars
Sep 7 2018,positive,the truth is that the last jedi is a really fun great looking scififantasy adventure but it is a lousy star wars movie i think that the pushback against the social agendas within this film is very upsetting because 1 who cares about what the characters look like as long as theyre well written and 2 it overshadows the conversation about this movies actual problems relative to the franchise disney and rian johnson seem to have wanted to surprise people so bad that they decided it was okay to throw out the rules of the franchise to do so for the purpose of cohesive story telling when one is world bulding it helps to have some wellconsidered constants things like how the force works how forcewielders lineage comes into play what it means to be a jedisith how space based technology and lightspeed travel work and what it would mean for the pastpresentfuture of the franchise if those rules were to be altered or cast aside are things that all need to be weighed heavily against the story that one is trying to tell these are things that have already been established but mr johnson did not appear ro consider any of them as he ran slapdash through the thoughtfully constructed sw universe and changed what he pleased to make his installment more subversive and unexpected well congrats rian you made a movie so different and unexpected that it isnt really even a star wars movie anymore so yeah great blockbuster bad sw movie
Sep 7 2018,negative,if i was watching this as just a regular movie i would probably not mine this movie but from a star wars fanboy point of view it was a disappointment to life and humanity as a whole do not watch this movie if you love star wars
Sep 7 2018,negative,terrible gimmicky and laden with plot whole and pointless action
Sep 6 2018,negative,not only worst star wars ever but just a bad movie period
Sep 6 2018,negative,the screenplay really  really
Sep 6 2018,negative,a prime example of why a majority of movie critics should not be trusted to give an honest opinion this movie is nothing more than a double middle finger to star wars fans very sad
Sep 5 2018,negative,visually stunning everything else is a garbage fire
Sep 5 2018,negative,watch it at night in bed to help you fall asleep
Sep 5 2018,negative,star wars in name only truly awful
Sep 5 2018,negative,half a star for the exceptional cinematography and half a star for the solid performances of the cast who did an amazing job considering the contrived story line and poor script they had to work with the rest of the movie 0 stars and was very disappointing   i am someone who even liked jar jar binks from the phantom menace sorry hard core fans and easily pleased by anything star wars so this is very disappointing to give a star wars movie 1 star   laura dern is one of my favourite actors so i was really pleased to see her in a star wars movie so disappointed when she had to play a terribly poorly written character that obviously feels threatened by a male character for no reason and so resorts to condescending him while showing a great deal of incompetence as a leader of people so frustratingly she is the very opposite of a strong female character lucasfilm have been promising     the characters which were set up well in the force awakens become 2dimensional   finn is relegated to comedy relief shame because john boyega is a quality actor and should be given something more to do   reys character isnt developed further and even becomes unrelatable due to her op being unnearned   poe has nothing to do apart from stand up to the office bully holdo   lukes character was needlessly and fully disrespected by the writer worse than that this new trilogy now feels like some sort of morbid death row for the most beloved characters of the franchise killing solo off in the last movie was bold killing one original character off per movie is nothing more than depressing   captain phasma had so much unused potential especially as she is played by the great gwendoline christie who took out the hound in got in such a fantastically choreographed and brutal fight scene phasma could and should have been more threatening and intimidating especially as she is played by the perfect actor for this but shes relegated to bit part nothingness why   the first order come accross as baffoons and so any real threat to the resistance is dimished to the point where there is hardly any tension or sense of peril in the movie at any point  the movie is full of contradictions to the rest of the star wars universe and indeed to its own story   i dont understand how the critics gave this movie such a great recommendation   the second movie in a trillogy needs to subvert expectations and take the story in a new direction this failed at this badly it tried to subvert expectations by dodging answering many questions set up by the first movie no subversions here just dodges the writer couldnt think of anything interesting to answer these questions so he gave us literally nothing   my expectation for a good star wars movie was the only thing subverted   i really really wish i could say i like this movie i have really tried to   the force awakens even though its a copy of a new hope left me excited to see the next instalment this one has left me feeling worried about the next one
Sep 5 2018,negative,continuing the disappointing line from the previous movie viiith episode of the saga just employs old tricks in different too similar scenarios to continue a neverending story in which relevant revelations are unexpected characters lack charism but maybe a luke skywalker which resermbles more mark hamilton than the original character himself john boyegas character and kyloleia relationships would have require a deep development that can not be achieved with the brief time and effort dedicated to this script
Sep 5 2018,negative,senseless and incomprehensible plot little to no thought was put into this movie and instead it seems content to rest on the star wars brand to prop up the story the characters motivations make very little sense and the contradictions and plot holes pile up faster than the viewer can process
Sep 4 2018,negative,my expectations of a good movie were subverted
Sep 4 2018,negative,worst star wars film ive seen so far i was hoping disney would not mutilate star wars the only decent disney star wars film so far is rogue one
Sep 4 2018,negative,overall the peak of mediocrity is this movies highest achievement an entire movie base on subversion fails as it is a sub version of what it could have been looking pretty allowed those that saw it to sit through it and it was flashy enough to force watchers not to think but after there is nothing but questions and the subversion already sets up that the answers will be just ignore that it was a joke     this movie would be good at being screenshots or a slideshow but it is not a movie as a story recorded by camera as a set of moving images it is a series of events that look cool but logically do not match time and flow are both broken in this story with rey and luke spending days on a planet during a 16 hour maximum space chase     as a stand alone movie that was never seen by a person that saw star wars it looks pretty but it resets itself the movie has no point it starts with a pile of people in a few ships fleeing from a massive army it ends with a smaller pile of people in 1 ship fleeing from a massive army    from the view of connecting into 8 other movies it is a poor attempt at a new episode 5 even in the theatre the movie felt like it finished when the silent explosion occurred with the jump into hyperspace through a ship  there was still 45 minutes left that dragged through and felt closer to another hour and a half none of the characters felt like they progressed they just stayed the same suffering from bipolar disorder angry to happy to sad back to angry was a common reaction through it     characters that were added were not interesting feeling more like cardboard than actual people   holdo was the standard cranky old lady type that makes one wonder how she kept her job she is dismissing the hotshot pilot for his arrogance while being arrogant and her death being in the same movie as her life has no weight i actually felt glad she flew it as it means her character is gone allowing a possibly better character to exist   the commander on the new nazi side acted like a 30yearold version of draco malfoy and was dragged through the mud literally as such he is supposed to be the 2nd in command yet is treated like the janitors supervisor    luke somehow is now the most cynical nihilist ever even though he rescued his father the one who killed thousands of people to the point that his shadow is now seen as the most iconic image of evil in fiction yet was ready to kill from a dream   rey was more of a standin for the emotion the scene was portraying if you were confused in what you should feel look at her face she does not change but reacts to what ever occurs to her     overall a good gasoline movie like those of michael bay but if you want a plot forget it on the scale of who got paid between the gasoline guys and the writers it was all gasoline guys and the desired events were sketched on a napkin at 6am at the end of a sleepless night         the new series would be better if it focused on kylo ren he could have been the centre of a new 6 part series showing his rise and fall into power on either the light or dark or trying to become the gray rather than what is there being a retread of the originals but with reduced plot points and more gasoline these new ones also contain more one dimensional characters than early 50s stuff in the past 2 movies there has been little to no arc in their characters and the most recent felt like it ripped through 5 completed 6 and then reset back to the end of 5 i would not be suprised unless major retroactive plot tweaking is done that the last jedi could be not watched and there would still be a complete plot
Sep 4 2018,negative,though the visuals shine this film is let down by the awful screenplay and ploting the plot doesnt make any sense on many levels and all common sense seems to be missing from every character in the movie beloved characters are reduced to shadows of their former selves dont bother watching its terrible
Sep 4 2018,negative,disney destroyed star wars
Sep 4 2018,positive,not as enjoyable as the force awakens but still good if overlong
Sep 4 2018,positive,i liked it on first viewing on second i liked a little less and on third i started to wonder why i liked it on the first place its just a movie full of broken promises as someone said twenty years ago after watching his own creation its bold in the sense of jerking people around i may have gone too far in a few places
Sep 3 2018,positive,92510 rian johnson as writerdirector was the right choice for a franchise that has long struggled with taking risks the last jedi is the most creative and unstar wars like film you could hope to see but is all the better for it johnson introduces a level of gravity to the saga by deviating from franchise formula where the good guys beat the odds save the day and are relatively unscathed and instead explores the folly of heroic recklessness no victory achieved by the heroes is anything less than pyrrhic the characters fly by the seat of their pants as they often do in the star wars universe but suffer grave  and fatal  consequences as their spontaneous rogue plans fall apart the true heroes of this film are the characters who remain calm and steady who realize the costs of slapdash foolishness and know when the time is right to make sacrifices in this way rian johnson has weaved together a cautionary tale one that brings the franchise to a darker more mature and necessary place    despite this and other radical departures from the star wars formula johnson is able to retain the fun humorous visually dazzling spirit instilled by his predecessors mark hamills return as luke skywalker was a highlight in terms of his acting  hilarious grizzled and yet tortured  and of character development in fact johnson nearly matches the screenplay for the empire strikes back in advancing interesting character arcs reys training is reminiscent of what luke faced in his youth but carries a heavier emotional burden poe and finn spend the film learning what true heroism is and what crossing the line into hubris can bring to bear adam driver as kylo ren may be the most consistently engrossing performer and character as he is constantly facing internal battles that manifest in rage but with desperation fear and longing percolating under the surface    this is the most beautiful star wars film to date weve come to expect great special effects from the franchise but the cinematography has reached a high point for the series offering homages to previous installments while seeking to leave its own distinct mark the scene with storys ultimate sacrifice is breathtaking its stark beauty serving to brilliantly reflect the greatness of the sacrifice that bore it additionally the air and light saber battles are among the best in the series expertly choreographed and framed     the last jedi is everything you could hope for in a star wars flick ironically by throwing many of the characteristics we most identify with this franchise out the window johnson derailed the franchise from the safe albeit entertaining tracks jj abrams intended ultimately setting it on a course for daring and depth that star wars hasnt charted in decades its a shame that star wars fans are so toxic  they may very well cause studio executives to shift the course back and perhaps rob us of an incredible finally only time will tell
Sep 3 2018,neutral,normally like star wars films but this was rubbish
Sep 3 2018,negative,if youre looking for a luke skywalker you wish youd never watched and a plot that works backwards this is the movie for you
Sep 3 2018,negative,waste of time no wait its even worse than that
Sep 3 2018,negative,destroys all the established rules of the world that has been built so far completely impossible to suspend your disbelief
Sep 3 2018,neutral,this is sadly a poor ending for both luke and leia cool as hll how powerful luke is in the force but but the story feels full of holes and concentrated on things that isnt that important i would have loved to more training footage the island for starters
Sep 3 2018,negative,bottom of the list as far as star wars movies go  bad writing bad character development bad director bad producer  we should all be refunded our money for this film hopefully a once great universe can be salvaged
Sep 2 2018,negative,horrible story line too many inconsistencies
Sep 1 2018,negative,the movie was only a dream in my opinion a dream ray had before she met luke lets hope jj remakes it the way he intended
Sep 1 2018,negative,bad movie destroys characters space battles became a joke hello ftl ram lol good bye death star and any other large ship mary poppins leah no more jedi you can be powerfull without any training mary sue ray sue admiral gender studies rose tico    dont believe the critics review its rigged and most of it just tells you based on my feelings its good basically without any valid reason explaining how it is good just look around the net
Sep 1 2018,negative,no just no this is not luke 
Sep 1 2018,negative,at least we found the bottom of the barrel
Sep 1 2018,negative,no star wars movie is worse than this and despite the critics review its a mess
Sep 1 2018,positive,great star wars movie i just dont like the direction this movie went in with killing luke hope he is not dead the crate scenes were great and kylo and rey fight was great
Sep 1 2018,positive,i dont really understand the hate that this movie was given as the general plot was interesting and it felt exciting throughout the movie personally i felt that there wasnt a dull or boring moment in the film even when the action isnt going on we felt tension in ideas and conflicting sides inside the resistance which was a nice touch to add as a subplot though the casino subplot didnt feel as powerful as i thought it was it was still interesting enough for me in the beginning of the casino scene we feel like something big is going to happen or at least something will change however at the end there was no character development no achievement just a random subplot to fill in time i understand that the movie wants to slowly shift away from the original trilogy and start introducing new characters as it did in the past few star wars films they have been slowly taking away screen time of the original actors however i feel it wont do as successful if the new characters lacked an emotional connection or relationship with the audience this could be simply achieved by having us follow along with them on a character arc and grow with these characters this would make the audience feel much closer and connected to the ideas characters and conflict of the movies
Aug 31 2018,positive,not bad but not amazing either the last jedi disappoints on many levels but is able to make up for it with great effects good fight scenes and memorable 3rd act
Aug 31 2018,neutral,the movie was fine which would be great except i wanted so much more from a star wars movie
Aug 31 2018,negative,possibly the worst movie in the star wars franchise including the horrible tv special the acting was acceptable but the story pacing direction everything except the special effects honestly were terrible unless you are a diehard fan save yourself some time and pain and skip this if i could i would give it zero stars i do not know a single star wars fan that liked this movie
Aug 31 2018,positive,an amazing movie ever made
Aug 31 2018,negative,i you loved the ot you wont find much to love here the casting is one of the biggest failures in this new trilogy and the story avoid
Aug 31 2018,negative,this is horrible trash which ruins all the plotlines from previous movies has a lot of pointless nonaction has logical errors weak characters no character development etc after relatively good previous episode this is enormous disappointment to anyone who watches this crap
Aug 30 2018,negative,b story arcs that dont go anywhere cliche dialogue and character interactions jokes that fall flat and bombs that drop out of ships in outer space with the force of gravity uhh yeah garbage
Aug 30 2018,negative,this was the worst film in the franchise
Aug 30 2018,negative,having strong female leads expectations being subverted i like all of that most of my favorite movies have that the issue with the last jedi is it has plot holes bad writing and editing if you put aside all the complaints about luke forced characters leia poppins etc it still doesnt work as a movie and it gets more evident given the force awakens did such a good job on those terms the last jedi is a movie i wouldnt watch again
Aug 30 2018,negative,a sad excuse for a star wars film with great potential let down by confoundingly stupid elements too numerous to count it is saved only partially by good visuals and direction
Aug 30 2018,negative,dissapointing doesnt cover it this was prequel bad creators were more interested in trolling the audience than respecting and making a meaningful addition to the star wars franchise its a without a doubt a new low for star wars
Aug 30 2018,negative,such a dissapointing failure ive been a fan since the first movie came out i felt it was something special and a good reason to go to the movies fun and imaginative i dont know what this is about anymore lack of a good story it does have good visuals but no more than that
Aug 30 2018,negative,wasted storyline unfaithful to the original saga way too much use of an epic saga as propaganda for multiculturalism and maybe feminism at the expense of the storyline beautiful movie when put on mute saturated movie leaving no air for imagination apparent fake criticism boosting cheating
Aug 30 2018,negative,so disapointed  you lost the essence of the universe of star wars
Aug 29 2018,negative,horrible not even worth it on netflix  it took me 3 nights to watch it was so painful mark should have said fuck you rian im not doing this shit just like harrison told george you cant say this shit back in the day this doesnt deserve any stars and rian should shitcanned for opening his mouth to the fans
Aug 29 2018,negative,the best way ive heard this movie described is a series of anticlimaxes this movie made me not want to watch movies anymore it was so freaking terrible i have been reading nonstop because nothing on tv sounds good anymore i stopped going to the theater as much i quit
Aug 29 2018,neutral,i used to like this movie for approximately a year and a halfbut after some deep soul searching i must agree with the star wars fans who hated this sequel the last jedi really is a franchisekilling movie rian johnson ruined luke skywalker he made him a cranky old hermit who drinks green milk from a cowlike creature on an island and hesitated to kill his own apprenticenephew in his sleep which caused him to overreact when he saw his uncle attempting to kill him and became kylo ren so that makes luke a lost cause it was out of character and theres so much more thats wrong with this film
Aug 29 2018,negative,went against in universe logic killed character portraits that have been build up over the saga plotline driven my outside political motivators very poor dialogue nonsensical scenes very cheap humor breaks attention from dramatic moments and worse if all they turned their back against the most loyal fan base in pop culture history i hope disney learned their lesson after this catastrophe with the plummeting reviews and failure at the box office
Aug 29 2018,negative,the visuals in this movie are amazing but that is where the good ends the screenplay is poorly written instead of getting one good a plot you get about four c plots that dont result in an overall satisfying story entire parts of the movie could be cut with no change to the overall plot which leaves the viewer asking is this movie almost over about 2 hours into this 25 hour long movie
Aug 29 2018,negative,awful idea to subvert us right out of the theater
Aug 29 2018,negative,what they did to luke is heartbreaking  makes the original trilogy kinda sad to watch knowing how bad his end is
Aug 29 2018,negative,basically a bad remake of the empire strikes back   half a star for yoda
Aug 29 2018,negative,chewbacca ate a porg   this is supposed to be a kids movie
Aug 29 2018,negative,say what you will about tfa but that movie succeeded undoubtedly in setting up interesting plotlines for the two other installments of the sequel trilogy to explore  when reviewing tlj i think it productive only to review it as the middle film of a trilogy and i believe in this it fails to perform it was disappointing badlypaced dealt extremely poorly with established character exhibited unfair bias and failed to make me excited for the thrilling conclusion of a threefilm saga
Aug 29 2018,negative,this movie somehow mad me lose interest in star wars
Aug 29 2018,negative,one of the worst movies ive ever seencertainly the worst star wars movie    it seems as if the only reason for this movie to exist is to push some weird sjw agenda no one asked for    very disappointing
Aug 29 2018,negative,hated it find the new characters boring and goofy and odd storylines i loved star wars as yong girl the last jedi and the force awakens have killed my desire to see any new star wars movie
Aug 29 2018,negative,terrible all round worst one out the new ones 
Aug 29 2018,negative,this is in my opinion the worst in the series even episode i was somehow better too much superficial scenes and characters poor performance at all levels except the special effects
Aug 28 2018,negative,the utter disrespect and maliciousness conveyed is hurtful to many fans and thus deserves to be punished accordingly
Aug 28 2018,negative,makes little to no sense from start to finish
Aug 28 2018,negative,horrible plot legacy ruined writer hated characters that we grew up on
Aug 28 2018,negative,its the only star wars movie ive never wanted to watch again  it made the prequels look great in comparison
Aug 28 2018,negative,this movie is terrible  so many plot holes contradictions of earlier movies and simply terrible writing  i am so disappointed
Aug 28 2018,negative,the story leaves much to be desired were talking prequel level bad
Aug 28 2018,positive,the story constantly defied expectations the best part was the interaction between kylo ren and rey
Aug 28 2018,negative,this is a really terrible movie  there was nothing good about it
Aug 28 2018,negative,in the vacuum this movie is fine it is well made it has some great moments and great characters but it is a star wars movie it abandons much of what it means to be a star wars movie luke skywalker is supposed to be our hero not someone who hides from his own mistakes it also takes a great villain built up in the first movie and kills him off easily making it clear that the director just did not like the character the real problem is that this movie is clearly not part of a story arc that started with the first movie this is a standalone movie made to follow the previous movie it is a sequel thats not what a trilogy is supposed to be and thats not what a star wars movie is supposed to be that falls squarely in the responsibility of kathleen kennedy there needed to be a plan and an overall story that each director worked with in and that does not seem to be what happened say what you will about the marvel movies but they are planned out and clearly all part of one continuing saga the last jedi is merely a sequel and abandons many of the hallmarks of what star wars movies have always been
Aug 28 2018,negative,the only thing this movie had to do with star wars was the character names horribly disappointing
Aug 28 2018,negative,just watched it now this is a mess of a movie theres so much wrong about this movie i dont recommend it to anyone
Aug 28 2018,negative,the story was just really bad
Aug 27 2018,negative,singlehandedly destroyed the sw franchise i stopped watching all sw after this
Aug 27 2018,negative,disgrace to the series
Aug 27 2018,negative,i have seen this movie 4 times i have really tried to enjoy and like it but it is just not happening force awakens new hope last jedi empire strikes back i wonder what the next star wars movie will equal boring lame and totally dumbed down star wars is supposed to be pg13 come one disney  take the tone of tron
Aug 27 2018,negative,it was just the worst movie i had ever watched the plotline is probably the worst i had seen from starwars ever
Aug 27 2018,negative,came out disappointed kill me please
Aug 26 2018,neutral,the returning characters are great but the new additions leave much to be desired a lot of plot points should be easy to solve but we gotta have movie which results in incredibly stupid scenarios that could be solved with a single sentence
Aug 26 2018,negative,there are some elements to like but the star wars universe is worse after this movie rather than before it  some character choices are baffling    a scene for example  a tearful goodbye from leia to holdo  this is how were introduced to holdo and leias relationship  im confused i guess they were friends    episode i is at least fun for kids  this just is annoying  interesting how theyll be able to salvage the story from here but thats only because this fil was so awful  rey still has no training i still have no clue whats going on with the universe as a whole or even who is more powerful than who  seems like the new order and the resistance didnt even matter in the universe and are both small factions in this movie  meh
Aug 26 2018,positive,a solid b for me maybe even an a sure it has it flaws but the visual is stunning character development between rey and kylo ren are interesting and its a completely new to star wars saga    pros battle of crait luke projecting himself rey and kylos team up the meeting between luke and leia holdos sacrificing herself    cons canto bight vice admiral holdo not telling her plan kylo rens attitude towards general hux
Aug 26 2018,negative,this  film seems to deliberately break every interesting idea ep 7 has established instead of building upon leaving the franchise in a dire spot
Aug 26 2018,negative,great visuals and thats it poor writing many plotholes uninteresting side stories and so on wouldnt watch again
Aug 25 2018,positive,a great movie that follows and expands on the original trilogy i saw it twice in cinemas and i definitely would have gone again  there were some great scenes with amazing special effects that drew the viewer in it definitely made me ready for next and last instalment in this trilogy
Aug 25 2018,negative,i get its disney but leia flying like mary poppins    she never used or showed any powers before   and everytime the ratings on this gets lower all the sudden   in a flash there is a wave of praise for it every abrams movie does this  gets you excited ya dart off to see it and are disappointed the only otger consistency in jj movies is that somewhere greg grunberg will show up   i really think they need to give simon pegg a crack at the story with kevin smith not like disney has anything to lose
Aug 25 2018,negative,visually epic but thats it
Aug 25 2018,positive,i think this one is much closer to iv in terms of the characters dialogues and humorous elements i cannot give the original cast less than 5 stars anyway and the newbies were good studies of the ethos of all the the new cast for viii i found gleesons hux character the most compelling whilst i understand the issues raised by the decanonising petitioners have merit its still viewers tastes and preferences rather akin to martin luthers contempt for st james epistle theres a higher force at work behind the scenes
Aug 24 2018,negative,this movie completely destroyed the star wars saga
Aug 24 2018,positive,this film is enjoyable for nonstar wars nerds this film is apparantly not worth a star wars film for those fanatical nerds if you are not one of these you will enjoy this film like i did
Aug 22 2018,negative,its amazing how much they messed up so may great characters and plot points it really baffles me this movie doesnt make any sense from a creative nor a business point of view
Aug 22 2018,positive,one of if not my favorite star wars movie
Aug 22 2018,positive,great movie let the haters cry about not getting the movie they always wanted go read the legends material quick crying this movie is great
Aug 22 2018,negative,too many irritating characters and luke skywalkers part was a massive let down
Aug 22 2018,negative,this was a train wreck of a movie from the lack of character building with their new characters to the character replacement with no backstory of the old the plot barely makes sense with huge holes characters having knowlede they shouldnt not giveing other characters expanations that they should and technology that doesnt and never has worked that way in star wars in nearly all ways from an unstructured and confusing plot to a lack of character building this movie fails and particulary so with long time fans who have invested in reading and understanding the old characters and how the technology and force in star wars are supposed to work
Aug 22 2018,positive,probably the second best star wars film
Aug 21 2018,negative,one of the worst movies ive seen in years
Aug 21 2018,negative,just watched it again  yoda will be turning in his grave how can you have so much source material and do so little with it  i have so many questions like why was snoke so large and yet appear human  how do bombs fall in space   why make skywalker  so pointless  ackbar just cast aside  dead gone  lets not forget luke milking a monster the most kick ass jedi  in the galaxy and hes a waste of film   disneys worse than lucas they killed bambis mum and now killed starwars  still they will be able to sell some toys and monster milk fair trade  dont they get it look at the film  solo and the box office  we dont care anymore just stop  please we still have at least 3 good films
Aug 21 2018,negative,it is quite a feat to be the objectively worst movie or show in the entire star wars franchise  rian johnson did such an awful job slapping this disjointed dysfunctional unmotivated canonkilling piece of trash together  it is very clear that rian johnson has great hate towards the franchise he was entrusted to  even the prequels were way better than this pile of dog feces
Aug 21 2018,positive,very good and fun could not ask for more
Aug 21 2018,negative,episode i was the first star wars movie on the big screen and i actually enjoyed the prequels then disney bought star wars at first i though great new movies finally then i saw the force awakens and was rather disappointed but nothing prepared me for the disappointment that was the last jedi the movie is utter crap one of the worst movies ive ever seen in comparison to that the force awakens is a masterpiece despite being bad itself the last jedi is so bad i couldnt believe my eyes when i first watched it i watched it for a second time thinking that maybe it might be better once i was over my initial disappointment but no still crap the story of this movie makes no sense is that really star wars i cant believe it at least i didnt waste money to actually watch this in theater rather than having me pay to see this the director should pay me for putting up with this garbage i doubt i will even watch episode 9 on the other hand episode 9 could hardly be worse than episode 8 or so i hope
Aug 20 2018,positive,bad done rey and luke part a great amount of errors
Aug 19 2018,negative,why wont my rating stick
Aug 19 2018,negative,a sad boring affair plauged by weak plot development nonsensical characters and unexplainable story choices it seems that disney have decided to do away with the star wars we grew up with in favor of this  sith
Aug 18 2018,negative,if you thought it was bad the first time it was just absolutely agonizing to watch a second time
Aug 18 2018,negative,better call george lucas 
Aug 18 2018,negative,i absolutely love the star wars saga and had high hopes for this movie after hearing good reviews of it but after seeing it i was so upset that i had to make an account just so i could leave a bad review
Aug 18 2018,negative,such a frustrating movie to watch the worst part is a sloppy set of stories following characters on their pointless side quests through the film the auxiliary stories do not even effect the main plot also so many things about being in space are taken too lightly how could a spaceship have an open cabin with people running around without oxygen suits and space just outside  the rebel bombers at the beginning if there is an invisible barrier you must show it
Aug 18 2018,negative,very disappointing i hope they reverse the decision to have johnson direct 3 more star wars films  that will be a disaster
Aug 17 2018,negative,while i did see this movie with family they were rather sanguine after seeing it though i was not i will admit that alittle contrarianism was building in me towards the new films how could people love them so much i for one found a weird nostalgic buzz prom the hated prequels that merited them above these films but that is besides the point the biggest reson for this rating is the honest experience of the film which was bad the amount of plot for how long the film goes is the killer here i feel like this whole movie could be a 45 minute arc on some weird amc series the characters are not lovable albeit most western movies fail to deliver in those regards i twas also painfull to see so many built up plot points ad ques lead no where that made me start to consider wether this was a deconstruction of star wars which would be cool but if that is what they where going far they did not do it hard enough a true deconstruction would not just burn the tree but the books too why not throw yoda in the fire awsell it would be a horrific spectacle that i would not be able to stop re watching nostalgic childhood memories lobotomized into bloody into meaningless purgatory   that being said my actual main problem is the aesthetic i have been pholosophising over the power of aesthetic for many years now and have often gone in pursuit of the ultimate dare i say divine aesthetic a combination of light and sound and other cacophony to win the mind of manin the end  i feel as if some media achieve this more then others i feel as though the aesthetic of this film is very poor and jumbled the composition of scenes harks nothing to the resplendence of art and form instead i see only hard colors that might aswell be from the crude edges of a 3d modeled video game the soundtrack did not stick alass i feel as if this is a wider symptom of a large universe starwars is so much and it is no wonder that this movie cannot contain its vast spaces in a trite aesthetic luckily this film will age and in no time it will become nostalgic and representative of a time and art and people then i will watch it again
Aug 17 2018,negative,what an utter tragedy the beginning of the end of star wars i really liked the force awakens rey was fantastic finn had so much potential poe was a bad ass pilot akin to the rebel days of past bb8 was hilarious and a fantastic comedic relief kylo ren was awesome torn between the light and dark constantly battling his inner demons  well rian johnson turned all that potential to shit he single handedly turned star wars into a joke a bad bad joke he absolutely destroyed finn who had the greatest potential of all the characters to be something amazing and if i was john boyega id be absolutely pissed he turned him into a side show clown with absolutely no character arc whatsoever you deserved so much better john i watched your other films after the last jedi and i know youre the real deal he turned rey into an unstoppable force with no charisma no motive no adversity no story and no hope of redemption i loved you so much in tfa but there is nothing jj can do to save you rose tico is a throw away character who is completely useless boring and made absolutely so sense at all kelly its not your fault please know that some of us understand the difference between you and a character you portray rose tico had the worst line in star wars hostory her last line was literally the dumbest thing ever said in a movie considering what her sister had done at the begining of the movie  admiral holdo what else is there to say id love to go on a two hour rant about how much that character sucked but i dont want to become enraged and throw things across my house the next admiral of a fleet of gritty dying soldiers with almost no hope of survival better not be wearing a fing ballgown the real princess leia would have torn her apart some people want to play the she might have thought there was a mole on the ship card but thats the dumbest thing ive ever heard now we move onto the biggest money grab butt reaming worst abuse of a new character ever even worse than darth maul captain phasma phasma was poised to be awesome she looked awesome she sounded awesome she was soooo fing cool looking and both jj and rian kicked her to the curb  what a waste what wasted potential she was probably the only character in the entire new trilogy that could have had her own stand alone movie now no one cares its over rian johnson i hope your happy i really really hope to god you thought you were making a decent movie and you didnt intentionally troll millions of people take that in for a second literally millions the silent and sometimes not so silent majority hated this movie i dont know a single man woman or child that enjoyed the last jedi it was a failure that ive never seen in my 40 years of life from a studio of this stature ive given up there is no redemption for this jj cant save this trilogy i didnt see solo because of tfa and i wont be seeing ep 9 i cant bring myself to do it and it breaks me up inside tfa is the first star wars movie i didnt purchase and i purchased 3 different collector copies of tfa i bought a ton of tfa merchandise but after tlj i was done i cant do it this finally brings us to luke skywalker mark hamill i love you man you were my beacon of hope you were the greatest jedi that ever lived rian did you dirty man the likes of which ive never seen im so sorry for you and your family i honestly sincerely mean that as a father i could not even imagine having your three children see what he did to you after a 40 year legacy the likes of which will never be seen again jake skywalker died on that rock mark not luke
Aug 17 2018,negative,this was worse than the 90s starwars series  i am having a hard time articulating everything that i hated about the movie the only decent characters were benicio del toro and snoke most of the acting was wooden     the general was a pretty poor actor i felt like he was not in his character     the director forced characters onto the film who had no back story and added little to nothing it is hard to feel the purple haired ladys kamikaze when the character is never developed     poe finn and rey were awesome in the first movie now they are single dimensional characters poe wants to fight rey wantslukes help not sure what finn wants in the end they became really boring     the story was pretty lame why exactly did finn pick up this random dude to be the code breaker when he went to las vegas to get a very specific guy leia floating through space was silly why is darth hipster so sensitive why is luke milking that alien why is chewie cooking the furby the humor was terrible    luke was turned into a crotchety old i dont know what there was nothing mystical about the character he was taken out of the center of a film series in a most innoble way even hammill hated his character    i get that space should be more diverse rogue 1 did that and gave an entertaining film this one was terrible it was so terrible i felt the need to write my first review terrible i probably will never write another film review
Aug 17 2018,negative,if you have to explain why your movie is good its bad   rian johnson has been on the defensive ever since the last jedi came out and for good reason many praise johnson for breaking the mold or for upending expectations but there is a basic logic to storytelling and moviemaking i never got good marks for saying that 225 despite any protestations that my teacher did not get it and that i was playing with the formula i still got an f people use forumlae because they work chief among the sins of the last jedi is the absence of any backstory or motivation for snoke we watch him die without ever being told why we should care nor do we see any progression in reys skills she is simply extraordinary was born that way and thats just the way it is we could have a fiveminute movie with that sort of development rey is amazing the end   johnson comes close to some profound statements it is a fascinating idea that light rises to meet the dark and of course viceversa lukes selfimposed exile makes sense in that context he refuses to allow the dark to rise to meet his extraordinary light power to explain the inexplicable rise of the first order it could have risen to meet the rise of the light that may be too generous but it almost works it almost works until the moment luke goes against his newfound middleroad ethos and engages kylo ren in a skype battle and perishes for his telework trouble anyway johnson also comes close to a certain point of view storytelling with lukes nearmurder of kyloben but it falls flat   johnson again violates his own ethical thesis when rose saves finn we have been shown that selfsacrifice is useful and necessary only to see a badlydeveloped romantic interest attempt to kill the guy whos trying to make a difference for good speechify kiss him and then pass out   speaking of finn his character development is nonexistent he made a choice to leave the first order almost deserted but found his courage in the first movie only to go back to his deserting ways at the beginning of the second movie and the one who catches him whose sister has just died for the cause somehow falls in love with him after a jaunt on one of the most infamouslybad sidemissions in all of cinema history   and then theres space leia rolls eyes   there are some good elements but the awful elements of the movie vastly overpower those few interesting scenes i feel i have to add my objective comments to help overcome the senseless encomia coming from the professional critics there is a major disconnect between those who are paid to review this movie and the people who paid to watch it i trust that history will help put this movie in perspective as an extremely flawed untethered bit of shlock
Aug 17 2018,negative,like many others i was beyond thrilled to watch this movie but like many others was truly saddened and disappointing i was truly invested in these new characters and all of their stories fell so flat what is there to hope for in ix a lifelong sw fan who has loved every other sw movie in its own way now crushed by tlj didnt even watch the solo movie please please fix sw disney
Aug 17 2018,negative,feminism in star wars crap i guess iv will still be the best nothing to see here
Aug 17 2018,negative,visually and cinematographically sure its great honestly disney can throw as much money as they want at a movie but without an original story significant character developmentgoals and being true to everything in the series before it it will never recapture any of the original charm of episodes 46
Aug 17 2018,negative,what did they do to star wars this movie belongs in a galaxy far far away
Aug 17 2018,negative,a disgrace to the star wars name
Aug 16 2018,negative,just awful this movie killed my love of star wars i dont care about future movies anymore
Aug 16 2018,positive,entertaining but not as good as the first in this trilogy  there is an entire scene that could have been omitted
Aug 16 2018,negative,an insult to the franchise  after such a disappointment star wars episode ix may be the first star wars movie ill skip in theatres
Aug 16 2018,negative,this show kill the stars war we knew
Aug 16 2018,negative,egregious plot holes poor story and embarrassing changes to luke skywalker easily the worst star wars film to date and solo was average at best 
Aug 16 2018,negative,the worst star wars and one of the worst movie of all time plot twists destroying the lore at each scene somebody please fire whoever is responsible of this mess
Aug 16 2018,negative,the worst star wars movie ever its almost impossible to produce a worse star wars movie
Aug 15 2018,negative,trash movie the worts of star wars series
Aug 15 2018,positive,it was more original and interesting than force awakens but had parts that were boring and seem unnecessary the casino planet but mark hamill is a complete badass as luke and the porgs arent nearly as annoying as you thought they would be
Aug 15 2018,negative,shiny but lacks substance
Aug 15 2018,positive,as good as the original trilogy
Aug 15 2018,negative,this movie made me more excited for season 7 of the clone wars than the final chapter of the skywalker saga 
Aug 15 2018,negative,just plain awful long stupid and full with political correctness worst movie of all the saga
Aug 15 2018,positive,i really loved this movie i was always a fan and i completely understand why people would hate this movie but it do things so differently compared the other films in the franchise it gave luke some character i wish they did bring up plot points from episode 7 but whatever this movie just hit the right notes for me but like i said can fully understand why others would hate it
Aug 15 2018,negative,rey is from a desert planet  she has never seen a pool of water before  rey can also swim perfectly    mary  sue
Aug 15 2018,negative,horrible only disney could ruin one of the most beloved franchises ever it also shows how much power disney has that the critics were terrified to truthfully critique this film and give it the low rankings it deserves i hate it
Aug 15 2018,positive,a wonderfully nuanced star wars story filled with action drama emotion and conflict i loved it
Aug 15 2018,negative,this movie was worst that the precuels please dont do any more star wars movies you are ruin one of the greatest histories of all time
Aug 15 2018,negative,this is not the movie you are looking for  rian johnson tried to do something different but in doing so completely missed the mark as well as jj abrams but not as severely on what a final trilogy in the story of the skywalker saga is supposed to be the first trilogy was a poor muddled attempt to explain the rise of the empire and the rise of darth vader the original trilogy was the story of his son overcoming the darkness and the empire great fodder of source material but to hold true to the entire arc the first trilogy raised the idea of balance to the force between the first trilogy and original trilogy nearly all jedi are dead as well as sith thats balance right so while force awakens eludes to an explosion of force users in the galaxy that was not the story now in last jedi we dont have a skywalker to continue we have kylo daughter of leia but force awakens isnt from his pov he isnt the protagonist or even an anti hero instead lets forget that this is supposed to be a connected saga and tell a completely different story that is the single issue here and why so many fans felt like they got the middle finger throw in the additional wonky element of theres still a rebel allianceand inside that is another resistancewhich doesnt make sense on the level of simplistic archetypes from which the original trilogy pulled from joseph campbells archives thats another detailing of the first trilogy as well and there isnt an empire but they have alli the old toys that theyve updated slightly as far as original material force awakens is a half hearted attempt this leads to last jedi where rian basically didnt want to be connected to anything and the obvious reason was that he didnt understand the material well enough add to that some crazy decisions to show leahs awakening of the force in a ridiculous mary poppins magical momentits called foreshadowingthe audience needed to see her force push something or have greater force sensing abilities than where we left off in the original trilogy instead of bam shes now magic thats not how the force works the other major drawback to this film is that it is too self aware people talk to leah as if shes this great matriarch that theyve all been on adventures with no one had any other opinion of her from within the story other than nostalgic grandeur if we had started this journey with the first trilogy instead of the original and it had taken 40 years in between then sir alec guinness would have revenge this kind of treatment which makes no sense in the confines of the actual story that is the biggest middle finger in all of this is that it winks and nods to the fans with a sledgehammer and then in the next breath tells exertions to go f themselves because the finale to a saga is not what youre going to get who cares if youve been told thats what youre going to get and that youve set a lifetime of expectation for as far as a standalone movie with no history behind itits still very ridiculous and offers no coherent understanding of why people have magic space powers or why the main bad guys are ridiculous parodies of anyone worth inciting fear abroad the galaxy or engendering respect to a single cause in short bad acting bad story and disconnected from itself
Aug 14 2018,negative,the subplots were pointless what was the point of the casino scene the main plot was boring i mean really the main story is that theyre going to run out of gas     they also killed off one of their potentially most interesting characters without backstory or reason just seems like it was a really half hearted effort
Aug 14 2018,negative,ugh this film should be erased from the star wars universe starting with that terrible phone call scene to 40 minutes of filler footage of a ship chasing another ship the terrible directing this was easily the worse movie of any of the star wars films it was the equivalent  of any generic scifi moviejust terrible dont bother watching thisplease save yourself the agony
Aug 14 2018,negative,one movie to rule them all one movie to find them one movie to bring them all and in the darkness ruin all previous love for any and all things star wars   this movie is like a lover breaking up with you your left feeling empty longing for what will never be again
Aug 14 2018,negative,absolute terrible movie cant believe how bad this story is written putting all those political issues like this movie needs more female for no reason and animal crualty before a good written story is unbelievable ans still get very mad about what they heve done to luke skywalker this movie could have been epic clearly anyone who likes this movie sees this as a standalone movie cause when you see it in the star wars saga you cannot possibly say they did a great job with this movie
Aug 14 2018,positive,one of the best star wars movies ive seen it rivals empire at this point
Aug 13 2018,negative,there is absolutely no point in viewing this film its depressing and filled with plot holes gonna leave it there cause its pointless to elaborate what i mean
Aug 13 2018,negative,nice visuals but thats about it  a stupid movie
Aug 13 2018,positive,good drama new features added to the mysterious force very good acting of mark hamill the redemption of luke after failing his family still better than seen ewoks defeating the empire or the prequels remembered me when i first saw empire strikes back nostalgia and drama in key moments of the movie
Aug 13 2018,positive,wow this movie has so much disdain towards it
Aug 12 2018,positive,this movie is a cinematic masterpiece and i feel nothing but sorrow for the poor souls who dont see it
Aug 12 2018,negative,the worst movie of the series im done with star wars
Aug 12 2018,negative,utterly disappointing and an overall mess of a script
Aug 12 2018,negative,5  stars for special effectstaking 4 off for the complete crap story and breaking canon
Aug 12 2018,negative,too much humor not many answers to past characters and really brings nothing new
Aug 12 2018,negative,a terrible movie to say the least the last jedi has an intoxicating number of bathos jokes that ruin characters such as hux this movie couldnt decide whether it wanted to benefit from nostalgia or a new star wars style therefore it ended up killing off the nostalgic elements in preparation for the new this absolutely did not feel like a star wars movie
Aug 12 2018,negative,disorganized mess of a movie filled with red herrings poorly written characters weak story and an incoherent bitter ending the movie shouldve been named star wars breaking bad silverlining the actors did their job but theres only so much they can do with a terrible script
Aug 12 2018,negative,this is a piece of crap a story that should be around the saga and continuation of the skywalker family ruined by a pathetic excuse of director do i advice to watch this movie  no not even if you are a hardcore fan dont even touch the merchendise is just a poor excuse for a film the same way ea made a poor excuse of a star wars game not worth the effort  director doesnt even deserve to have his movies watched its because of him this saga will be dead
Aug 12 2018,negative,so much done wrong so many wasted opportunities the director never watched a star wars film and clearly didnt even watch the force awakens
Aug 12 2018,negative,really bad missed potential
Aug 12 2018,neutral,meh stupid in some parts 
Aug 12 2018,negative,good movie but not a good star wars movie
Aug 12 2018,negative,terrible movie  ruined star wars
Aug 11 2018,negative,what an awful piece of hot steaming garbage this is definitely the worst star wars movie ever made filled with so many plots holes and terrible humor that made me beg for jar jar binks to come on screen so i didnt have to hear anymore of their humor this movie also is again very similar to the empire strikes back and the entire thing on canto bight was just a waste of time but the worst thing about this movie is how much it destroys the characters from the original trilogy the only things in this movie that i liked was the planet crait as it is creative and the designs for the crait speeders and resistance bombers even though it is an impractical design but other than that this is a terrible movie
Aug 11 2018,positive,i big star wars fan really enjoyed this movie  rian johnson made star wars new and fresh again  i think the movie is that great because you cant foresee the plot twistif youre a real star wars fan you will have fun watching it
Aug 11 2018,negative,rock and roll is dead so is the logic
Aug 11 2018,negative,car crash of a movie  character development was appalling there wasnt a single likable or interesting character  the story was shocking and super leia was atrocious
Aug 10 2018,positive,the last jedi is bold and takes risks similar to the prequel trilogy and like the prequel trilogy the results are mixed at best as great as the force awakens was it probably did the last jedi a disservice in that tfa felt too familiar and safe the version of luke skywalker  that we see in this movie feels necessary but ultimately unsatisfying my problem with many of the twists and turns in this movie is not that tlj sought to give the audience something different but rather the twists felt underwhelming the movie is saved by the compelling complex relationship between rey and kylo ren the adorable porgs and an amazing innovative use of light speed in terms of taking a detour from familiar roads here is hoping that the next film falls somewhere in between the force awakens and the last jedi
Aug 10 2018,negative,this disjointed mess of a story could ultimately be franchise killing now that the fans including myself are waking up from a nastalga based stupor and are seeing through the eye candy i couldnt disagree with the critic consensus more i would say that the last jedi dishonors the sagas rich legacy in a reckless attempt at creating a new narrative  and delivers a bipolar manic story that cant even keep up with itself an awful edition full of plot holes bad jokes and wasted potential
Aug 10 2018,negative,i give it one full star for the good visuals and decent sound design it had a few good moments but as a whole it was a narrative mess that completely st on the story of star wars the last jedi doubled down on the force awakenss faults ignored or corrupted some of its plot points and generally flipped the middle finger to the legacy of the original trilogy what they did to luke skywalker is pretty much unforgivable any hope rey had of becoming a good character was dashed and finn and poe were effectively wasted and the new character rose is worse than jar jar as far as i am concerned    the one light of hope was a plot point connecting kylo and rey but it is totally wasted and ruined by the end but hey at least we got to see luke slap rey with a grass reed    this movie broke star wars
Aug 10 2018,negative,this movie is bad just bad and i feel betrayed honestly because they took a franchise that i loved as a kid and turned it into this mess damn you rita johnson  disney for destroying the world that was star wars i just want to see a jedi with a damn light saber i didnt think itd be that hard to ask for but instead we get these story lines that have no meaning to the main characters look all im saying is i couldve made a better story or you or your nerd cousin anything wouldve been better than this mess
Aug 10 2018,negative,awful film the direction of the film ruined the massive budget and great graphics
Aug 10 2018,negative,a disaster of a movie they completely ignored not only the character development from the original star wars films cut also the continuity from the force awakens they ruined there characters and luke skywalker i dont know what kind of an idiot you have to be to fail this bad at making a film from a series this popular not even the prequels are bad if you like star wars of are incapable of just shutting your brain off then dont watch this terrible movie
Aug 10 2018,positive,this movie was okay but the last battle luke vs kylo was extremely underwhelming
Aug 10 2018,negative,this is actually the first star wars movie that made me feel like never want to watch it again after leaving the cinema terrible terrible plot filled with nonsenses that defy your intelligence maybe thats what star wars has developed into but that is not good not good at all
Aug 10 2018,negative,spat in the face of fans of the series
Aug 10 2018,negative,worst star wars of all terrible plot script ruins impressive cinematics and soundtrack and yes worse than episode i with jar jar binks
Aug 9 2018,negative,the beautiful cinematography and better character moments barely makes it worth the watch
Aug 9 2018,negative,the star wars universe is broken 
Aug 9 2018,negative,a complete mess of a story with massive plot holes and silly dialogue outstanding special effects and above average acting but if you dont have a decent story that makes sense whats the point no no no
Aug 9 2018,negative,1 star for the great cinematic graphics and camera work experience but everything else was just awful just bad story random actions just thrown around just for the hope of a shock experience a thesis can be written on why this movie was bad rotten tomato rating is ridiculous 90reallyi wonder who was paid for this just makes you wonder if anyone can use this site and trust it
Aug 9 2018,negative,context i am 34 years old up until very recently i had never seen any of the star wars films i had of course been exposed to the epic quotesscenesmemesetc but i had not watched the movies until a weekend star wars binge fest based on a coworkerrabid fans recommendation i watched them in this order rogue 4 5 1 2 3 6 7 8  to this outsider looking in the last jedi can be summed up in one word why     rian needing zero personalcharacter growth why    general hux turning into a pair of clown shoes why    casino  space horse scene why    holdo using the time honored military command strategy of not telling your subordinates your plans until the very last moment inciting mutiny why    apparently the jump to hyperspace can destroy ships why    rose every moment of rose why    space bombers why    leia is spaceproof why    the jarring moments of idiocracy ow my balls humor why    taking the indomitable luke skywalker that honestly gave me goosebumps as he faces vader in that silhouette poster shot in empire strikes back and making him into some emo old man that cant stop feeling sorry for himself for most of the movie why god why  im not an entrenched hardcore fanboy so if disney wants to take the star wars franchise in a new direction power to youbut could that direction 1 make sense and 2 not be run by a group of people that apparently hate star wars  the red sand planet was pretty cool though 15 stars
Aug 9 2018,negative,so so so many droped plot points wasted characters and things that make little to no sence not just in the context of the star wars universe but in the context of the last movie really makes me sad to see the death spiral i went in with excitement having liked the force awakens but this movies avts more like a poorly executed fan fic than a star wars movie
Aug 9 2018,positive,one fairly obvious plot weirdness the amazing effectiveness of lightspeed as a weapon prevents it from getting a full score but it was an enjoyable and unpredictable view refreshing after 4 episodes the prequels and the force awakens to a lesser degree that had very little to offer in terms of plot
Aug 8 2018,negative,its very dull story and tons of plot holes with the addition of slamming jjs vision the last jedi offers nothing but distraught fans and fans that are blinded by its visuals and corny dialogue
Aug 8 2018,positive,i love this movie  it has action and surprises at every turn also the characters in this film are so complex and interesting well done would definitely recommend it
Aug 8 2018,negative,i wish they would just stop making star wars movies now theres nothing interesting about them bad forgettable characters and no story the critics sure seem to love this one though i wonder how much disney paid them ill rate this 5 stars for 50 dollars
Aug 8 2018,positive,cool visual effects good action sequences and a tenseunique albeit a bit slow plot
Aug 8 2018,negative,what an absolute train wreck i hope the star wars postquels can be rebooted and rewritten this movie was awful
Aug 8 2018,negative,absolutely terrible addition to the star wars universe i loved star wars until this movie
Aug 8 2018,negative,do i need to say why this movie sucks no anyone with even the tiniest little bit of  working brain and the minimal capability to think critically would know that this movie is one of the worst in this century
Aug 8 2018,positive,in many ways a remake of episode v however there are enough twists to keep the film interesting and the performances of ridley and driver make for some incredible scenes sadly too much of the film is weighed down by the dull plot assigned to boyega
Aug 7 2018,positive,watch it a second time this is a masterpiece
Aug 7 2018,positive,despite modern marvel humor and social commentary throwing me off a couple of times star wars the last jedi is still a very enjoyable star wars movie with great performances breathtaking cinematography and amazing visual sequences  even though me and many others arent 100 satisfied with luke skywalkers arc in this there is no denying every scene with him is gripping emotional and amazing this might be hamills best performance in a live action movie cried at his final scene in theater which grants it an extra half star
Aug 7 2018,positive,you failed your highness i am a jedi like my father before me    when i was a boy watching return of the jedi on vhs i began to realize i was watching something more than just a grand spectacle with action and adventure  by the end of that film luke skywalker saves the day not by blowing something up or wielding a light sabre instead he throws his sword away and sacrifices himself he does something that most cinematic heroes do not do he forgoes violence and puts his faith in the humanity found in the destructive and corrupt monster he was meant to slay learning that the entertaining action film i was watching was also a story of forgiveness and redemption left a mark on me at a young age i believe it is why my love of the star wars films endured into my adulthood    in the last jedi rian johnson also succeeds in his attempt to create a movie that was more than just an adolescent spectacle he does give us a film with desperate space battles wondrous creatures and emotional duels with laser swords however he also takes the time to create an unexpected journey for each of the main characters in this film the reckless hotshot doesnt get to be the hero with a foolhardy act of youthful bravado that ignores the costs of war the harddriven general who has always been the strongest soldier no matter what the cruel galaxy takes from her finally feels the burden of all she has lost the survivalist learns why he must sacrifice and in this saga the villain and the hero are left with no clear quest or mentors to guide them     the film ends with luke skywalker saving the day in a unique and unexpected twist that upon reflection is very familiar  like in return of the jedi he does not use his laser sword or grab or push something with the force but instead through an act of sacrifice and faith he inspires a new galaxy of heroes and redeems himself    the last jedi did not go the way i thought  it was a more complicated daring and complete film and it will hopefully leave a mark on young fans for a lifetime
Aug 6 2018,negative,by far the worst movie of the star wars saga the movie is long but fails to spend that time wisely instead it attempts to accomplish too much through attempting to tell three disjointed plots all of which meet the protagonist with failure that never allow characters to develop rian johnson completely abandons what made star wars such an interesting and beloved franchise that spans over four decades
Aug 6 2018,positive,a daring movie whos bold moments definitely pay off in what id say is the most fulfilling star wars movie since empire strikes back
Aug 6 2018,positive,this is  one of the greatest movie i have ever seen i like the story the actorsactresses the cgi technique i can watch it again and again and i still dont get bored i can only recommend this movie congratulations to rian johnson
Aug 5 2018,neutral,i know its star wars and i adore most of the movies with prequels being alright but this one i can understand why most did not agree with star wars the last jedi was an anticipated film i enjoyed but left with a very unsatisfied look from its story the cast was great rey i felt was fine luke skywalker was alright but this film just leaves us with questions thats all the film massively of suffered from its plot holes and subplots it gave and it did answer some questions but not quite elaborated by far the film look beautiful by its outstanding visuals and cgi the actionbattle scenes looked great and the film held a great score once again the cinematography looked fantastic though there are scenes i felt were so unnecessary especially with the casino part which didnt help much some of the characters i felt like they werent really there to live up at all like rose and there are monents where it can leave so much in question but most of all the film wastes it characters in such a way that i felt was terrible jokes were sometimes landed but not much at all and the ending was not surprising at all overall i thought it was alright it was entertaining by its duration visuals cgi was outstanding action scenes were well shot and choreographed and i will only say for fans the film just manages to leave with so much to question 
Aug 5 2018,negative,this movie should have been good coming off of the force awakens but it wasnt the majority of the cast was relegated to pointless plot killing antics that did nothing but make me hate them while in the main story the one that should have been focused on some homeless man dressed up as mark hamill ruined the legacy of luke skywalker one of the greatest science fiction icons of all time at least the effects looked good despite apparently nobody near this movie even remotely understanding how physics works it is more like a sequel to spaceballs than a star wars movie
Aug 5 2018,negative,johnson was so busy being postpostmodern that he forgot to write a story the rebels ride a white ford bronco down the freeway the whole fans take themselves too seriously goes for film school grads too rian it doesnt have plot holes it has a plot mesh
Aug 5 2018,negative,too many plotholes and the humor felt so out of place logic is just not a thing in tlj   do spaceships slow down when they run out of fuel   the whole fin and rose story was so pointless and destroying enemy ships using light speed is a thing now what a mess
Aug 5 2018,negative,it is an average movie but an awful star wars movie it doesnt really resemble sw and makes no sense it was my worst experience in cinema yet and i saw resident evil final chapter there prior to seeing this so you know its not very good especially if youre a sw fan
Aug 4 2018,negative,excessive social commentary weak subplots lazy writings cringy jokes etc while the last jedi had its moments it ultimately proved that you cannot create a film based solely on subverting expectations and watered down nostalgia
Aug 4 2018,neutral,the last jedi introduces some interesting concepts into the storied franchise but ultimately struggles to find a cohesive compelling vision the movie attempts to subvert audience expectation and create a new direction for the universe but i couldnt help but feel disappointed by the lackluster jarring twists and turns the movie constantly takes
Aug 4 2018,positive,the last jedi is not better than its precessor but delivers  an ambicious movie for this great franchise
Aug 4 2018,negative,episode 7 was the massive downfall of this franchise but 8 did it in  there is nothing left for us to be interested in another sequel  i honestly wish disneylucasfilm completely reboot this sequel trilogy
Aug 4 2018,negative,literally the worst star wars movie ever the film actually breaks the sw universe in more ways than one it kills lukes inner character in the first minute you see him on screen finn is probably the most underused and rey is so over powered is just dumb
Aug 4 2018,negative,while the last jedi encompasses some great visuals and action sequences its overall plot character development and general tone fall short  with a disregard for many of the ideas set forth by abrams in the force awakens this films attempts to set up the end up of the skywalker saga in a way that seems almost disconnected from the rest of the franchise  interspersed with unnecessary comedic moments in what superficially appears to be a darker film the last jedi lacks a distinctive voice and has rampant issues with pacing  a viewing is recommended albeit this movie does strike a sour cord in what started out as a promising new trilogy by disney and lucasfilm
Aug 4 2018,negative,the most disappointing starwars movie ive ever seen left depressed for the future of this beloved saga
Aug 4 2018,negative,very boring   let us begin on a merry note unequivocally justifying the decision to bring star wars to skellig michael that outcrops performance outclasses those by many other more metaphorical piles of inexpressive stone in this oftenunderwhelming eighth episode it is all over the film so you need prepare no terrible puns for complaints to the irish
Aug 4 2018,negative,the movie had some cool visuals but overall it ruined so much of the franchise with stuff that made no sense the plot holes still bother me on a daily basis  if destroying an enemy ship just took jumping to light speed to destroy it then why are there even any star wars movies and why even waste time building giant ships how did rey learn to fight with a lightsaber without practice everything about holdo finns and roses entire plot the complete waste of a character snoke was etcits like whoever wrote the script didnt see the previous movie or have any idea what star wars was
Aug 4 2018,negative,so much pressure and forcing the transfer of the force to new actors making it disingenuous and quite frankly sad you cant recreate the magic without first believing it political correctness run amuck 
Aug 3 2018,negative,plot wise the worst star wars movie ive seen does a disservice to the series cgi was ok
Aug 3 2018,negative,this movie is a pile of human waste every critic who touted this as an amazing film should have their credentials revoked and should be fired
Aug 3 2018,negative,if you like this movie i question your motivation
Aug 3 2018,negative,im not sure the creators of this movie have actually seen the other movies
Aug 3 2018,negative,i thought star wars attack of the clones was a bad film this film is awful this film has destroyed star wars dont not watch this film
Aug 3 2018,negative,last jedi has a boring stupid plot a pointless subplot and many many other flaws but even worse than the movie was critics bizarrely high ratings they should be ashamed of themselves
Aug 3 2018,negative,the main problem in this film is it almost completely ignores what the force awakens was setting up reys parentage snoke as an interesting villain the knights of ren the friendship of the three new main characters rey finding answers or training there were enjoyable moments but they were spoiled by the bad taste in your mouth with how they missed obvious opportunities or flat out crapped on them
Aug 3 2018,negative,filled with many plot holes and inconsistent character traits e this movie falls short to its predecessors
Aug 3 2018,negative,its just awful rose and finns romance doesnt work and rian johnsons directing skills in this movie is just watching a shyamalan film the thing that george lucas invented was destroyed in every way
Aug 3 2018,negative,half a star for no jarjar  otherwise please please for all that is holy let this franchise just die already  horrible stupid boring pointless meandering nonfocused waste of three hours
Aug 3 2018,negative,i love everything star wars that said i am super disappointed this scriptstory board was approved it really felt like a 25 hour slow chase the main antagonists were reduced to punch lines of punkd jokes i get the need for a few cheeky laughs but it felt like the cheesy giggle spots were more thought out than the main plot direction   pleasedont get me wrongif you enjoyed tlj im happy for you i wish i liked it i just felt let down by the writing and script there were some amazing moments and visualsbut i just couldnt stop asking s about some big plot points biggest disappointment the total degradation or serious weight to the bad guys they all feel like a cheesy punch line now wasted snokewasted phasma   bummer
Aug 3 2018,negative,spoilers ahead i cant believe how incompetent was the scrip the casino story line is pure thrush the characters are blend the jokes are completely out of line and the story as a hole doesnt make any sense from my part im done with star wars and this one was the worst of the entire saga
Aug 3 2018,negative,wow i really didnt know how to feel about this movie when it ended it was just nothing and that feeling sums up this movie  its nothing    i was lucky enough to grow up watching the ot and i was young when the prequels came out and i loved all those movies i wont pretend that they are perfect films by any stretch  but lucas had a vision and for the most part delivered a masterful 6 movie story after watching revenge of the sith  return of the jedi became so much better vaders story arc is one of the best redemption stories in cinematic history  and now we have this    i loved the fa i thought the new characters that were introduced were great  especially the dynamic between finn and poe  which rian johnson decided to not explore at all in this film in favour of adding a new and irritating character in rose rey was ok as everyone has said massively op but if you put her life into context its not unreasonable to believe she can look after herself han solo was used well and his death by kylos hand made kylo a fascinating villain  all of these plot points were set up and none were explored in this film at all tlj didnt fulfill the role as a sequel  surely that was point one on the list of things this film had to do    from the word go the movie was wrong  how has the first order gained control they just had their massive planet sized base destroyed about an hour before this film starts would it not have made more sense to start the film months after  at which point that sentence is could make sense but no  because rian wanted a cheap laugh when luke throws his saber away wow    i wont rant as this review would become a book about all the things wrong in this movie but to name a few  leia flying through space despite never displaying any real force powers  light speed being used as weapon fuel in spaceships why the resistance terrible name and back story didnt make sense  but thats fas fault suddenly become the rebels  lukes character  snokes character  kylo and reys underdevelopment  finn and roses useless side plot  poe being sidelined for the majority of the movie i have no issue with new characters and holdo could have been great but her purpose was to keep poe out of action  its just bad writing and character development makes me miss anakin talking about sand      the biggest failure of this film is that it didnt follow up on the fa set up and then it doesnt set anything up for episode 9 the fa left us with so many questions and people wanted to see the next movie  but tlj sets up nothing han is dead luke is dead and the new characters have gone no where ive loved star wars for as long as i can remember and this movie has left me so disappointed the moments that are good do not outweigh the horror show that is this movie i wont be watching episode 9 such a shame
Aug 2 2018,negative,i didnt think it needed all of the humor
Aug 2 2018,positive,the best star wars perhaps ever except maybe the empire strikes back
Aug 2 2018,positive,it was a great addition to the star wars saga but definitely not without its flaws the film drags some in the middle but also has some of the most spectacular scenes in the star wars franchise the throne room fight scene and kamikaze left me speechless in the theater the continuation of rays growth as a character and the relationship between her and ben was definitely the strongest part of the film and probably the best character development show in the franchise i did not mind the change that was made to luke while i understand it is hard to see your childhood heros fall it was a grounded tale no one is perfect and everyone has done things in their life they regret if anything it follows the trend set in the skywalker legacy and builds on his possible turn to the dark side in return of the jedi i do agree however that the casino subplot could have been removed it added nothing and the admiral not revealing her plan was dumb but to anyone who said it was worse than the prequels it just simply is not true to all of those who hated it i recommend a second viewing your opinion of it might change watching it for what it is and not what you expected it to be
Aug 2 2018,negative,terrible horrible boring star wars destroyer
Aug 2 2018,positive,kylo ren is the best character makes the sequels worth it 
Aug 2 2018,negative,lazy excuse for a movie dont waste youre time watching this trash cant name any positives
Aug 1 2018,negative,what a hot piece of garbage they ruined luke skywalkers character disney had the keys to the sports car with this franchise and they completely blew it
Aug 1 2018,positive,not a traditional star wars saga episode but one that brings the feels i throughly enjoyed every minute of episode 8 and i wouldnt change anything about it
Aug 1 2018,positive,the 8th  installment of the star wars sagaexcluding rogue one the clone wars movie the ewok movies  the holiday special showed a different perspective from its predecessors great new additions from an already great cast great writing and directing from rian johnson and his cowriters and a perfect farewell to the amazing carrie fishereven though unused shots of leia will be used in episode 9the plot took an unexpected and dark turnwhich did upset many fans but the unorthodox turn was necessary even if many people thought it was not most critics actually thought the movie was really good but most fans hated it my own opinion i have to side with the critics this was a really good film
Aug 1 2018,negative,far and away the worst star wars movie     bad storytelling plot holes
Aug 1 2018,positive,although a top tier cgi powerhouse and fitted with a castcrew that gets the job done this movie falls flat the plot is designed weirdly under certain circumstances and is just too unrealistic at some parts still a generally interesting movie thats hard to stop watching
Aug 1 2018,negative,this movie effectively cripples the star wars universe
Aug 1 2018,negative,ii dont have words for this movie i enjoyed the force awakens but this movie has destroyed all interests in seeing how this trilogy ends i would be perfectly happy if the 3rd movie starts with luke opening his eyes and says that was horrible i need to train this rey person as if it was all a future premonition that he had   loved rogue one solo was the best o fthe new movies but the last jedi as so many plot holes total lack and respect for characters story progression out of place comedy just no on almost every level   that being said this movie is a visual delight beautiful to look at  i hope j j can turn this dumpster fire around
Aug 1 2018,negative,did not like the movie  disney is destroying the star wars franchise  there were so many great oppurtunities they could have went with like ray being lukes kid but now it looks like their going to make her hons kid and half sister to ren  oh wait a repeat again of the original  then they killed off the villan and put ren in as a brat who is now the leader  lets not forget the cowad and looser they turned luke into who is suppose to be the most powerful jedi of all time  yoda was a joke  its like they are trying to kill off star wars and push their agenda  loved lucas movies  the spin off movies are the better then the main story line movies  oh and how did luke or anakin make peace for a 1000 years if they kill them off  cgi carry fisher  in the next movie i guess  terrible movie  was not looking forward to this movie nor will i be looking forward to the next movie  did not watch hons in theatre and prob wont care to watch anymore disney starwars in theatre  cant remember since i was a kid when i didnt want to see star wars in theatre or was disinterested in it  star wars has now followed star trek in loosing a childhood life long fan thanks disney
Aug 1 2018,positive,thank you rian for directing my new favorite movie id have to write an essay about all the reasons why this movie was perfection rememberthe force is greater than all of us may it be with you
Aug 1 2018,negative,just not good its long boring every scene transitions terribly and it feels like it doesnt know what it wants to do just not a good film im just supprised so many people like it unless your a hardcore fan do not watch
Jul 31 2018,negative,except for good visuals this movie is bad in virtually all aspects the story is not exciting all of the new characters are either dull or not pleasant better existing characters are needlessly killed off left and right half of those who are not killed off are acting entirely out of character there is a relative lack of action compared to past films in the series there were no light saber fights and the kinds of twists the film offers left me disappointed rather than pleased    its like the carrot on a stick thing they keep leading up to some awesome battle hoping youll follow but whenever i thought we were about to see something good they wanted to throw a twist in there so all you get is more disappointment needless to say you never get that carrot    i advise you to skip this movie and skip episode 9 this film has destroyed the trilogy beyond any hope of salvation you should also skip the next trilogy entirely because it will have the same writer as this film actually it may be best to just stay away from star wars in general for the next several years with no hope whatsoever of anything decent on the horizon
Jul 31 2018,negative,the visuals and sound were good but everything else was blatantly insulting to any fan of star wars or to any intelligent person for that matter
Jul 31 2018,negative,just bad doesnt take rocket science to know why just look up some videos for why it is bad walked out of the move satisfied then having time to think about it in my own time i have come to a realization that it is garbage
Jul 31 2018,positive,the last jedi contained some good things and some not so good things when i think about something i loved i think about something i hated im stuck in the middle it was an okay movie
Jul 31 2018,negative,character development is horrible had enough of mary sue rey      the movie embarrasses womens dignity and the movie is significantly a cash grab
Jul 31 2018,negative,great movie visually but the plot was frustrating nonsensical and riddled with holes
Jul 31 2018,negative,i no longer care about any of the characters or where the sequel trilogy goes
Jul 30 2018,positive,this was actually really funny which i wasnt expecting
Jul 30 2018,positive,gave star wars fans the kick in the pants they deserved time to let the past die  fantastic story drama and character development
Jul 30 2018,positive,personally i thought this movie was decent at best it was mostly pretty good but it admittedly had its questionable moments for example the whole mutiny idea with poe was a bit too much in my opinion along with the canto bight section however the visuals and acting are great the action is overall done very well and the characters are developed nicely so in the end i dont see eye to eye with those that claim that the last jedi is a horrible movie i just hope more people can see the good side of it
Jul 30 2018,negative,a truly awful movie and a discrace to the originals
Jul 30 2018,negative,the rose and finn story shouldve been left out
Jul 30 2018,positive,the first film in this new trilogy to elevate it to a higher level with darker themes surprising evolutions and memorable action
Jul 30 2018,positive,luke skywalker should of been the main character
Jul 29 2018,negative,a very boring movie no characters are developed rey continues to be amazingly skilled at everything with no effort or explanation the light saber moves were embarrassing they looked like 5yearolds flailing around the comedy was not funny and ruined the drama all of the character motivations made no sense it was just bad it looked pretty but thats all that it did well
Jul 29 2018,negative,bad movie it would be awful even if it wasnt a star wars movie really bad directed
Jul 29 2018,positive,bravo to taking chances popular or not to take the mighty franchise that is star wars kicking and screaming into new territory while it is obvious some of the alterations were meant to serve the long term goals of the movie business there is more than enough here to  intrigue new audiences and keep the long time fan going   my favorite personal insight suspicion or feeling is that luke was not so much snuffed out as ascended destined to play an even bigger part in the fate of the rebellion  we will see
Jul 29 2018,neutral,as a saturday night fun popcorn movie this film was enjoyable in that aspect but as a star wars movie and second part of a trilogy it failed miserably too many holes and inconsistancies in the story the movie also didnt know if it wanted to be a sequel or a stand alone movie resulting in the story being a total mess a very low point for the franchise
Jul 29 2018,positive,it was awesome acting was great plenty of actionetc best star wars movie i have ever seen
Jul 29 2018,negative,the worst star wars entry excluding the prequels  weirdly paced underwhelming visuals too many characters to focus on boring subplots poorly executed comedy and a ridiculous amount of deus ex machina  the only thing this movie did well was its execution of kylo rens story  210
Jul 29 2018,positive,i really enjoyed tlj i loved the nostalgic feeling when luke enters the falcons cockpit as well as his interaction with r2 i also enjoyed the new ways they took the story i think a big reason i liked the movie is because i went in not wanting or expecting anything the new trilogy will never be the original trilogy and thats ok
Jul 29 2018,negative,cant consider this a star wars movie so i cant call it the worst one ever just a bad movie 
Jul 28 2018,negative,i gave this film a shot it was unfortunate that they gave a guy like rian johnson so much creative power in the middle of a 9 episode story arc  its also unfortunate that jj setup excitement and expectations only to have rian actually write something to diffuse any kind of excitement and expectations i have never hated a film as much as i hate this one it was so bad calling it crap isnt enough
Jul 28 2018,negative,worst star wars movie by far almost ruins the entire series made me appreciate the prequels because i didnt know a star wars movie could be this bad
Jul 28 2018,negative,im happy that they have women in leading roles the movie is just so incredibly awful its like it was written by an alien that has no idea what motivates peoples actions luke is a crazy old man who wants to kill his nephew in his sleep over a feeling one star because the movie looks ok everything else is a waste of time
Jul 28 2018,negative,there were things i enjoyed about this movie i know there were but im so hard pressed to remember them  the bulk of the runtime is manufactured drama and plot holes which would make one think of it as the perfect sequel to the force awakens but the two movies are painfully terrible in different directions in a manner that would be comically bad if all of the wasted potential wasnt so tragic  changing directors midway thru an arc doesnt seem like the way to go
Jul 28 2018,negative,it was horrible because it was star wars it was even worse zero strategic or tactical reality the universe was clearly shaped around intended character development with no effort to have the characters fit into a 40 year old fantasy universe
Jul 28 2018,negative,my expectations were high i decided to put them low to be surprised and it did surprised me  in a very negative way
Jul 28 2018,negative,the story did not make any sense whatsoever i guess anyone can wake up one morning and be an instant invincible jedi i guess the big build up was for nothing   
Jul 28 2018,negative,this film is inconsistent with the story line from the force awakens which set up a number of story arcs that are simply dumped in the last jedi  everything the audience was looking forward to being explained at the end of the force awakens is brushed off  main characters are killed off in boring and meaningless ways new characters have all the charisma of dead slugs  if there is an actual story line to the movie its not apparent in the film  i would rather rewatch the star wars christmas special than sit through tlj again
Jul 28 2018,negative,story sucked mostly a cobbling of random things going on that are mushed into a turd at the end  read articles that show what should have been in this 25 hr waste of time
Jul 28 2018,negative,extremely poor continuation of the series you have to simply wonder if the writerdirector even watched the previous films
Jul 27 2018,negative,2h15minutes of wasted time
Jul 27 2018,negative,this movie was an absolute disaster they took one of the greatest characters in cinema history and made him into a bitter old man absolutley ruined the franchise i thought the force awakens was a really good movie and did what it needed to do to get the franchise back where it should be after the prequel disasters this one just set it back again will not be seeing solo 
Jul 27 2018,negative,the worst star wars movie ever made central premise of slow ship was garbage if the central premise was bad but the rest of the movie was fine it still could have been a reasonable movie  but the rest of the movie isnt fine when its not arranging illogical space battles its besmirching historically beloved characters add a sprinkle of poorly executed slap stick humor and you have a mess fit only for colleges teaching students what not to do in movies
Jul 27 2018,positive,rian johnson did it again dramatic breathtaking and beautiful congrats
Jul 27 2018,negative,this film was so preoccupied in being different and surprising it never realized it was part of a saga and needed a good story luke skywalker is done a disservice and this film has destroyed the fandom so this is not a film i recommend
Jul 27 2018,positive,dont understand why so many dont like this film plenty of action and the story holds up the star wars tradition with new heroes and bad guys there were a couple hokie scenes but overall great movie
Jul 27 2018,positive,the last jedi is by far the most controversial film of the star wars saga and not without good reason rian johnson takes the franchise to new heights pushing the boundaries of what star wars represents granted the risks johnson takes arent always successful but when they work they really work the last jedi is a great film with incredible visuals an allstar cast and a ton of good oldfashioned adventure its not a perfect film by any stretch but overall its an enjoyable film 710
Jul 27 2018,negative,weak characters no pre established cannon for character changes and plot holes that break the star wars universe in a word dont see it if you are a star wars fan of the originals or prequels
Jul 27 2018,negative,without doubt one of the worst films ive ever seen
Jul 27 2018,negative,worst ending possible for a movie in the last 2 billion years and its in surround sound
Jul 27 2018,negative,they ruined the series i will never be able to forget this monstrosity of a movie they took all the source material and threw it into a burn pile its sad to see something i loved be thrown to the ditch like this
Jul 26 2018,negative,boring not interesting
Jul 26 2018,negative,they have destroyed star wars if you havent seen it dont see it save yourself the dissapointment
Jul 26 2018,positive,tlj subverts all of your expectations from tfa in some amazing and sometimes horrifying ways as a star wars fan the choices the director makes with the story seem to tear apart all we thought we knew about the star wars universe most people i have spoken with about this movie hate how luke is portrayed and the sidequest finn and rose go on i understand the sidequest hate because it honestly does not add much to the story at all just so that two of our heroes can be on snokes ship when holdo destroys it and for the benicio del toro twist take that part of this movie out and i would have enjoyed everything or at least make it necessary to the plot the luke storyline and attitude of our titular character hate makes me question if people watched this movie or force awakens luke was our good natured powerful hero at the end of return but in the time since then as portrayed in this movie and tfa he has tried and failed to restart the jedi caused one of his pupils to tun on him by thinking of and trying to kill him he lost everything he had tried to build because of his fear of the dark side growing inside of ben solo and his rush to the conclusion that he must kill ben was the downfall of luke and the jedi he left for the island because he had given up and wanted the jedi order to end he saw the failures of himself and the jedi before the empire as a failed system and wanted those failures to never be repeated again he is a broken man when we see him on the new trilogy all the events and tragedies in his life since return have changed him into the man we see he is reinvigorated by reys faith and yoda showing him a new path the jedis old ways were there downfall luke needed to change the jedi instead of giving into the fear of the darkside that lead to their destruction at the hands of the sith but he let himself fall victim to that fear for the briefest of moments and that made him lose everything now that my luke rant is over i want to appreciate the stunning visuals and the bold additions to known force abilities the director added to the star wars universe just because we have not seen something in the previous 8 star wars movies does not mean it cannot be done i loved all the new and interesting things used in the movie especially when luke uses an astral form to confront kylo that scene blew my mind and after that we see that the effort took a huge toll on luke possibly meaning the reason this ability had not been used before is because of the power concentration and pure skill needed to perform such an act this movie has some wonderful and brilliant moments kylo killing snoke was a huge surprise and even tho we saw snoke die does not mean he is dead forever he could be a reincarnated darth plagues he could be a new force user similar to him in star wars the clone wars darth maul survived being cut in half it is possible snoke who is clearly a more powerful force user could do the same holdos hyperspace jump was incredible that shot had me gaping in my seat in the theater thinking wooooow that was incredible all the leaps and chances taken in this film blew my mind i thouroughly enjoyed the fresh take and expansion of the star wasr universe and would rank this movie behind empire in my favorite and best ranking this movie makes me wonder where jj will take episode 9 oh and on the reys parents being nobodies storyline i have a theory that so far i have not seen anywhere yet snoke told us that he was controlling what kylo could see he controlled kylos visions and he was controlling the link rey and kylo had throughout the film what if bear with me what if snoke created that story as a lie to make rey vulnerable he could have sown that into kylos mind knowing he would tell rey and when she went into the dark pit on the island the darkness showed her herself when she begged to see her parents why would it not show her she is not a skywalker or a kenobi or any other wild theory what of she is an incarnation of the force she was able to use the force rather quickly with no training or prior experience knowing what the force was in tfa she could be like anakin and be a child if the force or it was all deceit and her parents really are force users we dont know i am willing to believe she is a nobody because that plays into the force being everywhere and i would love for that to be the case but for all those that seemingly need her to be a skywalker or something she still can be are you willing to believe a vision shown to kylo by a person like snoke like thats a little far fetched would you believe the emperor if he said your parents were drunks and left you on some random planets doorstep bad comparison but whatever this movie took bold steps and most of them were right in step with the universe this new trilogy is building on do not compare this new trilogy and movie to past ones and how great they were this movie is building on that universe and enhancing it not breaking it down and tossing it out i do not want to see the saem star wars cliches and stories over and over again i want new and bold and interesting this movie gave me that and i love it for it i hope you enjoyed reading my very very veeery long review by and long time star wars fan thank for reading bye
Jul 26 2018,negative,a slow train wreck that never happens leaving one to feel cheated and disappointed the fact the movie works so hard to break the cycle of light vs dark only to revert back to divided lines causes confusion and horrible story writing
Jul 26 2018,negative,this is the first movie where i like the you tube reviews making fun of it more than the movie what a joke
Jul 26 2018,negative,expectations subverted to the absurd
Jul 26 2018,negative,the worst star wars movie ever made the movie makes no sense the characters have no ark and the story line is idiotic absolute waste of time and wont be watching any other star wars movie evr again
Jul 26 2018,negative,abysmal self parodying experience i actually felt like i was on candid camera the whole plot just stands there and pisses on itself the entire time youre waiting for the film to move forward and it never does until far too late in the film and by then its as anticlimactic as one would fear the characters havent moved forward or progressed the whole film feels like silly filler
Jul 26 2018,negative,this movie destroys the force luke and teaches that the best thing we can do is run hide and survive  it might be entertaining to watch the disgust you feel afterwords for everything that has been pointlessly been ruined isnt worth it
Jul 26 2018,negative,completely destroyed establish characters and mythology for no reason and made a travesty of star wars this is not star wars
Jul 26 2018,negative,this film had so much potential  the force awakens gave them plenty to write about original material  delve into rey parents  who soke was  lukes return  fin becoming a leader  on and on   ive been a fan from the begining not a zealot just a simple fan   this movie was poorly made  lazy story telling plot holes every 15 minutes bad jokes no continuity from awakens to this film and no continuity in the film it self the only good thing is the special effects   i wont add this movie to my dvd collection kinda like all those star wars books at the book store that disney ignored  i will ignore this episode  i really wanted to enjoy it
Jul 26 2018,negative,what an abysmal movie  my hype as a star wars fan is absolutely destroyed
Jul 26 2018,negative,such a terrible movie and huge disappointment
Jul 26 2018,negative,everything wrong with that movie has already been said hundreds of times just look around on the web most of the critics are right this movie is just an insult to the fans and a mess in itself in some ways its a copy of episodes v and vi with some absurd twists added to prove that its different but certainly not good unfortunately its so wrong in both ways this should have been yet another space opera calling it star wars was the root of all the hatred it has generated  as a lifelong fan i enjoyed the original trilogy and the prequels despite some criticism because it developed the arc of some of my favorite characters in the spirit of the saga and had so many strong moments now i must admit that except for rogue one which gave me some satisfaction i no longer have faith in this universe and even worse i now feel like i have to stand against it  even if the force awakens was a huge deception to me i agreed with the people who liked it that maybe the last jedi would redeem it the absolute contrary has happened and now here we are i cant even stand to watch either one of these movies and what made me angry then because star wars was still alive soon i will just not mind anymore because it is dead to me the only way to change that would be to erase this new saga and make good movies instead since they make reboots  remakes all the time these days this shouldnt be too difficult
Jul 26 2018,positive,this film is amazing yes
Jul 26 2018,negative,my ultimate star wars movie  in that its the final one ill ever watch terrible i want my 2 12 hours back
Jul 25 2018,positive,in all honesty the issue i have with the over all reaction to the movie not the movie its self is that the angry masses effectively give the original trilogy a pass on every point the complain about this move on by score 45 out of 5 is based more no a simple ideal    if people say this is a 1 out of 5 then new hope is a 1 out of 5 return is a 0  this movie is by no means perfect none of these movies are the canto bright segment is to long and is pointless there are pointless parts to every movie in star wars there are parts of the movie that are not explained as well as they should ya its a middle movie empire has the same issue    i will give this however  1 this is the best example of the use of lightdark in a movie ever  2 its a damn good looking movie  3 no the sword lightsaber play is not bad its actually the 2nd best we have ever gotten and fitting there not suppose to be super polished  4 most of the plotholes that people have are in fact not plot holes there are totally plotholes but no one ever points at them because they are the plot holes that are always in star wars  5 luke is fantastic in this this is the best luke because ya the jedi failed hard luke trying the same thing over again was going to fail
Jul 25 2018,negative,ive been a star wars fan for my entire life watching the first 6 movies again and again since i was a child i absolutely loved rogue one and even thought that the force awakens was passable and saw them in theater right upon release bringing family and friends along i was even willing to overlook the flaws with eas battlefront ii just because it had a star wars plot in it ive spent money on star wars books toys games and movies  and encouraged others to do so as well    but then i saw the last jedi though i entered the theater with incredible excitement hyped to see the resolution of so many mysteries and the return of some of the greatest characters of all time who have been beloved for nearly half a century i exited confused and horrified unable to fully comprehend the lunacy of what i had just seen hoping to awaken from a delirious nightmare     i cannot go into excruciating detail on all the problems with this movie since that would require an entire book ill also try to avoid apoilers my major gripes are these 1 this movie has zero respect for the lore several events in the movie break the established lore of the universe and makes many major events in the other movies ridiculous or stupid eg holdos final action 2 the movie has zero respect for many of its characters particularly luke but even those from the previous ep vii 3 rey is too powerful and never gets any serious training she is more powerful than anakin was after over a decade of training every scene with her just made me roll my eyes at how overpowered she was with absolutely no explanation even if she was also born of the force like anakin the lore still requires her to undergo extensive training maybe if they had hired actual writers instead of using some kind of random word generator they would have heard of suspension of disbelief and worldbuilding 4 the movie is filled with strangely political scenes that nobody wants in an action movie but i cant talk about that or ill risk being censored 5 there is not even respect for continuing from the last movie where are the knights of ren for example i would have loved to see them but that would have added good scenes to the movie and thats apparently not what they were going for 6 the characters on both sides of the fight are constantly doing laughably dumb things that no one except a child could seriously believe seasoned military officers doing and the plot makes no sense whatsoever i dont even need examples for this one just watch the movie preferably as cheaply as possible 7 there are no proper battle scenes there are onesided pseudo battles but no large scale ground or space battles involving large numbers of people where both sides more than a remote chance of winning there are also no lightsaber battles except for one in which nobody uses the force    this movie does have some good parts kylo ren is wellacted and could be really cool if he was in an actual movie instead of a disjointed set of agendadriven ramblings the visual effects and graphics are also a rather pleasant sight though id expect anything costing such an astronomical sum of money to be commendable to some extent some of the humor was amusing as well luke was really cool for the few seconds he was actually allowed to do things that in a sane world his character would actually do     this movie is like if someone saw what happened with mass effect andromeda and thought hey that went well lets do that not only was it incompetently made but it was made that way on purpose for political purposes and when people point that out the company insults them what kind of company lets their employees insult their customers on twitter disney does what kind of company lets their executives say things like we dont need certain demographics of fans well disney let kathleen kennedy say it not only is the movie itself almost impressively bad but the people who made it seem to have done so specifically in order to hurt the fans of the franchise it was clearly made by people who like neither star wars nor its fans and have no interest in making money and i blame the company that lets this continue    i did not see solo and as a result nobody in my family did since i would normally be the one to drag them along i have zero interest in this franchise now and frankly in anything disney does well done disney you managed to make lifelong fans of star wars turn their backs on your entire company  all for the low price of 4 billion
Jul 25 2018,negative,theres not much to say its a weak story with unlikable characters and a loose thread trying its best to tie a bunch of really unrelated plotlines together wide as an ocean deep as a puddle
Jul 25 2018,negative,best looking sw movie ever very well acted awesome score horrible unoriginal story and even worse character treatment it has the tools and the pieces to be a masterpiece but makes the worst and stupidest decisions at every turn a clusterfk of missed opportunities my disappointment cannot be overstated
Jul 25 2018,positive,i honestly cant see why there is so much hate on this one the last jedi is easily the best star wars movie ever not including the new hope maybe my expectations were low because of the force awakens but i dont know the praetorian guard scene on the supremacy is easily one of the most intense scenes ever the climax was also greatly executed also who couldnt love porgs  8510
Jul 25 2018,negative,probably one of the worst film i have watched preposterously awful story paired with poor structures make watching this film simply painful it keeps showing scenes after scenes as if they mean something as if it is a meaningful foreshadowing of some sorts nevertheless in fact they are all meaningless with a bit of exaggeration one could remove 90 of the film and could still get the same experience from it it is simply disgusting how the majority of scenes are actually insignificant and irrelevant to the main story line and the ending
Jul 25 2018,positive,great movie  luke was not what i wanted him to be and not what he should have been  but its still a good story
Jul 25 2018,negative,dumpster fire from beginning to end ruined star wars  the legacy of luke skywalker so many better storyplot lines available than the ones chosen anyone who gave it a positive review is a hack critic  not a true star wars fan
Jul 24 2018,negative,enough has been said butchered plot lazy writing weak script plot holes no continuity from previous movie and pointless characters not worthy of the star wars universe
Jul 24 2018,positive,let the past die and throw your expectations out the window i loved the film and that it subverted my expectations it may even replace empire as my favourite film in the franchise its a visual treat and sets the bar high for episode 9 its a shame some star wars fans are so upset because at the end of the day it is a movie and its ok to dislike it without starting a revolution
Jul 24 2018,positive,there were two great star wars movies before the last jedi  a new hope and the empire strikes back  which were both great in very different ways the last jedi is the third great star wars film also in its own very different ways at its heart its movie about failure about how people respond to the failures of their pasts often by failing again
Jul 24 2018,positive,great but still some flaws like the killing of snoke roses screen time and the way luke skywalker was portrayed
Jul 24 2018,negative,saw some oneliner 5 stars heres a oneliner 0 star sw only has 3 episodes 6 if you believe george lucas
Jul 24 2018,positive,definetly better than the force awakens
Jul 24 2018,positive,while not much of an improvement upon its predecessor in the been there done that categoryin fact some similarities may be more frighteningly familiar to fans since it doesnt draw as much from the entire star wars universe as it simply does from the original trilogy rather than its derivatives ie despite how they may chalk something up as a salt planet rather than an ice planetand it does seem as though the majority of the time is spent stalling for time when in fact we couldve been developing the plot a little more since the previous movie jumped the gun by giving us the object of our desire in lukes arrival one movie too early anyway on the other hand since character development is something we really still need i guess thats precisely what we got even if it meant seeing the characters we want to evolve struggle through their darker ambitions or fleetings even more to get there that said the problem concocted by the force awakens still persists proficiency in force training or lightsaber handling need not apply even in rarer styles makes you wonder why there was ever a jedi academy in the bloody first place useless jedi masters anyway so regardless of whether characters live or die or plots twist and turn youre still convinced there could be a better way direct the script since the dialogue is pretty ugly to get the job done perhaps some better cgi too since the puppeteering sucked and to let us get to know some characters instead of just oneshotanddone theres also the question of where the hell these guys get their information in the first place eg um since the info perished with the original order how the hell does luke know who darth sidious is anyway disneys certainly got some splaining to do
Jul 23 2018,positive,not good enough to be good  not bad enough to be bad
Jul 23 2018,negative,tried so hard to make everything unexpected that it ruined every single character and buildup from previous movies a two and a half hour middle finger to fans and previous directorswriters
Jul 23 2018,negative,lack of character development and an overabundance of plot twists make the last jedi the last straw for me
Jul 23 2018,negative,it gets a star because its star wars but seriously did the writers and directors even see the force awakens
Jul 23 2018,negative,ryan johnsons vision for a bold new star wars film was intended to bring the series forward while letting the past die however johnsons film was almost more insulting to fans who had expected consistency to the saga  subversion of expectations which many critics praise about the film was more disappointing than surprising as too much of the new trilogys plot was thrown under the bus in this installment the force awakens built anticipation as it teased fans by introducing new questions about the characters the state of the republic or rebelsresistance how maas got lukes lightsaber to give to rey and just who is snoke mr johnson however took none of this into consideration as if he was in charge of the next star wars anthology film johnsons attempt at his own star wars story went too far with the dismissal of everything the fans wanted to see you will enjoy the highbudget visuals youd come to expect from just about any disney film these days but for serious longtime fans of the saga visuals alone are not enough when paired with hasty writing and creative overreach
Jul 23 2018,neutral,initially fun and impressive the film falls apart on closer examination and ultimately leaves the user with a hollow feeling
Jul 23 2018,negative,while the visuals are admittedly an improvement over the other films this apparently being the first to discover the color red can be used for something other than blaster fire the story and characters are not only a mess they are downright insulting rian johnsons apparent need to subvert the audiences expectations and avoid following fan theories left the old and new characters acting in ways that make littletono sense i was not a fan of the force awakens but i saw that there was potential if certain plot elements were explored in the movies following it this unfortunately was not the case i will not be seeing episode 9 as this movie has made me refuse to further fund these soulless continuations of a timeless and iconic story
Jul 22 2018,negative,better than the last still a shell of what the franchise was
Jul 22 2018,negative,as many have already said the important bits of the plot didnt quite make sense the writers really let the series and the fans down with this one which is unfortunate because episode 7 really got it off to a great start for us star wars fans we can only hope that the failures of episode 8 didnt completely ruin the current series heres to looking ahead to episode 9 cheers
Jul 22 2018,negative,this was comically bad from betraying long standing character atributes to pointless new characters this movie had no real direction and its plot falls apart as quickly as the franchise is dont pay to watch this
Jul 22 2018,negative,ehhh this movie needed a wider range test audience if it got past the producers without spoiling anything about the plot the movie itself was a ridiculous mess it trys to much to be a standalone movie disregarding too much of the previous the now cannon material essentially it lacked the main elements of what made a star wars movie a star wars movie
Jul 22 2018,negative,i seriously cant believe how awful this movie is very sad
Jul 22 2018,negative,shame on the professional critics who rated this movie highly the influence from disney on the reviews listed here is obvious character development plot continuity or even a grade school understanding of physics are all noticeably absent from this sad excuse of a movie this poorly written and soulless cash grab concerns itself more with providing a backdrop for the selling of merchandise than it does with the telling of a clear narrative the visual effects are terrific but no amount of flashing lightsabers or exhausted john williams can spare it from the mortal wound that is bad writing
Jul 21 2018,negative,one of the worst movies i have ever seen its as if a million star wars fans cried out and were suddenly silenced rip sw
Jul 21 2018,negative,it completely disregards previous star wars lore and offers nothing better or interesting it fails to do basic story telling and leaves the viewers confused and empty
Jul 21 2018,negative,completely ruined the star wars universe for me horrible story line and in a way stole  and destroyed the unique opportunity rian j was given  killing off key characters  we can never get back  i watched this movie with my 13 year old daughter and she said dad i know you liked star wars at my age but i dont is that ok     seriously disney really ruined the franchise with this rubbish
Jul 21 2018,negative,easily the worst star wars so many bad plot holes and writing
Jul 21 2018,neutral,first star wars movie i found unenjoyable the cgi is great character designs are great ost is good john williams actors did a fantastic job as well but the overall plot and character development is beyond bad every time the movie gets good or somewhat decent it gets ruined by an immature joke or certain groups political agenda
Jul 21 2018,negative,i heard it was bad but didnt realise it was going to be this bad these bew star wars films have absolutely ruined a once loved series thats enough for me i dont think ill be watch any other movies
Jul 20 2018,negative,it was blah and seemed to kill build up the first one which was awesome had started
Jul 20 2018,negative,this movie was a mess and all over the place i felt the story had no real direction and so many unnecessary pointless scenes disney ruined such a wonderful opportunity and with it the franchise
Jul 20 2018,negative,cringingly embarrassing for anyone over the age of 12 the star wars franchise showed so much promise with rogue one
Jul 20 2018,positive,overall i think this is an okay movie obviously not great but better than the prequel trilogy i know a lot of fans are losing their minds over this and i can definitely see where theyre coming from however in my opinion its a decent attempt that is flawed but not the utter travesty people are making it out to be       first of all the visuals are amazing and the plot is ambitious if a bit all over the place i can see some genuine attempts to mirror episode v and mostly that brought a smile to my face the things a lot of people are raging about i didnt mind the porgs and the jokes werent too much of a problem to me and helped to keep the film from getting too dark the treatment of luke is yes a disappointing addition and perhaps the biggest mistake of the movie though his final scene was lovely and the shot of the twin suns on the horizon was a nice touch and helped to bookend his narrative       holdo i must admit was an utter dumpster fire of a character she is totally unlikable from start to finish and as many other people have pointed out her smarmy arrogance is the catalyst for almost all the tragedy that happens in the movie if she had simply explained things to poe like a mature adult her plan wouldve gone off without a hitch and half the rebellion would not have been slaughtered hell luke mightve even survived since without the base being under attack he wouldnt have had a reason to intervenei her death at the end is less of the heroic sacrifice the movie seems to want it to be and more the films real villain getting what she deserved       other than that the rest isnt too bad the bombs seem to have been given a push by that rack descending so them falling towards the dreadnought was more of them floating in the right direction the scene with leia was probably a bit camp but ive got no issue with the physics people can survive in vacuum for a minute or so even without space magic and her flying was clearly just forcepulling the ship towards her which propelled her instead because she has less mass overall i think a lot of the fan rage is justified but the rest is just grasping at straws        then again i didnt think the justice league movie was that bad either so take my opinion as you will
Jul 20 2018,negative,a terrible movie that pushed a liberal agenda as well as ruining cannon ideology characters and a lot of the basis ideas of the star wars universe mark hamil spoke out in one interview about the horrible things they did to his character and i agree star wars died when disney was given rights to it
Jul 20 2018,negative,like many of the people who went to see this movie  i was disappointed  they didnt handle the characters ive been loving my entire life well  they definitely let me down in this movie  so much that i dont think there is a way for the next movie to fix it 
Jul 20 2018,positive,i enjoyed this movie although i must admit that there are some plot holes and scenes that  were not entirely necessary in my opinion most people dont like it because it was not like the script they wrote in their head and had emphasis on choosing your own path and rising out of nothing i liked the fact that a new concept was brought to the galaxy and hopefully it will be more enjoyed later on as was empire strikes back
Jul 20 2018,negative,fake 90 tomato meter  easily the worst movie ever due to its many failures in writing and execution  nothing in it makes sense or relates back to the original trilogy and in fact intentionally stomps on the fans
Jul 20 2018,positive,great performances and great effects the last jedi is the most enjoyable star wars film since empire
Jul 20 2018,negative,it has bad and lazy writing  disney can only can trick us the fans to watch it once and no more there is too much wrong with film and try to cover up with cool visual effects audience are sick of this type of film
Jul 20 2018,positive,i wouldnt listen to those who are being negative i only go with the critics for movies
Jul 19 2018,positive,i know that many people in the star wars community either some what disliked this movie or just completely hated it  but i thought loved it their were a few things that i thought i would probably change that if i was writerdirector but overall i thought that rian johnson made a wonderful continuation to the star wars saga is it the greatest film of all time no is it the greatest star wars film of them all no but is it an overall  good movie with a good story yes
Jul 19 2018,negative,boring complicated not fresh just worn out  dont bother with it
Jul 19 2018,negative,i finally saw this movie today on netflix ive been using rt for several months but never felt the need to make an account but i really wanted to share my disappointment about the last jedi granted this movie might not be so bad if youve never seen a star wars movie and had no idea who the characters were and what their history was or what the tone and tenor of a star wars movie was all about this installment seems like a seth macfarlane parody with quips and gimmicks better suited for a fast and furious movie or an afterschool special
Jul 19 2018,negative,this is the first movie ive ever seen in a theatre where i pulled my phone out of my pocket midway through to check the time  its not only a bad star wars movie pooping on all established lore and character development but its a terrible movie in general  plot holes are everywhere there is no character or plot development and over an hour of the movie is completely pointless and goes nowhere  nothing in this movie makes any sense nor does its high ratings from critics who clearly need to reevaluate their career choices
Jul 19 2018,positive,plenty of awesome new spacefaring action and diversity in the cast but sadly lets you down on the revelations and lack of character development tough shit disney
Jul 19 2018,negative,absolutely the most disrespectful movie to the star wars universe if you want to keep your childhood memories do not watch another single one of these disasters
Jul 19 2018,negative,two and a half hours of squandered potential not only did it end my interest in star wars it also proves that the tomatometer is broken and therefor not dependable
Jul 19 2018,negative,this is a pretty weak star wars film the story to me was bunch of sub plots stringed together with a bunch action scenes there was not much character development from any character i only part i found interesting was when rey and kylo ren communicated through the force that was it
Jul 19 2018,negative,half of the movie is awesome the other half could have been just deleted
Jul 19 2018,negative,just a mess of a movie took a step back from a force awakens and puts the sequel to come after this in a horrible spot
Jul 19 2018,negative,disney should stop making movies my past is dead thanks to this movie  thank god i didnt waste money to see this in the theatres because enduring it on netflix was painful enough and it took me 3 nights of sickness to get through it whats with the purple hair lol  really if youre going to destroy a franchise might as well go out with a big laugh about incompetency with the director down to the hairdresser  the supposed film critics that are giving this a tomato have no idea what theyre talking about and it is as if the world has gone mad  this doesnt even deserve a half star
Jul 18 2018,negative,i really despise this movie  as someone who grew up with the original trilogy and got to see the prequels as a kid  i have a deep love for the former and i enjoy the good parts of the prequels for what they are    these movies all stayed true to their characters  the force awakens did not and it bothered me during that movie  but it ruined this one  honestly luke is disgraceful here  the mere fact that he would kill his nephew han and leias child in his sleep for even a moment is simply ridiculous  the man that saw good in darth vader and redeemed him  that alone was enough to ruin the movie not to mention the merry poppins flight ackbars death the complete waste of snoke as a character admiral holdos terrible leadership and writing the milk scene  there are a million things i hate about this movie and every time something interesting happens its immediately followed by something ruining the moment  i love star wars but i absolutely hate this movie
Jul 18 2018,positive,a great movie with interesting characters and the best visuals of any star wars movie a great continuation of an epic saga
Jul 18 2018,negative,this movie feels like they focused only on visuals  and completly forgot to have an actual plot that makes sense it looks great visualy but omg plot holes are distractingconfusing also just like episode 7 the fact that rey is basicly good at everything without having any real training or hardship to overcome really takes away from the immersion for me
Jul 18 2018,positive,sw the last jedi was almost everything i wanted to see in the previous episode new faces a fresher plot lots of action etc  however personally with the disaster that was episode 7 originalitywise 8 had a though job to fullfill which i believe payed off almost expectacularly with mayor twists and character development taking place in this almost 3 hours length production however i cannot overlook some of its issues like snokes dissapointing lack of origin and lets not forget about that whole ruined sacrifice near the end although the one powerful scene that came after it touched my heart and made me cry tears of sadness and joy so in the end i believe this movie is worthy of a final sequel i just hope that someone can abrige its predecesor so we can forget the whole episode 4 emulation that it was
Jul 18 2018,negative,i believe theres a difference between a good star wars movie and a good standalone movie i say this because even though i believe its a subpar standalone movie the last jedi is a horrible star wars movie while its got the beautiful visuals and charming music of its many predecessors the last jedi lacks everything that makes a star wars movie feel like a star wars movie whether itd be the characters the story the development of the fun
Jul 18 2018,negative,good visuals dont save a lacking story and poor characterization the story could work as an anthology film but falls completely short as the second of the new trilogy  the film portrays itself as edgyartsy but fails to build on the previous film and even manages to betray its own stakes at every turn i am left with no anticipation for what happens next or interest in the new characters     the visuals are great though 1 star just for that
Jul 18 2018,positive,possible the best written movie of the saga  a brilliant film that reveals more each time you see it   cannot express how fantastically written and executed this sequel to force awakens is  a truly great cinematic experience  visually stunning witty fastpaced and satisfying for a long time fan
Jul 18 2018,negative,registered only to give 1 star terrible movie in overall kills everything that  became interesting from force awakens who is snoke we still have no idea but hes as lame as one can be we learnt the mystery in rey is just ruined with some very primitive jokes and a very lame explanation about her parents luke what the hell happened to him a jedi master having no idea about anything any time terrible writing confusing characters even carrie fishers acting resembles a soap opera at times
Jul 18 2018,negative,its like a slow car chase but with ships  answered none of the previous movies questions  humor is absurd meaningless storylines throughout
Jul 18 2018,negative,destroyer of star wars lore and fans
Jul 18 2018,positive,this is my favorite movie ever great twists great characters great star wars action great drama great insight into the existing new characters dont listen to the hate this is the movie youre looking for
Jul 18 2018,negative,destroyed the franchise by completely ignoring the groundwork laid by ep vii bad pacing felt preachy whatever the messages were royally botched one of my favorite childhood characters if this is what disney wants to give us i hope they stop making all star wars films
Jul 18 2018,positive,tlj  ryan johnsons entry to the third trilogy of star wars saga   luke skywalker is front and center compared to tfa hamill gives   hands down best performance as luke skywalker  now reluctant  role as mentor luke has taken exile and has studied the scripture  from the jedi whils we audience learn of luke skywalkers   first failures as a jedi since first introduced to him as a infinite in   sws rots and then featured in sws anh luke appears broken upon  meeting rey  sws reintroduced to him and caught up to his backstory since   last seeing him is in rotj rey is eager to start her jedi training as lukes padawan learner but instead finds a reluctant jedi master wanting to teach     snoke kylo have regrouped since tlj   are on the offensive ala empire in sw esb ryan johnson gives sws fans one of the sagas best  complex                                                               space battles in the entire sws saga fans will need m than one viewing of tlj to fully appreciate this battle  all of tlj our heros leia poe finn  rose new character find themselves in a tighter spot than the rebel alinance during rouge one and at the beginning of sws anh tlj provides arguably the best light saber duel since sws tpm battle of the fates and one of most shocking moments inter entire sws saga finn  rose are deployed to find a code breaker on a planet that houses what can    the described as an industrial military complex this new planet is ranluj by a new entity that manufacture anything from star destroyers to xwing fighters  any weapon a buyer has coin to spend to whoever has the money to pay     the climax to tlj introduces another new planet and serves as and looks simular to hoththis planet has just been scraped clean of its natural resources from previous battles     benito del torros character is spot on as code breaker and quickly becomes a welcome addition as does lara derns character
Jul 18 2018,positive,luke doesnt even fight totally predictable and really left me disappointed 
Jul 18 2018,negative,unlikable from start to finish 4th wall and canonbreaking the movie is a disaster that seems like it was intended to make it as difficult for disney to follow up with another star wars movie pointlessly virtue signalling at the worst times while needlessly killing people with no feelings attached at the best times  2 stars for the concept art thats about it
Jul 17 2018,negative,could have so much better very careless directing and writing  ruined the experience i have tried twice to make it through a second view and failed both times due to boredom and frustration
Jul 17 2018,negative,could they have made a worse disgrace of a once great franchise  disney seems more interested in pushing social justice agendas and cheap laughs than they are in writing a good story  pass 
Jul 17 2018,negative,watch the fan edits that fix most of the garbage 35 once fixed
Jul 17 2018,negative,another of the many life long fans who upon watching this film created an account just to score this horrid addition to a loved franchise
Jul 17 2018,negative,i left the movie theater in a state of shock i tried to convince myself that it was good but it was just so bad rian johnson and kathleen kennedy need to be forcibly removed from anything star wars related
Jul 17 2018,negative,just a bad movie all politics and other nonsense aside it took a huge step back from episode 7 which wasnt that great to begin with we need a reboot from this current direction
Jul 17 2018,neutral,great visuals great pacing decent acting dazzling special effects and some topnotch bits of world building  all ruined by fundamentally bad storytelling
Jul 17 2018,negative,the plot was terrible canon was wrecked i was actually bored of the attempts at quick jokes it was like a marvel movie gone wrong
Jul 17 2018,negative,ruins the star wars storyline
Jul 17 2018,negative,worst star wars movie ever debatable if it is better than episodes iiiand iii it lost key elements that made this franchise an immediate fan favorite several plot lines dont get a chance to mature causing a disengaged feel to the movie i wouldnt watch it even if it was on tv without commercials
Jul 17 2018,negative,the movie that killed star wars  fans at least get to pretend like nothing has been created since return of the jedi
Jul 17 2018,negative,a pastiche of a bad marvel movie ham fisted dad jokes crowbarred in right from the start with an incredibly thin plot if you like transformers you will love this says it all
Jul 17 2018,positive,beautiful story arcs rey becoming more hopeful despite possibly supposedly learning she descends from regular folk poe learning that he doesnt have all the answers and has to overcome being humbled luke saving those he loves rather than killing those he hates rose doing the same finn learning to put the groups needs over his own but to also understand that rey has her own path plus showing the evil for what it is kylo ren being a petulant pissant who whines about what he cant get sounds like some supposed star wars fans so dang good
Jul 17 2018,negative,another 0 star review is deserved here but sadly not available
Jul 17 2018,negative,firstly i am not a star wars fan but enjoyed the original trilogy  found the prequals mostly dull as dishwater monologues and some poor acting and the force awakens a dull lifeless story especially the acting oh the acting was terrible so thought the last jedi must be better how wrong can you be a story so full of hideous pot holes and random nonsense its hard to say what part is worse acting again dull lifeless and unbelievable luke skywalker who saw good even in darth vader now tries to kill his nephew just in case he turns bad and goes and sulks on an island for 20 years even when finn finally does something selfless he is stooped by a stupid act of stuoibess what kill someones trying to stop an attack by trying to kill both of you was this meant to be comedy snoke who appears out of nowhere gets killed easily and seems like a plotless idea the empire a rebranded name is stupid  is way stronger than the resistance so how did that happen surely in epidode 6 the empire was destroyed  and worse of all hyperspace through a ship destroys it easy then to kill a death star or fleet of ships with cheap transports undermines all of star wars storylines vice admiral holdos contribution is to say never allow women in charge as she isbterrible rey learns to be a jedi in 5 mins oh thats easy kylo ren just needs acting lessons and some backbone basically it makes transformers the movies look logical and even the prequals look ok i wish i could get my money back from watching this film
Jul 17 2018,negative,an incoherent mess from start to finish imho
Jul 17 2018,negative,as not as a die hard fan but just a longtimer of the space opera been just puzzled around about how they managed to pull out this one so bad to put it plain they just destroyed all the basis all the foundation of the saga but not just torn it down also kind of scrapped it out to the bin look at the treatment of luke vanishing away at mocking yoda to luke as their last encounter at the nowrebel imptrooper fin killing other imp trooper although he resents the initial killing of his imptroop friend in the first minutes the scam of hyperspace discovery as weapon and the silly plot of poe and bombardment ship at initialnot to mention the casino and the horsesdogs run childish no content bestiary bullshit from disney
Jul 17 2018,negative,i have never been more confused and disappointed walking out of a movie
Jul 16 2018,negative,unfortunately a poorly written script that had such great potential
Jul 16 2018,negative,shockingly bad from the very start the rebellion so mired by superficial infighting that barely anything is gained low brow comedic garbage makes established characters unrecognizable the first orders general hux is reduced to a bumbling fool the previously brave and selfless poe reduced to a hothead liability whos greatest achievement is a yo mama joke no one to root for just a hodge podge of individuals with no cohesive direction learn from the past used to be the motto of the wise kill the past   sounds like a bad teenage punk rock band
Jul 16 2018,negative,this movie was awful
Jul 16 2018,negative,breaks my heart to see this i will reject this new series as cannon and try to erase it from my memory
Jul 16 2018,negative,poorly written with plots you could fly a star destroyer through no character development and silly plots that pad the run time but add nothing to the story things happen becauseplot things happen because the writerdirector needed them to happen such a leia poppins the wasting of laura dern captain phasma getting the boba fett treatment and the gutting of luke skywalker to shine a light on the greatness of reythe reigning mary sue one had to wonder if the sequel will be called return of the mary sues
Jul 16 2018,negative,this movie was a big disappointment the plot was slow and uninteresting laura derns character was just smug with not justification  the scene with princess leia pulling herself back in side the ship just reminded me if the scene in guardians of the galaxy where peter rescues gimora  the whole humor of the movie felt more like guardians than star wars  they really missed the mark with this film
Jul 16 2018,negative,star wars the last jedi fell flat for me the actors are good but the story is completely tonedeaf not only to the tenor of the existing star wars universe but more importantly to the arc created in the first movie of this trilogy i feel as if rian johnson at each juncture intentionally chose the path for his existing characters that flew in the face of what longtime fans expected thus the new characters become one dimensional and the old characters are simply new people with old names they are written almost completely opposite of the established personalities of the characters from the original trilogy and eu
Jul 16 2018,negative,i loved rogue on and the force awakens after the force awakens i was super excited to see luke again see kylo ren train to become an badass with lord find out who snoke really is and find out who reys parents are but i was shocked after the last jedi to see that everything i was excited for was ruined they ruined lukes character wasted the huge opportunity that was snoke and ruined the idea of reys parents the only thing im still optimistic about is kylo ten i really dont know where they are going to take episode 9 but unlike most of the star wars fans i will give it a chance and if it is good then i will acknowledge that it is good but as for this one it was a dumpster fire
Jul 16 2018,negative,the last jedi is a horrible movie that ruin the star wars saga dont be fooled by the critics the movie is a nightmare for star wars fans and no spoilers but if you had a theory there is 9999 that its wrong
Jul 16 2018,negative,words cannot describe how bad this movie is i have never been a huge star wars fan but i was always entertained by the spectacle good jedi vs evil dark side at its best this movie however is inconsistent with everything star wars stands for their biggest hero is turned into a whiny old fk who simply doenst care about anything to the point where he commits suicide are you kidding me  rey simply knows all the jedi tricks without any training and you know what everyone can you need no training or anything and everyone can be a jedi especially women by the looks of it i dont know if this movie was trying to pin a me too batch to itself but what is with all the men bashing in this movie  all men are reduced to hot headed macho idiots and girls seem to always be so very thoughtfull and wise every decision poe takes basically puts the rebels in a worse situation and finn is completely left in the dark about the plans so he can totally make a fool out of himself by not just standing around and waiting to get killed here we have another shining hero woman that commits suicide by crashing the ship via lightspeed how stupid do you acutally think we are  it is star wars for crying out loud  there was no autopilot or freaking druid that could have done that  i mean i was kinda smiling when they had those landing assistent guys waving their sticks in roque one they have light speed and everything but cant land and find their parking position without a guy standing there and waving those pompom like sticks  sadly this movie is no comedy and i could probably go on whining about this movie all day but i already feel a bit like luke i just dont care about this franchise any more and i am afraid that if i put any more effort into this review i might actually disintegrate like luke did
Jul 16 2018,negative,i have literally grown up with this franchise as i am 44  i expected to see many changes with the new characters over the years  i suffered through the prequels but knew the set up and the story were relevant to the creation of vader and the subsequent story of ep 45 and 6  the force awakens did carry the story after a long absence it holds water and sets us up for what could be a great next chapter in this universe  however it bombed on so many levels that i will probably not go see the third installment of this trilogy  i have seen every other movie in this franchise multiple times in the theater and on vcrdvdblu ray  not this time  i was concerned when lucas gave up the reins and got his pay out  i figured it was just butterflies  unfortunately it turned out to be montezumas revenge  good bye star wars
Jul 16 2018,negative,we start with rebels blowing up a empire battle cruiser so straight away you think whats the point of this film then a glimmer of hope the empire can now track the rebels going through hyperspace and catch up with the fleeing rebels but wait the rebels can keep just far enough away from their foe so their force field is effected enough to stop the empires blast cannons so why doesnt happen in all the battle scenes the rebels have a cunning plan they can sneak onto the empires multi billion pound state of the art battle cruiser and disarm this tracking device with the help of a world famous code breaker so finn sneaks off to find this guy without the empire knowing remember they can now track them through hyperspace but cant track finn leaving the rebels ship to get help  in the meantime princess leia gets sucked out into space but fear not she suddenly knows how to use the force to pull herself into another  ship not sure why she hasnt used it before by this time l couldnt take anymore enough excitement for one day disney dont give up your day job
Jul 15 2018,negative,an insult to the fans delete it from the canon please
Jul 15 2018,negative,so its the longest one and it really feels like that the entire runtime i was trying my best not to fall asleep and still failed
Jul 15 2018,negative,terrible there was no thought put into this movie i just wish they understood the sw universe but they clearly dont
Jul 15 2018,negative,worst star wars film ever i would never recommend this film
Jul 15 2018,positive,a new take on an old idea
Jul 15 2018,negative,after seeing that the critics review of the last jedi is in league with christopher nolans the dark knight i had to make an account and give this turd 12 star
Jul 15 2018,negative,the last jedi is one of the most disappointing movies i have ever seen the entire 2nd act of the movie is just horrible the new character rose takes center stage and that is plain stupid because she ruins everything in the end as well some nice action sequences with oscar issacs character but thats mostly it because rey is on an island the entire movie with a old luke skywalker who was writin as a joke after all star wars the last jedi is not a good movie in any way and is and embarrassment to all star wars movies
Jul 15 2018,positive,its simply amazing
Jul 15 2018,negative,literally the worst movie ive ever seen
Jul 15 2018,negative,defenetely one the worst science fiction movies ever and by far the worst of the star wars franchise
Jul 15 2018,negative,angry and hurt by what disney has done to destroy the franchise  just very thoughtless  i feel like they decided to disrupt the physics of star wars the fabric of star wars the laws of star wars the axioms of star wars the ethos of star wars and they thought fans would be ok with it as long as they put the name star wars on the opening crawl  this movie isnt star wars  if you are a director and have any questions go back to joseph campbell and archetypes when creating characters  this movie was meant to have classical archetype characters the youthful optimist the reluctant hero the wise sage the evil villain  be thoughtful and respectful of the history and the physics of how the star wars universe that was created space time how the force works you cant use the force to fly through space otherwise kenobi couldve just force flown to alderan in the original movie  you cant ram star ships in hyperspace in star wars that makes kamikazeeing an entire starfleet with one cruiser too easy and couldve been done in all the other movies    the reason audiences are angry with you disney is because you didnt create this movie in the star wars universe you created it in a new universe  rogue one was a star wars flick this movie isnt star wars  you couldve created a whole new franchise for this movie for people to see for this movie call it galaxy battle the final wizard or universe conflict the only lasersword wielder  please just dont call it star wars the last jedi  it doesnt fit
Jul 14 2018,positive,seeing luke as a teacher with what was revealed during the film is a much better story than what a lesser screenwriter would have written   in fact the whole movie was written for grownups to take their kids to it had the jokes and explosions for the kids and it had themes that you need to think about
Jul 14 2018,positive,a very enjoyable entry into the star wars franchise i saw this twice in the theaters and again recently the film may have many small flaws but i think that as a whole it is very enjoyable and did a great job with all of the characters especially kylo and rey i am excited to see how this trilogy ends and i think this was a pretty good middle chapter in it 
Jul 14 2018,negative,uninspired unoriginal rehashing the same olground
Jul 14 2018,negative,watched this movie with high hopes as the force awakens was pretty good and was leaving quite a few cliff hangers for this movie to expand on   this movie disappointed on all aspects the character building was terrible the cliff hangers were just cut off without much explanation   there is so much wrong with the writing the introduction of fuel issues the ex machina tracking the bs humor   no reason to watch this ever  hopefully ep 9 will bring the entire series back on track
Jul 14 2018,negative,a complete trash movie filled with plotholes and bad writing rules are broken to advance the story and honestly just go watch the original 3 and call it a day this movie is complete cancer
Jul 14 2018,negative,this movie was a disgrace to the star wars franchise
Jul 14 2018,positive,loved this movie it has gotten me back into star wars since iiii was not my favorite i have watched the movie several times read the book and rewatched the force awakens again since watching the last jedi i cant wait for episode ix
Jul 14 2018,positive,at this point in the sagas development star wars fans have learned to extract the good bits from each film and to overlook missteps and excesses  that is im not sure anyone is wholeheartedly accepting all of the directorial or production choices in each film anymore  but i say that still not having seen revenge of the sith 2005  rian johnson who made a promising directorial debut with teen noir brick 2005 guides the franchises renewal here focusing attention on luke skywalker mark hamill after the previous film zoomed in on han solo  princess leia er general organa also stars  in a part shot just before carrie fishers death  we pick up where we left off with new heroine rey daisy ridley on planet ahchto irelands beautiful skellig michael island as she approaches luke to return to the resistance to rejuvenate the jedi religion and to take on the first order led by supreme leader snoke and han solo  leias son ben adam driver now turned to the dark side of the force and called kylo ren  meanwhile the rebel fleet is being attacked by the first orders battleships and might soon be completely wiped out if a crazy plan involving a casino at canto bight doesnt come off john boyega and kelly marie tran star in this sequence with benicio del toro as a shifty ally  as promised there is a lot of action with oscar isaac returning as fighter pilot poe dameron and laura dern joining as a vice admiral and things do blow up and light sabres do get to thrusting and slicing  johnsons production design is splendid whether cgi or not with colormatched costumes and widescreen interstellar backgrounds  the jedi tree is a nice touch and the scene in which it features contains another treat for the older generation  but the film does seem to drag on and there are times when it gets expositionheavy explaining the relationship between luke and kylo ren and some plot developments feel unearned  but as i said star wars fans have learned to overlook some things and fortunately the porg arent as intrusively cute as the ewoks before them  all told an enjoyable return to this universe  but it is hard to say where episode ix could go
Jul 14 2018,negative,i pushed myself to watch it its beautiful in appearance and terrible in storytelling and character motivation the only redeeming qualities to this is mark hamills acting the cinematography and some scenes other than that its not even worth seeing and all the problems wrong with it are a detriment to its score taking points away from what would have been a competent maybe even a good movie its a disasterpiece beautiful looking but ultimately hallow and shallow
Jul 14 2018,positive,another star wars film for kids to enjoy while it has its issues and there are things that could have been done better it has some great sequences made even better by a truly amazing score  the film takes some chances while exploring the mysteries of the force   though there is a sequence that seems to be impossible in both our world and the star wars universe once examined the science checks out as well as the force side of it   the final thirty minutes or so of the movie bring an epic battle followed by an even more epic battle with a final confrontation that focuses on letting the music and scenery do most of the storytelling  once again john williams has created a score that illustrates the emotions of the film so well that caused some peoplemin the theatre to cry over the death of a character that had been introduced five minutes before  the sound mixing was done well and a sequence where the sound cuts out allowing you to hear the reactions of the other audience members surprised everyone and makes the film even better  overall the scenery and music combined with some great action sequences are what make the movie worth watching
Jul 14 2018,negative,a very bleak storyline with tremendous plot holes painted over with a generous budget of visual effects and flashy scenes this film took all the audience was looking forward to from episode vii and threw it into the trash the correlation between the two films is so meaningless its hard to believe the same studio was responsible for both marks performance as luke was annoying to watch as the veteran master came off as whiny and annoying the character of snoke is worth nothing after this film and the character of reys parents mean nothing after this film why would jj create such curiosity in the force awakens to let rian johnson trample this franchise with such a shallow film to follow it incredibly disappointed
Jul 14 2018,positive,this movie is a great addition to the franchise its similar to empire strikes back but different enough to feel like its own movie that does not mean its without flaws this movie dedicates a lot of screen time to side characters and some answers from puzzles of the force awakens are frustrating but that does not make it a bad movie some flaws still great addition
Jul 14 2018,negative,it was objectively a terrible film
Jul 14 2018,negative,how can a movie this bad have a rating of 81 its realworld politics and the way they deliberately disrespected the old characters to promote the new is disgusting this movie left me feeling profoundly sad as the child in me died and realised he has no place left in the world
Jul 14 2018,negative,quite possibly the most disappointing movie ever made
Jul 13 2018,negative,great visuals terrible writing and pacing the characters have a bad case of plot induced stupidity 
Jul 13 2018,positive,i really enjoyed this film 
Jul 13 2018,negative,this movie was a terrible sequel almost every star wars movie has a time skip of 23 years this movie picked up where the last left off and in no way did it improve the story luke skywalker turned to complete crap rose should be killed off leia was just weird finn was just useless disney ruined star wars and that faxx snoke was a more shittier villain then broly
Jul 13 2018,negative,awful the plot is so stupid that i hesitate to analyze the entire story after an illconceived battlepyrrhic victory against the first order the resistance hopes that their literal plot armor can protect them long enough hatch an escape plan the purplehaired vice admiral holdo who is ten times more annoying than jar jar binks devises a stupid plan to save her crew the audience is told that its a brilliant plan despite the fact that it fails in the exact manner that you and poe would expect it to the finnrose subplot is a complete waste of time and only exists to undermine holdos brilliant but actually moronic plan through a flukish plot twist luke skywalker is completely wasted ancient jedi wisdom is treated with contempt which is ironic considering how terribly written this story is compared to any of the films in the original trilogy the only reason to watch this movie is if you feel obligated to keep up with star wars this franchise is nothing but an artistically bankrupt cash grab informed by repugnant hypocritical left wing identity politics
Jul 13 2018,neutral,wtf worst edited movie in the franchise rian johnson must leave this could have been so much betterwhy all the social justice nonsense in a sc fi war epic in a galaxy far far away               were there actually a plot holdo did nothing rey brought a ghost and something on the side i guess                   
Jul 13 2018,negative,definitely the worst star wars movie ever  for lots of reasons primarily those reasons include that it is bad at being a movie and worse at being star wars perverts not subverts canon norms and fan expectations like its designed to make the fans ragequit worked on me
Jul 13 2018,negative,fickle story painfully narrow character arcs insanely misguided treatment of franchise characters a complete and utter lack of knowledge of spacegravityair locks a blatant attempt at pandering to executives perceptions of audience completely offbase and poor directorial understanding of bathos and just a bad movie altogether this film should not have been released as it is
Jul 13 2018,negative,its not even logically for a childs movie
Jul 13 2018,negative,star wars major fan since birth this movie has scarred me and both my perception and hopes for the star wars saga disney what have you done im angered for life at this horrible movie and what they did to our beloved life long star wars characters
Jul 13 2018,negative,hated it why did they ruin my star wars george lucas please come back and save you legacy
Jul 13 2018,negative,this movie is bad on so many levels that it would actually be difficult to cover in one post but here goes    plot holes the force awakens set up several plot lines that never got developed and then where later dropped or tossed aside in the movie the two biggest ones being the killing off of snoke with no backstory and the second finding out that reys parents are no one and had no point to the overall story it serves as an insult to previous movie and also serves as lazy writing there was further plot holes left unanswered such as the discovery of vaders mask and lukes saber absence of the knights of ren and luke with his search for the first jedi temple which served no point to the plot as well he just went to the island to die apparently it felt downright disrespectful to everything set up by jj   terrible script and acting rose is basically a next generation jar jar with that terrible acting what a career killer this movie must be for her wow that was bad to be fair all the acting was pretty terrible which leads into my next point that the script must be at fault also while i know these are not academy award winning actors i honestly thought the characters of rey and fin were acted fairly well in the previous movie some of the dialogue was so bad i was left speechless as if i was in a state of shock unable to comprehend the ridiculousness of what i just witnessed  unoriginality and boring story lets face it the movie was basically a rip off of empire strikes back and return of the jedi in one big reveal about reys parents mirrors lukes father big reveal return of the jedi like throne room scene in which kylo like vader kills his master rebelsresistance on the run a stab at mimicking han and leias romance with rose and fin which didnt work by the way and rey being trained by a reluctant hermit master on a remote planet which didnt work either also the story itself was boring it has the rebels on the run in a spaceship in outer space its a slow motion chase scene in space for the majority of the film wow thats about as boring as you can get there was some other story elements like the casino planet which was the worst part of the movie and also ended up serving no purpose to the plot as well  dispreset to luke skywalker i had to made this its own point because of how much it bugged me luke skywalker was my childhood hero and was the main hero from the first trilogy they turned him into a babbling idiot who sucked at all things jedi on top of that they made him extremely pessimistic which is the exact opposite to what his original character was like the torment they put mark through was awful to watch in interviews mark stated he fundamentally disagreed with virtually everything that was decided for his character i agree with him  unexciting action the millennium falcon chase scene on jakku in the force awakens was about a billion times more exciting than basically every action scene in the last jedi not once was i on edge of my seat or excited for anything also this is the very first star wars movie in history to not have one valid lightsaber battle just let that sink in  no new mysteries or lore since snoke is dead reys parents mean nothing and we were given nothing new to hold onto there is basically nothing to look forward to in episode 9 its almost as if star wars has lost all excitement or build up  ridiculous force powers im sorry but there is something about princes leia reincarnating in the vacuum of space that just ergs me to no end how about snoke connecting kylo and reys mind together over the distance of millions of light years so they can communicate how about having luke skywalker force project himself millions of light years away force powers were just thrown around random like this was a marvel movie it was stupid and upsetting to say the least   humor there was humor everywhere and it was awkward to say the least i enjoy a few laughs but the humor was so bad i wanted to groan they literally used a your momma joke i cant even list all the bad humor not only was it not funny but it also ruined any ability to enjoy any of the deep moments or action    im sure i could list more if i really thought about it more but i think i got out my main points the funny thing is the more i look into it the more i find out i dont like i feel like this movie could be put into a college film class study on how to make the worst movie ever
Jul 13 2018,negative,totally forgettable with poorly written characters and bad acting by almost everyone in the film even worse now that time has passed since the excitement of opening weekend
Jul 13 2018,negative,dont watch it it will ruin star wars for you boycott the next ones
Jul 13 2018,negative,spoiler alert  to kill off luke in episode 8 was a mistake i have never criticized anything in any star wars movie but when you think of star wars the first character you think of is luke skywalker to bring him back in 8 just to kill him off was the stupidest idea ever i can see it happening for episode 9 of course to finish off the saga but what is the point in doing it with another full movie left to go i dont really care what anyone says to argue this point or justify it including the director or fans of the movieit was simplya mistake rest of the movie was okay adding the character of rose seemed forced and unnecessary to me the character wasnt that interesting or important to the story  good job developing characters like leia poe and ray and as always special effects were good they epic scene at the end where they try to shoot down luke with all the fire power the first order can dish out would have been a classic scene if it was actually luke thereit would have been epicbut alas lukes character wasnt actually there and his development in the story is completely wasted considering all he has been through in the previous movies in summary an average movie in comparison to the other star wars movies and still fun to watch but  a black shadow on the franchise for taking away luke who is the heart and soul of the 9 episodes outside of darth vader live long in the force luke
Jul 13 2018,negative,the only reason to like this movie is as a proxy fight for your misguided political agenda the story is poorly constructed and gives a jarring experience there is active anticonsistency with the rest of the series the entire thing is really embarrassing
Jul 13 2018,positive,i liked it im not gonna sweatily type paragraphs on why its such a masterpiece or why it ruined star wars as a whole im just keeping my opinion simple this time
Jul 13 2018,negative,this is absolutely the worst star wars movie ever im a big fan of sw and disney and i liked what they have done up until this garbage was unleashed upon us not only did this movie trash everything that was set up in fa but it obliterated the sw universe and original characters all for subverting the audience and inserting personal agendas where it doesnt belong i wish this movie didnt exist i hope disney is listening and will do a major course correction in ix help us jj abrams youre our only hope
Jul 13 2018,negative,worst star wars movie ever there is nothing good about this film
Jul 13 2018,negative,terrible movie luke skywalker wasnt luke i know in the origi
Jul 13 2018,negative,star wars the last straw
Jul 13 2018,negative,the movie itself is pretty much different from other star wars movies which in itself is not a problem it can bring in new viewers it can introduce some new styles and features that can work and it does at some point so that part is fine  the issues is actually with the basics i think if you can keep 3 rules in check then a film ina series of films in the same universe is great1 keep the rules of reality 2 keep the rules of the universe that the film is placed in 3 tell a good story with good characters for these points star wars the last jedi fails in every aspect it does not hold the basic logic of reality like physics if the script demands it it does not utilize the previously established rules and inventions in the star wars universe instead it introduces a lot of new ones which are totally idiotic andor not explained also some of these ruin the logic of the acts of the characters in the previous films as well on the story side it is a mess we are jumping all around the places and times usually it is not even clear what is happening after what in the different places we are watching and what is taking hours or days or weeks or just minutes characters act differently they learn the same lessons as before or learn nothing just suddenly act differently  i think the main coincept behind the whole movie was to destroy what jj built in the force awakens so we tear down all the misteries that we had from the previous film or simply forget them while not establishing any new ones literally i dont care about the next episode because there is nothing to think about everything seems to be perfectly known and predictable as the movie ends  why i am not giving it a complete zero is because the movie itself can be enjoyable it is spectacular many visually great scenes but not much content behind it at least for a star wars fan it feels more like a transformers movie  all in all enjoyable especially if you are not a big star wars geek but otherwise forgetable
Jul 12 2018,negative,such a disappointment  half the move is one big plot hole  lets just tackel the big ones  first is that the first time anyone has ever thought to ram a smaller ship into a bigger one at light speed  i mean we had 2 movies trying to figure out how to kill two different death stars and all this time they could have just rammed it with a ship at light speed  i mean really  3 of the smaller ships ran out of fule and just died  they could have turned around and light speeded into the star destroyers  what a waste  second half the entire movie can be cut because it does not add to the plot  cut out the entire part where finn leaves for his side mission  it was boring and it didnt help in any way  if you think about it finn was the biggest villin of the movie  he got more people killed than anyone
Jul 12 2018,negative,absolute trash nonsensical plot insanely poor character writing a pathetic tarnishing of the franchise filled to the brim with unfunny realism breaking jokes its so bad i dont think anyone could be interested in see how this all ends at this point
Jul 12 2018,positive,the more i watch this movie the more not bad it is the cinematography is really amazing not to mention the creativity of the the new planets some characters are a little annoying but daisy ridley is actually a phenomenal actress and rey is an interesting character sadly we were rid of snoke rather quickly but curious to see how bens inner conflict will manifest itself overall not a bad piece of work
Jul 12 2018,negative,a day after watching the second installment of the new star wars trilogy i thought to myself this film was almost terrible i liked daisy ridleys performance mark hamill when he was allowed to be mark hamill and i thought kylo ren played by adam driver had some good moments beyond that i felt that this was not a film made for star wars fans  and thats a big problem its been said all over the internet of course that rian johnson ignored the setup put in place by jj abrams and basically made it up as he went but what i will say is that i went into the theater expecting a number of things and got none of them i liked the force awakens because it was a step in the right direction and because of that i went to see the last jedi but the second movie was not only a step in the wrong direction it was a step off a cliff the greatest failure of the last jedi was that it went out of its way to make me not care about the next movie and that was not something i was expecting from a movie in the middle of a trilogy i hope disney gets its act together i love star wars but i do not love what i am seeing now
Jul 12 2018,negative,too many plot holes lack of planning between episodes 7 and 8 lackluster characters and character development and pointless subplots all combine to make this a disappointment for the newest installment of a much beloved franchise  they would have done better plagiarising an eu story or maybe even a webbased fanfic
Jul 12 2018,negative,although this movie has the best cinematography of the entire franchise rian johnsons the last jedi just feels very messy rian johnson tried to make the movie suprising by constantly doing the exact opposite of what he was setting up but it ultimately felt really sloppy the movie spends a lot of time with storylines that lead to nowhere luke skywalkers is very different from the previous movies which didnt have to be a bad thing but there werent really any good reasons given why he became the way he is in this movie many times when the movie became interesting it turned around and did something odd and boring new ideas are briefly explored but the movie isnt very new and refreshing as many claim it to be the movie didnt spark any interest inside of me to watch any more of these movies since its not really setting up anything interesting or new
Jul 12 2018,negative,i am a huge star wars fanatic and honestly a fanboy but when episode  came out at first i was so excited to finally see a star wars film in theatre for the first time and it was a huge disappointment and at the time i thought it was the worst star wars film yet i still think its horrible but this is a close one for the worst the only parts i liked involved kylo ren even then it wasnt that good but compared to the rest of the film and episode 7 they were the best scenes in both films the tone of the film and incompetence of the director starts right off the bat when the scroll comes up and you find out that the new order has taken over the entire galaxy out of nowhere and the resistance is now galaxywide generic rebels now just because you destroyed a capital of a nation doesnt mean the entire nation will fall and just surrender snoke why was he even a character luke wasted opportunity and ruins the lore and character in this one film johnson is by far the most incompetent director in the 21st century he is worse than george lucas this film along with episode 7 is worse than episode 1 or 2 because at least 12 and 3 are actually original and are somewhat enjoyable 7 and 8 are just lazy ripoffs of the original movies i honestly only went to go see episode 8 because i thought it would have been better than episode 7 but i guess i was wrong the only good thing about this film is with what they did with kyle as he does what vader could not i must reiterate that this movies only ruins established lore of the saga because johnson wanted to have cool looking scenes and have wow shots for who i dont know most of the wow shots are done to impress children or people who are mentally incompetent
Jul 12 2018,negative,the last jedi is a mess and a terrible addition to the once great sky walker saga large plot holes unlikeable cast this movie doesnt make you mad doesnt make you angry it makes you furious and frustrated with the current disney star wars would not recommend it will ruin star wars for you
Jul 12 2018,negative,plot misses the mark by a mile  rian johnson totally ruined the movie and possibly more  humor was misplaced  killing off luke that way was disrespectful to fans  why kill off snoke after building up a potentially awesome villain  where did leia get her godlike powers to survive being blasted into space  stupid stupid stupid  ugh
Jul 12 2018,positive,i loved this movie  i thought that rian did a fantastic job in creating characters who had depth and in exploring the relationships between the characters  this is definitely a thinking persons version of start wars  this is definitely not a movie for navel gazing yahoos who prefer their characters with big boobs possibly and apron and a plot low on talking high on grunting and  guns  i have enjoyed every star wars experience from 1977 and cant honestly say i actually had flutters of excitement and anticipation while watching this film  there were no character assassinations think some peoples watch too many conspiracy theories but just a grown up story in my favourite galaxy far far away  as encouraged by my favourite podcast if you hated loathed and are in a world of pain as this movie ruined your childhood then you were never a fan maybe just a wanna ben cool kid wanting to hang out with the fan think its  time to build a bridge and get over it then burn that bridge  so you wont  be tempted to cross it again  well done rian cant wait for your next star wars instalment
Jul 12 2018,positive,loved it hamill was ace
Jul 12 2018,negative,i went to see this movie with my roommates and i was really not too happy with it the visual effects were amazing seeing as disney had more money than god at this point thats only fitting the acting was with several major exceptions fairly good but the writing pacing and even the overarching plot were downright awful  the only part of this movie that i truly enjoyed was seeing the look on luke skywalkers mark hamill face when he saw his trusty droid companion r2 again for the first time the rest of it was just absolutely awful wouldnt recommend
Jul 11 2018,negative,what can i say that hasnt already been said its a terrible movie character development doesnt make any sense luke  leia serve no real purpose rey is the infallible messiah of the star wars universe ive no motivation to see the third movie once its completed ill only watch it if it gets added to netflix
Jul 11 2018,negative,star wars needs to get the politics out of there movies its making them horrible films
Jul 11 2018,negative,very bad movie snoke didnt matter kylo ren is not a believable bad guy needs his mask luke needs a real battle scene the whole part of the movie at the gambling planet was meaningless why was poe mansplaining all the time he was a good character
Jul 11 2018,negative,literally nothing happened in the movie just the killing off of a major character try used the movie to make a political statement also the timeline doesnt match up of does she become a full jedi in about 2 days if even that
Jul 11 2018,negative,a hot mess that leaves the plots of the previous iteration unanswered and does not fit into the themes of the previous movies in the franchise
Jul 11 2018,negative,a terrible addition to the star wars franchise and i can barely call it a star wars film if you just watch the movies it is probably fine but those who have read the books and delved into the lore will be disgusted by this movie to think we lost 20 years of work and effort into expanding the star wars lore and that all gets thrown away for this trash
Jul 11 2018,negative,cinematography was nice but this movie was awful everything the force awakens set up was destroyed by the last jedi to top this all off i never write reviews but the hatred i have for this movie would turn me to the dark side i feared watching this movie because i new this movie would make or break the trilogy lea flying led to anger green milk turned to hate luke dying led to suffering
Jul 11 2018,negative,when i first saw the last jedi i would say i liked it kinda i but the more i thought about it the more i realized there was actually a lot i didnt like   i liked it for a scifi film but i dont like it for a star wars film if that makes any sense and my real issue with this movie was the way ruin johnson took luke skywalkers character i completely disagree with it  and refuse to accept it lol i know a lot of fans hated the force awakens but i actually liked it aside from hans fate that is but who wants to see these beloved characters go and i could put that a side i just cant do it with the last jedi   how can you take the optimistic hero who knew without a doubt there was still good in vader and wouldnt give up on him even knowing the horrible things hes done become this bitter old man that felt his nephew turning to the darkside so he crept into his tent at night to kill him in his sleep and doesnt fear lead to the darkside fear is the path to the dark side fear leads to anger anger leads to hate hate leads to suffering shouldnt ruin johnson know this  out of fear that ben was turning to the darkside he was going to kill him um no luke would never do that luke would find a way or try to to at least reach him but then i guess this film wouldnt exist lol it would be a whole other movie  lol i also take issue with killing him off i mean with the passing of carrie fisher there is no longer anyone from the original story droids dont count in episode 9 we have no skywalker left to finish the skywalker saga and kylo ren is a solo which makes me sad even if luke is brought back as a force ghost it still isnt the same    the other issue i had was rays parents are no ones as in nobody special i really hope that was a lie i feel like if she turned out to be like the granddaughter of obi wan or a relation to quigon jinn hell i would have even been happy if she were a palpatine lmao i feel like that would have takin the sting out of losing everyone from the original films now i know carrie fisher didnt die in tlj but she is gone in real life rip and i have no idea what they are going to do with her character but i think this also makes it that much worse that we lost luke   i saw this in the theatre once and i did buy a digital copy for my dad but i havent watched it since it came out in the theatre and im not sure i ever want to see it again and i have watched the originals and prequels i cant even tell you how many times i have seen the force awakens maybe like 4 times and rogue one about the same amount maybe even more i have also watched the clone wars all seasons  movie multiple times star wars rebels at least 3 times all the way through the last jedi just makes me sad it doesnt feel like a star wars movie to me its a goodnot great scifi film just not a good star wars film
Jul 11 2018,negative,movie is trash disney jj kk and rian ruined star wars as bad as the prequels were at least they were very creative and original this new universe is souless junk
Jul 11 2018,positive,a really amazing star wars film that reignited my star wars fandom seriously i hadnt bought an eu book since rots bc i thought it was dead tfa was boring and overly nostalgic this film inspired me to immediately buy new canon books and merch like never before love it
Jul 11 2018,negative,a pretty trainwreck terrible pacing unnecessary subplot destroys any tension huge waste of creative capital no character development and so many gotcha moments that its painful    characters literally hide their plan just to create synthetic movie tension  this movie doesnt set up an interesting third installment of a trilogy it ruined the overarcing plot with by changing the director who got creative control  its on netflix its worth seeing but i wouldnt watch it twice
Jul 11 2018,negative,lets be honest you dont need to be an expert in movies or star wars you dont have to the up to speed with all the star wars canon now considered legends by the new overlords to understand and realize that this movie failed to deliver the unique star wars experience rian johnson and ms kennedy used this platform to bolster their own unique political views that star wars never needed because its a general story of good and evil and the heros journey   unfortunately there is no way to repair the damage done rian johnson bashed our most beloved character luke and provided a narrative with so many gaping holes and extremes that make no sense why didnt holto share her plans with poe  the gang  i am afraid there is no one in their circles to repair this chapter of the saga not even jj abrams who lets be honest is part of the problem after all the only thing he did was to just rehash episode 4 and sprinkle new characters that are utterly 2 dimensional and johnson continued this with his rehashing of elements from episode 5  6   but the most offensive aspect i take with this movie is the aftermath of it all the people in charge and who delivered this chapter to us actors included except hamill blame it on the fans that we dont understand and have prejudices apologies to kennedy and her gang in lucasfilm but a bad movie is just that a bad movie accept the reality of your failure and try to do better in the future but the problem is they dont want to instead they push bad narratives in the movies and considered themselves oscar worthy when everyone can see they dont have any love for the original characters  by now the disaster that is the last jedi only shows that wasting characters bad narratives creating a leadup to moments just to squander them shows that you do not know how to create a movie and this is precisely what they have done here   i just hope this is just a dark phase and better more creative people will be brought in who actually love star wars who will know how to create a narrative 3 dimensional characters and understand the lore and what star wars is   or shift everything and make a kotor movie for the new generation ah but wait it was already thrown in the trash by them
Jul 10 2018,negative,as a person who grew up with star wars i was 6 when the original movie came out and still have all of my original toys from the 70s and 80s i was hopeful for this trilogy and really looking forward to it the force awakens setup and amazing possible storyline for several characters but the last jedi just failed in every way imaginable you never give all control to just one guy especially someone who has no clue about the star wars legacy this movie failed in so many ways its hard to count them all mainly reys parents could have been epic but was an utter disappointment and let down who spoke was and where came from another complete let down and a huge hole left to explain rian johnson and kathleen kennedy failed at this movie and i am afraid will continue to fail if left in charge of star wars is a space opera based around the skywalker family all 6 movies so far were based on that they took the most optimistic character luke skywalker a new hope and turned him into a pathetic loser we could have seen or had a great experience seeing luke skywalker being the true jedi master he is but we got was the total opposite and a joke to be honest and flying liea was painful to watch any person including jedis would die instantly upon entering space unprotected past jedis died as they did in revenge of the sith but some how liea survives i dont buy it so thank you disney for ruining one of the greatest movies franchises and stories ever told great job
Jul 10 2018,negative,ill give the movie 2 stars  one for looking pretty and the other in sympathy for adam driver who did much with very little and deserves better  i hated this movie  the story makes no sense the characters are bland and disinteresting the protagonist lacks a personality and any charisma  i heartily wished kylo had defeated the whole cast in the first act and moved onto more interesting things like lawn maintenance  luke skywalkers characterisation was a travesty and im not surprised to read the ot fans are outraged  what did disney think was going to happen  im not seeing ep 9 im not boycotting anything id just rather not waste my time
Jul 10 2018,negative,hardly worth watching
Jul 10 2018,positive,it was good porgs awesome was kind of suck causes of side quest but pretty good
Jul 10 2018,positive,has its moments but overall is a big disappointment doesnt give much deserved answers to some very important questions and kills off characters when were just starting to get invested in them
Jul 10 2018,positive,much potential the themes and visuals were on point but the way the story plays out is very disappointing forced and at times misguided
Jul 10 2018,negative,wtfwas that  last jedi is unfortunately terrible seems like it was written by someone who doesnt even like star wars let alone understand it  terrible writing lots of plot holes and makes fundamental changes to the characters and the universe  acting was fine cinematography was good but overallwhewwhat a stinker
Jul 10 2018,negative,this movie was not a star wars movie useless story arcs the murdering of the major plotlines from the previous movie its almost as if the director and writer didnt know star wars or how and why the setting became pipular let me put it this way this movie makes the prequels look good
Jul 10 2018,negative,nothing good ever in this
Jul 10 2018,negative,felt like  the entire movie was written by a focus group terrible
Jul 10 2018,negative,easily my least favorite of all of the prequelsequels so far id rather listen to jar jar binks than try to struggle with the absurdity of the plot devices used in this film theres no ill will on the director cast or crew the fault lies in whoever greenlighted a story with so many frustratingly pointless story line obstacles
Jul 10 2018,negative,this was an absolutely horrible movie it destroyed the entire franchise for me and i have been a fan since star wars came out in 1977
Jul 10 2018,negative,i entered the start of the movie with an open mind but man was this movie bathit crazy i couldnt help but smirk when princess leia awoke from death while floating in space  and started to magically fly  i couldnt help but laugh when luke skywalker is portrayed as a literal man cave dwelling heavy handed metaphor for the fanbase i couldnt help but roll my eyes at every scene with commander menopause purple hair and the out of control irresponsible meat headed fly boy poe  i was ready to like this movie and wanted to i really did but injecting the film with so much agenda driven identity politics was huge mistake  and this is coming from someone who calls himself a democratic socialist     if this is the future of the star wars series then no thanks i like my scifi to be as far from the current political landscape as possible
Jul 10 2018,negative,ive never rated a movie on this site before but i hated this movie so much i felt the need to create an account just so i could rate this film one star
Jul 10 2018,negative,why not a fanatic i have always been a star wars fan and was really looking forward to the last jedi i avoided all spoilers and went to screening just a few days after it was released    unfortunately despite trying to remain positive throughout the viewing ultimately i was left hugely disappointed for me the movie was totally superficial a good looking movie that  lacked any real soul or depth in either the story or the characters     that was the real problem for me star wars or any good movie has always been character driven for me i feel a connection to the characteristics and become invested in their story the last jedi had the opposite affect on me characters that i had been interested in like rey finn and poe and even long time favourites like luke skywalker came across as quite plastic and to be honest almost unlikeable by halfway through the movie their story had little suspense because i no longer cared what happened to the characters    after watching the movie i was quite interested in others opinions and was quite surprised by the positive reviews that it received from critics especially reviews that praised it for its originality and for taking chances i know it tried to shock at different stages but it came across as being cheap and gimmicky rather than anything of real substance in fact i wished that they had followed through with some of these scenes they could have made some of these characters more compelling maybe even making kylo ren a formidable villain    overall the movie was just disappointing or as some of my friends put it a lemon i do realise that half the viewing population loved the movie and to those people more power to you in fact i feel a bit jealous because i wished that i enjoyed it as well but i cant recommend this movie as anything more than a b movie time filler
Jul 9 2018,negative,garbage  rian johnson totally destroyed the star wars universe
Jul 9 2018,negative,this movie is an absolute piece of trash horrible star wars movie id much rather watch the mediocrity that is the prequels at least they had world building character development and pushed the plot forward with every movie this garbage on the other hand seemingly abandons good story telling for shock value and twists congrats rian johnson on your writing great plot twists too bad you had to make a terrible movie to get them on screen
Jul 9 2018,positive,i finally saw a star wars movie i actually liked i was pretty comfortable with nearly everything and i thought that the director along with the crew did a fantastic job i studied art and read some books unrelated to star wars and i was honestly in the right mindset to watch this movie i really enjoyed it because my family and i had a good time watching this film its a movie about family and philosophy and it might or might not stand the test of time but i approve of the films message thanks guys
Jul 9 2018,negative,this movie is god awful the only saving grace is adam driver kyle ren the characters are boring and most of them cant act ie kelly tran john boyeaga  daisy ridley the plot sucked  the comedic breaks were the opposite of funny 
Jul 9 2018,negative,the best part of this movie is the production value  it looks good  as stills frames the movie is fantastic    unfortunately the plot and characters are dead on arrival  the best characters are rey and kylo ren and they have some interesting moments    everything and everyone else is poorly written and confused  none of the plots make sense  none of the character motivations make sense  the film contradicts other star wars and also itself
Jul 9 2018,positive,one of the best star wars films ever made period it develops the established characters puts luke skywalker in the best most realistic place he could be in his life disregards all the unnecessary characters that were introduced in the last film and most importantly it takes a major dump on prequel fanboys expectations
Jul 9 2018,negative,saw the movie twice in the cinema after seeing it a first time and feeling very underwhelmed i went back to see if there was something i was missing the critics were raving about this brilliant reinvention of star wars nope the movie is pseudointellectual postmodern garbage ryan johnson has to be the most overrated director in hollywood it is like he wanted to show everyone how smart he was by unravelling the longstanding use of joseph campbells hero motif in star wars story telling yes visually movie excels but peel past this veneer and you will discover that the plot meanders the scripting sucks the character arcs are regressive and the film is out of kilter with previous star wars films including its immediate predecessor the force awakens even if jj abrams left an inconvenient bunch of mystery boxes such as who are reys parents and why did she have visions when she touched lukes original blue lightsaber just cant pretend they werent there or dismiss them worse of all courtesy of johnson luke skywalker has been reduced from hero to loser why because according to johnson everything is contextual there is no real good or evil if like luke skywalker you hang around long enough you will realise that the heros journey is pointless and what is old becomes new again so the inevitable option is to give up confusingly however rey becomes some kind of hero without ever really earning the right how does she become a jedi master with almost no training particularly if she is a no body this is not a renewal of the franchise even ignoring its unnecessary inclusion of antifa politics the films let the past die philosophy is is an arrogant and disrespectful junking of tradition and the many fans bought up on star wars pop culture maybe many of these fans are man babies and maybe we should quit calling what are really just laser swords light sabers but if your agenda is want to destroy fantasy and pop culture beware the consequences many of us simply wont watch star wars anymore
Jul 9 2018,negative,one of the worst movies i have ever seen a complete disrespect to all the sw lore maybe rian johnson belives sw is some sort of marvel movie just special effects and childish stories who knows if he just intended to create a mockery of the entire franchise
Jul 9 2018,negative,worst star wars movie ever phantom menace is a masterpiece in comparison to this mess
Jul 9 2018,negative,this addition to the star wars main canon sported a few moments of pure star wars magic the vast majority of it is really hyperactive storytelling poorly done without pathos for the characters you started to love in the force awakens
Jul 9 2018,negative,somehow the first order is controlling the galaxy not explained why luke is treated like dirt by the makers of this movie its so stupid luke didnt grow into that kind of character from the old trilogy luke is supposed to be   the most powerful jedi of all time and his power was not utilized or really shown the guy has taken on armies in the comics and  its stupid how they underpowered him what they do with luke in the end is the worst thing they could have done    the movie tries to be funny but it isnt i didnt laugh once  its a stupid disgrace to all the star wars films and easily the worst
Jul 9 2018,negative,love watching mark finally being luke again after 30 yearsbut his character was torn apart  ever since the beginning of the movie you can tell that the writers didnt care about the fans or even legacy his franchise has tossing away an heirloom like anakins lightsaber disregarding everythingi mean thats not luke skywalker thats not luke who went to save his father from the emperorwe all understand this is a new trilogy theres new characters and all new plots new storiesbut you cant disregard the past that easily and stupidly like this movie has envisioned us to accept luke  alsofirst star wars movie in which theres no saber duellike really  i certainly hope kathleen kennedy is removed from everything related to star warstheres no need for a great franchise like sw to get all political
Jul 9 2018,negative,thank you for turning a classic franchise into a sjw mess
Jul 9 2018,positive,a good star wars movie but just missing the consistency to make it a great one great visuals sound and direction
Jul 9 2018,positive,disney knows what they are doing 
Jul 9 2018,negative,while the movie is visually stunning and contains a few compelling characters it suffers from a severe identity crisis the theme of the first two acts was subverting expectations yet the final act of the movie throws that idea out the window and fulfills nearly every expectation but does it so late and sudden that it gives the viewer whiplash it starts trying not to be empire strikes back but gives up on that and begins throwing empire allusions left and right it cant find the right pace and the 25 hour run time drags on because of that the tonal shifts are anything but subtle going from pensive to comedic to action filled in a matter of minutes over and over again the movie lacks nuance cant find a theme to stick to and is 45 minutes longer than it needs to be it doesnt ruin star wars but it is a mediocre film being marketed as a blockbuster masterpiece with a production crew too prideful to admit their mistakes
Jul 9 2018,negative,news critics and some people need to stop trying to defend this pile of crap worst star wars movie rian was trying to appease this snow flake generation he should never be allowed near the sw universe again
Jul 9 2018,negative,a disgrace to the franchise as a whole and one of the worst mainstreams ive ever watched ratings under one star are not taken into account by the rt score so
Jul 8 2018,negative,what the hell happened to luke  how did leia float through space like that  why the hell did kylo kill his mentor snoke  cause he had a little sith crush on rey who did next to nothing in the movie except move some rocks why did this get a critic score above 90 wtf is really going on
Jul 8 2018,negative,not consistent with what the characters developed to that was not luke skywalker
Jul 8 2018,negative,even worst than the phantom menace yes the one with jar jar that movie left me outraged and i didnt enjoyed it at all the plot is boring theres is no awesome scene to save that movie like the prequals
Jul 8 2018,negative,this movie is embarrassingly awful disney has finally ruined the star wars franchise visually its pretty spectacular but the writing is just so bad giant plot holes nothing explained and they ruined luke skywalker it ultimately felt like there were about three movies compressed into one and i was being rushed through it i thought the force awakens was pretty good rogue one was where the wheels started to fall off and this one was just a complete disaster how this thing got 91 on the tomatometer completely blows my mind i will no longer trust that as a legitimate source for movie ratings
Jul 8 2018,negative,this movie is trash and dosent deserve to be a part of starwars
Jul 8 2018,positive,personally this movie was my favorite from the franchise it was different from the other movies while incorporating the steady flow of new additions from the force
Jul 8 2018,negative,star wars the last jedi straddles the seemingly impossible position of being either extremely flawed storytelling or a stroke of artistic genius adhering doggedly to its central theme of failure it is comprised of a slow moving main plot and entirely inconsequential b plots while relying heavily on the poor decision making of its central cast and supporting characters to advance the story thus the work is strangely self aware reflecting either the genius or  failure of director rian johnsons vision
Jul 8 2018,negative,cinema dumpster fire this was dreadful it only had like 2 good scenes the rest was a tangled mess of subplots and awful jokes i wish giving less than one star counted to the total audience score
Jul 8 2018,negative,easily the worst star wars movie ever made rian johnson and kathleen kennedy should be ashamed
Jul 8 2018,negative,terrible movie what was the whole point of the trip to the casino added nothing to the plot marry poppins the space witch what was that leia flying through space you know how snoke came into power and control the force in such a way that it could traverse space and join rey and kylos mind no well f u because we killed the guy like nothing we had an epic moment when finn was going to die snuffed by an unnecessary rescue why was the laser so far anyways my god so many errors i cant even think straight never see this movie
Jul 8 2018,negative,there are a few good scenes in the movie my issue with this movie was the way luke acted in this movie was very out of character killing of snoke was a shocking moment i like how he died but we know nothing about his motives and his backstory i think rian johnson thought the force awakens was to safe and he felt like i have to do most schoking he was afraid screw star wars 
Jul 8 2018,positive,nothing short of the best star wars film of all time where the force awakens called back to the original trilogy for the sake of nostalgia and foundation the last jedi calls back to it so as to subvert it the final product bravely daringly challenges its own franchise and refuses to pander to audience demands of a hollywoodtypical blockbuster instead delivering grippingly resonant writing thrillingly emotional action and jawdroppingly outstanding moments that genuinely surprised and amazed me in ways most movies dont this may not be the star wars movie purists wanted but its the one the franchise and ultimately everyone needed
Jul 8 2018,positive,beautiful imagery and a successful overarching story doesnt diminish how rian johnson rushes from one forced emotional beat to another
Jul 8 2018,positive,i like this film more then the force awakens because a least the plot was original and not a rehash of a prior movie the problem for me is the middle of the movie is just very boring the and screws with the pacing every time i watch i ding it harder to get through the second act it doesnt help thats the whole canto bight sequence amounted to nothing i personally think it was a mistake to kill of luke skywalker in the film too the action was good but the story was just meh i feel like nothing really progressed
Jul 8 2018,negative,this film totally destroys all possible storylines from episode vii and its totally nonsense for the star wars universe
Jul 8 2018,negative,with all these smart people in hollywood how is it possible to make such a poor movie  you would think that after all these years since the original star wars the movies would get better with experience technology bigger budgets etc  the special effects in the last jedi were horrible   the numerous ships popping out of hyperspace to an abrupt stop was ultra cheesyreminded me of the 50s and 60s flying saucer movie graphics  you know the cgi is bad when you get distracted by it throughout the entire movie with good cgi you might start the critiquing it but after a few scenes it is so good you forget to look for it for the rest of the movie    dont get me wrong i am a first generation star wars fan  it is not my purpose to trash the franchisei am just utterly disappointed how these mega studios and genius directors are so blind    aside from the poor cgi this movie was missing humor character charisma and a decent storyline   some of the scenes were amateurish  the casino scene was pressed and lacking lucaslike vision  the fathier horse escape scene was an insult to the audience  the red ninja guard battle had to be the worst fight choreography in the entire franchise    overall it is hard to pin down everything that was wrong in just a few paragraphs but overall it was missing what the force awakens has rey and finn together humor fun story and  lots of chewy  without harrison around to carry the franchise at least show more of chewy
Jul 8 2018,positive,while not perfect this was another excellent entry in the ongoing saga with some truly unexpected turns  it definitely left me eager to see episode ix
Jul 8 2018,negative,this movie signifies the traditional battle between elitessuits in hollywood thinking they are great when in reality the man on the street knows their own product better than they do its so bad i can sum it up with this my kids told me we dont like star wars can we watch something else to me a dad and a life long fan this speaks volumes
Jul 8 2018,negative,the visual effects are bomb and the acting was a great improvement over the childishness of the previous installment however this is very much a disney star wars movie and not a true star wars movie there is nothing to see here it is simply a space opera
Jul 8 2018,negative,copypasted from another reviewer as i completely agree  terrible writing zero character development blatant merchandise pushing and obvious political statements that make this movie seem like its not in a galaxy far away are we suppose to believe that luke who turned himself into the empire because he believed the most evil man in the galaxy still had good in him would attempt to murder his own nephew while he slept because he thought he might turn to the dark side also how did he die using the force too hard wasnt snoke using the same force power to project kylo and rey to each other how about an entire horrible and irrevalent casino scene that wouldnt have needed to happen if holdo just told everyone what she was thinking how about her staring at the escape pods getting destroyed for like 10 mins before she lightspeeds into the first order that terrible dialogue at the beginning with the prank call legitimately funny the first viewing but stupid when you realize they dont take themselves seriously for the duration of the movie as well how this movie got over 90 critic score is one of the most confusing things ive ever experienced
Jul 8 2018,negative,yummmy yummmy yummmy disney put star wars in the trash cans tummy
Jul 8 2018,negative,i hated to give this a bad review because everyone in the movie was fabulous  this rating sits all on the head of rian johnson  how the heck did he get the gig  he obviously hates the fans as his ego is so astronomical he abrogated his responsibility to passionate fans  because after all isnt that what sequels are about  furthermore by disrupting the continuity of the story  he left so much unanswered while leaving  fans going wth this is just my personal essay on the jerk who spells his name with an i not y
Jul 8 2018,neutral,the last jedi gives a nostalgia feel to lots of fans and has some amazing visual effects but due to sloppy writing and pacing lots of people have described this movie as the worst instalment in the series
Jul 7 2018,negative,to me it was a big mess it had no back story for either kylo nor ray and thats what we wanted the most in the movie  we wanted to see how ben solo became kylo rin and how the knights of rin were formed as for ray we wanted it to be like when yoda was training luke in empire and learn more of her family history instead we got luke who wants to hang him self the last jedi was pretty much hay lets drive this ship till its out of gasoline  as for fin and rose that part in the movie was the worst every time it jumped back to fin and rose you just wanted to leave  its just had no point the movie had a horrible intro it should have taken place a year after the force awakens not 30 minutes later  i say episode 8 never happened and we remake it
Jul 7 2018,negative,horrible movie that wrecked the franchise trashed everything weve come to love about star wars not to mention every plot point set up by the preceding movie the force awakens plays with the audience makes stupid choices and just plain makes no sense much of the time a big expensive waste of film
Jul 7 2018,positive,im old enough to have been a 20 year old in a long line waiting for the opening of the return of the jedi and found myself being interviewed by a tv channel so ive been invested in this saga a very long time  i get that every little detail matters to a lot of people  but what matters to me more is how i feel when the end credits roll and the messages and morals and bits of wisdom tucked into the story there are certainly more things id have liked to see especially luke training rey in the force  but when all was said and done i loved luke rising to the occasion and projecting himself into the battle sacrificing himself so everyone could get away he was able to pass into the force full of peace  then we see the youngsters telling the legend of luke and you can see that that take was going to spread and bring life to the resistance  and that left my heart full and satisfied and thats what matters to me
Jul 7 2018,negative,too political for me
Jul 7 2018,negative,thanks you ruined star wars disney
Jul 7 2018,positive,lifelong sws fan original came out on my 13th bday was in love with luke skywalkertlj brought him from almost toogoodtobetrue teen heartthrob hero to a true legend who experienced the entire range of very identifiable human emotion loved the farmboy from tatooine even more after he forceprojected across the galaxy to say goodbye to his sister and try to salvage her broken son dont understand how anyone could see his last stand as anything less than totally badassed opinions from a very vocal group notwithstanding tlj gave me the fan experience 40 years later that i had as that gobsmacked 13 year old watching star wars it will never be a new hope to me in the summer of 77
Jul 7 2018,positive,fun installment  does the saga justice
Jul 7 2018,negative,why did the intentionally twist luke skywalkers character into the exact opposite of everything he ever was what was the point of that
Jul 7 2018,negative,a failure the worst star wars movie ever made a completely moronic middle chapter that erases all plot arcs and character development a character assassination of luke skywalker and the traditions of the previous star wars films and shows watch and then forget itkill it if you have to
Jul 7 2018,negative,the movie that killed or at the very least crippled star wars boring plots inconsistent characters shoehorned socialpolitical commentary takes shots at its own fans and is just generally unentertaining backlash from this movie has led to solo flopping sw toys games and book sales all declining and a fractured fanbase    gave it 12 star extra just for kylo ren being an interesting character a single good plot twist and some nice artistic touches
Jul 7 2018,negative,what an unbelievable disappointment  i dont know where to start  from throwing away the story elements and characters introduced in the force awakens to badly reinventing the manner and extent to which force effects could be manifested in the galaxy  why bother making a multifilm story arc if youre going to make uninspired detours that abandon foreshadowing and kill off potential foils for the heroes  we the audience bought into the storyline introduced by the force awakens and this movie threw it all in the trash can  i find it utterly ironic that the critics consensus on rotten tomatoes says that this movie honors the sagas rich legacy when in reality it is fundamentally disrespectful to the franchise
Jul 7 2018,negative,rushed  the special effects where horrible
Jul 7 2018,negative,worst of the series by far
Jul 7 2018,positive,i didnt watch this movie for eight months its the first star wars movie i didnt see it in the theatre because audience criticism was so negative now watching it for free on netflix i realize this criticism was undeserved not the best star wars but much more in line with the lore than phantom menace and the other prequels     i grew up believing i could be luke skywalker  the representation of the force in this movie did not betray the expectations that i had grown up with it was in line with the spiritual aspect of star wars while expanding on it dont get me started about midichlorians that was an abomination lukes departure is similar to how kenobi and yoda both died i dont get how people dont see that     the political undertones werent any different than all the other star wars movies were at the time i didnt sense a huge political agenda threaded through this movie remember how anakin tells the smoker to rethink his life what about the cantina on mos eisley  you will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy than in a bar back in 1977 so i wasnt offended it wasnt necessary and if i was the editor i would have cut it out i thought the chewbacca scene was cute  but i didnt think he was going to go all vegan on us    people that love this movie are wrong but so are people that hate it it is a solid 3 and a half stars some of the plot points are a little thin slowspeed star destroyer chase why not just outflank and surround them do they need to go to canto bight probably not i might have written that differently but it doesnt ruin the whole movie and who gets thrown in jail for a parking violation why dont they just tow the vehicle off the beach rose isnt as annoying as jar jar binks not even close the movie is not slathered in oneliners either it actually is pretty onpar with other star wars movies leia flying around  not exactly as the reviewers have stated it i saw it as the force acting to protect her she is anakins daughter this is the only time shes used the force in five movies everyone gets bent out of shape    and snokes death well maybe he should have taken lukes class on the balance between the light and the dark might have seen that coming a little better dont put a bunch of jedi in a room with light sabers someones going to get cut in half    im disappointed that i didnt see this in the theatre its not the 91 that the critics wrote but neither is it 46 audience score a solid 75 meaning they would have to change 25 of this movie to make it perfect
Jul 7 2018,positive,had to throw in a 5 star review to help throw off the star wars geeks attacks on this awesome movie the critics got this one right cant wait to see it again when it hits hbo
Jul 7 2018,negative,this movie destroyed the star wars series  if you wanted to kill star wars this is how you do it  plot is ridiculous and lacking in creativity full of political agendas and nobody cares
Jul 7 2018,negative,an assassination attempt on the star wars legacy that comes very close to succeeding
Jul 7 2018,positive,the last jedi was willing to take risks that alone makes it better than the force awakens but it still has issues the main criticisms i have with star wars as a whole in this new disney era is the modern dialogue and comedy its too on the nose too marvel apart from the middle act being bogged down by finn and roses excellent adventure i was at least interested in one thing which is more i can say of the previous film and that is the development between kylo and rey while i feel the direction it could have gone would have been much better it was still enjoyable to see develop alsoi felt mark hamill did a great job in his role everyone expected to see luke as a legendary master of the force but this twist was quite nice and welcoming the broken mentor is a classic staple but its done well here overall its not as bad as everyone says the humor kills it and the pacing sucks in most places but it has some things worth checking out
Jul 6 2018,positive,i like how star wars is trying to take a different turn in things and letting the old die i feel people are struggling to comprehend this which is completely understandable but i think this movie might get more appreciation after the 9th movie comes out if people come into this thinking of seeing a dank star wars movie then they are wrong as a movie it is well done with twists and turns that will have an amazing ending in star wars ix
Jul 6 2018,negative,what a crap movie were my exact thought on this movie the forced humour  mary sue arc casino social justice bs dumb leadoon story lines visual great though
Jul 6 2018,negative,this movie is full of plot holes and bad characters
Jul 6 2018,positive,fantastic film best part is that it enraged the incel shutins who cant cope with women in strong roles    more seriously this is my secondfavourite star wars movies because it finally breaks out of the limited repetitive plots laid out by lucas
Jul 6 2018,positive,an absolute spectacle the last jedi takes the star wars franchise in a fresh new direction that is very welcome to fans and audiences alike stunning visuals a rich plot the return of old beloved heroes and worthy new characters to pass on the legacy of the franchise a must watch
Jul 6 2018,negative,it looks good in terms of special effects but underneath this is a very bad movie filled with massive plotholes weird sideplots and a huge lack of character development
Jul 6 2018,negative,it just aint the forcey
Jul 6 2018,negative,a pointless story that serves more as propaganda than a respectable star wars movie from vast amounts of wasted time on storylines and characters that dont move the plot forward to the vastly unbelievable combat scenes this is the worst of the star wars movies it barley passes as a bmovie interpretation
Jul 6 2018,negative,feels sacrilegious to the original story also this movie feels sacrilegious to the new trilogy as well somehow
Jul 6 2018,negative,who was that old man because it wasnt luke skywalker this movie took my favorite character from the originals and turned him into somebody i cant recognize even mark hammil hated his new character and that shouldve been a hint to rian johnson that things would not end up well now johnson is having to address fans all the time due to backlash note to writersdirectors just because you have plot twist after plot twist in your films does not qualify them to be great movies stick to what has brought you over 40 years and dont ruin it instead
Jul 6 2018,negative,the movie was decent but its a horrible star wars movie rose is annoying luke isnt himself and a lot was too slowpaced and didnt make sense kylo ren was the only plus he was interesting and unique other then that second worst star wars movie after episode ii
Jul 6 2018,negative,a bunch of contrived situational suspense action scenes linked together with no story   making a starwars movie that people hate is hard to do quite the accomplishment  also funny to see the discrepancy between the official reviewers and the people  just shows that disney has a crazy amount of influence over the industry and people these reviewers are scared to be honest
Jul 6 2018,negative,two stars because it is an absolutely beautiful movie the visuals are perfect however i dont even consider myself to be a hardcore fan and i was really disappointed in the way characters were treated the new character ray is like a superhuman with the force combat and as a pilot i like her but who can relate to such a bad ass not only that but what about the other jedis who actually had to be trained the tomatometer score btw what a joke i no longer have any confidence in that rotten tomatoes has been bought
Jul 6 2018,positive,decent addition to the star wars franchise
Jul 6 2018,negative,this episode seemed to be made with little adherance to the established lore where force ghosts can now summon lightning which would have been useful in earlier movies and characters behave like someone else or just do nonsensical things for example luke was mad about being found when he purposely left a map in r2d2 so he could be found i tried hard to like it as i generally love most of the star wars episodes before this one but i found this movie to be too poorly written to like even a little the one thing i cant take away from this film is the cinematography that was actually pretty good as much as it pains me to say its a trash movie overall
Jul 6 2018,negative,i give it a half star only because it is star wars canon that is all
Jul 6 2018,negative,if anyone is reading this  watching this movie in theatres is what it feels like to get hustled and robbed this is what backstabbing feels like without the knife   terrible actors terrible writers just terrible the whole way disgrace to the original gangstas who made star wars come to fruition disgrace to its loyal fans   i had written a much longer variation of this review  but its pointless at this time the damage is done to its fans
Jul 5 2018,negative,terrible writing zero character development blatant merchandise pushing and obvious political statements that make this movie seem like its not in a galaxy far away are we suppose to believe that luke who turned himself into the empire because he believed the most evil man in the galaxy still had good in him would attempt to murder his own nephew while he slept because he thought he might turn to the dark side also how did he die using the force too hard wasnt snoke using the same force power to project kylo and rey to each other  how about an entire horrible and irrevalent casino scene that wouldnt have needed to happen if holdo just told everyone what she was thinking how about her staring at the escape pods getting destroyed for like 10 mins before she lightspeeds into the first order that terrible dialogue at the beginning with the prank call legitimately funny the first viewing but stupid when you realize they dont take themselves seriously for the duration of the movie as well how this movie got over 90 critic score is one of the most confusing things ive ever experienced
Jul 5 2018,negative,it wont let me give it zero stars and it wont let me write a book to list all the flaws
Jul 5 2018,negative,the story is convoluted and lazy rey is boring as a protagonist leia is ridiculous
Jul 5 2018,negative,i did not like this one very much i thought there were some parts that were so unrealistic and stupid i think that with han solo the movie lost a lot of its comedy relief
Jul 5 2018,positive,my favorite star wars movie of all time 
Jul 5 2018,negative,just awful filled full of dead end plot points to much political bs and completely ruined like will never watch a sw movie again thanks ryan
Jul 5 2018,negative,ruined the francise
Jul 5 2018,negative,this movie was a contrived cash cow by disney it wasnt shit here is evidence for rey being a mary sue a woman who grew up on a desert planet can swim perfectly while finn cant
Jul 5 2018,negative,this felt more like fan fic than an actual part of the series
Jul 5 2018,negative,ridiculous bewildering mess of a movie
Jul 5 2018,negative,the movie was terrible and has essentially ruined any enthusiasm that i had for star wars going forward i didnt even bother going to see solo a star wars story because of how the last jedi turned out    aside from all the plot holes in the last jedi the many dropped sub stories that were started in episode 7 the forced politicization and all the many other flaws     the one big thing that killed it for me was seeing how they treated luke they turned the most hopeful jedi who saw good in the most evil villain the galaxy had ever seen vader into a curmudgeonly old pessimist who hates the jedi and all their teachings and thinks that he should murder his nephew in his sleep the second he detects a bit of darkness in him it is nothing short of a complete character assassination of a beloved hero    then luke does one fantastic force power which was cool but falls over dead because of it it made no sense the entire plot of episode 7 was to find luke before the first order could when they found him what did the rebels get out of it no real training no assistance aside from a force hologram that merely delayed the first order for ten minutes or so that is the extent of this legendary heroes contribution no they are just wiping out the characters we love in order to push us into bland characters that we dont care about    rey is a complete marie sue
Jul 5 2018,negative,how to kill a franchise  episode 1
Jul 5 2018,negative,garbage plot ruined star wars  pretty sure it was written to a 5 year old
Jul 5 2018,negative,too many plotholes from the force awakens  finn and rose subplot complete waste of time
Jul 5 2018,negative,this was such an awful film on so many levels the comedy gags ar the start were unbelievably bad  the charcters of hux holdo and rose were so badly created  the fact that without any training at all rei is the best jedi ever completely sucks  awful awful ruined the star wars universe for ever
Jul 5 2018,negative,disappointing  visually stunning but full of plot holes and discontinuities  poor writing that continually surprises the viewer by disappointing with most questions answered by saying it means nothing  little to no development of back stories  rey unrealistically perfect and has no room to grow which creates no connection by the viewer  ive enjoyed all of the expanded universe books games etc  this is the most disappointing contribution to star wars since the holiday special
Jul 5 2018,negative,its suppose to be science fiction yes but omg the pacing of this movie is too crappy needless to say how can this get 91 is beyond me sure the vfx is great and all but the writing is too cheesy it become laughable
Jul 5 2018,positive,typical star wars slow in the beginning 
Jul 5 2018,negative,unthoughtful and allows current american politics to invade the star wars universe
Jul 5 2018,negative,this was far and away the worst starwars movie ever made for reasons you can read about pretty much anywhere it completely ruined starwars for many people from killing luke to pointless sidestories that were shoehorned in to the detriment of plots like snoke to political activismin a star wars movie of all places give me a break star wars fans deserved better the critics are so wrong on this one hard to believe they werent paid to write good reviews
Jul 5 2018,positive,i guess if you are a mutant who liked the prequels youd hate this movie if you like fun science fiction with great visuals and music this is an excellent film
Jul 4 2018,negative,good thing that the people creating the new star wars movies arent the ones who started the franchise if these new movies had to stand on their own merit there would be nobody watching them 
Jul 4 2018,negative,i cant believe that i paid money to watch this garbage  the last jedi is easily the worst star wars movie ever made  im including the prequels specials cartoons and even the ewoks tv show from the 1980s    all of my hope was destroyed by watching this film  it was so bad that it took a while several days to process just how bad and viscerally offensive this film was  it ignored its protagonist rey and had her do little more than swing a saber and lift up some rocks  it injected political opinions that have no business in a star wars movie and added a bunch of scenes that dont tie particularly well with the rest of the movie    this is a hot mess that should be removed from the star wars library
Jul 4 2018,negative,just watched on netflix  as a stand alone movie there were many rushed plots that made me feel like i had missed a scene or two the jokes were flat and seemed out of place maybe they were going for a marvel feel visuals were great it felt like a collection of hastily told short stories stitched together all the characters were very shallow having only one or two main traits the ones from the force awakens had the benefit of a whole movie the ones introduced here dont have that benefit and because the plots and scenes are so rushed and under cooked i am left feeling like this movie wants me to like the characters but doesnt give a reason to all together it makes the whole production feel contrived     as a star wars fan for nearly 20 years i didnt know what to feel i liked the prequels played the games listen to the sound trackswatched the series and rogue one was quite enjoyable i hated the force awakens but whatever thisit was like watching a direct to dvd sequel of a classic disney movieit looked like star wars but none of the charm the first order is made out to be petulant or buffoons this looks like a star wars movie but doesnt feel like one thats really disheartening because rogue one told its own story and brought the visual effects thatd youd expect from a top tier production and i assumed this would be 10x better but it wasnt this felt like mulan 2 or pocahontas 2 in terms of looking like the classic but lacking the quality  im really glad i didnt pay to see this
Jul 4 2018,negative,its a fun movie but it is not star wars in fact it gleefully subverts and directly negates everything you would expect from star wars luke skywalkers character is unexplainably the complete opposite of everything that multiple films had developed it makes no sense there is virtually no character development in this movie  no motivations explanations backstories questions answered the only character that gets some development is kylo ren rey is still an enigma the perfect flawless character who accomplishes more than luke skywalker could with zero training again going against star wars canon which we had come to expect ultimately this movie makes me appreciate the character development in the prequels despite the multiple annoying subplots
Jul 4 2018,negative,pretty good until you get past the intro scroll
Jul 4 2018,negative,all i can say it is definitely strange that it has a 91 rating on the tomatometer this was not a good movie it was absurd and made a mockery of everything before it i loved star wars growing up i will not watch another movie made by this regime
Jul 4 2018,negative,one of the worst movies i have ever seen the visuals were very great though
Jul 4 2018,negative,this movie lacks the timelessness of its predecessors
Jul 4 2018,positive,the torch has been passed with trepidation and a bit of angst to the newest hope in the star wars universe a great ride
Jul 4 2018,negative,if youve come here for continuity a cohesive script and respect for what came before you have come to the wrong place
Jul 4 2018,negative,there are not enough middle fingers to give to this  lifelong star wars fan no longer
Jul 4 2018,negative,the worst star wars movie ever made what was disney thinking my 12 year old hated it and does not want to see episode 9 how sad
Jul 4 2018,positive,if you are a casual fan and not a fanboy or girl of star wars then this is a great movie i am a fanboy of star wars and i like it dont listen to the backlash this  movie is getting from fanboys you really cant please them
Jul 4 2018,negative,i was extremely disappointed with this movie the opening scene with the bombers that need to be on top of the enemy ships in order to throw their bombs was when i realized the movie was going to suck i dont expect a star wars movie to be accurate with physics but come on these bombers seemed more like ww ii planes than spaceships there are so man plotholes and subplots that go nowhere if the movie was to be cut to the relevant scenes it would probably be around 30min long there was also nothing original about the last jedi the picture of frankensteins monster comes to mind something that has been constructed out of parts salvaged from things which should have stayed undisturbed and dead for example the scene where rey is in the boring version of the dagobah cave or the planet that is definitely not hoth because its salt thank god that soldier told us i cannot understand how anyone enjoyed this movie at least we got to know who supreme leader snook was a nobody and it doesnt matter anyway there is no background story he was just the new 2 dimensional emperor because obviously a star wars movie needs this all in all it was a huge disappointment and i dont plan on watching episode 9
Jul 4 2018,positive,great movie only thing that keeps it from five stars is i have to rate empire higher
Jul 4 2018,positive,thoughtful sometimes unexpected movie
Jul 4 2018,negative,my review was too indepth so rt wont post it i worked for like an hour an a half too ill shorten it up far too bloated with unnecessary characters characters arent that interesting lack of drama manufactured stakes no love or emotion terrible pacing luke is wishywashy and grumpy im not gonna write all this out again some day ill post my full review and link it here or something like that
Jul 4 2018,negative,2 stars for the cinematography and nothing more for anything in this mess of caracter murder i will change this rating also if the outcome becomes different with the last film in the trilogy
Jul 4 2018,negative,the last jedi is the unequivocal evidence that politics cinematography and visual effects are paramount in the eyes of professional critics while story and integrity reign supreme in the eyes of fans  this film lacked vision and direction  to top it off the mafia style approach lucas films has taken toward fans and even cast members who recognize the bias and inneptness of the film seems to have divided the base in such a way that it may not recover until a changing of the guard
Jul 4 2018,negative,this movie ruined luke
Jul 3 2018,negative,this is a bloated string of saturday morning adventure tv series episodes compressed into one giant blob of what were supposed to accept as a star wars blockbuster if i were to eat the script a star wars lego set and a chewbacca figurine my digestive system would compress them into a better plot
Jul 3 2018,negative,everything is a knockoff of older films except made worse worst film to date
Jul 3 2018,negative,this is late to the party but i refused to pay a penny to see this wreck    its as bad as youve heard  nothing makes any sense  the old characters are treated like crap  new characters are boring and whinny  the entire universe is ruined it opens questions on why these new made up tactics arent used in other movies    all force awakens setup threads are closed with it was nothing  it sets up nothing for us to care for the next movie    i find it hilarious that rian johnson still thinks he made a good movie  this is a franchise killer    i may not have thought that prequels were good but i didnt feel like they ruined my enjoyment of the other movies  this is just the worst
Jul 3 2018,negative,how is it possible 91 of critics like this film
Jul 3 2018,positive,i honest dont understand the hate i thought it was pretty damn good another great film to add to the saga
Jul 3 2018,negative,its a great movie as long as your not looking for a starwars movie visually beautiful but doesnt understand the material in a way conistent with orevious 7 chapters you dont change the contect in act 3 of a move and expect the audience to feel good leaving it
Jul 3 2018,negative,terrible film turned luke into an uninteresting character it seems like the directors point was just to misdirect poor plot and character development the worst star wars yet
Jul 3 2018,negative,one of the worst movies ive ever seen almost as bad as plan 9 from outer space by ed wood
Jul 3 2018,positive,i loved this movie so all of you haters can suck it
Jul 3 2018,negative,middle finger to starwars fans
Jul 3 2018,negative,this movie has so many errorsinconsistencies in its characters reasoning and basic decision making that you start to wonder if it was written by a thirdgrader visually its a great movie but given the expectations for a sw movie it is plain disappointing
Jul 3 2018,positive,loved it primarily for the double storytelling of both the story in the movie and using what happened to many of the characters to talk to the audience as well in different ways
Jul 3 2018,negative,definitely the worst star wars movie ever made makes the prequels look like they are made of gold
Jul 3 2018,positive,an incredible fresh movie that pulls away from the predictable and repetitive nature of star wars allowing this trilogy to go places never before seen giving new life to the new and old characters this film was amazing and is being shot down by fans nitpicking at the smallest and most irrelevant parts of the movie because their theory didnt come true
Jul 3 2018,positive,fantastic from beginning to end
Jul 3 2018,negative,terrible disappointment filled with sloppy cliched writing and pointless subplots and characters
Jul 3 2018,negative,i am tired of the angry fans attacking actors and ruining the tone of this franchise with that said this movie was just not good    i struggled with the slow speed chase plot and i found the answers to the questions raised in the force awakens to be hollow and boring i am fine with films that subvert my expectations but when the answers are all the same your curiosity was misplaced and is irrelevant i lose interest i honestly cannot thing of a less interesting way to be reintroduced to luke skywalker than having him throw the lightsaber i get having him be a disgruntled old man but not to the point where he is not even curious who rey is or what happened to his friends    i actually fell asleep in the theater for this movie which is a first for me for a movie i actually wanted to see some articles on the internet  said to watch it again with a new filter because i might have missed the finer details when i watched it again at home i fell asleep again    the last jedi killer any curiosity i had for episode 9 and with all the drama surrounding the franchise i just dont see a way to make star wars interesting again hopefully i am wrong
Jul 3 2018,positive,favorite star wars film since empire strikes back
Jul 3 2018,negative,rian johnson is not george rr martin  his goal of subverting expectations drove the franchise into a ditch  the eternal optimist luke skywalker is completely gutted in this movie and completely nonlinear the all of the character development up to this point  also the new characters just dont stand on their own  rey is a mary suepoint blank  she knows everything does everything and even defeats a jedi master who has trained all his life  whereas luke lost his hand in his first outing with vader rey easily defeats her enemies who have been training with the force some longer than she has even been alive  dont get me started with space leiaugh  knowing that carrie fisher died in real life they had the opportunity to give the character a fitting death in the saga  instead they choose to have her flying through space like mary poppins  it is very disconcerting to see such a high critics rating on rotten tomatoes  im trying to figure out what movie they were watching
Jul 3 2018,positive,dont know why audiences are so hard on this movie true it had a few moments where the director tried to hard to be cutefunny but come on its a space cowboy matinee not an art house piece four solid stars for me 
Jul 3 2018,neutral,first half was utter garbage 2nd half was decent with the final showdown being the best part  90 of the dialogue was tv sitcom quality not befitting of a star wars movie
Jul 3 2018,negative,i have loved stars wars all my life and i have seen and played bad moviesshowsgames but movie  is something else alltogether  it is the antithesis of everything that star wars is made by people who dont respect and possibly despise it
Jul 2 2018,negative,disney has killed this amazing franchise lukes storyline is terrible how could they screw up this badly
Jul 2 2018,negative,three arcs one dumb and subversive to the franchise one nonsensical and mocks any knowledge of even paramilitary warfare one pretty well done
Jul 2 2018,negative,its like watching charlies angels or something they made luke pretty much a discount tyrion lanister
Jul 2 2018,negative,i signed up for the express purpose of adding my review i have never reviewed a movie until now in short im stunned i will never trust the professional critics tomatometer again 91 that cannot have happened without either a direct monetary payoff or an epic groupthink meltdown a la the emperors new clothes the only real explanation i can think of is that critics have been scared or psychologically bullied into thinking that they have to like this franchise regardless of how absolutely abominable the product is i mean with hundreds of millions of dollars at stake a high profile reviewer who puts out a bad review could feel an awful lot of heat and could risk career suicide i on the other hand have no such constraints previous reviewers have stated in many many ways all the particulars about why this movie failed on so many levels my ultimate conclusion is that this is the movie that gets made when you turn it over to the marketing department at disney you start a spreadsheet and list all the attributes characters and plot points from the earlier films that audiences responded favorably to and that also have merchandising potential you then build a script that stuffs as many of those elements as possible into it regardless of whether it makes any sense i watched this movie at home without any bias from a star wars fan audience or any other pressures to like or dislike it i hadnt read any reviews it just happened to be available on netflix for the first thirty minutes i was ok fastpaced a few new characters some good cgi then things started to unravel laborious backstory explanations uninteresting action scenes ridiculous sub plots a seemingly unending parade of what were supposed to be dramatic reveals and confrontations midway through i was yelling at the screen near the end i was laughing out loud at the end i just wanted it to stop this movie was an epic failure to tell an epic story what a waste of money talent and time
Jul 2 2018,negative,this film has ruined it for me  ive officially given up on star wars
Jul 2 2018,negative,shame there wasnt a negative star ratingsimply terriblehandbrake turns in space laser trebruchetsthe ridiculous space chase where the entire rebel fleet is slightly faster than the first orders ships
Jul 2 2018,negative,magnificent work of artists excellent graphics and camera work this ends the movies pluses the rest of the film is a boring dull and most importantly stupid and illogical rubbish which parasitizes the successful franchise
Jul 2 2018,negative,i could not kill thought in my brain enough to enjoy this moviei wanted to leave and prayed for it to end horrible writing comedy politics and more
Jul 2 2018,negative,zero stars this movie does not honor the legacy it kills all that was good about star wars i am no longer a fan i will never see another rian johnson or kathleen kennedy movie
Jul 2 2018,negative,a complete disappointment obviously not made by a real star wars fan who understood the original trilogy thanks for ruining luke skywalkers return to the movies
Jul 2 2018,negative,omg extremely poorly thought out it doesnt make any sense too many jokes
Jul 2 2018,negative,there was absolutely nothing redeeming about his movie  comic relief was added in all serious moments because rian johnson is unable to write a good story and tell it in an engaging way  every character that was previous elevated was diminished every bit of suspense from the last film was ground to dust every new subplot was unnecessary and went no where and the main plot involved the bulk of the rebel force doing either nothing or nothing intelligent  this film seemed like it was written by a focus group in order to give the minimum possible appeal to the greatest possible number of demographics  the result was an extremely sympathetic first order  how could the audience not root for them to put an end to this miserable spectacle and restore order to the galaxy  this film gave the worst of the prequels a run for their money in terms of sheer audience pain
Jul 2 2018,negative,such a massive let down and waste of one of the greatest scifi properties of time i wouldnt recommend this move to anyone who is an actual fan of the star wars universe the only reason to watch it is so you can see how bad people can screw up one of the most important story arks of all time
Jul 2 2018,negative,terrible leah poppins rose jar jar binks tico rey whose father must be superman finn who remains pointless as his adversary phasma does as well purple haired lady who acts like a child the whole time yet is suppose to be a great leader all of it just terrible and stop trying to be funny rion johnson you arent good at it
Jul 2 2018,negative,there was so much wasted here it wasted time talent and every single plot hook from the other movie it is such a waste of the franchise the people adored how the critics ever found it to be good i will never know
Jul 2 2018,negative,what rian johnson did with the character of luke skywalker was a travesty  first he destroyed luke through character assassination then needlessly killed him off after bilocating across the galaxy  he presents luke as a bitter old man not the beacon of hope we have known in the past  this was a huge disappointment for me so much so that i do not plan on seeing episode 9  nor do i plan on watching any more movies associated with rian johnson
Jul 2 2018,negative,the movie was crap they killed off most of the characters and there was many retcns and a lot of politics
Jul 2 2018,neutral,over 41 years ago i caught the first starwars movie it was a magical escape from reality an epic space opera that took place in a galaxy far far away a very long time ago this past weekend i caught this movie on netflix this is a very mediocre and unnecessary movie which essentially took a whole bunch of stuff from the original trilogy and cooked it up for fanboys who cant get enough of starwars and those who are addicted to epic space operas the actors and characters were tiresome and tedious the story limped along much like the chase scene that dominated the entire movie and i couldnt see any major plot to this movie except for a warmed over rehash of kylo ren asking rey to join him in ruling the universe sound familiar yeah stolen right out of the empire strikes back when vader reveals himself to be lukes father and asks him to join him in defeating the emperor and ruling the galaxy as father and son yeah this movie was a rehash of all the old tropes from the original trilogy the one gem in the movie was laura dern who plays admiral holdo and performs the ultimate act of sacrifice to save the handful of rebels this was a very meh type of movie
Jul 2 2018,negative,disney has ripped the heart and soul out of the star wars fancies and is bleeding it out for every penny there greedy penny they can get there hands on couldnt be more disappointed with whats happening to this classic and legendary saga 
Jul 2 2018,negative,film kills off everyone of note like it is the last movie of the triology the next story will therefore be full of people who no one knows and involve lots of back story explaination not exactly what anyone wants for a trilogy  imagine what would have happened to marvel if they killed of all the x men in the first film as the writer wanted something fresh disney may as well of created another scifi series and saved its money
Jul 1 2018,negative,i was never more disappointed in a movie in my entire life than this one it ruins all the good the force awakens did to set up the franchise in every way possible every plot point is meaningless or just downright awful one specific part of the movie is something that previous films have said it definitely cant happen because itll make you think hey every battle couldve been avoided if they just did this but didnt it say in the prequels and in empire that its impossible to do this huge disappointment and truly sad that this was carrie fishers sendoff
Jul 1 2018,negative,ruined the integrity of the first 6 films terrible movie overall
Jul 1 2018,positive,bold energizing film that will be remembered as one of the best up there with rogue one
Jul 1 2018,negative,im not a big star wars fan but i loved 46 hated 13 loved force awakens and dont judge me but currently think rogue one is one of the best films in the entire franchise but wow is this film absolute garbage two words canto bight the most disjointed and uninteresting plot line i think ive ever seen in a film i almost fell asleep and the fact that there was no back story to snoke or rey for that matter luke seems almost heartless in the film and all the build up in character development in force awakens gets thrown the window and its too late even if they attempt to answer questions in episode 9 because i wont be watching it after this debacle 
Jul 1 2018,negative,just terrible i wish i could give it zero stars
Jul 1 2018,negative,really figured disney would have enough creative genius to come up with something at least a little creative
Jul 1 2018,neutral,i fell asleep the 1st time i watched it but thought i would give it another try  now that it is streamable but i was very disappointed and would give it no more than 2 12 stars  and that is being generous if you ask me  the attempt at humor and cuteness is way to forced kind of wanted to stick my finger down my throat  i think it would have been better if chewbacca ate the bird now that would have been funny  i have never been a big fan of the  cutesiness but i guess some of it is good for the young crowd the very young crowdthe children  the cutesiness however is just part of what is wrong with this flick the storyline was kind of uninteresting      there did not seem to be much of a plot seems like the whole was just to try a snuff out luke and why was he being such a thorn  when he threw the lightsaber i believe i uttered the phrase wtf out loud  i did not see any humor in that at all and why was he so against the forcehe was a master and certainly would not have feared it did obiwan fear the dark side  no he remained strong with the force   there was also way too much going on why the big casino planet  well i guess it make sense that they were trying to fit in some of the weird alien types like they did in the shady bar where luke first met han solo or the spaceport that is  you will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainythey could have used some decent lines like that to make it help make it more interestingthe casino however did not quite worksomething was off about it it didnt seem to fit      when i first saw kylo ren take off his helmet in the force awakens i thought what the hell  he seems to be such a whiney dweeb  certainly not an offspring of someone like harrison ford and carrier fisher  he does not even look remotely like either of them  talk about a gigantic monstrous shnozzi mean what a pizzaface  and now he is the supreme leader  oh boy now we have that to look forward to  he should have kept his helmet on that would have been better  and why would a powerful guy listen to the poor captured rey was he not interrogating her what a wimp    i do like rey but it would be nice to see more of a personality with her  maybe in the next film i supposebut i definitely am not expecting much in the movie itself  the supreme leader is a pizza faced wimp with powers  he is like a troubled adolescent who has not yet figured things out
Jul 1 2018,negative,star wars is dead
Jul 1 2018,positive,the internet made me hate this before seeing it i watched and now can realize that this is the episode v of our era except theres a million times more pressure on it because of the past 40 years of culture we know i can say surely that everyones gripes with the youre a nobody and that ending shock will be blown away in ix star wars never would quickly graze over anything so major without actual proof and let that stay in stone remember this is the episode v of this trilogy heck just look at strength of yodas ghost  imagine what the most powerful jedis could be  and thats before you consider the circumstances of their departure as well for all we know reappearing isnt out of the question
Jul 1 2018,negative,rian johnson single handeldy ruined everything about star wars the jedi the lord and the events before tlj all because he wanted to kill the past mary sue is apparently the most powerful force user that has ever existed in the galaxy dont even get me started on the treatment of luke how everything in that movie went against what we knew about luke this move has tainted everything lore wise that has come before i just cant anynore star wars died in 2017 the only good disney star wars is rouge one
Jul 1 2018,positive,as a true fan of star wars unlike those who feel it is their right to harass inflict pain and abuse on writerdirector rian johnson and actresses daisy ridley and kelly marie tran this is a very worthy followup to star wars the force awakens with an excellent executed storyline and directing by mr johnson incredible acting dazzling visual effects sweeping musical score by the legendary john williams incomparable cinematography by steve yedlin well crafted editing by bob ducsay set pieces by rick heinrichs and costumes designed by michael kaplan the best star wars fiim since the empire strikes back for those out there who decided to give up on star wars you will miss out on what is yet to come
Jul 1 2018,negative,just a complete fail ruins good characters from the original while managing to make new characters completely uninteresting and never gaining any back story or reason to be
Jul 1 2018,negative,forgetting the conspiracy nonsense about strong female characters and why fans hate it this just isnt a good movie the miss judged comedy makes a mockery of villains something star wars never has and huge sections of the film are completely superfluous the last act feels tagged on in order to have an empire scene but its salt not ice so no copying and the film should have ended after the one good bit  the battle with the crimson guard chaps added to this we have gravity and bombing in spade the slowest chase in movie history a movie about fuel not telling the plan pointless quests with pointless characters weaponising lightspeed and luke is wasted and belittled and i thought the force awakens was bad
Jul 1 2018,negative,a travesty   how can people who are paid so much money make so many mistakes  shockingly bad film ending 40 years of creative world building appalling neomythology woeful character development etc etc its all just so sad heartbreaking that this was approved to be made
Jul 1 2018,negative,this was easily the worst star wars movie ever made i waited for solo to be out before i rated because rumor had it that it would be bad however solo was better than the last jedi all of the excitement and fun of episode vii had me excited for number 8 then johnson ruined it just cast everything aside that i was excited about
Jul 1 2018,positive,this film completely disregards the wellcrafted jedi order while tiring the  terrible scenes
Jul 1 2018,negative,this is the worst star wars movie ever made ive been a star wars fan since i was a child and have loved every movie until disney got their hands on it this movie has actually made me not care about the future of the story legendary characters have been forever ruined and the moderately interesting details about the new characters unfolded to be boring unexplained or just plain ignored it will take a miracle to save the franchise after rian johnson left it in a butchered bloody mess until i hear positive fan reviews i will not watch any future star wars films in the cinema again good luck jj abramsseriously
Jul 1 2018,negative,audiences showed up for two movies because of luke skywalker teasers why is the writing inconsistent with the skywalkertheme gravitas that most people relate to
Jul 1 2018,negative,every male characters is seen as incompetent and every female character is a mary sue the film throws away everything jj built in the previous film for no reason the comedy within the film is horrendously cheesy and unnecessary
Jul 1 2018,negative,it was painful to watch though visually stunning there was nothing else that could be considered a redeeming trait the story is confusing the star wars universes own rules are rewritten and its not even entertaining    terrible
Jun 30 2018,negative,this movie insulted my intelligence id rather go marathon parts 2 and 3 over and over for an afternoon till my brain melts than see this garbage mess
Jun 30 2018,negative,extremely disappointing cliched movie there is very litle character development for poe and finn did anyone really care  abotu the fight scene between finn an phasma the scenes of leia  escaping and the entire casino scene both were too comical to enjoy the character of luke was complteley unbeleiavable and then when they brought some life to his character they added a boring ending  if you want some fun go back and watch the empire strikes back or the force awakens this movie  the last jedi is just purposely silly it could have been worse they could have resurrected jar jar binks
Jun 30 2018,negative,the good guys are now stunning slapping and treating each other like enemies luke was willing to burn books like the nazis that he  didnt even read  star wars used to have a wholesome and positive message about the value of friendship dedication and assiduous practice among other things  very little in this movie makes sense  this is the third time i have tried to post a review
Jun 30 2018,negative,saw on a plane  enough to make me want to use the barf bag  they made luka a loser and then killed him  probably some kind of allegory for the racegender obsessed dorks running lucasfilm now  awful characters  eg admiral purple hair  and the scene with chewbacca and the roasted bird was taken right from the chickfila commercial where the cow makes a looks at the person eating a hamburger unoriginal disrespectful of the with an overkill of the hollywood political orthodoxy
Jun 30 2018,negative,i added this account just so i could contribute to supporting how disappointing this movie is
Jun 30 2018,positive,the primary plot with rey luke and kylo is just about perfect the secondary plot with the escaping rebel fleet is ok third subplot with fin and rose is no good and borderline train wreck but the primary story makes up for it so it still gets four stars  listen to the professional critics not the super fans that held it to unrealistic expectations
Jun 30 2018,negative,the plot is shit cannot compare to the splendid visual effect excellent acting i feel all the great acting is wasted with their bad lines nothing it started i did not predict it happens there is no suspense climax plot twists or memorable lines a complete waste of a such a big budget film please pay the writer more and find someone who can plot well before getting all the talents together
Jun 30 2018,negative,what a horrible movie so dissapointing
Jun 30 2018,positive,no idea why people dont like this well worth my time
Jun 30 2018,negative,one of the worst star wars movies made
Jun 30 2018,negative,very sloppy no character development and boring lots of plot holes too i think their editors were asleep when they reviewed the film for problems there was something artistically appealing about some of the scenes but that was not integrated into the story
Jun 30 2018,positive,the last jedi takes star wars in a new needed direction to keep the franchise new and full of surprises our protagonists dwelve even deeper into their personal arcs which drives the audience into more interest for the new sequel trilogy the movie does contain some incredibly dumb and pointless moments but are overcomed by stunning visuals plot twists avoiding a rewrite of empire and one of mark hamills best live action perfomances  yet
Jun 30 2018,negative,i cant believe they made such a terrible and disrespectful movie my entire family had a sick feeling after watching it theres nothing they can do for episode 9 that can make up for the permanent damage they did with episode 8
Jun 30 2018,negative,all anyone has done is make excuses for terrible plot points in this film that couldnt even come up with an original starting off point filled with pointless characters that no one is given time to care about because of virtually no character development i wish i could delete this film from my mind
Jun 30 2018,negative,this was a boring movie i was constantly checking my watch the film is too long makes little logical sense ignores star wars lore and has many twists that feel lazy honestly this is one of the most lazily written films ive ever seen i was deeply upset i spent money on theater tickets i will not be seeing another star wars film unless it is free to stream and even though i probably wont because those are 2 hours i can never get back      to make matters worse this movie is inappropriate for children due to its dark and frankly incoherent plot im sincerely confused who the target audience was clearly not me clearly not children
Jun 30 2018,positive,first time in years that ive felt like i was watching a genuine new star wars film
Jun 30 2018,negative,a terrible movie the more i think about it the less sense it makes
Jun 30 2018,negative,ruined the franchise
Jun 30 2018,negative,an insult to a once proud and epic american classic fire the director producer writer anyone mentioned in the credits and every disney executive who contributed to this pathetic cartoon
Jun 30 2018,negative,am i really going to write a review of this movie hasnt everyone whether theyve seen it or not made up their mind    ive read and seen a lot of valid criticism of this film simply from the point of being entertained this is not the direction i would have taken star wars    again from a view point of entertainment i found this movie to be terribly boring i didnt care about any of the new or newer characters anything i might have been interested in was turned into a plot twist or used to subvert my expectations ugh
Jun 30 2018,negative,this movie dropped the ball so epically plot sucked dont have faith in the direction this beloved franchise is moving in which is a disappointment after rogue one was solid
Jun 29 2018,negative,yes great this movie has lots of diversity  thats it  literally
Jun 29 2018,negative,wow i waited a while to see this movie because i heard some not so good things about it but i was still blown away by how bad it was plot holes completely forgetting sub plots prequel level writing and jokes why lucasfilmwhy do this
Jun 29 2018,negative,spoilers exec 1 luke gonna die this episode exec 2 cool so hes going to have a heroic last stand and sacrifice himself to save everyone exec 1 no youre going to think thats about to happen but hes really just a projection that going to distract kylo for a minute exec 2 so he lives exec 1 no he still dies exec 2 perfect 
Jun 29 2018,negative,this movie was awful absolutely no story or character development   the entire plot makes no sense  these new movies are an absolute waste of time  not sure how any critic could watch this movie and say it was good
Jun 29 2018,negative,this was a star wars movie in name only the characters story everything about was disconnected from given cannon of the star wars universe disney has taken the star wars franchise and driven it off a cliff
Jun 29 2018,negative,worst star wars movie made by far good cinematic effects terrible star wars film
Jun 29 2018,negative,beautiful movie but i cant go any further in case i get called sexist racist or a man baby
Jun 29 2018,negative,destroys lukes story arc and character from the original trilogy unneeded casino subplot humor that doesnt land the holdo manuever ruins all space conflict past and future add in many plot holes and you get the last jedi
Jun 29 2018,negative,worst movie in the series by a long shot
Jun 29 2018,negative,star wars franchise is now 100 off the rails nice work ryan johnson youve taken a dump all over our favorite childhood characters well done cant wait to not see the next one
Jun 29 2018,negative,did rian johnson even watch star wars before writing this
Jun 29 2018,negative,i wonder if rian johnson has ever seen a star wars movie this was an abomination 
Jun 29 2018,negative,so much has been said already all ill say is this was simply poor story telling okay no ill say a little bit more the humor was painfully out of place the villains constantly came across as schmucks no one in their right mind would be afraid of this new order and there was absolutely no reason none at all for that ultimately useless side quest to the casino
Jun 29 2018,negative,terrible  the person they turned luke into in no way is the same character  just a bad movie all the way through
Jun 29 2018,negative,brian johnson killed the franchise with this sorry excuse of a movie
Jun 29 2018,negative,sloppy choreography random meandering plot too many goofy gags that were not really funny  full of plot holes  and continuity errors with the other movies
Jun 29 2018,negative,after the exciting but epically average force awakens the last jedi broke my star wars bone im now indifferent to any future star wars products
Jun 29 2018,positive,rian johnson delivers a visually stunning genuinely shocking and emotionally entry in the star wars saga with the last jedi captivating performances by adam driver daisy ridley and specifically mark hamill propel the film forward in fact luke skywalkers arc is the films most interesting plot line making fans question a character theyve come to love but still giving him a sense of purpose and redemption while the film does lose momentum with its various side plots and overlong running time the tight direction and writing keeps the film intact for younger fans the visually stunning action scenes compliment the films more intellectual themes overall the last jedi delivers a near perfect entry into the star wars saga and a worthy sequel
Jun 29 2018,negative,disney has ruined star wars the last jedi was the worst movie ive ever seen
Jun 29 2018,negative,what a great movie im so glad that i spent hour and hours in line when i was a kid to see the original eleven times enabeling me to watch the franchise eventually turn into this the special effects that acting that overwhelmingly well thought out story arc my goodness is there anything to complain about with this movie its a nonstop wonderful experience that i am so glad that i was able to have this genre has in no way been overly watered down by the corproate movie machine that spits out contrite and rediculous garbage for the massses to shove down their gullet like so much fast food    amazing everything i just said was wrong     if anyone had any humanity left in their soul they would take this franchise out behind the woodshed and mercifully put it out of our misery all things need to perish so that their existence is relevant i think this great story should have ended quite a while ago
Jun 29 2018,negative,changing directors was a mistake and has watered down the franchise
Jun 28 2018,negative,very disappointed with what disney has done to star wars  im actually thinking jar jar wasnt that bad at this point  hyper speed is pulling time space around you    great graphics but plot holes everywhere with poor character development that wasnt luke skywalker
Jun 28 2018,negative,dumpster fire is a pretty good description of the movie
Jun 28 2018,positive,ok first of all great movie i can see why some people didnt like it i get it they didnt show rey training that much which was sort of a bummer and it seemed like finn might have had a crush on anothers girl besides rey but thats just part of the story i dont think that we should only focus on the not so good parts of a story and start calling the whole story bad because of them i mean rey was freaking legit and i personally dont think that rose and finn are a thing finn obviously is in love with rey and i know he and rose kissed but she was kissing him not vise versa  also haha the whole leia flying is space thing was pretty wack honestly though i like do the movie a lot and i think its sad how a few mistakes throughout the movie could change someones whole outlook on star wars and make them not like the movies any more star wars is still great for anyone for real hating on star wars right now i hope that you can rethink it and have some slack about it because why not its star wars
Jun 28 2018,negative,first off ill start on a positive note heres what i liked this film had stunning visuals with an amazing blend of cgi and real world effects where sometimes it became difficult to tell what was real and what was cgi the musical score was the best since the original trilogy as well on those two points alone this film is probably worth watching once    where this film falters though is its storytelling  plot there are way too many interesting plot points from the previous movie which were never explored as well as ones within this movie itself that were just plain ignored and thrown out some character development from the first movie werent even touched upon there was no finn  poe camaraderie both of these characters were merely just a punching point for two dreadful  poorly written characters i wont even go into what they did to other preexisting characters in the star wars franchise that made little to no sense at least they didnt mess with yoda    if this film were any other franchise it wouldnt have been held to such a high standard there are some points that would make this movie worth watching  but very few people will want to watch it even for a second time im not even sure how they can get past this to make episode 9 work  theyd pretty much have to retcon this entire move
Jun 28 2018,negative,it was so bad from the sequencing to the plot tried my best not to fall asleep all throughout the movie i am perplexed how this movie stands with a 91 rating its not just a bad star wars movie its a bad movie
Jun 28 2018,negative,the worst star wars movie ever made im not even going to comment because youre at too many other really good reviews of how horrible this movie was totally destroyed what star wars is  the worst star wars movie ever made im not even going to comment because there are too many other really good reviews of how horrible this movie was did not feel like a star wars movie whatsoever the director obviously had no clue on how to make a star wars movie its too bad everybody boycotted solo because that was actually a good movie that felt much more like a star wars movie i will never see the last jedi again nor will i ever buy it on bluray very very very disappointed i wish there was someway to remake the movie to completely forget about this one
Jun 28 2018,negative,the plot was a mess and simply not interesting the movie was at least 30 minutes too long and i wanted it to be over long before it was  corny misplaced and unfunny jokes throughout  lastly but most importantly the beloved character of luke skyealker was needlessly  and ruthlessly assassinated  the literal new hope of the galaxy who believed he could and ultimately did find the good in even the most evil person in the galaxy vader is now a grumpy hermit who attempts to murder children in their sleep unacceptable
Jun 28 2018,negative,brutal to watch  a film with an agenda that unfortunately seeks to tear down a proud legacy rather than to build upon it
Jun 28 2018,negative,im in my 30s male and i created an account just to rate this movie first how the heck did these critic review rate this at 91 how much did you get paid if youre around 515 years old then you might enjoy this movie if youre use to semi intelligent movies than youre going to be bored to death scenes and drama played out every little thing is dramatic the action is pretty low the acting is forgettable i had to check the reviews on this because all i wanted to know when is the movie going to end watch this movie only if you need some noise in the background while you do some other task like cook or surf the internet i just watched it to the end because i alright wasted my time watching this boring movie that i have to see how it ends
Jun 28 2018,negative,made an account just to say how poor this starwars movie was
Jun 28 2018,negative,pointless plot line and roles ray is getting stronger with no training at all unlike luke and anikian snoke is a huge mystery that was never explained find character is really pointless and im sure in that time era this giant frigates wouldnt need fuel they would run off of a reactor or somthing just that that was pointless i will give them credit for the bombing scene and showing how the empire and rebels get there equipment this series needs a better plot and more character development
Jun 28 2018,positive,complete review 34 stars  star wars the last jedi is a story continuing off of the previous the force awakens installment the movie consists of beautiful spectacles great action and as to be expected a great musical score the story is the weakest point of the film but by there is definitely things to take out of it the story mainly focuses around rey and luke skywalkers interactions as well as rey and the antagonistic kylo ren in this installment rey is given more of a character but unfortunately isnt completely redeemed she has very good scenes and interactions as well as ideology and thought provoking questions risen about herself kylo ren also sees light as he also questions himself beyond the two main leads the original cast returns once again and the acting feels very emotional and driven the writing is this movies biggest downfall there were plenty of scenes that were either unneeded or simply went for two long there were characters that fans were disappointed didnt get more screen time or attention and simply felt like they were cast aside the comedy in these movies are much better than that of the prequels i often found myself laughing at many of the jokes in the film they always seemed easygoing and never went on for too long than they needed to much to the extent of the previous installment     the biggest problem with this movie is the fact that it fails to deliver what the majority wants most of the fans of star wars set their expectations far too high for the films of the series youll often find that people that havent seen the previous movies or arent as into the star wars lore and universe will enjoy this movie much more rather than those who take the time to read the books watch the television series read and create wikis and much to that extent this movie is not for everyone and that can be said for every single film ever created does this movie deserve a one star rating because of its writing absolutely not does the writing drag the movie down yes     i always like to ask myself this question when i finish watching a movie was i satisfied uninterested or entertained this question asks a lot and makes you reconsider a movie after you watch it  satisfaction is the process of feeling that you got what you came for and nothing more or nothing less you recieved exactly what you expected and you can say that a movie was good being uninterested would mean that the movie simply did not keep you interested and was not a good film in general being entertained is when a film does what it is supposed to do in its base entertain you for 23 hours you may not get what you want but did you sit there and find yourself taken to a new world or different story did you feel immersed and interested in what happened next     after asking myself this question i came to agree that this movie entertained me i felt thrill in the climax i found myself worried in fight scenes and i found myself taken to another world while i watched this movie i dont think there was a single scene that i wanted to just gloss over and ignore even if they were pointless     that is the problem with most reviews about star wars fans expect to be entertained and satisfied and unfortunately most of the time that doesnt happen the original star wars films entertained us they gave us characters and story that we loved we had no bar set and we didnt expect anything up and beyond now what happened when the prequels came out bars were set far too high and people expected to be satisfied by getting the same entertainment from the originals when that didnt happen the film was bashed now comes these new films people set the bar even higher for satisfaction and the film doesnt deliver the star wars community is broken right now because they want to be satisfied not entertained and no one should go into a movie expecting it to be satisfying you should go into a movie with an open mind and an expectation to be entertained it is called the entertainment industry not the satisfaction industry     with that i give star wars the last jedi four stars out of five
Jun 28 2018,negative,not only the worst sw movie but one of the worst things ever
Jun 28 2018,negative,franchise killer too many characters too many subplots and a lot of characters that did nt contribute to the story i dont see how they can save episode 9 i dont really care about the remaining characters  hopefully though they dont cgi princes laya or recast     one and  half stars for the spectacular visual effects
Jun 28 2018,negative,gave this a rewatch and still hate it first half is boring and not compelling second half is frustrating and angering its all stupid and bad literally every character in the next movie could die and i couldnt care
Jun 28 2018,negative,possibly the worst excuse of a movie ever created
Jun 28 2018,negative,a 2 hour talkathon about out with the old in with the new something that couldve been done with an actual complete story instead of the marathon of explaining everything 
Jun 28 2018,negative,this movie was a massive pile of plot holes and had no respect for the logic of the original trilogy or its characters  i will not watch it again
Jun 28 2018,negative,on my first viewing of this movie i wasnt sure what to make of it but the more i thought about the movie the more i hated it the only thing i liked was the visuals and light saber fights i wont be watching episode 9
Jun 28 2018,negative,single handedly ruined my child hood
Jun 28 2018,negative,movie was atrocious
Jun 28 2018,negative,they keep telling us that the vocal minority are the only ones who hated this movie that the vocal minority is racist and misogynistic because we didnt applaud how great this movie is complete cop out and bs its just a bad movie there is a minority that has put hate on some of the actors they are just doing their jobs and its wrong to blame them personally i echo nearly all of the legitimate criticism  others have mentioned in the audience reviews im not sure what the expert reviewers are seeing in this film maybe they are afraid to tell the truth  out of fear of offending the powerful people at disney and lucasfilm they killed the golden goose and there is no saving it short of starting over people who say they had to stomp on the skywalker saga to start the next generation of star wars are missing  the point at any time they can create hair new sagas old fans would have welcomed new stories on their own merit why destroy 40 years of good will and not give the original saga the finish it deserved 1 star only because they dont count anything less towards  the score clean house disney  especially kathleen kennedy and rian johnson
Jun 28 2018,negative,this movie threw away so many legacy characters the build up of seeing the characters i loved enjoyed as a kid get was great and i feel this movie just looked over the fact that people wanted to see these legacy characters interact and do something luke did a little something at the endit was awfuli really didnt like this movieif they were going to kill off all the characters of the old movies they should have made a new star wars movie that had nothing to do with the originals
Jun 28 2018,negative,what is good about this film the visuals and cinematography   what is not good about this film everything else i cannot go into detail on this because ive already elaborated in multiple conversations and reviews the reasons why this film is a negation of whats come before to this end ill simply address what yoda says in his only appearance in the film     the greatest teacher failure is     why doesnt luke know this lesson already he already failed in empire to save his friends in confronting vader prematurely failure is something that luke knows all too well and he already knows the lesson that failure can help us learn from our experiences in order to come back stronger he defeated not just vader but the emporer by heading yodas words the second time in confronting vader by using the force for defense not attack as he did in empire     luke already knows this lesson concerning failure     this brings me to my main issue with this film weve already seen it before all of it for all the criticism the force awakens received for being a rehashing of a new hope this one film borrows way too heavily from both empire and return of the jedi it is simply a condensed version of these two films into one with some disney spectacle sprinkled for seasoning
Jun 28 2018,negative,bad story telling and they killed snock to erley and luck died not in epic lithgsaber dual
Jun 28 2018,negative,the only reason that i am giving this atrocity of a movie a single star is that it is visually stunning and thats about the best that i can say about it
Jun 28 2018,negative,what the hell were they thinking months after seeing it im still gutted no film has ever disappointed me so much and i so wanted to love it i really liked force awakens and solo was great but this was the cinematic equivalent of a turd in fact a dog turd the worst type of turd
Jun 27 2018,negative,good as a no brainer movie however as a serious movie set within the larger narrative of the star wars story not so much disappointment also the backlash against people that didnt like the movie was unfair
Jun 27 2018,negative,worst star wars movie rian johnson completely destroyed star wars such a disapointment
Jun 27 2018,negative,horrible plot writing and character development
Jun 27 2018,positive,haters got a reason or three but this is a good movie
Jun 27 2018,negative,it truly is a terrible film
Jun 27 2018,positive,i really enjoyed the movie and how it moves the star wars universe forward
Jun 27 2018,negative,what a wasted opportunitythe dark force is strong with this one
Jun 27 2018,positive,love this movie best star wars movie everrrrr
Jun 27 2018,negative,waited 6 months to rewatch what an utter waste of potential thru the lense of a standalone film this would be fine however as part of a larger story with such a deep deep mythos it fails on nearly every level director should have been given a star wars take ala rogue one or solo imo
Jun 27 2018,negative,almost everything about it was absolute garbage the whole point of the ot was for luke to learn to become a jedi and a responsible full blown adult with control over his emotions and the ability to help support his friends and family this movie spits in the face of that they wasted some of the great characters introduced in tfa and it was like they bent over backwards to make some of the new characters unlikable the only good thing about the movie was the acting    plot holes and completely unnecessary plot twists and lines were soooo numerous the empire built the biggest ships in the galaxy but theyre not as fast as smaller ships and so any time they need to catch someone theyre supposed to just follow and wait for them to run out of gas wtf  rey and kylo were the only okaygood part of this movie the throne room fight was excellent but at the end of it they took this amazing situational setup they created and tossed it over their shoulder like it was an old lightsaber they were somehow not interested in
Jun 27 2018,negative,they killed probably the best trilogy that could have ever been  lousy writing stupid comedy killed off so many legendary characters or battles that could have been disrespected the jedi storyline wiped out any interest or intrigue to see  9th episode what a waste of legendary characters most but not least  luke skywalker
Jun 27 2018,positive,while the cgi visuals and theme music was great it was mostly star wars fluff it was def dragged out at the end and the whole thing was rather predictable i really didnt care much for any of the flat onedimensional characters better than the last one that was just a carbon copy overall could take it or leave it
Jun 27 2018,negative,worst movie of the series they chose a very bad director for this one
Jun 27 2018,negative,i never was much of looking at movies reviews never commented on imdb or rotten tomatoes before but with this movie i have to confess i never felt so bad after watching a movie at the theater its hard to describe i left the theater in december feeling insulted i have seen lots of bad movies but non of them made me having this kind of bad feeling as tlj did watching this reviews and viewing peoples comments feel kind a relief to see that im not the one feeling the same thing as many movies reviews gave a lot of stars to tlj and rian johnson even got his own trilogy to make i was total wtf when i saw the news   im not a super hardcore sw fan but i love its universe lore always enjoyed the movies since i was a kid i also enjoyed the prequels which fans seems didnt like it much loved clone wars and star wars rebels the storytelling was always great it made me want to know more about each character about the force it was a very believable universe   now comes to tfa and tlj tfa was kind ok as a movie was good entertainment but was a kind of movie made only to make money through the nostalgia of the franchise as it havent added anything new to the sw universe rebels were still rebels empire is still the same thing with just another name storm troopers and everything else are the same as if people got old but time stoped on the galaxy the ot events never happened in an universe so well made by george lucas with potential to make so many great stories was kind boring just to watch the same rebels vs empiredeath star as nothing has changed since troj  on tlj was liking watching spaceballs just a bunch of morons fighting against another bunch of morons no character development at all just garbage and more garbage trowed at the audience so many gotcha scenes that really makes you feel insulted all the time while watching the movie and its a star wars movie not star wars parody the jokes didnt fit on the movie they were stupid stop copying marvels movie star wars is not marvel    the last jedi is really bad story telling bad writting bad direction tlj ended in a so big mess but like in a solved mess the rebels now are just a few morons left the new order has no real leader anymore only morons left so everything is a real mess but it didnt left anything open to make the people who is watching to get curious about what is going to happen on episode 9 for me the movie ended at the boy with the broom hell a star wars ending with a commercial about star wars what great ending there is nothing left to make me excited to wait 2 years to watch episode 9 when tfa ended i was super curious about many characters i was crazy to see the encounter of rey and luke but now are they dead or just fleeing on space    seems disney just wanted to play a game with the franchise where someone begins a story pass the flag to another to continue the story and see how it changes with no goal how they can create an epic story where the directors arent in the same page and they dont even know how its going to end  how disney can spend 4 billions in a franchise and have no plan for it at all   just hire amatour directors like rian johnson make random stupid stories and see if sells and in specially how disney can let their employees say that the problem are the fans telling that the fans and people who didnt like the movie are sexist racist and all this political words fans are the ones who made the franchise worth 4 billions are the people spending money on it how a company like disney can treat their customers like it  i wont see solo on the theather and i will deftinly wont pay to see another star wars movies after it please fire kathleen kennedy and rian johnson no more sjw agenda on the movie no more amatour writting and direction bring someone who understands what star wars is and has real leadership to take place on lucasfilm
Jun 27 2018,positive,great movie im not sure what all the fuss is about
Jun 27 2018,negative,just an overall terrible movie  glaring plot holes that repeatedly break the aesthetic distance  poor use of existing characters that only served to detract from the development of characters new to the franchise  if this story had not taken place in the starwars universe it would have been a flop
Jun 27 2018,negative,terrible terrible movie it is as if rian johnson wanted to destroy this franchise he did not stay true to the original characters or any premise in star wars lore when has fuel ever been mentioned in a star wars movie yet it is the central theme of plot a weird i dont recall han refueling the falcon in the middle of space questions were set up in tfa the first of the disney owned trilogy only to be thrown to the side and made a mockery of by johnson i have to believe they had a summary for all three films to follow originally anyway johnson through the original plan out the window and created something far worse than even the galactic empire
Jun 27 2018,negative,how on earth does this have 91 as a standalone movie its pretty terrible as a star wars film its an utter disgrace    after really enjoying both the force awakens and rogue one i was excited to see this the trilogy was set up nicely and various interesting plots were materialising the way the story was going and the quality of the last 2 films was promising to say the least     the last jedi is so bad in terms of plot and the wider stars wars story that it would be better if they just hadnt bothered there are plenty of reviews that pick apart the problems lukes character becoming a joke leia doing a dead space float thing likely the slowest chase in cinemtic history story lines and conflicts between characters within the move that were pointless and easily avoidible and the anticlimatic evaporation of all of tfa story lines
Jun 27 2018,negative,seeing this movie gave me some thrills in the moment but the moment the credits rolled i was just left feeling empty    i never got to see luke doing something cool and because of how the movie ended i never will even worse the luke we saw in this movie was the antithesis of the luke i knew from the older movies    i was not left with any reason to care for the new characters and i was not left with any reason to fear the only villain who is still standing     im just left with disinterest the old characters didnt do anything exciting and the new ones just arent interesting   since im not curious in the slightest about what is going to happen in the future movies this is probably the last star wars movie that i am going to watch
Jun 27 2018,positive,this movie took everything i excepted from it and made something else that ended up being surprising new and true to the saga at the same time and truly amazing
Jun 27 2018,negative,this film was awful plain and simple its full of pointless plots unfulfilled and abandoned character arcs and corny cringe worthy jokes this movie is the epitome of soulless filmmaking but hey at least you can sell some shiny new toys
Jun 27 2018,negative,this movie is just crap first half is not as bad i can even pass flying leia but the moment i realized finns and rose mission is useless and pointless and holdos or whatever her name was didnt have any reason to not tell poe about the plan things went straight to the gutter notice how starting there the movie just falls on its face with every frame the fucking movie is filled with plot holes and the script its just horrible i fucking laughed out loud at the cinema when rose saves finn which is terrible because she could have died or he could have died anyway and tells him love will saves us all or some crap gives him a kiss and then faints that alone will give you a good idea of what kind of shitfest this movie is the jokes are bad they didnt land at all the porgs suck characters have no actual development many things setup in force awakens were straight up ignored here rian johnson just destroyed lukes character entirely and so on just so many things wrong i didnt went to the theaters to see solo and i wont be seeing episode 9 i already made a decision i wont keep following this franchise or contributing to it in any way with my wallet until this shitfest is declared non canon no matter how decent epidode 9 turns out it wont save this crap star wars is dead to me as it is congrats rian johnson you made it you were able to destroy a whole franchise years in the making by one of your turds thats quite an accomplishment
Jun 27 2018,negative,the problem with this movie is quite simple whoever wrote the script is a complete moron who gleefully twists and manipulates the plot in order to suit their needs ignores common sense in order to provide things which can only be described as situations and seems to have just watched a bunch of oldtime saturday morning kids cartoons and not even good ones before throwing together a plot and may have even forgotten that the other star wars movies possibly even vii existed at all in short get a five year old to write the next script it will have fewer plotholes deus ex machinas and letdowns
Jun 27 2018,negative,give me back my wasted time  garbage
Jun 27 2018,negative,lazy writing stupid subplot that doesnt contribute anything to the story and worst of all changing the whole identity of a beloved character for no reason at all
Jun 27 2018,negative,worst star wars movie ever made sorry but thats it
Jun 27 2018,negative,the last jedi does not feel like a star wars movie  it rides on the presumption that you have bought into its narrative without attempting to conceal its lack of substance  the actors generally looked confused lost or as if they are trying to act the senselessness out of their behavior or scenario  feels like a movie based on the elementary level adaptation of the novelization of a better film  not only is it boring it is cringily unfunny  i laughed once at the pilot who says right away sir to kylo ren near the end and that was the only time i laughed at intended humor  i did find myself laughing incredulously at things that were  badly done  sharp ironic barks of laughter that would have likely ruined the experience for others had i been in theater  this movie felt like a tv episode that forgot its run time  the lightsaber battle was said to be good but i found it pretty weak especially after seeing how these powerful force users had blown away entire buildings without much of a thought  however even assuming these nameless red shirts matched their force power the choreography was meh and the last opponent kylo faced seemed to need kylos help in getting into position  however if you find yourself to be like most of the characters in the movie idiocracy this movie is made just for you  there isnt much about this movie of any merit  the dialogue was so patchy and feels like it was written like my review here in a dialogue box 3 inches wide by 14 inch high by someone who has already forgotten what else he has already covered and i could make more of an effort but meh it doesnt matter its good enough probably  right  how could you mess up star wars
Jun 27 2018,negative,theres about 5 minutes at the end of the film with luke skywalker that i enjoyed that felt like the star wars scene wed wanted its not perfect by any means    the rest of the film suffers from the ultimate sin its boring
Jun 26 2018,negative,i cant believe how bad this movie was so many plot holes garbage story telling at its worst its like the people who made this movie have never seen a starwars movie before  my friends and i walked out of the theatre in shock i never thought i would ever hate a starwars movie
Jun 26 2018,negative,i put off watching this flick for several months giving me time to clear my head of all the negative gossip because i really wanted to give the last jedi a fair shake    alas this film comes out of the gate badly and stays bad for the next two hours they altered the star wars fanfare theme which i noticed instantly they immediately tried injecting disneyesque humor none of the characters are likable or even tolerable including luke and leia the plot never takes off its just one long chase and the dialogue is abominable    theres no other way to say it except to openly admit that this film is boring whatever charm star wars once held decades ago is long long dead and its not coming back particularly under the guidance of disney    i confess i even had a low opinion of the second trilogy as it moved farther and farther away from the magic of the original at least episodes i thru iii had a few saving graces    but this third trilogy has zero redeeming value its like a shallow and insolent parody of star wars and a very very bad parody at that
Jun 26 2018,negative,this is the first time in my entire life as a fan that i have been so disappointed by a star wars film and i was there for the prequels jj abrams may have made a safe movie in the force awakens but he set up fun and interesting characters with great story pointsall of which are purposefully wasted in this film subverting audience expectation is great in orchestrated moderation but rian johnsons style is twist over plot character and enjoyment features a slow pointless main plot with various sideplots that are completely and infuriatingly also pointless takes pride in disrespecting anything fans cared about in their lifelong fandom including throwing aside traditions and characters if the movie offered anything new and interesting in its place it would be one thing but at the end you are left feeling devoid of enjoyment or interest in this bland vexing exercise in wheels spinning futility i find myself unsure whether i care about anything left in the movie universe enough to watch a third film it truly feels like a movie made by someone who hates star wars and wanted to ruin the franchise and any moments i appreciated are lost to my memory under the weight of this horribly constructed pile of bantha fodder movie
Jun 26 2018,positive,i dont know how anyone could not like this one there making way for the new crew and i love all the older actors but it cool how they transition the new ppl in the movie
Jun 26 2018,negative,a hot mess of a movie throwing out pretty much all of the story points built up in the previous installment in the series painful slowpaced boring side stories that make no sense and have no effect on the main plot outcome really really poor storytelling
Jun 26 2018,positive,great to see star wars firing on all cylinders again i waited 34 years
Jun 26 2018,positive,i loved it my favorite nonoriginaltrilogy star wars film much better than force awakens imo watch it yourself dont believe all the buzz except mine p
Jun 26 2018,negative,the audience score is a better representation of how good the movie was
Jun 26 2018,negative,it just wasnt good the director flat out changed the root of the main character that the star wars universe was built around in luke skywalker they wasted having anyone in the original cast take part as they did nothing with them there are some utter ridiculous moments that are way too far fetched to even suspend disbelief but my main problem was the complete reverse course on the current characters the force awakens set up great mysterious backgrounds on rey and snoke and even finn that you were excited to see those expanded upon in the follow up not only were they not expanded upon they were give lazy to no background and largely dismissed you know a cup of coffee is real easy to make kind of  hard to completely screw it up to the point of not drinking it i always thought the same of star wars until this mess this deserves to be shelved with the prequels redone and lets just imagine it doesnt exist
Jun 26 2018,neutral,i didnt hate this as much as some fans i place this one ahead of episode i episode ii and the theatrical clone wars movie thats all it has too many plot holes and is pretty terribly written in parts and for some specific characters other parts are amazing and breathtaking and have excellent writing  i very much enjoyed about 12 of this film problem is the other 12 is absolute garbage
Jun 26 2018,negative,i only saw it to see if it was as atrocious as reported  it was
Jun 26 2018,negative,no im not an internet troll im just a moviegoer slash film critic who knows a bad story with doll characters and wasted potencial when i see one
Jun 26 2018,positive,quit crying fanboys
Jun 26 2018,negative,the worst star wars film by far  where episode 7 was a bland retread of episode 4 this is a rippoff of episode 5 in reverse with elements of episode 6 and 1  this movie ignores character arcs universe rules and common sense to push weird political narratives and burn every bridge it can with the average viewer in the process     then there are the structural issues  the impressive number gaping plot holes alone put michael bays transformers franchise to shame  the utter lack of continuity with not only the original 6 films but the force awakens  none of the characters actions fall in line within their pre established status  many lines and actions have no meaning to the story by the next scene  this movie is a mess    then the worst part is the reversal and destruction of the entire reason star wars is a successful franchise  the total bastardization of luke skywalker and his legacy  there are no reasons or excuses to justify how this made it to film      this movie stands as a testament to how not to make a successful film  if the goal was to kill the franchise then it did that quite well
Jun 26 2018,negative,the humor was cringeworthy when rey was sensing the force the visuals of constant cut always was remarkably horrible some of the visuals were good but everything around the visuals felt like a rift on the prequels hamill did his best with what he was given but skywalker was entirely out of character
Jun 26 2018,negative,while the visuals music and performances by carrie fisher mark hamill and oscar isaac are great thats really where the praise ends the plot made little sense the script felt rushed and attempts to subvert audience expectations left fans angered while ruining continuity in summary the movie just doesnt make sense things like tracking through light speed luke the hero who left his training to save his friends isnt willing to go back to save his sister along with twisting the memories of the childhoods of many make the last jedi the worst star wars since attack of the clones the first movie i ever saw was a new hope and as a lifelong star wars fan i dont like the fact that this movie was made intentionally divisive to piss classic fans like myself off the worst parts of the movie were the fact that reys parents are nobody you know everybody thought she was strong and powerful because she was a skywalker or a kenobi that could possibly explain her abilities but no its just that shes nobody as well as the casino subplot which was really only to give finn a purpose and story in this movie as he does very little else it was boring and felt like the prequels it ends with absolutely nothing accomplished except pissing off the conservative audience all in all the last jedi is the embodiment of everything wrong with modern disney star wars
Jun 26 2018,positive,i felt that this movie was a marvel of storytelling and film making not only is it aesthetically groundbreaking deep with its characters and has some of john williams finest work but it also introduced new themes to star wars in some truly intelligent ways
Jun 26 2018,negative,horrible story that jumped around way too much  this did not build on the previous movie
Jun 26 2018,negative,one star for the excellent effects and visuals dop take a bow no more for pointless undeveloped characters plot holes the size of a sarlac b plots that belong in a bantha pen and so on if you like it thats cool i just like my effects with a side of plot and character also for a film that wants to subvert expectations it sure does borrow a lot from the ot some good moments
Jun 26 2018,negative,after seeing this terrible film and the depressing character assassination of luke skywalker ill never watch another rian johnson film again
Jun 26 2018,negative,aggressively slow and painful to watch could be the biggest letdown ive ever experienced from a second part of a trilogy there is absolutely no element of the story from force awakes that didnt either turn into a joke totally dismiss or intentionally glossed over to defy expectations the only problem is you actually have to replace those plot points with others that people actually find interesting this is a movie about a slow car chase and then they tell you the slow car chase you watched was entirely pointless and they could have avoided it entirely the name and the poster looked cool but it was maybe the biggest missed opportunity for a great cast great effects team and cinematographer with god awful direction some painfully awkward and unfunny jokes that wont age well and some of the choppiest and weirdest editing choices ive almost ever witnessed in a blockbuster the script the story the lack of continuity everything here was a total disaster the animal chase scene seemed more appropriate for a harry potter film the casino planet was so cheesy and out of place all of the jokes destroyed the vibe and would have seemed out of place even in guardians of the galaxy which strangely gets silly jokes right the only saving grace of this complete car wreck was rose tico who i honestly hope gets her own standalone film like solo i refuse to see solo after this car wreck and how badly the fans of star wars have been treated by executives the director and the stars wars cast unless there is a public apology i will not be in line opening day and i will not see episode 9 10 times in the theater as i have with every other star wars film since jedi its almost impossible for me to believe that this movie was directed by rian johnson i am a huge fan of brick and all of the subtly wit and amazing storytelling from that film were nowhere to be seen in the last jedi i wish you had given carrie fisher the feature and tribute to her amazing character that she deserved i wish she would have been able to use the force for something cooler than the weird cg moment you gave her im actually shocked that this has even a 46 from the audience it deserves something like 2 and thats only for the poster and potential for this cast
Jun 26 2018,negative,its a good movie but not a star wars movie
Jun 26 2018,negative,did not enjoy this star wars film 
Jun 26 2018,negative,at the second view i could not see the whole movie the story is incredibly shallow and boring for star wars
Jun 26 2018,negative,keep politics out of star wars
Jun 25 2018,negative,rian kill my star wars
Jun 25 2018,negative,flat predictable boring
Jun 25 2018,negative,a complete script train wreck disaster a meticulously crafted deconstruction of luke skywalkers persona and the stars wars universe overall a pathetic attempt to force new empty characters through uninteresting and uninspired plots the movie that made star wars like every other movie the movie that managed to unmade star wars packed in a flashy beautiful package with no substance whatsoever ryans jhonson regurgitated contradictory mess
Jun 25 2018,negative,complete poo this is not a star wars movie its a strange perversion of what made the franchise loved so much
Jun 25 2018,negative,this movie took the jedi  who were people trained to use their gifts for the betterment of all and turned them into superheroes born with force powers no training needed just like spider man or any other comic book hero   maybe if everybody hates on rose we wont see her in the next one just like jarjar
Jun 25 2018,negative,to put simply this movie is saga chushing that is how bad it is    some people relate this movie to bad fanfiction that is a horrible understatment imagine sitting your 6 year old down after watching the force awakens and asking then to write the next installment yeah that is how bad it is most fans who create fanfiction have at least some inkling of the rules star wars has not this film    as expected nothing is earned and everything is contrived character development is either nonexistence or butchered     so the plot is basically a battle star galactica episode where our heroes are running out of gas while fleeing the enemy that can track them through lightspeed travel yeah its as stupid as it sounds for a star wars movie    idk why but when i was a kid i was never thinkingwhere do the rebels fill up for gas where do the rebels buy their spaceships can force ghosts call down lightning can jedi project themselves across the galexy i guess i wasnt was creative as rian as a child
Jun 25 2018,positive,the last jedi isnt quite as good as the force awakens but its close i dont know how die hard star wars fans will feel about the last jedi but as someone who loves cinema this film really impressed me the performances and action scenes in this film are the best in the entire saga the amazingly choreographed action scenes utilize wide shots with few cuts all of the cast is top notch carrie fischer has so many scenes in this film as leia of just being a badass kylo ren played excellently by adam driver is still a complex villain that evokes a lot of sympathy daisy ridley as rey is still the strong hero we all love but she has chances in the film to show some real vulnerability oscar issac as poe is given a lot more to do he goes through a very interesting arc where he has to grow as a person the performance that steals the show however is mark hamill as luke hamill is brilliant in this film he is a broken man who is tired of being the hero and is just looking for a way to find peace the main focus of the plot is to evoke emotion and it succeeds at most attempts the emotional weight of this film is its greatest strength ive never felt this emotionally invested in a star wars film before the score by john williams and special effects are what you expect theyre incredible the only flaw this movie has is a subplot involving finn played by john boyega and rose played by kelly marie tran the actors do a good job but the entire subplot is pointless to the main plot you could cut finn and rose from the film and nothing of significance would change theres also a development involving their characters that i just didnt care about at all besides that subplot this was a masterfully crafted film with the magnetic action terrific performances and unprecedent emotional investment i can confidently say that rian johnson has created one of the best films of 2017
Jun 25 2018,negative,if i could give this movie negative stars i would  i would tell you what i dislike about it but it would take hours
Jun 25 2018,negative,luke skywalker turned into a grumpy excruciatingly annoying old man who dies out of excitement after turning himself into a space traveling ghost speaking of space traveling leia turned into a space traveling superwoman the blue hair tumbrelina sacrifices herself by driving the rebel capital ship into the 1st order ship how about using a droid for that and this are just a few of the endless stream of nonsensical crap in this movie the worse star wars up to date youll lose a few iq points after watching this
Jun 25 2018,positive,fantastic those trolls who downvoted shouldnt count
Jun 25 2018,negative,as a long time star wars fan this movie was a big let down the special effects were great with a few humorous scenes other than that i found the story to be a bit lacking for me rogue one is a much better movie
Jun 25 2018,negative,this movie is bullshit and full of wtf moments main characters are so stupid and poorly written they are able to win in every circumstances because huh they are the good guys  the heroes wins in the most stupid and improbable ways possible if i had to resume this movie in one sentence it would be shut up its magic
Jun 25 2018,neutral,star wars the last jedi is suffering from the failures of stars wars the force awakens as plot holes and confusing character spoiled the movies potential and relevance in the star wars saga
Jun 25 2018,negative,this is a flawed and underwhelming movie the 2 12 hour run time is used to shove social commentary down the viewers throat its abolishes any excitment created by the episode before it and the constant joking made me forget i was watching a star wars film terrible waste of time prequels looking pretty good after watching this
Jun 25 2018,negative,this latest episode of the star wars felt like theres no overarching storyline for the trilogy the force awakens felt like a rehash but set up nicely to this series then pretty much shot down all of the questions theres also a lot of inappropriate jokes and gags that doesnt rhyme to the overall tone of the movie there are also so many scenes that doesnt make sense like the one with leia flying and luke dying without explanation  lastly its just a very long movie with no payoff at the end its such sad that star wars have fallen this low in terms of storytelling
Jun 25 2018,negative,destroys everything the old movies built
Jun 25 2018,negative,a disturbing tangent in the star wars saga  this movie is an unfortunate mistake in every capacity  it generated tons of expectations and met none of them  it tried desperately to take the story into bold new arenas only to give the middle finger to the stories that came before it  take away the mind boggling departure from the star wars universe and its still a poorly written movie with sub plots that make no sense and underdeveloped characters that could have brought so much more to the telling if allowed  bad bad movie  terrible star wars movie
Jun 24 2018,negative,worst star wars film ever made completely destroyed everything luke stands for and believes in characters constantly making stupid decisions and lets not forget space leia not fit enough to have the star wars name in the title
Jun 24 2018,negative,the last jedi indeed star wars is now dead  plus i now have a negative view on  disney
Jun 24 2018,negative,yuck    one of the stupidest movies ive ever seen in my life  too many annoyingly cute animals  this is star wars not pokemon  all the men were weak and all the women were self righteous and condescending  did dr phil write this movie      the main character wasnt challenged in any way and overcame nothing  a beloved character luke skywalker was destroyed  all the jokes were juvenile and stupid  i will never see another rian johnson movie again
Jun 24 2018,negative,there are a couple of cool moments in this movie but extraordinarily incompetent and underdeveloped characters on both sides of the galactic struggle make it virtually unwatchable  im not sure if it was the writing or the directing but it did not seem to be an issue with actingit actually looks like most of the people did the best they could with what they were given  unfortunately there is just too much filler and not nearly enough substance  what little substance there is seems to be at odds with what we have seen from the franchise in the past  save yourself the time and watchread a quick synopsis to catch up
Jun 24 2018,negative,what a huge let down nothing remotely close to an ending that id be like ok i get it i dont get it at all it did not feel like a star wars movie how can he claim to be a life long fan i wont be watching any more if rj is behind it
Jun 24 2018,positive,this film was a fun exciting addition to the star wars saga its not perfect but its definitely one of the greats the cinematography visuals characters and score were all brilliant i love this movie while it has several glaring flaws the pros far outweigh the cons
Jun 24 2018,negative,smhdisney needs to listen to their fans and not create a story that destroys character arcs that have already been established
Jun 24 2018,negative,the worst star wars film ever made it was basically like a remake of empire strikes back but in reverse the characters are not very likeable leaving you disinterested in who they are or what they stand for and during one major part of the film some characters decide to go off on a side story that is just basically a waste of time in an attempt at diverting the viewers attention away from the fact the films story is basic to none existant
Jun 24 2018,negative,horrific is too kind a word for this steaming dumpster file im done with star wars thanks sjws
Jun 24 2018,negative,first im not a die hard star wars fan in fact except for the very first ive never really cared much for the story however even i left the theater thinking to myself wow they really poo pooed all over the most beloved heroes of all time
Jun 24 2018,positive,i enjoyed it a lot but why did they waste finnleiaphasma and r2 and more although i still look really forward to episode ix its still enjoyable to me tho rating72
Jun 24 2018,negative,they miss the point that star wars its about skywalkers this should be a spinoff   until now i love all star wars disneys spinoff  but  the new trilogy sucks so far
Jun 24 2018,negative,poor direction and bad editing bloated unnecessary subplots except for episode 2 this is the worst in the saga
Jun 24 2018,negative,a really terrible film that i wanted to love the last jedi took what few glimmers of hope for a compelling trilogy remained after the force awakens and crushed them not only is the last jedi a bad star wars film its just a bad film in general
Jun 24 2018,positive,i liked it didnt have much hope and it started boring and predictable but ended in a more interesting way was also great to see the real luke skywalker and princess leia together for one last time not cgi which they will probably enact a billion times in the future you cannot expect much from these movies they are above all entertainment for kids would also like to mention that adam driver makes for a great villain sad but also ruthless theres something truly dark about him that also makes him brilliant
Jun 24 2018,neutral,an average movie filled with outstanding moments and characters but topped with a thick frosting of horrible and cringeworthy scenes
Jun 24 2018,negative,looks amazing but the story is horrible taking the characters in bizarre directions 
Jun 24 2018,negative,horrible movie if you took the star wars out of this and replaced it with orginal characters it wouldnt have blipped on any film radar  the half star goes to sound and visual production
Jun 23 2018,negative,the force awakens was an amazing movie it combined all the best parts of the star wars original trilogy and the prequels without the worst parts of the prequels      so the last jedi was a huge downgrade by comparison  weird plot lines often times poorly executed humor and just all in all an uninspired mess it tries so hard to be shocking and new that it just comes off as another try hard sequel     some scenes were good but the movie as a whole falls flat
Jun 23 2018,negative,i went into this movie with no expectations having only seen two reviews one good and one bad and having avoid fan theories  the biggest let down of this movie is you can see the potential for greatness only for it to settle for mediocrity the pacing is completely off drawing out scenes for far longer than necessary the dialogue is barely blist movie quality the plot while having potential is failed by the writing and the character development is practically nonexistent  the only reason i didnt give it a lower score is that attack of the clones is arguably worse in all above listed categories
Jun 23 2018,positive,so many questions left to be answered in the next movie a great performance by the late great carrie fisher had a few flaws and left a bit to be desired here and there
Jun 23 2018,negative,probably the most disappointing movie i have ever seen in my entire life and the way johnson has handled the criticism is incredibly arrogant and disrespectful to lucas who lets not forget is the only reason there is this universe that we love and care so deeply about i just hope they dont let johnson make a trilogy and divide fans ever further
Jun 23 2018,negative,literally cinema trash
Jun 23 2018,negative,has some upsides but mostly feels like another disappointing moneygrab more time spend planning merchandise than story the film loses whatever promise force awakens left for it and runs with its worst what feels like a huge step in the wrong direction sad to see something so big so poorly done
Jun 23 2018,negative,this is a star wars movie written and directed by a person who quite obviously knows nothing about star wars or epic storytelling i gave it a whole star though it deserves none because this site doesnt count anything under one whole star toward the score for the audience they will show your review but your rating will not be added to the average ive seen reports that if these rating had been taken into account the actual score would be around 27 and not 46
Jun 23 2018,negative,felt cold after watching this film such a shame it had some great cinematic shots and scenery but had no heart was really disappointed to see luke portrayed as a some negative cynical old man
Jun 23 2018,negative,the last jedi is the movie that destroyed everything beautiful in the franchise
Jun 23 2018,negative,terrible movie it is objectively flawed on multiple levels from endless plot holes to side plots that get more screen time than the actual story   speaking of which  there isnt really a cohesive story in the entire film it can be described as a whole lot of nothing happens for the entire run time
Jun 23 2018,negative,this movie was a mess the most important part of every movie is plot and characters and they were both done poorly our hero luke was destroyed finn was forgettable poe was humiliated rose and holdo were insufferable hux was a clown and kylo isnt a scary villain the plot was boring and dragged on for far too long much of the writing made no sense and provided the audience with no payoff also many potential plot threads from tfa were wasted snoke was a powerful villain whose backstory could have been interestingbut he was killed in a cheap unsatisfying way reys parentage was hinted to be interesting but never mind her parents are nobodies there seemed to be a story behind the lightsaber rey found something that called it to herthat wasnt brought up again there was so much bulidup to rey finding luke but he just tosses the light saber over his shoulder im not sure what there is to look forward to in episode ix the characters all seem boring or unlikeable and there are very few plot threads left worth caring about the critics consensus says this movie honors the sagas rich legacy which is a sad joke as this movie does exactly the opposite   there were a few scenes that stood out to me because they were so preposterous and out of place first was carrie poppinsmaybe that scene was supposed to be inspiring but it came across as laughable in a bad way also the scene where holdo belittles poe no idea why that scene was there but it made me care less about poe while hating holdo finally the scene at the end where rose crashes into finn and her rationale for doing so was the absolute worst part of the movie for me what a great way to ruin a climactic  part near the end of the movie   the trailers for the movie tell a different story than the movie itself does captain phasma is advertised but barely has a part in the movie lightsaber duels were scarce in the movie even though they were heavily advertised its like the makers of the film knew what audiences wanted but intentionally did the opposite its like this is another of rian johnsons subversions done for the sole purpose of surprising the audience   ive kind of been all over the place in this review theres just so much that went wrong in this movie its hard to lay it all out in a way that makes sense im still baffled by the shoddy writing in this movie as well as the incredible efforts of the mainstream media to defend this movie
Jun 23 2018,negative,quite a dissapointment for sure so much potential so many promises madeeven the trailers are better than what the final product wasis that badwell id say this about itvisually its an impecable movietake that awayand its an empty  canheartlesswithout a compelling  storythe tepid rian jhonsonwill be always remember as the guy who wanted to make a star wars movie but in the process killed an extraordinary opportunity and even worsewas awarded by his friendmrs kennedya new set of movie nonethelessbeyond creepydreadful
Jun 23 2018,negative,this movie is a tragedy for the whole star wars saga ive barely kept watching it until the end
Jun 23 2018,negative,how does such a terrible film have 91 from reviews and 46 from audiences this was miserable avoid do not waste your time
Jun 23 2018,negative,disappointing plot holes character development and humor  a longer review and analysis is warranted for an opinion like this but this movie numbed me to caring
Jun 23 2018,negative,what a travesty visuals for the most part good music good the rest has been well documented by the audience reviews too many bad parts to waste time naming worst thing of all was destroying the previous sw legacy for no good reason except i can only guess to say because we can
Jun 23 2018,negative,yuck its bad enough that it was boring but it also ruins the legacy of luke skywalker and turns him into an unlikable jerk
Jun 23 2018,positive,a film that lives up to the legacy of star wars and gives it new life lukes arc is great and handled with aplomb rey is still a bit too perfect but it doesnt detract the casino scenes are both good and awful i wish they could have found a better way to explore that subplot    all told this film reaches some of the best highs of any of the star wars movies  it  isnt a copy like force awakens was even though it shared some superficial beats to empire    cant wait to see rian johnsons new trilogy if it follows in the path of last jedi then im sure it will be great too
Jun 23 2018,negative,i did not enjoy star wars the last jedi it felt like a complete disconnect from the original trilogy as well as the force awakens the casino subplot was completely unnecessary and such a waste of storytelling luke was simply treated as a throw away character i was bored i was so bored i was on my phone most of the time and i love star wars its such a shame that star wars has come to this
Jun 23 2018,negative,needless plot diversions  too lengthy  very much mirrored the story of empire but way worse  excessive illtimed humor that strays from the typical genre mood  the story didnt feel like a sequel so much as it seems like an attempt to steer the series in a completely different direction  i can appreciate this attempt but i did not care for the way the plot was delivered
Jun 23 2018,positive,i can see where people are coming from in saying that this movie sucked but in all honesty its a star wars movie and the last jedi provided some of the most amazing sequences in sw cinematic history
Jun 23 2018,negative,this movie literally made me hate star wars
Jun 23 2018,negative,i didnt think it could get worse than jar jar binks but at this point id be happier with a jar jar origins story then the trash they are putting on screen    this francine is dead to me
Jun 23 2018,negative,worst movie of the year of the decade way to destroy a golden legendary franchise everything they did ruined everything they touched in this movie i dont know how they could have done a worse job hurt and destroyed the characters and story more than they did everything they did everything was wrong and bad for star wars everything use your brain and really look at what they did horrible
Jun 23 2018,positive,since i havent watch the previous movies sometimes i cant figure out what was happening before this one but it definitely is a cool movie
Jun 22 2018,positive,some massive but fixable in ix plot holes and mistreatment of luke also a terrible character in rose and no not for racist or misogynistic reasons still has its epic star wars moments but contains some of the biggest missteps in the franchise could look better in retrospect if some plot holes are fixed in ix or comics or tv shows
Jun 22 2018,negative,if you like star wars dont watch this movie
Jun 22 2018,negative,the movie was an abomination to all star wars fans it was so bad it killed the fan in me and my family where to start how about with some of the lessons we learn in the film rey taught us that family is irrelevant the purple haired admiral holdo taught us never to question authority especially female authority from rose we learn that capitalism is evil these are communist manifesto themes and also animals have rights too and men are disposable ryan johnson the director hates the star wars fans so much he humiliated the hero luke skywalker and made him a grumpy old pessimist he killed star wars lore with using light speed as the ultimate weapon now all you have to do is make some drone ships equipped with light speed to easily take down any empire fleet or death star i can go on and on and on and onthe one light in the movie was the battle with snoke i hope disney fires ryan johnson and starts listening to fans otherwise they will implode
Jun 22 2018,negative,the movie was an abomination to all star wars fans it was so bad it killed the fan in me and my family where to start how about with some of the lessons we learn in the film rey taught us that family is irrelevant the purple haired admiral holdo taught us never to question authority especially female authority from rose we learn that capitalism is evil these are communist manifesto themes and also animals have rights too and men are disposable ryan johnson the director hates the star wars fans so much he humiliated the hero luke skywalker and made him a grumpy old pessimist he killed star wars lore with using light speed as the ultimate weapon now all you have to do is make some drone ships equipped with light speed to easily take down any empire fleet or death star i can go on and on and on and onthe one light in the movie was the battle with snoke i hope disney fires ryan johnson and starts listening to fans otherwise they will implode
Jun 22 2018,negative,ive never booed to a screen before until i saw this excuse of a star wars movie
Jun 22 2018,negative,this didnt even really feel like a star wars movie im all for doing new things but it still needs to feel like it belongs there were a few things i liked but i can count those on one hand and that is something i never wanted to have to say about a star wars movie the pacing is off the subplots are uninteresting the new force powers are jarring and the whole thing just ends up feeling like poor fanfiction
Jun 22 2018,positive,literally the best star wars film to date definitely has problems but has been the darkest most character driven narrative in the star wars universe
Jun 22 2018,positive,very different from the rest of the saga but honestly i thought johnsons take on this film was interesting and entertaining the characters are still great and so are their story arcs the humor wasnt totally sucked out and it was watchable unlike episodes 1 and 2
Jun 22 2018,negative,lukes character has always been about hope holdo should wear a uniform and cant fly a ship through hyperspace into a ship otherwise everyone would do it and the starkilller attack squadron would have hit the planetary sheilds rey is a mary sue
Jun 22 2018,negative,this is a bad movie anybody with a mind of their own can see that like this is unforgivably bad so many counterintuitive pointless scenes so many dumb moments its hard to believe this is a accident a movie this bad has to be purposely made this way like every singe chance they have to diminish a character they take just look at snokes face when he dies he looks needlessly moronic my theory is this movie was made to cause outrage amongst older fans to make them seem overly sensitive and not reasonable just to make younger people feel more important when a new star wars fan see negative reviews about this movie they probably think hey this is star wars star was is good  what a bunch of bitter old men when in reality they have every reason to hate it because it goes entirely against the arcs and terminology of what a fan expects from the series i could go a bit further and say this is to reinforce a hivemind like complex over films so that the only thing that matters in a film is its branding and not the content within the movie itself
Jun 22 2018,negative,i was waiting a really long time for this movie also it was first star wars movie i had an opportunity to watch in united states the way they treated my favourite character was a great disappointment to me and franckly i wish it was possible to unsee this movie
Jun 22 2018,negative,too much attention to unnecessary characters a horrible drama 
Jun 22 2018,negative,saw it   disney wanted to destroy star wars if the movie poster or the title is not enough then listen to the characters saying it straight into the camera  nay your face  and if this is not enough listen to mark hamills regret  this movie as a single installment would probably be ok but does not fit into the star wars canon yeah as said  it finishes it
Jun 22 2018,negative,its a pretty movie however it is so full of inconsistencies in both the star wars universe lore and just the movies own plot line storylines end up leading no where characters act with no thought of the consequences random aliens are freed while their humanoid caretakers are left behind to deal with the consequences somehow we are to believe that there is no greater evil in the galaxy then arms dealers it makes you wonder if no one will follow the good guys then are they really just the bad guys but we are watching a movie from their delusional perspective established characters are doing things outside of their nature as a character and it doesnt add an arc to the plot it seems to be pushing some kind of political agenda but its not entirely clear what as this movie is so incoherent this last point isnt as much a fault of the movie so much as the culture but if someone shares their displeasure of the movie then they are labeled as some kind of bigot and a alternative subset of the fans even though it seems that the majority of the people on this website agree the movie was bad in conclusion this movie is so bad it makes the prequels look like some of the most perfect movies ever made jarjar and slide transitions and all
Jun 22 2018,negative,bad movie and the reviews here are fake june 13th too many revies to be real
Jun 22 2018,negative,a crime against humanity
Jun 22 2018,negative,this was terrible  i have been a major star wars fan all my life  the issue is not about the changes or the new characters  its just a horrible story with shitty plot lines that dont make sense also a lack of answers for multiple characters snoake and rey for example was extremely frustrating  they made us ask the questions in the force awakens  they introduced the characters gave us mystery behind them then gave the most pathetic cop out  or even better dont even answer the question and kill off the character it is very worrying that disney is hiring the same director to do more movies the issue with the movie is not about not following the stars wars mythology or that its not what fan boys want it is literally just a poorly done movie i will not be seeing any of the movies that rian johnson directs as to be blunt he is incompetent
Jun 22 2018,negative,this one film and director may kill the franchise cancell the rain johnson contract while you can save star wars
Jun 22 2018,positive,incredible movie that continues the epic saga while bringing a revitalizing energy to the franchise cant reccomend it enough
Jun 22 2018,negative,too many flaws to list  extremely disappointed in what this film is
Jun 22 2018,negative,when viewing this movie i was yawning i looked at the time and thought to myself how is this not even half way through yet at the end of the movie i thought to myself well that was a royal waste of time i want my 2 and a half hour and money back the plot was full of plot holes with so many conveniences that just blow my mind how stupid the writers think the audiences are there are so many inyourface political viewpoints dont die a hero but follow orders without question it is ok to protect your love one even at the cost of hundreds of others capitalism drives the war i was ok with this and thought it was a nice side of war we never thought about in star wars but what is the point of introducing it if it is so bad can the characters do anything to stop capitalism are they changing their focus on not space battle but political warfare now if not then why even bother talking about it slavery and animal abuse is both bad but lets just save the animals and those kids who cares if they are being forced into child labor and will probably have to clean up the mess we just made there are good moments as well im sure and the film has a lot of budget to spend on making it visually acceptable however the movie is just so overflown with plot holes bad writing bad characterization and out of place humor that i cannot recall any of the good stuff they tried so hard to make female lead a thing but as a vietnamese female i never hated a female character in a movie more than rose tico the actress did a great job but too bad she had to play the most pointless character ever the last scene with her and finn i cringed so hard i had to look away just why they met literally a few hours ago she was doubtful of him most of the time and now she loves him and willing to sacrifice the last hope of the galaxy that her sister died trying to protect for him wow just wow  then i went to see infinity wars not even once did i checked my watch and the 2h40m went by like a flash like the last jedi infinity war was also tasked with bringing together the series beloved characters and setting up the big bad villain for a grand finale and it has done it without shitting on its characters while respecting its fans and viewers the last jedi should be ashamed of itself
Jun 22 2018,negative,in many ways while i was watching the last jedi but the after taste is seriously bad its like this movie was done by people who dont know the star wars universe and couldnt care less about the world and the characters from the old movies they also dont seem to know how to write believable characters so it feels like the franchise is now officially dead its a beauty to watch but painful to digest
Jun 22 2018,neutral,a major letdown luke character was utterly wasted a shame jj wasnt the director major plot holes and character development from tfa was seemingly ignoreddropped by rian johnson
Jun 22 2018,negative,good picture bad script bad storytelling bad nonexistent character development no worldbullding this is barely a movie to be honest seeing how well theyre doing with marvel i was hyped to see disney reviving the star wars franchise but now i just want it to die the prequels were poorly made but at least they had interesting stories characters and built a fascinating world the last jedi is just an empty shell i would have a lot more to say and argue my point but this film isnt worth any more of my time i just want to forget it even exists
Jun 21 2018,positive,very surplrising movie in positive sense good editing and amazing visuals i do not understand those who rnak it 05 because it doesnt reflect the book or comic they once read
Jun 21 2018,negative,wanted to like this so much but i cant get over how they portrayed luke like tfa it puts a damper on the ending of rotj knowing what is to come i didnt like the ship chase or casino planet plots and some of the characters actions were very questionable the lack of a time jump also hurts the story i think
Jun 21 2018,negative,not a good movie  poorly written poorly directed and poorly edited  a lot couldve been improved by cutting out certain characters and scenes that interrupted the flow of the film  also the writer didnt seem to understand the main characters in the franchise and that fact was evident in the writing
Jun 21 2018,positive,this movie was great if you werent into the messages of the film about moving on from the past and stepping into the future then thats too bad its not your star wars its everyones star wars you dont get to claim ownership of something that belongs to all of us rian said it at the end with the shot of that little boy at the end its not special people with midiclorians in them that lets you use the force anyone can be a jedi
Jun 21 2018,positive,wonderful film gorgeous great message no matter where you come from you can do whatever you want to do
Jun 21 2018,negative,so incredibly awful i cant even bring myself to watch it a second time every interesting storyline that was provided by tfa was just ignored and dismissed terrible direction terrible story bad acting 
Jun 21 2018,negative,the character assassination of luke was unforgivable the space chase was boring and unbelievable finn and rose rescued animals but left the slaves behind holdo stayed behind to fly a ship in a straight linein space reys parents werenobody snoke wasnobody the knights of ryn werenobody the movie plot holes were legion the film was junk cleverly disguised as a science fiction film
Jun 21 2018,negative,rian johnson admitted he didnt watch the force awakens before writing the script for this movie and it really really shows it baffles my mind how disney can set out to make a trillogy of films and have no idea what the arcs and major plots are
Jun 21 2018,negative,reeks of deliberate sabotage this was basically a fanfic that shouldve been forgotten on some tweenagers livejournal in the early 2000s
Jun 21 2018,negative,the plot of this movie was absolutely terrible ryan johnson kathleen kennedy and disney should be ashamed of themselves throw jarjar abrams in with them for defending this garbage and blaming insecure men shame on all of you i wont be giving them or disney any more of my money
Jun 21 2018,negative,i feel a disturbance in the force a disturbance that has created a media nightmare star wars the last jedi is not a good movie it was an unpleasant experience filled with offputting characters a stale main story and politics that are being forced onto the audience whether they like it or not before i get into the review though i would just like to say i cannot believe the ridiculousness that has occurred from both audience members and the filmmakers themselves when it comes to this movie on one side you have directors and people in charge of companies worth billions of dollars isolating and insulting audience members by calling them bigots and saying they want to segregate their audience by saying things like the force is female or there are too many white guys in star wars on the other side you have people who allegedly berated an actress for her portrayal of a character people of the world if you did this please refrain the actors did not write it they are merely doing their job a job that i have very little to complain about that said i will do my best to explain this critics gripe about the movie star wars the last jedi yet giving credit where credit is due  despite the media circus and the glaring problems with the film there are some arguably strong moments and entertaining parts in this movie for one thing the world building and stunning visuals were something i praised upon watching this movie something that star wars has always been good at is making their movies look good this movie was colorful the world building was nice especially ahchto everything looked real and the landscape was beautiful there were also a lot of good shots in this movie one of the best ones is where a ship crashes into a bunch of other ships at light speed towards the end of the film arguably one of the best scenes in the movie despite the characters throughout the movie being flat annoying or confusing the acting in this movie is pretty solid everyone looked and sounded like the people they were playing none of it ever looked forced or fake even mark hamill as luke skywalker a character that will be discussed later he was doing a very good job these are probably the best qualities of the film its a shame that i dont have many good things to say but its the truth and that is what is most important  it is still unbelievable the number of things wrong with star wars the last jedi from a critics perspective i wrote previously that the visuals were good in this film that doesnt mean i enjoyed the special effects in the film there were scenes with cgi that went from good to terrible quickly there is a scene where two characters are riding these alien horse creatures they look like something from an xbox game similarly to a scene with a character resurrection where she flies through space and it looked so fake that it took me out of the movie some audience members even started  laughing as the scene played asking what was that the characters were another gripe in viewing the film rey is just as bad as she was in the previous movie shes an overpowered mary sue and before you call me a misogynist let me tell you that if she was a man i would say the same thing she learns nothing in the movie yet is perfect in every way from the beginning of the movie to the end she doesnt grow or change as a character and people actively defend her character despite the glaring problems finn is a character who is used only for terrible jokes and gags as well as a subplot that goes nowhere quickly in the film they tried to make him some sort of comedic relief but it fails as a result rose is also a bad character in that her lines are so corny and on the nose she has barely any impact on the story and they try to make her a love interest which falls flat immediately luke skywalker is a completely different character than he was in the original trilogy in that he turns to a cranky old hermit who betrays everything that the character was about whats worse is that he doesnt grow or change as a result he just sits there complaining that the dark side is too strong and kylo ren is beyond saving so go away i mean that can work as a story but if that was the route they were going with that luke wanted to be alone then why in the last movie did he leave a map for people to find him like did he just forget the tone was another big problem with the film it didnt know what it wanted to be and it wound up being a mess some parts had like childish humor like finn being naked in a suit and leaking water on the floor and then scenes where a person is violently ripped apart by lasers can you make up your mind is it a comedy is it an action movie a political thriller finally the politics that the movie is trying to force on people this is less to do solely with the movie now but just my two cents in this is a message to everyone in hollywood stop putting your political beliefs into your movies if its a political movie fine but stop forcing politics into films the feminism message in this movie is a joke with holdos character too busy making the men characters look dumb to make a plan that actually makes sense to the mary sue that is rey it becomes too much to bear very quickly  i have seen all the star wars movies to this date and i have never been more disappointed by one of these movies than i am about this one its a shame what was once a revered iconic dream of a young director that grew into a billiondollar industry is now suffering and becoming comically bad i have hope for the future and i want these movies to succeed because there were still good things about this movie and interesting ideas but the potential is just potential i wont give this movie the 91 percent that other people have given it because much like rey and her powers it hasnt earned that score star wars started out as a blessed franchise lets not see it die a poor series of mediocrity
Jun 21 2018,negative,the worst star wars movie
Jun 21 2018,negative,i am not a russian bot   missed opportunity great visuals some really good moments overall poor pacing until last act terrible humor disjointed heavy handed social comentary did not seem to mess wither understand movies prior to it  sucked all the momentum out of the trilogy
Jun 21 2018,negative,now i know what it is like to have my soul crushed by the force  that was my first comment after seeing the movie  after rogue one became my favorite star wars movie to date i cant begin to explain how much of a let down this movie was  it is not that great of a movie but absolute hot garbage as a star wars move  horribly written characters for one  poe rose and holdo were bad but the enemies good god  instead of cold calculated  and menacing we got a bunch of incompetent morons  there was also endless plot holes and endless overly silly or corny scenes  the overall tone of the movie was just weird  it is like they tried to make poorly written avengers move except the overly goofy tone that works in superhero movies just doesnt fit star wars at all
Jun 21 2018,negative,the special effects were great i loved some of yodas lines however admiral holdo wss a horribly done character the events and plot were almost to the point of idiotic rey just knows everything no weaknesses leia can wake up in space and fly no one gets affected by vacuum of space when they pull her in the whole guilt tripped casino planet scene was downright needless luke is next to meaningless it all seems like someones silly dream its definitely not a star wars movie
Jun 21 2018,negative,i never thought i would miss george lucas as much as i did when i watched this steaming pile of monkey dung
Jun 21 2018,negative,awful film with rehashed scenes and guardians of galaxy humour and mary poppins throw in
Jun 21 2018,negative,this film takes everything promised by the previous film and rips it up under the pretext of surprising the audience the absence of expected revelations combined with lacklustre plots and new characters that seem entirely 1 dimensional make this the worst stars film so far its as if disney were so scared by criticism that force awakens was too similar to a new hope that they tried to distance themselves from it so much in this one that they took away everything that was star wars and forgot to set themselves up episode ix there are a couple of visually spectacular scenes  but the subversion and plotholes to get to them mean that they dont come close to saving the movie
Jun 21 2018,negative,i have been a star wars fan my whole life and  grew up on the prequels however i watched the force awakens and thought it was an okay movie but was really looking forward to the last jedi because of luke however luke was not in this movie mark hamill played a totally different character also every man in this movie was torn a part by the woman character to make themselves look superior it was a horrible movie
Jun 21 2018,negative,probably the worst star wars movies in cannon writing was atrocious   characters you feel nothing for disrespect for old characters humor that wasnt funny bad pacing continuity issues  overall very bad
Jun 21 2018,negative,by far one of the worst movies i have seen in my lifetime
Jun 21 2018,negative,the last jedi is the worst star wars movie ever made after lackluster initial reactions i decided not to see it in the theaters and waited for its amazon release i am glad i did and still feel i wasted my money   the movie was poorly edited and its attempt to be cutsie with the porg failed miserably there was only one scene with the porg that actually benefited the movie the rest looked as if someone cut in happy feet footage as a joke the porg detracted from the drama of the other scenes they were in   the entire finnrose adventure contributed nothing to the movie and was ruined with what seemed to be a social justice punch list of issues they just had to address   reys character who i thought might be interesting after force awakens  became incredibly one dimensional she is made to look invulnerable incapable of failure and loaded with unearned ability at everything she does the movie missed every opportunity to actually make her interesting the only reason i gave the movie a 112 star rating was the vfx were a bit above average and john williams score did not disappoint   disney may as well not make an episode ix star wars is dead the first order has captuered the last resistance base the resistance is on the run reduced to one shipload that the rest of the galaxy doesnt give a damn about and they killed luke skywalker who died without an heir here ends star wars there is nothing left to bring back  there is no character left in the star wars universe that i care enough about to pay to see another star wars movie
Jun 21 2018,negative,pros  visually stunning a few good fight scenes    cons jokes are forced bad dialogue plot holes everywhere jarring editing unsatisfying character development entire plot is just a slow chase scene    overall with the plot character development dialogue leaving such a bad taste in your mouth its hard to appreciate any merits of the movies which are few
Jun 21 2018,negative,if you think youre not good enough then youre probably not
Jun 21 2018,negative,it gets 1 star only because they dont count half stars
Jun 21 2018,negative,great visuals and nothing more  humor falls flat and adds no value  harrison ford is lucky solo he was killed off in 7  the heroes run around to try and save the resistance but they dont accomplish anything  the heroes should actually save the day in a star wars movie  the all powerful snoke was a wimp and gets killed by a whiny brat kylo ren  leia is now superman and can live in space without a space suit and fly around in space  even in the prequels the jedi had to use a breathing device to to go underwater  at least finn could have had his randy quaid moment independence day and save the day but no  you have luke project himself across the universe to stall while the last remaining good guys escape  captain plasma is still a wimp  everyone is waiting to find out who reys parents are and then it is a big nothing  rey knows how to use the force with little or no training  even anakin had to be trained  its like rian johnson has never seen a star wars film before  disney needs to come up with a plan and map things out rather than just have random directors do random things with this franchise  it is almost like this was a standalone movie that does not resemble a star wars movie other than special effects and costumes  close to being just as bad as episode i
Jun 21 2018,negative,i think i made it about 10 minutes into this movie before turning it off keep in mind that i was on a 17 hour flight to japan and instead decided to watch every other movie they had come back to tlj and then turn it off at the same moment the moment was when snoke told kylo he looked like an idiot wearing his helmet why why do that to your villian could you imagine if palpatine did that to vader
Jun 21 2018,negative,unfortunate to say but i enjoyed episode one with jar jar binks more than this installment rose tico and jar jar binks are about on the same level of annoying
Jun 21 2018,negative,even the stunning visual effects are unable to redeem this piece of garbage
Jun 21 2018,negative,poor pace luke didnt have to die
Jun 21 2018,negative,complete cancer sjws have ruined star wars and rian johnson got away with murder
Jun 21 2018,negative,i have always loved the star wars franchise i have loved star wars more than any other movie franchise something about it just really appealed to me that is perhaps why i feel so utterly disappointed by this poor excuse of a film i feel my love has been betrayed by a director with a flippant disregard for the story and the history of the star wars universe   i have never rolled my eyes so much in a movie before i thought i might get eye strain there are so many nonsensical sequences lazy visuals plot holes lame jokes and gotcha moments that i wanted to throw my popcorn at the screen in disgust i was truly sadden at what they did to my favourite franchise and i knew that this was it my love affair with star wars was finished disney stole my childhood dreams and sold them for a dollar i wont be back
Jun 21 2018,negative,this film was proof positive  that the goal of disney pertaining to this franchise was to strip mine it and use its burned out husk to spew the rotten stinking extremist  political philosophy  shared by k kennedy  and r johnson  into the faces of star wars fans all attempts at creating good characters  plot and dialogue were abandoned in preference to this end avoid this contagion if you value your soul
Jun 21 2018,negative,just awful does not belong into the sw universe
Jun 20 2018,negative,looked good but written pretty bad i didnt appreciate a lot of stuff it did to the star wars universe
Jun 20 2018,negative,so much wrong with this movie it was all over the place it was by far the worst star wars movie i have seen to date
Jun 20 2018,negative,beautiful looking film but quite disappointing in many ways
Jun 20 2018,positive,easily the best star wars movie ever made  i really dont care what the fans think  if they dont like it its because the film is so complex and deep that they cant comprehend its intricacies  screw abrams nothing that happened in tfa matters and who cares what will happen in ixi dont  this movie made a ton of money so it must be good
Jun 20 2018,negative,such a frustrating disappointment and wasted opportunity  the strong visual effects and some nice settings and set designs are not enough to save this film from a raft of problems from bad pacing and a plodding story line to nonsensical extensions to the fundamental laws of the star wars universe ridiculous force powers and hyperspace physics to utter lack of believable onscreen chemistry between the characters old and new to disgraceful recharacterization of an old hero luke for no good reason or payoff to overbearing ideology superseding good storytelling to hey look at this bet you didnt expect that im sooo subversive arrogantly selfish direction that shocks viewers without delighting them to numerous dropped story lines and setups from episode vii that go nowhere to humor that veers into spoof territory to weak villains to characters so unreasonably capable you catch yourself saying oh come on repeatedly and much more but i will stop there      doesnt lucasfilm understand you cant grow the audience by annoying the best and most faithful customers of the brand to pander to a market segment that is largely indifferent  i saw the original trilogy in theaters many times 11 times for a new hope alone and bought a lot of merchandise over the years  i saw the prequels and tfa twice each  i saw tlj once but that will be all  the more i think about tlj the less i like it how many repeat tickets and blueray discs are the presumed new fans buying answer not many and not nearly enough to grow the total audience when old fans feel driven away    and here is where episode viii really fails as the middle act of a threepart story theres nothing to look forward to for episode ix we cant see han luke and leia together rey is essentially allpowerful already kylo is contemptible but hardly menacing the resistance is practically gone basically there are no big questions left to pique our interest  the only reason to see it is to see whether jj can somehow pull off a miracle and make something that is worthy of our attention and dollars as the conclusion of the sequel trilogy  i wont be a customer if episode ix i icks is more likely to annoy me than entertain me disgust me than inspire me or make me want to forget i ever saw it rather than tell everyone about it and drag them to the theater     if you have the chance to sit this one out skip it  dont buy the blueray or otherwise signal to disney that you think this is an acceptable product
Jun 20 2018,negative,one of the worst plots ive consumed as an adult the great chase makes no sense when you stop to think about it for even just 5 minutes and the last battle completely fails as an action scene this movie departs from all things star wars
Jun 20 2018,negative,half star just for the music williams as always and the top notch special effects everything else is terrible lazy writtening and a horrible characters development bad enought to make me loose any posible interest in the next movies star wars is over
Jun 20 2018,negative,special effects were top notch mark hamill did his best to play what was given to him but his character falls flat the movie is a dud a lame lame sequel and should have never seen the light of day i lost faith of disney ever making a good star wars again roque was alright and was waiting to see what was next this was just so disappointing its such a let down i wont say it ruined my childhood because as far as im concerned only episodes 16 count as star wars and the clone wars cartoon and maybe rebels this iust a slow chase scene in space dragged out for 2 hours they could have cut down the chase scene to 10 minutes there was nothing redeemable about the storyline carrie fisher is gone and her role was such a let down  though i dont blame any of the actors the failure is solely on kathleen and rain johnson who made this turd of a starwars movie would rather see the christmas special over this pile of dung
Jun 20 2018,negative,probably the worst film ever and the fact that its a star wars movie is even more heart breaking luke was portrayed as a looser rey knows more about the force than yoda what a joke
Jun 20 2018,negative,2nd worst star wars movie ever force awakens being the worst simply cause we were expecting greatness and got nothing but a slap in the face essentially
Jun 20 2018,negative,quite possibly the worst movie that has ever been made to anyone with a brain
Jun 20 2018,negative,not worth it  would give it 0 stars if i could only star wars movie that i have seen once and not watched again  i cant get myself to see it again as anything i can think of doing is still better than wasting another 2 hours on this movie the other crappy thing is that it left such a bad taste in my mouth for star wars in general that i havent gotten myself to go see solo either  save your time and watch something else
Jun 20 2018,negative,i feel bad for the cg artists and sfx people because those were the only good aspects of the film rian johnson and the writer ruined the hope and heroism of luke skywalker and added some terrible new characters out of a tumblr blog the movie is postmodern ugliness and it sickens me
Jun 20 2018,negative,would give 0 stars if that would ged registered worst star wars movie ever 1010 would want to delete from my memory
Jun 20 2018,negative,this movie is riddled with plot holes the characters are written badly this is by far the worst film in the saga dont waste your time or your money on this one and dont take the 5 star reviews seriously either the critics score is laughable and speaks to the fact that they dont want to lose their access by posting a negative review
Jun 20 2018,negative,as much as i enjoyed the force awakens and was very excited to see this movie i was left disappointed and heartbroken they disrespected my childhood hero princess leia by making her awkwardly fly through space they destroyed the beautiful character of luke skywalker that was so carefully created by george lucas luke was the hero everyone could relate to inspite of being a women i was disappointed in rey and kylos character development rey is hard to relate to because shes great at everything im a women i know im not good at everything kylo was not scary or intimidating at all and its hard to invest in a villain that is always going to lose people keep saying that were just bots but i can guareentee im a real human this movie is awful and i wont spend any more money on star wars until krazy kathleen and rian johnson never get to put their grimmy mits on our beloved franchise again     and if disney doesnt want to listen to us the fans then well my hundreds of dollars i spend on star wars will go elsewhere no problem
Jun 20 2018,negative,my bona fides i took my 6yearold son to see star wars in 1977  star wars the last jedi  i fell asleep literally and not just because im 64 years old
Jun 20 2018,positive,great scenes great acting and a great story cant wait for the next star wars movie
Jun 20 2018,negative,this is a terrible film
Jun 20 2018,negative,this movie absolutely does not honor the sagas rich legacy  look at rey how long did it take luke to even get decent at using the force this mary sue just picks up a lightsaber of a real jedi and is immediately an adept at force arts please there is very little real struggle in the new movies no one works for anything kill off all the main characters okaythis is a disgrace to the memory of the original trilogy this is a disgrace to the fans this is a disgrace to the force thanks for ruining one of the only fond memories of my abusive childhood i had left rose tico is the best character in this movie by far
Jun 20 2018,negative,in all honesty it wasnt just barely star wars it wasnt just barely entertaining it was barely a movie half of the characters are trapped in some sort of circular pointless plot the protagonists talk about actual interesting topics but act in any but interesting manner at the end of the day the bad guys are bad  the good guys are good and nothing really happens i legit believe you will be able to skip this movie and still make sence  from episode vii and ix
Jun 20 2018,negative,the worst star wars film to date lacklustre and incoherent story with flat characters who go nowhere in their development the way they mishandled the original trilogy characters was deplorable  whomever is responsible needs to be fired and never touch a star wars film again
Jun 20 2018,negative,awful mess didnt think they could do a worse job than tfa boy was i wrong
Jun 20 2018,negative,i cant recommend this film hate it
Jun 20 2018,negative,crapiest sw movie ever period
Jun 20 2018,negative,boring story poorly written underdeveloped characters and poor jokes i cannot recommend  this move
Jun 20 2018,negative,godforsaken diabolical mess and the nail in the coffin on any hope of a future for star wars rip
Jun 20 2018,negative,trashwhile on my viewing i felt cramping abdominal pain bloating gas and constipation   a shitfest lucasfilm more cyberfrog needed
Jun 19 2018,negative,poor humor forced feminism politics pointless casino segment our beloved characters made a mockery of luke doesnt have hope just like this film  the worst star wars movie ever made
Jun 19 2018,negative,an absolute abomination
Jun 19 2018,negative,terrible movie so many plot holes and bad characters
Jun 19 2018,negative,one of the worst movies never mind a starwars movie that anyone can watch the movie has zero respect for content that relates to the characters that came before for example princess leia now has lesbian undertones fynn is now just pure comic relief poe is a childish testosterone filled caveman idiot and luke skywalker is a murderous coward who abandons friends family and reason only to die a pathetic death in the end to pull off a joke    rey the main character still overcomes obstacles simply because she exist two movies in and all hee skills abilities and knowledge exist because she does the force made her so this is not a good character and poor story telling at its worst
Jun 19 2018,negative,franchise killer plot holes lore conflicts terrible writing and unlikeable characters destroy the movie  the great visuals soundtrack and acting are buried under the bad  it is actually so bad it creates problems with previous movies
Jun 19 2018,negative,when i first saw this movie it was well after the backlash against it had begun so i was sort of expecting it to be the worst movie ever but objectively speaking it isnt there are a lot of well done scenes and sequences and its shot very well however as time went on and the backlash against disney continued disney tried to fight back director rian johnson and multiple geek websites that seemed to have a favorable view of disney started insinuating that the real reason there was such a backlash was because of sexism or some such rather than own up to the fact that people had rejected his hyperpoliticized and arguably insulting take on star wars he instead resorted to the name calling and emotional instability that he accuses his critics of what this has ironically done has severely lowered my estimation of the film     the directors behavior since widespread rejection of both the last jedi and solo has crystallized for me a lot of the oddities in the film why does the canto bight sequence go nowhere why are rose tico and admiral holdo johnsons characters completely pointless why are the character arcs of rey finn poe and kylo ren completely derailed by this movie why do both luke and leia act so out of character all of these questions that i might have been willing to give the benefit of the doubt i no longer feel inclined to do so because director rian johnson has revealed himself to be the very manbaby he claims his detractors are he took possibly the most popular ip on the planet and made a divisive and spiteful movie that split and already fracturing fan base it seems fairly clear that rian johnson wanted to essentially troll the audience and couldnt handle getting trolled back with the financial failure of solo hopefully disney will take notice of some of its more exuberant critics but given that they were the ones that let rian johnson become a professional troll i have little hope
Jun 19 2018,negative,i would like to give it a zero
Jun 19 2018,negative,im a major star wars fan and this i have to say is the one star wars movie i will never watch again it terrible
Jun 19 2018,negative,watched it thursday the day before openingwalked out after the movie shaking my head i clicked on to google and started typing in the last jedi d  and it autosuggested disappointed which was what i was planning to type this was on the night before opening night this movie made me have no desire to see episode 9
Jun 19 2018,negative,almost walked out of the theater horrible movie special effects were nice if thats what you want to spend a lot of money on the new main characters they tried to bring to life were shallow and flat they even made the old ones flat it was like watching a knock off of star wars but it was the real fake thing
Jun 19 2018,negative,not the worst movie on its own merits but very destructive to the star wars story  so many important elements and characters of the universe thrown away unceremoniously  even these main characters which were developed in the last movie came out thinner and less developed than they started  dont get me started on the inyourface liberal politics and irrelevant social commentary  this movie will certainly not age well
Jun 19 2018,negative,this movie was a total disappointment  poor storytelling and making luke skywalker so cynical and complacent was disheartening
Jun 19 2018,negative,everything we hoped to see evolve in the force awakens was thrown away in this film
Jun 19 2018,negative,worst star wars movie ever made and its not even close
Jun 19 2018,negative,it pains me to give one of my favorite franchises such a bad review star wars the last jedi was an overly political movie with rushed dialogue plot holes and uneven pace the biggest atrocity being its confusing disregard for past movies and its viewer base it seems the spirit and heart of its producers died with it as well get ready for 9 more
Jun 19 2018,negative,hideous trash  garbage  a disgrace
Jun 19 2018,negative,first off id like to say these critics are straight up liars this movie is not only the worse starwars movie i have seen its probally the worse movie ive seen in years i think disney and rian johnson were huffing fumes off his old show breaking bad while creating this i bought this on my tv  im gonna try to get in touch with the vatican to have them send someone over to exorcise this trash off my tv  if i could give negative stars for this sjw filth i would
Jun 19 2018,negative,in an attempt to subvert all of the past tropes of the genre and saga it instead undermines and ultimately fails to live up to the storytelling of previous entries into the franchise the logic of the characters are faulty the humor is awful the new rules introduced detract from the elegance of past star wars films the action is poorly executed and the plot lines read as so manufactured that there is minimal joy to pull from this film especially when the one hope and joy people have been waiting for is an ultimate letdown skywalker hamill was right notmyluke instead of a numbered star wars film focused on the skywalker saga we received disneys attempt to make everyone a princess or at least a jedi and in turn an endless line of saga films poor storytelling mixed with clear monetization means one thing no i wont forget the past and trying to tell viewers otherwise is a poor attempt to hide the mediocrity youre now peddling
Jun 19 2018,negative,much like luke skywalker did with the sea cow all this movie could do was suck absolutely no story direction to speak of regression of any character growth if any growth existed to begin with forgettable at best insulting at worst
Jun 19 2018,negative,this movie destroyed luke skywalkers awesome character and with it the franchise i will not watch another star wars film and will not ever visit a theme park horrid is the way you treated luke
Jun 19 2018,negative,do i really have to give the 1 star for rt to count my vote  whatever  i have been using rt for a decade but this is my first review  i had to come out and let people know the truth about this movie  what did you do to luke  lukemy eternally optimistic hero has given up on everything  this not the luke youre looking for waves fingers  i never thought id miss the prequels  never
Jun 19 2018,negative,this is the worst star wars movie in existence without spoiling anything 1 legacy characters are disrespected 2 the new characters are totally forgettable and horribly written 3 the movie is thematically inconsistent 4 it contradicts the greater star wars mythos and 5 it neuters any hype for the final chapter of the trilogy garbage
Jun 19 2018,negative,this is the worst star wars movie ever wouldnt recommend to anyone ever
Jun 19 2018,negative,character assassination cringey acting and direction a nonsensical plot forced diversity    there is literally nothing good about this movie
Jun 19 2018,negative,actually ruined star wars for me
Jun 19 2018,negative,worst movie of franchise by far id give it less but rotten tomatoes wont apply it to the score  fandom menace will do the same to episode nine if its sjw propaganda bye kk
Jun 19 2018,negative,this is the worst star wars filme ever madei risk to say this is the worst film ever made  a lot of plot roles undeep characters stupid new character rose vague lore no emotion at all  the director had no balls to risk a good movie and did what films nowdays are doing make the simplier script ever to reach the maximum of ppl they canwhat turns out fucking up the godamn movie  and for those who are saying that starwars is unexpected and thats why its so good because it dont give what we want here some headup its not because something is not expected that it means its good  oh and rey sucks she is the biggest mary sue everand leia is the godamn mary poppins flying in the space and shit  fu disney fu ruin johnson and fuuuuuuuu katheleen kenedy and you fucking sjw that fucked up one of the best gifts ever given to the humanity fuck you
Jun 19 2018,negative,ive been a star wars fan since i can remember my first memories were literally watching empire strikes back on vhsi am extremely disappointed with this film simply because rian johnson takes a deconstructionist approach to the sw universe i dont want a nihilist worldview to be applied to my beloved characters and thats what disney has done re han solo and luke skywalker this is the worst sw film to date and will be reviled by fans for all cinematic history the plot doesnt make sense and drags on for the majority of the film ive never sat in a sw film and looked at my watch to see how long ive been there until this film cinematography is great however but it cannot redeem bad writing i was really rooting for finn to be developed as he was my favorite character from the force awakens but the writing for him falls flat its not the fault of the actor just the writing and direction the sw universe is clearly lacking any vision or direction i really hope the leadership at lucas films makes some drastic positive changes
Jun 19 2018,negative,was disappointed in the story and bad character development almost everything that was set up from tfa was thrown out the window its like this movie was made to be a stand alone film the cinematography was great as were most of the special effects but other than thatmeh this is the first star wars film that i will not be buying
Jun 19 2018,negative,worst movie to exist in star wars theatrical history the first third of the movie was utter nonsense the core of the movie undermines one of the greatest heroes of the last 30 years in an elaborate character assassination the new characters are pointless distractions that ultimately achieve nothing that couldnt have been done more effectively without them and the characters returning from episode 7 spend more time running in circles than anything else every promising story arc from episode 7 is promptly dropped in as anticlimactic a fashion as possible bottom line if youre looking for a star wars story that subverts your expectations while also having a female lead youre better off with knights of the old republic 2 the sith lords
Jun 19 2018,negative,probably one of the worst star war movies in a long time the biggest problem with this movie is with the story itself this movie makes me question who the hell did disney hired to write the story do they even know the sw universe lore anyway watch it for yourself one of the worst sw movies behind attack of the clones to have ever been made 4510 or 25
Jun 19 2018,negative,too much pointless and useless sideplots that had no meaning to the film and were eventually completely thrown aside at the final resolution
Jun 19 2018,negative,ive never seen a franchise so utterly eat itself in one film  to take such great potential momentum and 40 years of set up and just flush it all down the toilet the complete lack of respect and regard for the franchise the lore and the most of all the characters is just appalling it remains the only sw film that ive only watched once in theaters
Jun 19 2018,positive,overall pretty good it just loses key star wars things we love and the story goes on a little bit
Jun 19 2018,negative,giving this a 15 stars as being frankly just the worst star wars movie   say what you want with the prequels but at least they didnt go off on whole expose plot from the main store following finn and rose that just took so much away from the main story   and not to mention that its sad that all the new characters of the franchise besides kylo and rey just are awful obviosly either forced multicultral characters for the sake of inclusion without any character building what so ever at all
Jun 19 2018,negative,horrible in every way from the pointless characters disjointed story line and even the music score wasnt up to normal star wars standards
Jun 19 2018,negative,no just no  i would have been better of not seeing it at all it made life a little worse when i did
Jun 19 2018,negative,soy bad what they did to my childhood hero luke us real fans are not going to take thisoh jj redeem this franchise
Jun 19 2018,negative,the worst sw movie ever made  as its own film outside of sw its still pretty terrible  no need for the 2 thirds of the plot lines  there is no explaining how bad this is
Jun 19 2018,negative,littered with sjw propaganda and plot wholes the size of the galaxy itself  luckily this film came with an expansion pack of fan bashing and core isolation  worst soy wars ever made
Jun 19 2018,positive,i personally love this film although the pacing issues are apparent luke skywalkers arc is brilliant and the movie is driven by its theme however this makes the messages a bit tiring and nearly feel as if they are being shoved down our throats the characters drive the film as well though and this new trilogy is jampacked with plenty of likeable layered interesting characters
Jun 19 2018,negative,boring plot of slow speed space chase very minimal world building except for a side plot that turns out to not matter much to the main plot and one dimensional new characters and the destruction of old characters over all i left the theater feeling as my time had been wasted it had some high points though it was a visually beautiful movie that was about it if this was all i would have probably given this movie a 2 maybe 25 however lucasfilm employees complete dismissal and mistreatment of critical customers has been absolutely disgraceful often resorting to some of the worst character attacks racists sexists misogynists nazis white supremacists etc i can not support this behavior and as far as i am concerned lucasfilm has lost a customer in me this from someone who has spent thousands of dollars on lucasfilms merchandise over the past few decades congrats to rian johnson and kathleen kennedy for creating a film that hacked the most profitable intellectual property in human history to bits
Jun 19 2018,negative,i dont understand why this film is ranked so highly  this is so misleading poor story poor characters i was rolling my eyes a lot when i was watching this
Jun 19 2018,negative,if you identify as a victim youll love this its feelingsfiction not sciencefiction and certainly not star wars all the money came from the ip not the quality
Jun 19 2018,negative,only one thing to do now   forget the last jedi reboot it if you have to
Jun 19 2018,negative,as a life long star wars fan and the son of a lifelong fan i have to be supportive of the franchise and of the fandom that being said i want to see better story telling and less lip service to the minority of pc cultural enthusiasts who dont respect the franchise or its fandom the latest disney movies are beautiful and fun to see once but not good enough to be considered great or even good star wars movies and the fandom has proven this as the decline in merch sales for this movie have plummeted while the return investments for investments of the franchise as a whole is stagnant disney no one wants too see star wars fail especially the fandom but if you dont want star wars fans boycotting your movies over this sjw fad then you need to find the roots that made this franchise wildly profitable and its fandom proud again
Jun 19 2018,negative,disney has destroyed star wars  it can never come back after disgracing our childhood heroes solo luke leia and lando  they killed the golden goose  horrifically horrible movie
Jun 19 2018,negative,absolute garbage movie easily the worst star wars movie in the franchise do not waste your time with it terrible script awful characters bad miss timed humour a complete mess avoid
Jun 19 2018,negative,i absolutely cannot stand this film rian johnson is a buffoon who in the pursuit of his own egotistical and psychotic behavior has created a downright unwatchable film
Jun 19 2018,negative,the treatment of luke skywalker was a gut punch people have their favorite characters in the sw saga but luke is star wars so to see a character that you care about and have seen grow up on screen get treated so shabbily is a sad thing who would do that to the actor and the audience has been waiting to see this character for 40 years or at least imagined him in a good place this movie has a lot of flaws and some good stuff too and one could forgive it for its flaws if it didnt destroy the main character of the whole saga  having good female characters is a must but rey is too perfect and powerful to care about she is not human the other characters are okay but are hard to care about i liked rian johnsons looper and brick and again i would have turned a blined eye to the films failings and just enjoyed it if luke was treated like the hero hes supposed to be  these disney sequels have no success stories all of our heroes are failures han is a deadbeat dad who raised a psychotic and luke is a loser who should have never left the farm its amazing that a whole 40 yr saga of comics novels games cartoons and of course movies can be uprooted by one cynical twist of a movie
Jun 19 2018,negative,silly its not about fighting what you hate its about saving what you love i love star wars and am saving it with  one star  up yours stupid last jedi trash
Jun 19 2018,negative,i would have more fun at a theater if someone shot me in the head
Jun 19 2018,negative,i went into the theater expecting to see a good star wars movie it subverted my expectations
Jun 19 2018,negative,the special effects and cinematography are what saved this film however the story was awful  im disappointed with disney but hey selling garbage stories to kids is how they make their money so what could have really been expected of them
Jun 19 2018,negative,horrible rian johnson the round headed bafoon disgraced luke skywalker  he killed the franchise  he and the witch kathleen kennedy need to be fired
Jun 19 2018,negative,the worst star wars movie ever and ive seen the xmas specials    what ever disneys plan for star wars was but they have failed love how the paid reviews rate the movie at 91 but the audience rating is at 46 the says it all disney are in full damage control after the flop that was solo    the general critic consensus says star wars the last jedi honors the sagas rich legacy while adding some surprising twists  and delivering all the emotionrich action fans could hope for    this left me speechless
Jun 19 2018,negative,while it has its moments the last jedi is a cynical slog with flat characters and inexplicable twists seemingly there for the sake of it
Jun 19 2018,negative,yikes worst star wars film yet fire kk and ruin johnson
Jun 19 2018,negative,so not worth the price of admission skip it if you want to go see a better movie may i suggest revenge of the tomatoes
Jun 19 2018,negative,the more i thought about this movie after watching the more i disliked it
Jun 19 2018,negative,couldnt give it zero stars would if i could this is not a star wars movie this is a soy wars movie ruin johnson should not be making a trilogy he shouldnt have even been allowed to make a single film this is stupid boo i wish i could give this 5 stars or 50000000 stars because i cannot more highly say this movie is the worst movie ever made for culture
Jun 19 2018,negative,bilge water movie cant recommend it rian johnson first draft nonsense with massive logic holes star wars is dead because of him
Jun 19 2018,negative,this movie was so horrible that ever time i think about it a single tear is shed from the corner of my eye  if you thought this movie was good i do not hate or dislike you  but i do encourage you to go on youtube and watch almost any video breaking down how garbage this movie was and your eyes shall be opened  star wars was not just killed by this movie but murdered  may the force be with us all especially in this time of darkness 
Jun 19 2018,negative,the critics are absolutely sucking off disney
Jun 19 2018,positive,i watched this after reading terrible reviews and people calling it the worst star wars movie ever well to my surprise i really enjoyed it i like the interaction between rey and kylo ren and how they portrayed luke skywalker beyond the cliché superhero jesus messiah perfect creature it was a cool new take that of course it was going to piss off those who want the same stories over and over again
Jun 19 2018,negative,wasnt too bad at first view spoiled by some substandard writing which repulsed me when i thought of watching it again rian johnson and kathleen kennedy have to go
Jun 19 2018,negative,greatest ever just kidding worst star wars movie phantom menace is better
Jun 19 2018,negative,after loving tfa this one killed not only the trilogy but my interest in the series in general  first viewing i disliked but the second time made me realize how horrendous the twists actually are  new fans may enjoy this one but anyone who had any investment in the long term plot of the saga essentially had their entire history deficated on for weak gags and a random writerdirector to get kids to think hes smart  i honestly dont see how the next movie could recover from this  back to the gamescartoons for good sw stuff now
Jun 19 2018,negative,worst star wars film ever
Jun 19 2018,negative,these movies under disney have been the biggest disappointments in franchise history its sad to see how disney has blundered the integrity of star wars now in wake of turning on the fans and proven facts of approval scores being faked and tainted shows how low disney is willing to go and accept this kind of rhetoric sjw banter and todays political agendas should be kept out of star wars because with failed toy sales bad reviews disney employees fighting the fans and solo bombing in the box office disney needs to wake up and figure whst to do with kathleen kennedy and rion johnson they are killing the franchise 
Jun 19 2018,negative,the plot of this movie has more holes than swiss cheese
Jun 19 2018,negative,this movie was so terrible i had more questions coming out of this movie  i felt fin had no development from the first movie it was as if his journey was in a loop the one thing i enjoyed about the first series and even the prequels was the development between master and student there was none of thati felt rey could have been more believeble with more interaction and training with old luke i wont get into the issues i had with that due to i kinda figured he turn out this way and rey would he his way back to his old self either way there wasnt enough character building each character seemed forced or rushed i did like bb8 he got half a star
Jun 19 2018,negative,incredibly bad would be laughable if not for a the amount of money they spent b the seriousness and self importance it was presented with and c its apparent hatred of both the eager moviegoers and the beloved franchise characters embarrassingly bad
Jun 19 2018,negative,i cant believe disney made me not want to see the next film  this is garbage and an insult to star wars fans world wide  the director and jj should be lined up and shot
Jun 19 2018,negative,this movie went from yeah to meh quick simply terrible
Jun 19 2018,negative,just a terrible insult to starwars even mark hamill hated what they did to the original characters spirit and science of the films
Jun 19 2018,negative,poorly written completely destroys anything worth moving forward in regards to the story that was being teased through the first one in tfa  aside from it being a very bad movie awful injection of sjw propaganda it has ruined any reason whatsoever to look forward to the last movie  mary sue hrm i mean rey has already beaten kylo ren there is no more threat besides the military force that is the empire or whatever they are calling it now  new order  last order  best its just the forgotten order  forgotten is what this movie needs to be
Jun 19 2018,negative,my 9 year old said it was meh
Jun 19 2018,negative,garbage this is not star wars
Jun 19 2018,negative,i was always a big fan of star wars this cured me of it
Jun 19 2018,negative,so disapointing superman leia justwell forget it 
Jun 19 2018,negative,this film wasnt just bad it was  an insult every plot thread from tfa was dumped or revealed to be utterly meaningless and of no consequence the plot was a literal low speed chase riveting     utter bilge
Jun 19 2018,negative,when the makers of the movie dont care about the universe or the characters happens movies like the last jedi disrespectful for the actors for the original makers of the amazing movies of star wars and of the audience unsuprising and unoriginal story the new characters like rose and goodriddanceholdo are as useful as jarjar but lamer     this is not even worth of being called star wars when the star wars stories like rogue one and solo are better than an add to the main storyline then you just know that this is not the way to go
Jun 19 2018,negative,star wars ep ix rey snaps her fingers and the rebellion wins kylo dies chewie dies from depression c3po and r2 become sjw bots and the whole galaxy gets sent far far away from my memory end credits
Jun 19 2018,negative,the absolute worst movie i have ever seen and i have seen a lot of crap this is an insult and it breaks up the star wars universe to a degree that it is no longer star wars they had the last chance to do something great with the old cast but no this is what they did anyone that says this is a good movie is either blind or only likes it because of the gender politics people that like this garbage movie are not fans and nice try using bots to raise the audience score on this movie not only is the movie garbage but the people behind it too
Jun 19 2018,negative,so horrible it needs an army of dead presidents to boost review scores 6 months after its release and only weeks after solo bombed what a coincidence hunh  will enter history as the worst kennedyjohnson failure since the vietnam war
Jun 19 2018,negative,probably the worst star wars movie ever made  no amount of lucas film employees posting fake reviews could make this awful movie look good
Jun 19 2018,negative,too long too many chewbacas
Jun 19 2018,negative,i didnt like it at all totally ruined
Jun 19 2018,negative,worst movie ever made shameful
Jun 19 2018,negative,this film is very poorly written the new characters are either uninteresting rey rose poe and holdo or poorly written finn kylo and snoke and like many people i dislike the direction they decided to take lukes character id probably give this move a 35 rating if it werent for the fact that people are defending this movie simply because its a star wars film this is a bad film and disney needs to do better if they want this franchise to succeed the fact that this film grossed half as much as fa doesnt bode well for the future of star wars
Jun 19 2018,negative,a disaster starwars is no place for heavy handed social preaching  starwars is supposed to be fun this film is anything but its depressing too long and badly edited if rian johnson wanted to make an indi film for sjws he has succeeded avoid this movie like the plague
Jun 19 2018,negative,awful film awful plot some of the visuals are pretty awesome but that doesnt make up for everything else avoid at all costs
Jun 19 2018,negative,worst than the prequels lmao
Jun 19 2018,negative,absolute trash and a disgrace to the star wars canon would not recommend to my worst enemy
Jun 19 2018,negative,this is not so much a movie as it is cinematic audience trolling the production value is as good as one might expect from a movie with so much money behind it however the writing is terrible the story is nearly nonexistent and the original story line from the original trilogy has been corrupted and turned into something that is star wars in name only   luckily i was able to watch the last jedi on an international flight and didnt have to pay for such an unpleasant experience
Jun 19 2018,negative,the biggest pile of bantha poodoo ever
Jun 19 2018,negative,lfl is paying people to boost this rt rating  dont be fooled  the last jedi is a poorly written film  yes the fx are great as usual but the story is stupid and doesnt follow the previous movie at all  and luke skywalkers character is totally trashedturned into a deadbeat loser instead of the hero we all know and love  people hate this movie for good reason  avoid
Jun 19 2018,negative,the plot doesnt flow in any logical fashion  rian johnson has failed at writing a coherent story  i hope the characters get a better opportunity to shine in the future under a different studio  lucasfilm should not be allowed to malke any more star wars films  the writiers for kotor should be hired to save the franchise
Jun 19 2018,negative,a mess of a movie that has tonal whiplash and is constantly undercutting its own message making a narrative mess
Jun 19 2018,negative,lucas films trolls upvoting this piece of shit movie this movie is fro rbsin dreas morons nwver seen suxh a piece of shit mobie wver before killer clowns from outer space is better than this shit
Jun 19 2018,negative,this is overlong and boring there are parts that are good eye candy and the telepathy parts are nicely edited and sound designed overall it lacks the mythic element i enjoy from episodes 1 to 6
Jun 19 2018,negative,very disappointing sequel that did a disservice to both the original stories luke in particular and the groundwork laid by jj abrams luke tossing his returned lightsaber over his shoulder was a metaphor for rian tossing jjs trilogy plot in the trash that was the baton in a relay race and rian didnt just fumble it he threw it away the opening between hux and poe was more wile e coyote than star wars the humiliation of poe by holdo was misandry personified but only to lay the groundwork for her sacrificial redemption later akbar was right there but they give that moment to a purplerinse stranger they just made us dislike how subversive how out of touch with fans the preachy side mission to canto bight was completely pointless no wait it led to everyone getting betrayed and killed dj and his cynicism was well handled like an irredeemable han solo rose preventing finns sacrifice risking even more lives was another low point you could see what rian was going for but founded on such ham fisted plot development that youre yanked out of it thinking about all the people rose just got killed lukes force projection would have made some sense if he didnt die anyway the hyperspace as a weapon looked spectacular but completely broke every other desperate battle where it was never used until now and not used by a ruthless first order earlier that brings us to the biggest flaw of all undermining all of this the space chase mechanics made absolutely no logical or physical sense in any universe
Jun 19 2018,negative,i trusted the critic reviews so i was really excited to see the movie when it on release here in the philippines  and on that day as soon as my little brother came home from school  we rush to the theaters with our expectations high and saw it slowly sink to utter disappointment when the first  marvel jokes started showing up every time taking away any seriousness for the plotwe were packed with a sizeable crowd  of children and their parents too that afternoon and none of them were laughing just goes to show out of place their humor wassecondly  the flat characters like rey having no struggle at all to use her powers that made any or coming jedi teachings pointlessly  ridiculous poe the only new character my little kid brother care about do stupid things all over the place made him one of his pissed off to together with the rest of the cast before that he was really excited to buy last jedi toys because of the hype now hed rather have trash jar jar binks toy than any last jedi toys whatsoeverfinn and rose is utterly useless and a waste of plot and time just like all the rest and luke who started just as a simple farmer boy to a galactic hero become like this is saddening too see  because at the end of it all they want his legacy to die to make way for their own version of star wars they think is the better one and lastly the surprising twists the critics praise over is a betrayal of anything that stand for what made star wars special that is our last straw and to our eyes disney star wars is an abominable noncanon of the true star wars
Jun 19 2018,negative,disgrace to the skywalker saga
Jun 19 2018,negative,did someone get paid for writing this story well watching previous star wars film is a good starting point for star wars screenwriter
Jun 19 2018,negative,a terrible film and a horrendous star wars instalment poorly written plot poorly written characters i feel sorry for mark hamill thats how were gonna win not fighting what we hate saving what we love even the oneliners are awful i blame rian johnson and kathleen kennedy and to the star wars fans who make excuses for this movie shame on you
Jun 19 2018,negative,get your damn politics out of my star wars  adamant fan of all star wars movies have watched 16 20 plus times thats a safe low estimate  favorite franchise of all time  tfa was ok with some new characters that seemed to have an interesting journey ahead of them we could go and grow along with them for a new trilogy  even if the plot was too safe a new hope v2 it had promise  i watched hours of fan theory craft about luke rey kylo and snoke  all trashed   get this garbage out of here  sjw politics wasted characters  who the hell is holdo  why not tell the crew the plan to avoid mutiny  why not give that role to leia or akbar  they are the ones that deserve the heroic end off  this is not my luke skywalker the jedi knight i pretended to be throughout my childhood when star wars wasnt the cool thing mid 90s elementary  snoke was the only thing done well in this heap and look at the decision made there  lets kill him in the early 3rd act  why is po made to look and treated like an idiot  why didnt we get to see finn turn into the resistance hero he deserves to be  general hux a bumbling bafoon  you know when an imperial general would lead a fleet in the original trilogy he would be feared he would be taken seriously  rey is raised by junk traders eh  learned a jedi mind trick in a matter of days  luke had to train his ass off failing over and over again for an eternity with master yoda on dagobah only to be told he was not ready and he would fail if he left  im sick of seeing characters who have no depth because they are perfect and confident of victory in every battle  show us characters that have faults show us growth with hard work or hard lessons give us great stories with arcs that do our beloved characters justice  the characters that built this house  man phasma shouldve kicked the crap out of everyone in both movies sent em packing to lick their wounds and learn to hide to stay alive or ascend and defeat her  i know im everywhere i could continue forever  drop these two saga movies and start with a clean slate ala the incredible hulk with edward norton  nobody remembers that movie when the avengers are kicking ass with mark ruffalo  maybe keep tfa maybe      make star wars great again
Jun 19 2018,positive,was late to the review the movie with my 11 june friends but this movie is definitely better than citizen kane its so good i cant believe it never happened before there no word you have to see this please do see it
Jun 19 2018,negative,hated what this universe has become whatever jj built up and ryan tore it down plus get ready for the worlds slowest and unexciting chase scenes so boring
Jun 19 2018,negative,this film is not the star wars i know and love it is also a very poorly written movie how the script was given the goahead is beyond me
Jun 19 2018,negative,this movie is utter garbage it has pretty much ruined the saga for me fan of 30 years    thank you for ruining my abusive childhood
Jun 19 2018,negative,watched this once in the theater and once as a rental cant believe sw has fallen so low they completely ruined lukes character ruined sw lore and had so many plot holes and ridiculous events that it made me cringe been a fan since 77 but this abomination is worthless wont watch another disney sw movie until they change this nonsense with sw movies tragedy
Jun 19 2018,negative,just horrible tuned the star wars saga 
Jun 19 2018,negative,its so sad to see how terrible star wars has become  also if you check the positive votes youll notice that theyre all fake many are even named after us presidents
Jun 18 2018,negative,this movie is hot garbage
Jun 18 2018,negative,this star wars movie absolutely destroyed star wars as a golden goose which most thought would be impossible to damage yet they certainly did it proving that nothing is impossible rey basically destroyed all of the interest in working hard and training to be the best apparently there was no need for luke to train his butt off with obi wan and yoda all that is needed to become a jedi master above all is grow up female as a scavenger and have the name of rey and suddenly you too can go from zero jedi ability to being a master that can destroy all including luke    its like star wars is no longer about great star wars storylines and instead is about political leftist brainwashing all into becoming marxist pedos  and robot diddlers
Jun 18 2018,negative,worst star wars everthanks ryan j for ruining my childhood
Jun 18 2018,negative,worst star wars movie ever full of plot holes
Jun 18 2018,negative,this movie is an absolute disgrace keep you children away show  them the original trilogy
Jun 18 2018,negative,i only gave this one star because rt doesnt count 12 or nostar ratings towards the average this film is a deliberate desecration of the star wars franchise the makers of this film not only hate star wars they hate heroes they hate hope and they hate everything our culture has built but i still have my original series dvds and no one can take them away from me
Jun 18 2018,negative,easily one of the worst movies ive ever seen friends and family all concur and wish this would be retconned out of the sw canon
Jun 18 2018,negative,i cant think of a single moment in this movie that made me feel excited while watching it  i felt bad for the rest of the day afterwards  im not even that mad at the plot points but the execution of those points were awful  honestly the least interesting ways to tell the story were made at every single point in this movie  this felt like a filler tv movie not a star wars space opera epic  rian johnson didnt have the chops to pull this sort of movie off and it shows
Jun 18 2018,negative,sucks they killed the whole star wars genre would only recommend as punishment
Jun 18 2018,negative,this movie literally hurt my soul this garbage makes watching two girls one cup seem poetic i personally hope that carrie fisher never sees this from beyond
Jun 18 2018,negative,poo wrapped in a movie then shat out like a rose tico action figure soylo
Jun 18 2018,negative,i literally just signed up to combat the fake reviews for this steaming pile of garbage if you liked any other star wars movies youll hate this the fake reviews are all one liners of   the greatest movie ever but any bad review reveals multiple reasons of how bad this movie is the blantant disregard for every one of the force awake setups the total changing of the personality of a  legacy character like luke who played like jake skywalker the completely useless and pointless side story that takes up a quarter of the film while adding nothing but a vapid  inelegant and hamfisted attempt to spread a social injustice message the characters acting in a nonsensical way just to advance plot conveniences like not sharing their critical plans in a desperate moment one dimensional characters with no substance and no emotional attachment rey is a master jedi in terms of skill with absolutely no training and no explanation why other than to advance her as the  protagonist in the story  im not even going to go into it in depth but google flying leia the only good thing i can say is visually it was a good movie but a entrancing painting isnt a movie now check out the 5 star reviews and see if they can say that many good things about the movie please for the sake of the franchise fire the whole creative team and kathleen kennedy and make sure ruin johnsons new trilogy is consigned to the trash heap of history
Jun 18 2018,negative,a true tour de farce  like im going to buy disillusioned angry luke not your fault mr hamill and play get off my island  with my boys  its just sad
Jun 18 2018,negative,this was a huge waste of money the plot doesnt make sense there is zero of the magic of the original 3  didnt think it was possible but this is worse than the prequels any potentially good moments were usually ruined moments after i was left with a bad taste in my mouth  no matter how much money lucasfilm pumps into trying to persuade the internet that this movie was liked it was not  theater was damn near empty when i went not sure if ill see the next one
Jun 18 2018,negative,it gets a star for superb special effects but the story is plainly bad i dont recognize the luke they have here and rey simply is just good at everything without learning
Jun 18 2018,negative,i liked the force awakens saw it twice in cinema bought it on itunes watched it 56 times to date when rogue one came out it blew me away imho it is second only to empire have watched it 10 times to date i liked rian johnsons earlier movies loved brick detective noir is my fave genre looper not as much but has merit i didnt see last jedi in the cinema my enthusiasm waned due to what i was seeing online from both detractors  advocates it has taken me almost 6 months to watch the last jedi and my only regret is that i wasted 4 to hire the bluray this movie is not a star wars movie it neither honours what came before it nor leaves a legacy for what comes after it is a creative black hole as far as the script and direction which is a shame because everyone else involved in the production outdid themselves viz and sound fx are outstanding costuming and set design too the actors all did the best with what little they were given even poor mark hamill what an insult not only to his character luke but to the man himself how degrading as for all the talk of diversity star wars has always been diverse on both sides of the screen as an asian man myself i appreciated donnie yen in rogue one im a long time fan of his but ive never needed someone to look like me to be inspired by them my childhood popculture heroes were bruce lee luke skywalker optimus prime  storm from the xmen 4 disparate characters that all embodied heroism integrity  selfsacrifice desirable traits to emulate but as bad as this film is to me it is the bigotry and lack of self awareness from disney  lucasfilm that has turned me off star wars for good didnt watch solo dont care if it was good wont buy the toys for my children or any other lucasfilm product im not boycotting just not interested anymore wont support anyone that refers to me as a nazi  or stands silent as their advocates do so  yet is happy to utilise naziinspired imagery to sell their products to children
Jun 18 2018,negative,a influx of fake reviews on the 13th june from saul goodman and dead presidents cant help change what people think of this film this film is terrible social justice nonsense it completely ruins the character of luke skywalker
Jun 18 2018,negative,you can like it in the same way you might like a cult film but you cant say it is objectively good  might be the last star wars movie i will see
Jun 18 2018,negative,came across a nasty rumor apparently lucas film has invested 50 million dollars in a disinformation campaign to cover up howbad this film is    id sell your disney stocks if you dont want to take a hard hit in the pocket book    unbelievable how out of hand kathleen kennedy had let this get
Jun 18 2018,negative,what a giant piece of trash plots that go nowhere world breaking and incoherent would it be so hard to get a decent writer for such a huge franchise
Jun 18 2018,negative,if you like star wars this movie will spit in your face for it
Jun 18 2018,negative,i absolutely cannot stand this film rian johnson is a buffoon who in the pursuit of his own egotistical and psychotic behavior has created a downright unwatchable film none of the character threads are fleshed out  finn is still a joke rey undergoes no struggle and thus is an incredibly flat character and poe is not any better i wont even begin on the stupidity of creating a walking talking political manifesto and calling them a character ie rose kylo ren is a perfect allegory for any angsty teenager not that any intimidating villain should act as such the character assassination of luke skywalker has been covered more than enough but it still warrants mentioning i ask any person who appreciated the last jedi to give a reason as for luke skywalker to go from redeeming the most evil man in the galaxy darth vader to attempting to murder his nephew before he even does anything holdo is another joke similar to finn though she represents all which is wrong with lucasfilm on the political front that is they have their heads in the sand and force identity politics into everything including admiral gender studies this film is terrible and im sick of lucasfilms attitude towards the now former fans for disliking the last jedi but i guess that im just another manbaby right
Jun 18 2018,negative,shouldnt be included in star wars universe boo
Jun 18 2018,negative,only idiots doing bots would use presidential names to create 5 star reviews cause your too lazy to use creative names to do your botting  get over it lucas films this movie was some of the worst writing i have seen in a movie in a long long time  a total waste of some amazing actors and actresses do them some justice stop with your political bs and write good scripts for them to act and for us to enjoy  thank you
Jun 18 2018,negative,lucas films  caught you trying to rig this score on this truly mediocre movie  shame on you  this is a bad movie
Jun 18 2018,negative,this movie killed the franchise
Jun 18 2018,negative,rian johnson destroyed the greatest franchise is movie history kathleen kennedy is a buffoon that doesnt care about star wars at all she managed to kill 40 years of good will in just a handfull of years
Jun 18 2018,negative,this is why no one trust the media anymore f this trash
Jun 18 2018,negative,i liked a new hope this one was a disappointment the story was not up to par the most beloved characters were killed off the one black male star who was going to sacrifice himself to save everyone had his heroism taken away from him the only satisfying part of the movie was the lightsaber battle after the killing of snoke disney is becoming cancer with the overloading their media with identity politics
Jun 18 2018,negative,ive been a star wars fans since rotj when i was 4 years old i love star wars the prequals while not great still had the essence of a star wars story ro was good and the other two films by disney were average best but i will never ever watch this dumpster fire of a film again it was two and one half hours of horrible writing acting and directing with a story that goes literally no where  it insults the fans who have loved this before franchise for over 40 years and i hold the horrible director personally responsible he wanted half the fans to like it and the other half to hate it and yet he calls us names for expressing our displeasure with his product hes not a bright individual i still love star wars and i hope we get better films in the future but as of now this new trilogy is done in my eyes and i wont be watching ix because viii has left me disinterested in the rest of the pointless story
Jun 18 2018,negative,worst star wars film to date the first star wars movie i walked out of feeling beyond disappointed jokes were ridiculous and a waste of time spent on characters who were underdeveloped or completely misrepresented does nothing to compliment or drive the saga forward it just planted the saga and the trilogy in the ground head first  no fixing this one no matter what happens in 9 disgrace
Jun 18 2018,negative,this was just a terrible movie use your money to build a gonk droid costume instead
Jun 18 2018,negative,worst movie of the main canon
Jun 18 2018,negative,two can play this game disney dont add fake reviews onto this film in attempt to bump up the rating this film is a failure for star wars and as a story no one likes the porgs this isnt a classic movie and it disgraces beloved characters shame on the ones who bot reviews it wont work because the real star wars fans will prevail in the end
Jun 18 2018,negative,a crippling dissappointment  heartbreaking end to the beloved character of luke skywalker
Jun 18 2018,negative,i used to love star wars i loved the droids chewbacca the spaceships the story now i realize its no longer for me the sad thing is i have 3 kids and theyre not interested either they like age appropriate video games and basketball
Jun 18 2018,negative,some nice effects and action scenes are not enough to overcome a plodding confused and frankly insulting story that trashes characters we love to make room for make room for overbearing and poorlywritten new characters  this film goes out of its way and trips over its feet doing so to subvert the audience expectations but not in ways that delight but in ways that shock and simply frustrate  so many story ideas set up by episode vii are tossed out for a quick gag or ideological grandstanding  the more i think about tlj the less i like it  i wish we just just press the undo button and start over on this one
Jun 18 2018,negative,if you want to see the character assassination of luke skywalker and mark hamill and the destruction of the star wars franchise then this film is for you
Jun 18 2018,negative,worst piece of garbage did they ever even like star wars before they tarnished it so
Jun 18 2018,negative,this film is the jaws 4 of star wars
Jun 18 2018,negative,havent seen the movie dont plan to im writing this to express my displeasure at disneys treatment of the fans since darth disney was created in what universe do you crap on your core fanbase for having the nerve to dislike your product then insult those fans even further when they dont spend their money to watch your latest insult to the franchise now seeing the reported 50mil lucasfilm is spending in a retaliatory misinformation and trolling campaign as evidenced by the recent influx of 5 reviews you have seen my last dollar disney star wars is nothing more than an involuntary victim to you politics and greed imo  i wasnt likely to see the movie in theaters but when the best personal review i heard was its the worst sw but its still sw i felt no desire to see the worst film in the franchise and for those fanatics out there that insult anyone who didnt like the movie let me ask you something who is more nuts the person willing to walk away andor when a good thing has gone rotten or the person that hangs on for dear life admitting the failure but still fanatically sucking the teet those of us that dont like current sw simply want it to be better those fanatics that only want to tear down the negs by insulting us because we dare not like your precious you only make yourselves look nuts in the end for the record this comes from someone who had no problem with the prequels they had their moments so no keep your autistic argument that people who complain about tlj are not and have never been sw fans to yourself people who were never fans have better things to do than troll you fools
Jun 18 2018,negative,not a fake review from disney shill media  0 stars
Jun 18 2018,negative,i love all the june 13 reviews theyre better than the best movie presidents and sit com characters love the last jedi disney hills boost the rating of this film but this film wasnt good and disney has rationalized it by attacking a specific demographic segment as if that somehow makes the film better

Jun 18 2018,negative,horrible terrible these people have no idea how to make a star wars movie rotten tomatoes is obviously skewing the numbers here
Jun 18 2018,negative,the writing in this move is trash this movie marks the end of the star wars ip even if most 5 star reviews are fake
Jun 18 2018,negative,watching the last jedi is a painful experience horribly written horribly acted almost as if the director had never seen a star wars film before the story is ludacris and a tragic waste of the luke skywalker character what a shame worst star wars film ever
Jun 18 2018,negative,a postmodernist deconstruction of an american myth idealogues have taken over star wars and if you disagree you will be called racist sexist nazi etc
Jun 18 2018,negative,i like how all the past presidents and sit com characters of june 13 thought this film was better than citizen kanei also know these shills appreciate that disney hates a certain pale demographic as much as they do but this film was bad and they should feel bad for artificially boosting it
Jun 18 2018,negative,this movie was on another level unfortunately that level was c deck of the titanic
Jun 18 2018,negative,bots are 5 star upvoting this abomination of a movie how low are you willing to go lucas film are you willing to sell your soul maybe we can make a deal

Jun 18 2018,negative,what disney has done to the franchise is horrible  they have to be purposely doing this and its so sad to watch  it was truly humiliating and insulting to see mark hamills beloved character luke skywalker flushed down the disney toilet  what an absolute shame  and that was just one of the many terrible things wrong with this moive  dont bother ever watching this dumpster fire
Jun 18 2018,negative,the director of this movie must have not watched the previous movie the writers of this garbage never watched a star wars movie or at least never cared about continuity i left this movie shocked i went to see the force awakens three times in the theater but once is enough of this hot mess i wonder if jj abrams stole rian johnsons girlfriend and this movie is the only way to get back at him
Jun 18 2018,negative,having watched this movie i was left very disappointed the writing was poor a lot of the themes and story elements that where laid down in the force awakens where completely thrown out the door by johnson both force awakens and tlj treated long cherished characters in the sw mythos like garbage and to be honest they new characters where poorly developed there as been a lot of talk about sexism and racism is the reason for these poor reviews and thats just not true for the vast majority of the people give this film a poor review the character of finn a black man is not shown in a favourable light and as for rose tico she is such a poorly realised character  i really could write an essay about it but i dont have the time or inclination to do this if you are a longtime star wars fan and you want to watch it watch it just be prepared to be disappointed
Jun 18 2018,negative,this is the worst attempt at a plot i have ever seen in a science fiction or fantasy film the plot holes are impossible to ignore there is little character development the ahchto scenes are as disappointing as it gets the slow chase scene in space that lasts the entire movie the jarring transition from ep 7 where all of the sudden the resistance has almost no forces and the first order forces have inexplicably increased the hyperspace weaponization problem the misplaced humor the tone i have no desire to keep going there are so many things wrong with this movies its like rian   johnson had an outline and knew where he wanted characters to be during certain scenes and simply didnt know how to get them there in any kind of believable fashion
Jun 18 2018,negative,garbage movie destroyed the entire saga rian johnson should watch it as the door closes on his leaving
Jun 18 2018,negative,hello i am former president millard filmore and unlike the other dead presidents reviewing this movie i am most personally offended by this moving picture it is incompatible with the public interest it menaces beloved characters from our childhoods and engages in gerrymandering amongst the fandom i did however enjoy yodas joshing  tomfoolery with luke therefore two gold stars for that i must now retire back to my grave nice try disney shills
Jun 18 2018,negative,the most unfaithful jumbled mess of any star wars mess ive ever seen i would take the phantom menace any day over this
Jun 18 2018,negative,if you are a star wars fan do not watch this
Jun 18 2018,negative,actually catching your girlfriend in bed with bill lumbergh would be better than sitting through this movie
Jun 18 2018,negative,cringy humour awful script  nonsensical plot worse than the prequels
Jun 18 2018,negative,rose tico is easily the glue that holds this pile of soy based nonsense together i bought all of her action figures and cant wait to not watch chapter 11i mean episode 9 itll be fun for all the shills at collider for sure
Jun 18 2018,negative,the star wars christmas special was better than this mess save your money and head elsewhere
Jun 18 2018,negative,the worst star wars film  this film makes no sense  now watching caravan of courage to see some better star wars
Jun 18 2018,negative,im glad my friend paid for this movie for me it was not worth the money they used the character of luke sale tickets just to make him look bad and killed him off
Jun 18 2018,negative,terrible movie with no respect for the franchise
Jun 18 2018,negative,dont bother listening to anyone who says this is great or even a good star wars film because at best it was a well funded poorly written fanfiction
Jun 18 2018,negative,rian johnson ruined the new series we had s golden opportunity and he squandered it f this movie

Jun 18 2018,negative,this movie was utter trash  it spent far too long on some pointless casino scene  in factfinna nd roses journey could have been completely avoided had we known holdos terrible plan from the get go  not to mention her plan hinged on the imperial ships not being able to spot transport vesselswhich we know they can spot escape vessels from a new hope  ya know what there is jsut too much for me to blast in this piece of trash    lets see reys ability to digitlay erase weapons that will kill her yes it is there clearly in the finished product look at the guards weapons as he draws back once he arm locks her   poor storytelling i mean yes do not get me wrong there are bad films but this one is incredibly overrated     to suggest one is to critical of this film because its aimed at childrenno   it was a terible film chock full of garbage  it wasnt aimed at children because children would have grown bored too during it   but it made a lot of money   yes and most of the people who gave it multiple viewings admit they didnt like it the first viewing in fact it took mutliple viewings to like it    thats called people trying to rationalize either a no star wars vs bad star wars or b  i spent  upwards of 40 dollars to see this crap i better like it  as for critic scoresya know alot of the you tube critics  who gave negative reviews about this crap  got copy right strikes against themhmmm i wonder why
Jun 18 2018,negative,worse than blues brothers 2000 and ghostbusters 2016
Jun 18 2018,negative,quite frankly one of the worst movies i have ever seen  this is on a freddy got fingsred level  of bad  the forced comedy that is not organic to the universe is off putting from the getgo  the cumbersome and awkward dialogue makes episode ii look like casablanca or when harry met sally which is almost unthinkable for anyone who has watched that dumpster fire more than 10 times and broken it down  the new characters benicio del toro laura dern and kelly marie tran are underdeveloped underutilized and unfortunately costumed and directed  it is unfortunate too given that i have loved everything i have previously seen out of dern and del toro  additionally elegant and respectful opportunities were available to deal with carrie fishers untimely passing and were not taken this will  create unnecessary challenges for the next saga film  lastly the movie provided no satisfactory payoffs for the exposition in episode 7 seemed to point the finger and say gotcha at the audience multiple times to no real effect and lastly didnt take advantage of any of the storytelling opportunities mark hamil who really delivered from a shear performance perspective  afforded  this was a low caliber forgettable dijointed sci fi movie  i will not be seeing this again and wish i could have donated the money i paid to see this to charity

Jun 18 2018,negative,the movie had not substance most of the movie was unneeded and did nothing for the story not that there was much of a story the amount of wasted potential is horrifying and the fact that people enjoyed it is sad from a movie point of view the characters were 1d the story was a stretch at best and as a whole forgettable  rayn johnson was acting like a middle school girl along with everyone at disney and lucas studios only middle schoolers are petty enough to spit in the face of their supports and expect not backlash
Jun 18 2018,negative,waste of time and potential with the death of this once proud franchisestay away and stick with the eu

Jun 18 2018,negative,garbage movie only slightly saved by decent cgi and scenes characters are extremely unlikable and story makes no sense compared to the rest of the sw universe avoid at all cost
Jun 18 2018,negative,the worst star wars yet  incoherent narrative zero character development pointless sideplot and to top it off it totally shuts down everything set up in the force awakens i was especially disappointed that luke was written as a bitter and lazy curmudgeon who cant even leave the planet  what was the point disney needs an inclusive business model that considers all fans
Jun 18 2018,negative,the best movie in the series nauseatingly wonderful
Jun 18 2018,negative,story and pacing was awful this is something id make my nemesis watch not someone im friends with
Jun 18 2018,negative,more than anything else i feel sorry for all the actors in this film that they had to be exploited as tokens for reprehensible film with poor writing political posturing and an inability to take me to a galaxy far far away give star wars back to the fans because the current exercise in futility is a complete money pit
Jun 18 2018,negative,disappointing how luke skywalker was portrayed  the casino sequence  was utter garbage
Jun 18 2018,negative,ive been a star wars fan since i was a kid  i gave tfa a lot of slack because i thought there would be some sort of payoff  this movie failed to deliver and for the first time in my life i can truly say i am not looking forward to the next star wars movie  positives  looked pretty soundtrack was okay  negatives  poor writingdirection
Jun 18 2018,negative,this movie is an abomination destroyed lukes character was overall terrible
Jun 18 2018,negative,honestley a pretty poodoo experience
Jun 18 2018,negative,a broken film that has set ups with out pay offs and pay offs without set ups wouldnt recommend this as a star wars fan it would of been better as a empire strikes back rip off which the prior film force awakens was a rip off of a new hope
Jun 18 2018,negative,this movie changed my life ive decided to stop following star wars as a brand used to wear the tshirt and everthing and now its all in the trash thanks rian johnson for your masterpiece cheers all
Jun 18 2018,negative,dont waste your time watching this the worst star war movie ever

Jun 18 2018,negative,about 10 of the movie is visually impressive 90 of the movie is sjw trash with animal cruelty as a major plot point of a star wars fucking movie
Jun 18 2018,negative,this movie didnt just leave every cliff hanger from force awakens unanswered they closed them without comment  sad movie also in the time it took a lightsaber to change hands the entire republic was destroyed down to a handful of ships with no reason  the absensce of a plot abandonment of jj abrams story lines and no cliff hangers to make me want to see the next movie this served as the end to a great franchise i was a casual fan but will find my sci fi elsewhere  the special effects were good the action good but star wars is about story and story just wasnt in this movie
Jun 18 2018,negative,a complete extirpation of a film saga and the essence of the heros journey that is exemplified in the ot thats what made it a success in the first place the ot set the bar this film has failed to maintain it rather changing star wars into a generic badly written b scifi movie   
Jun 18 2018,positive,a fun time rian knows his star wars saga very well unlike most complaining people its great to see luke another time and him returning to the force is a great moment hopefully his ghost is in ix
Jun 18 2018,negative,this is a deeply flawed film the main characters are bland and 2 dimensional the bad guys are laughable and cartoonish  rian johnson wrote the trilogy into a corner
Jun 18 2018,negative,i made an account just to review this movie its a dumpster fire of flaming garbage and an insult to the human race disney needs to purge its ranks before it even considers making another movie the fans have spoken and we arent buying your crap just because you put the name of something we love on it
Jun 18 2018,negative,bad plot bad characters preachy politics mary sues destroyed legacies avoid at all costs rian johnson proves he hates star wars more than george lucas
Jun 18 2018,negative,this movie spits in the face of what was at one point a strong and robust star wars universe star wars needs considerable help in plot development in its next move or more fans are going to walk
Jun 18 2018,negative,rian johnson couldnt have done a worse job i have no idea why disney hired that schmuck
Jun 18 2018,negative,subverted my expectations
Jun 18 2018,negative,ruins a well imagined franchise
Jun 18 2018,negative,as a longtime fan of star wars this film is a horrible addition to the series poor plot  weak characters and  numerous plot holes made this already too long movie 25 hours a grind to watch its obvious no one had any ideas for a real story since the writing was so lazy it didnt line up with or even acknowledge the previous movie
Jun 18 2018,negative,the last jedi is one of the worst films ever made an abomination of cinema and a disgrace to the star wars name
Jun 18 2018,neutral,utter waste of the luke skywalker character why bring him back and do nothing but p off anyone who loved the old trilogy and the main villain is pathetic not sure who they are trying to sell this too but i am now totally impartial to episode 9 ill catch it on netfix if at all  does any fan out there actually like the last jedi  are we all too attached to luke skywalker and blinded to the new story  why couldnt you let luke kick some ass and then die heroically
Jun 18 2018,negative,i left the theatre scratching my head wonderig what the hell was that supposed to be i grew up with sw but im in my mid thirties now and its time to let the past die i guess
Jun 18 2018,neutral,i wasnt impressed a long wait for a horrific let down sad
Jun 18 2018,negative,this is not how star wars works
Jun 18 2018,negative,sub par scifi romp or trash star wars installment either way thoroughly dissapointing 
Jun 18 2018,negative,simply awful  a complete betrayal of the story and all the other movies  yes even the damned prequels      here we go        indefensible waste of opportunities with the older characters particularly luke skywalker who was ruthlessly trashed      the utterly laughable and pathetic new order  more like the new spaceballs      onedimensional new characters that are impossible to give a shit about unless youre five years old      unforgivable shoehorning in of the writersdirectorsstudios realworld politics at the expense of telling the star wars story cynically using star wars as a platform to mass dupe young people into following an extremist leftwing agenda i personally do not subscribe to right or leftwing politics      dumping what was set up and implied in the force awakens to gratify the ego of the new director and writer  not that i was a fan of tfa either      a story riddled with plot holes      a diabolical script      the makers when called out about this pile of tripe start calling fans who are in the main good decent hardworking people who have loved sw their whole lives racists sexists uneducated idiots white supremacists transphobic insert implied thoughtcrime here etc when they are nothing of the sort theyre just calling you out on the quality of this dross    its a dismal time to be a longstanding star wars fan  i genuinely wish no further movies had been made after rotj and that we still had the great expanded universe as the true continuation of the star wars saga    i will not be watching solo or any further star wars movies produced by disney and lucasfilm  in my opinion star wars as a franchise is in tatters and damaged beyond repair    fuck the left fuck the right fuck disney fuck lucasfilm and fuck this movie
Jun 18 2018,negative,half a year has passed and i still have not recovered from this i have seen dozens of times each movie without exaggerating even the prequels with this i have not been able to do more than on december 15 2017 and when the bluray came out i do not want to see it again in order that the memories that my brain keeps disappear help us bad results at the box office you are our only hope
Jun 18 2018,negative,i will never ever understand why this film has received so much praise 
Jun 18 2018,negative,  this truly was a massive spectacular way to ruin the future of star wars i really am disappointed in the terrible plot character design and well everything really    first time ive seen a star wars film only once in the theatres usually see at least 2 or more times and i refuse to even buy or seen this rubbish again
Jun 18 2018,negative,this is the first star wars movie i havent watched until the end i just didnt care about any of the characters boring
Jun 17 2018,negative,i really wanted to like this movie i enjoyed the force awakens and how it left me wanting more this movie has managed to ruin tfa poor story major plot and star wars mythos incongruity     imagine if they killed the emperor in the 2nd film of the original trilogy then luke trains yoda and somehow becomes stronger in the force afterwards then somewhere out there for no reason han solo meets some random girl and they become romanticly involved before the movie ends and it all has bearing on the storys development whatsoever thats this movie in a nutshell    and underlying all of it are not so subtle messages theyll shove in your face through undeveloped or under developed characters you could care less about when all is said and done enjoy
Jun 17 2018,negative,disney bought a franchise with a huge fanbase that guaranteed lots of ticket sales for the first movie after shitting on and driving away that fanbase disney needs to up their game considerable and start making incredible star wars movies that will capture a whole new audience because the original audience has rightly turned their backs on this garbage well done disney impressive heavy breathing
Jun 17 2018,negative,poor writing boring a lot of wasted storylines movie seams to be long for the sake of begin long so much of the movie seamed like filler
Jun 17 2018,negative,i cannot overstate how terrible this film is i will not be seeing episode 9 because of this film
Jun 17 2018,positive,visually stunning but story feels flat
Jun 17 2018,negative,a movie that slapped into the fan who loved star wars the culprit of solos failure
Jun 17 2018,negative,it was better than cancerthats about it
Jun 17 2018,negative,i have been a star wars fan since 1977 when the first film arrived in theaters i am a hardcore die hard fan with that said this is by far the worst star wars film ever made i even enjoyed the prequels after several views and understood lucas vision not only do they betray his vision they betray his beloved characters luke is supposed to be the most powerful jedi ever and his story line to bring the force into balance was completely abandoned the movie is long the new characters are boring plot holes galore and the potential characters are never developed even snokes backstory is never touched on it is just a terrible terrible mess i would go as far as to say this is the worst sci fi movie ever sharknado has more entertainment value dont waste your time or money
Jun 17 2018,negative,i would rather watch 2 hours of jar jar binks than watch the last jedi again
Jun 17 2018,negative,i just created a rotten tomatoes account just to thumbs down this abomination of a film can you give zero stars i could only get it down to 12 i wouldnt trust rian johnson to make a box of macaroni and cheese how much were those journalist reviewers paid to review this schlock favorably hey disney ill never give you another penny for your disrespectful treatment of this beloved franchise its actually very sad
Jun 17 2018,negative,visually excellent yet seemed poorly written planned and had a lack of consistency and adherence to both logic and inuniverse rules
Jun 17 2018,negative,this isnt star wars 
Jun 17 2018,negative,learning to be okay with this
Jun 17 2018,negative,riddled with plot holes continuity breaks deus ex machina  it definitely subverted my expectations but not in a good way
Jun 17 2018,negative,all this movie is nonsense it breaks star wars universe apart
Jun 17 2018,negative,how this movie has a 91 critic approval is beyond me probably paid off by disney the plot is full of holes rose adds nothing to the plot and is useless she stops finn from sacrificing himself even though she talks about how proud she is that her sister died for the resistance really unfunny jokes kylo is no longer a intimidating villian that jj set him up to be he acts like a enraged 9 year old with schizophrenia luke was destroyed what a abomination of a movie
Jun 17 2018,negative,this movie was a true disappointment after disney bought the franchise i was unsiure how he films would turn out to the good of my luck 3 of the 4 newer films have been great this is the exception the story line was boring from the getgo and the plot didnt add up characters that had been built up in the previous movie were thrown aside and the whole movie seemed like a waste of time i dont know how the main series can recover from a dismal display like this solo rouge one and the force awakens were great fun but this one definitely missed the mark
Jun 17 2018,positive,pretty great star wars movies with occasional issues people are overreacting
Jun 17 2018,negative,i was totally on board for this film i awaited to see the what was going to happen to these characters after the setup from the force awakens however what i got was a boring disjointed film that was a disgrace to the star wars franchise which i have supported since may 25th 1977 unless lucasfilmdisney can clean up their act i am now done with these films and be content with the better films in this series a true mustmiss film
Jun 17 2018,positive,the troll is over it was one person guys its very easy for one person to add tons of reviews i did this very easily without the aid of a bot if i had a team of 10 people this score would be moved rather simply  1000 people voting a few times a day is all it takes     fwiw most of the reviews submitted to rt dont have anything written look what i did in a single week there are at least 3 youtube video created about a few hundred reviews on a meaningless poll all the claims that disney was paying for reviews why would disney care some guy on reddit is scraping reviews here so analyze the data if some of you were more curious about datastatistics youd realize that 200k votes for this film render this data statistically irrelevant please keep voting on this poll though 
Jun 17 2018,negative,the movie that killed star wars bring the original cast back to kill them all lol
Jun 17 2018,negative,goes against everything star wars i can go on for hours how bad it is just betrays everything we love hated it as a star wars film ok ish maybe not really as a film horrible starwars film
Jun 17 2018,negative,very bad written movie not worth your time
Jun 17 2018,negative,i give this rating because i applaud the fact people turned up to make this movie on a daily basis
Jun 17 2018,negative,the lowest  worst attempts ever to make a sw movie sw fan films with no budget have far better stories that fit canon better luke skywalker is a worthless bum that tried to kill his own nephew in his sleep rey gets no proper jedi training yet she is unstable as long as she manages to get a lightsaber in hand  wields it even if she has just gotten the saber finn is all but a joke leia is turned into mary poppins the first order are buffoons who is snoke some dead guy whats up with kylo who knows he seems to wanna cry all the time sjw rules the galaxy now very bad female characters everywhere that are not heroes but gets people on their own side killed expecting an epic duel nowhere to be found and dont get my started on the meaningless casino planet the force is a joke now anyone can be a jedi now without taking real responsibility for it force ghost yoda uses lightning to burn down trees did anything in tfa or any of the previous 6 films matter here not at all the holiday special was awful in every sense of the word but the ot characters at least remained in character back then they dont here lots of shit happens but the film ends where it started lots have died but that is just shrugged off everything is meaningless sw is pushed down a shithole this is beyond embarrassingly bad you wanted payoffs you wanted to see epic battles  duels luke teaching rey the ways of the force  together they fight against snoke  kylo get ready for the biggest disappointment in your sw life absolutely nothing what you wished for or what the marketing seemed to promise us is in here theres no magic the score is not good the editing is all over the place sw has been around for 40 years it took only 2 35 hours to tare it down ep 9 who cares now sw is meant to take you to a galaxy far away  make you feel good the perfect escapism tlj just makes you uncomfortable at best those that demand nothing from their sw will enjoy this they will enjoy the pretty surface but for us that demand meaning story character development a red thread connected to previous films wonderful score epic action we must look entirely elsewhere
Jun 17 2018,negative,this film sucks so hard
Jun 17 2018,negative,not really the best movie ive ever seen its a blatant copy of a new hope
Jun 16 2018,negative,i wish i could give this piece of moving pictures and sound it does not deserve to be called a film zero stars i could talk about the plot holes galore empty characters lack of a heros journey pointless plot threads and absolutely misplaced humor all day but other reviewers have done that instead the critical and deadly sin of this film is the blatant disregard by rian johnson of the treatment for a trilogy set up in tfa according to mark hamil jj abrams set up treatments for a 3 part story to be told in this sequel trilogy rian johnson comes onboard and rips it up and replaces it with this nonsense its a disgrace with regards to the fundamental process of filmmaking nevermind the disregard for the previous 7 star wars episodes rian johnson and kathleen kennedy need to go although im afraid its too late theres nothing that can be done that can save this series from the absolute disaster that was tlj episode 9 cant fix the mess of tlj and wrap up the whole saga its an impossible feat thanks a lot rian johnson youve killed star wars for me something the prequels didnt even manage to do 
Jun 16 2018,negative,rian ruined a great series
Jun 16 2018,negative,terrible movie does not feel like star wars to me i was that bored in the theatre i started looking at other audience members lots of people shaking there heads or with there faces in the palms of there hands never thought i would see the day where this was possible during a star wars movie the biggest laugh the movie got during my viewing was the flying through space scene not sure that was meant to be the funniest moment but oh well i could write an essay on what i did not like about the film but im trying my best to forget it so instead i will go over some things i liked about the movie the design of the resistance bomber ships the design of the speeders on the red dust planet the red dust planet itself and the scene with r2 and luke using the hologram from a new hope thats it off the top of my head this is the first star wars movie i have only seen once in theatres and the first one where i have not purchased the home release nuff said
Jun 16 2018,negative,terrible movie  us fans are tired of disney destroying our galaxy  you made a crappy movie and you are now blaming us and accusing us of being sexist bigoted and racist  when fans dont like your bias agenda and narrative you blame it on us
Jun 16 2018,negative,this movie could have been better written by a 1st grade kid who got held back a year  ryan round head johnson isnt qualified to clean my toilet after eating at a taco bell
Jun 16 2018,negative,i speak 6 languages and i cant find appropriate words to describe how bad it was just bad bad jokes with the worst timing ive ever seen bad plot bad characters bad subplot bad political propaganda just bad the only good thing about this move was that it ended
Jun 16 2018,positive,how dumb do you have to be to actually believe disney would pay for good review for a film thats already a hit made a ton of money and that came out six months ago     who is paying for all these dumb worst movie ever reviews
Jun 16 2018,negative,clearly disney has resorted to paying people to write good reviews an insane gambit that will massively backfire a horrible horrible cinematic failure that will go down in history as a classic example of franchise mismanagement and hubris pure dumpster fire
Jun 16 2018,negative,changing the directors midway was the worst idea rian johnsons movie has a lot of plot holes uninspired characters and really bad pacing he sacrificed logic and common sence for the sake of bad humor its objectively a bad movie
Jun 16 2018,negative,this movie doesnt make sense as the second movie in the trilogy it is like the writers didnt even watch the first movie
Jun 16 2018,negative,initially when i sat in the theater with my son to see this film we were  both very excited to see where the story and characters would go between the two of us our reviews were mixed at best some amazing scenes in the film were overshadowed by terrible blending of futile substories background stories that could had been utilized for further character development rather than fillers    unlike the flowing appeal of the other franchise films last jedi felt forced superficial and cluttered it was evident that there was little to no focus on continuing a richer character development it had many moments where i questioned how many rewrites the screenplays had how many scripts were we really looking at on screen the opportunities were there the script was not   unlike the many i really love the new introductions of characters i love all characters of rey kylo finn rose poei would had hoped for more for this characters     free advice the audience needs to fall in love with the characters not just shove characters in without real elaboration force awakens began this process beautifully while the last jedi struggled to maintain story telling throughout    as far as the plot plenty of predictable twists and turns so much so i hope for the next there is canonnot cgi fillers with a few garnishes of canon i dont mind new twists to canon as long as it flows     im not an elitist about the canon but there are plenty of moments of wtfit makes for cringe worthy moments lost moments of superb story telling    seven months later after seeing jedi in theaters i cant recall the ending at all i recall some parts in passing it was forgettable and thats distressing    sadly there is nothing there that stirs the spirit to see the next its so disappointing to say this about a franchise i had staunchly loved for so long but money is moneytime will tell if we will take the bait again   sadly these films are becoming politicized its not so much of what is in the films that are the issue its the echo chamber of of blame and moral outrage that people hated from these films   theres so much of it ive tuned out anything from lucasfilmdisney on social media or likewise bad reviewsopinions are blamed on the evils of white andor sexists are there such things in the world absolutely but not every negative review should be treated as the antichrist but its what we are hearing more of via the media    as for my 19 year old son he feels the same about the rhetoric surrounding this film franchise right now as do many of his malefemale friends its considered pablum    as a parent to three kids i want them to love star wars as i did as little girl i wasnt born when the first star wars hit theaters and was an infant for the second however i fell in love with the adventures and characters from star wars from the moment i watched them i was raised a classic feminist so i never thought twice about who played what role in the film all i knew was i wanted to be a female jedi and kick some ass    my family is mixed af as most americans are yet weve focused on our differencesso much so now the utopian future of living together in harmony seems even farther away why is that why has it gone to this place  racism sexism capitalism political opportunism    for us we want well developed films of heart and passion not superficial pandering even with the dated allure of the first films there was heart and passion and sense of adventure force awakens i really enjoyed it despite moments of mixed canon and other points that could be made it was memorable and fun    i hope for the sake of childhood nostalgia not just for me but for my kids something can be resurrected with that excitement and allure that many love about this franchise without burning down the coliseum completely with moral outrage if one isnt careful this is how influence can be stripped awayall with a tweet    tldr ive added my two cents uselessly
Jun 16 2018,negative,1 of 2 movies i regret spending money on seeing the other was the blair witch project
Jun 16 2018,negative,worst sw movie yet  hint  use of hyperdrives couldve made this movie 10 minutes long  lazy and thoughtless writing huge plot holes useless plot twists useless characters tarnishes first trilogy this movie should be completely rewritten and remade before episode 9  a fresh start if you will  i wouldve rated this 5 stars if i could but you have to give it at least 1 star to count
Jun 16 2018,negative,worse than the christmas special
Jun 16 2018,positive,i loved this movie i find it so funny that people criticize this movie for shattering all preconceived ideas about how star wars should be that is exactly what makes this movie so great it dares to be different and take a totally different path than what were used to this is the exact reason why i didnt enjoy the force awakens too much i love movies that want to be unique and different in their own way and i love that they did that with star wars a halfstar off though for those casino scenes haha    dont hate on this movie because its not what you envisioned star wars to be behind all that is great character development creative twists and the most refreshing star wars episode in a very very long time
Jun 16 2018,positive,one of my all time greats love the way they take it a little bit towards the dark side but it brings balance after all thats what the movie is all about
Jun 16 2018,positive,classic and revolutionary at the same time the film does justice to the spirit of star wars where all the hate is coming from i have no idea i think they simply cannot take luke being taken out of the picture
Jun 16 2018,negative,easily the most lackluster entry in the series the only star wars movie i simply have no desire to ever see again  it is generally boring with some downright nauseating diologue at times
Jun 16 2018,positive,a staggering achievement
Jun 16 2018,positive,brilliantly written performed and produced its amazing
Jun 16 2018,positive,solid new star wars film
Jun 16 2018,positive,a classic tale of good vs evil
Jun 16 2018,positive,one of the best films of the year
Jun 16 2018,positive,a near perfect film
Jun 16 2018,negative,if you want to see wide open plot holes and wasted character development aplenty youve found the right movie otherwise stay far away from this disaster
Jun 16 2018,negative,this movie destroys every plot line from number 7 episode 7 was a lazy movie in itself but it at least had some things that made you interested in where the story could go this movie made a point to not answer any of those questions and end anything that would have made me interested in seeing episode 9
Jun 16 2018,positive,so many great performances a outstandingly written film
Jun 16 2018,negative,absolutely a waste of time does not continue the story in anyway there is a useless plot that you never really care about
Jun 16 2018,negative,complete and utter crap wow   congratulations you ruined star wars   i had been a massive fan since i was 6 years old  30 years you took everything great about it and destroyed it in two movies  horrible lightsaber battles no awesome displays of force powers  no cool lore or mythology and cool aliens  anyone can be a jedi now give me a break  rei is the most boring character ever to enter the universe with no back story no reason to care about her blahh  way to pc way too feminist  you disgraced the legendary luke skywalker gahh i want to vomit you bastards
Jun 16 2018,negative,this is the movie that killed the franchise for me i disliked this film because of legitimate reasons and the people who made it insult me and call me names because of it but im a 42 year old white male who cares what i think anymore right
Jun 16 2018,negative,long time sw fan this is the first movie that i could not stand to watch and by the end of it i felt it was heading in the wrong direction what they did to luke skywalker was puzzling beyond belief i honestly feel i could have written a better story than what they fed us talk about wasting the momentum from the force awakens even if it unanimously agreed it was a straight rip off of a new hope abrahms at least got the timing and nostalgia correct tlj was a failure on so many levels it almost deserves to be used a classroom material for new directors as an example of what not to do with a well known franchise the magic was lost in tlj the force was completely lacking the danger the lack of dread the lack of any emotion it simply was a fail movie and yet rian johnson is still currently working on a new trilogy i would yank the carpet from under his feet after what he did with tlj disney star wars feels far too positive far too safe far too happy and way too  boring star wars always had great evil to fight against and frankly kylo ren is not evil enough hell i have a hard time taking that character seriously
Jun 16 2018,negative,i dont know where all these good reviews came from im wondering if they were either bribed or didnt see the same movie i saw ive always enjoyed the star wars series but this draws the line the story was so poorly constructed that it seemed a twelve year old wrote it there were so many plot holes and pieces that didnt add up for example how was the first order the most powerful and dangerous force in the galaxy so ridiculously gullible and easily fooled how does making the villains so incompetent that a five year old could undermine them make the protagonists in any way triumphant lets not forget the characterization not one character seems to follow their personality behavior and charisma that weve learned to love whats with finn helping to destroy the most powerful weapon in the galaxy to save rey then in this movie completely forgetting his loyalty to the resistance and having no character development whatsoever except for learning a lesson he already learned lets not forget he spent this entire time following this new character rose in order to create a forced and poorly developed romantic relationship to dispose of any future relationship for finn and rey why would they do this except for creating and even more poorly developed romance between rey and kylo and who could forget poe dameron from tfa the strong and charismatic pilot we all loved doesnt like leias substitute pilot enough to cause a mutiny and cant seem to follow a single order hes given we cant forget luke skywalker one of the most iconic and loved characters of the entire series becoming a complete hermit who is too scared to do the right thing and help his sister defeat the first order he also had the horrid urge to kill his own nephew just because he saw darkness in him shouldnt luke know better than anyone after saving vader from darkness that ben could also be saved and taught the ways of the light side i guess not last but not least the villains not only are the first order officers completely dumbed down to make the messy resistance task force an easy escape but the ominous supreme leader snoke was killed off instead of answering fans questions of who or what he even is by none other than kylo ren himself i guess im order to save rey why didnt he do this earlier in tfa to save han maybe because this movie is a poorly written disaster so this movie ends with barely any resistance members escaping to some run down planet and fighting off the best weapons in the galaxy with the worst machines i had ever seen only for luke to come in as a hologram to distract his newly elected supreme leader nephew who is clearly too unstable and incompetent for the job so the resistance can escape once again this movie was a huge disappointment because it had so much potential only for the new director to create his own mess of a story for who knows what unless you want to see all your favorite characters be dumbed down and act nothing like the the fighters youve come to admire i cant recommend this movie to anyone at all
Jun 16 2018,positive,the best star wars film
Jun 16 2018,positive,facetime in space the motion picture is great
Jun 16 2018,positive,the very best star wars film
Jun 16 2018,positive,a masterpiece rian johnson really brought his a game for this one
Jun 16 2018,positive,i loved this film so much
Jun 16 2018,positive,a fantastic achievement
Jun 16 2018,positive,five out of five stars
Jun 16 2018,negative,a diappointment with unconvincing characters except for kylo ren also poorly plotted i expect better from star wars and disney
Jun 16 2018,negative,this movie pulled  off what i thought was impossible dismantling everything great about star warsthe total destruction of luke skywalkers character is unforgivablei could accept such a change if were earnedand the whole plot relied upon very dubious technical aspects of spaceships rather than impart lessons through good story telling it preached and talked down to the audience this is not star wars this is more like a reanimated corpse that used to be star wars star wars needs a true resurrection now after tlj killed it
Jun 16 2018,positive,seriously where are the plot holes these hater drones keep talking about ill save you the time theres are not plot inconsistencies in the last jedi this is one of the better star wars films but lets not pretend than any of them are citizen kane for a star wars film though this is easily the best written one i can remember perhaps thats why some people are still screaming about it six months later
Jun 16 2018,positive,a top 3 star wars film
Jun 16 2018,negative,inconsistent characterisation pointless plotc coupled with plotholes you could fly a star destroyer through wilful rejection of canon and disrespectful treatment of established characters unfortunately the franchise is careening to an ignominious end
Jun 16 2018,negative,the last jedi was not only a disappointing star wars movie it was a terrible movie in general lazy confused writing useless sub plots a run time that is too long at the end of the movie it feels like nothing of consequence has happened the force awakens was lazy and plagiarized the original star wars film but it least setup some interesting storylines for this movie to expand upon unfortunately that never happens with tlj  one of the worst movies of 2017 and easily the worst sw film including the prequels not excited to see the next installment of this trilogy
Jun 16 2018,positive,hope is like the sun if you only believe in it when you can see it youll never make it through the night so many great lines
Jun 16 2018,positive,save what you love
Jun 16 2018,positive,an amazing experience
Jun 16 2018,positive,one reviewer just wroteto the 5 star posters you are not just losing the cultural war you have lost it   what does that have to do with star wars please get some help     this movie is great for some reason it triggered a lot of people with mental problems
Jun 16 2018,negative,what a let down  everything interesting that jj set up in the force awakens was promptly tossed away by rian johnson  this was a bigger disappointment than star trek v the final frontier  what they did to luke was unforgivable  a low speed chasenot very exciting  lucasfilm had better find better writers people who understand the mythological and anthropological roots of sw
Jun 16 2018,negative,properly named it will be the last jedi movie i will ever see i have never missed seeing a new star wars movie at a theater since 1977 what johnson did to luke skywalker is unforgivable theres no longer a reason to see episode 9 or any other star wars movie
Jun 16 2018,negative,been a fan since i can remember sw is dead now dead to me this movie killed it the least effort possible was put into it rian johnson has absolutely no idea about the franchise and the lore or even worse he just didnt care neither about the work nor the fans    and the worst of all is that instead of acknowledging the fact that mistakes were made they will keep in denial and will keep thrwing garbage out    just check how from june 10th on these reviews page they released hundreds of 5star bots childish and shameful
Jun 16 2018,negative,wish i had waited till this was free to watch we all felt deflated by this film and the more i think about it afterwards the more i find that makes no sense a couple of real face palm moments and lots of jokes that fell flat our teenage girls were talking half way through they said it was like old people harry potter set in place thats no interest to them i have to agree
Jun 16 2018,negative,i read several audience reviews that insist that the final straw for them was people breathing in space leia surviving crazy technology changes snope etc but for me it was mark hamil sucking on an alien titty
Jun 16 2018,negative,i specifically made an account on this site to comment on this movie and the reviews i see about this movie the past week i see lots of 5 star ratings and that made me think why so much 5 star ratings so i did some igging what do all past week  5 star rating reviews have in common they all subscribed to rt this month so my gues is these are bots or payed people to write positive reviews     now about the movie the movie looks awesome the music is awesome the visuals are awesome but the story is a slap in the face for any star wars fan internet is full of stories how this movie broke the star wars franchise look it up
Jun 16 2018,negative,this movie was the worse i have seen the new characters have no meaning there is no connection to them the legacy characters were treated like a joke there was no meaning to the story i felt like i walked out of a joke of what was my role model as a child there was no reason for me to waste money on this movie i will not waste any more money on this movie if you grow up loving luke and liea do not go see this movie having liea become a flying joke was a slap in the face having luke become a joke of who he was that was bs to the max so no this movie us not wroth your time or money
Jun 16 2018,negative,a steaming pile of garbage that only serves to assassinate beloved characters replace them with lack luster characters in a poorlycontrived story full of plot holes and shove identity politics down the audiences throat rian johnson will go down in history as the director who intentionally brought down a mighty franchise and divided its fan base
Jun 15 2018,negative,a mediocre at best sci fi film and an abhorrent attempt at a star wars film completely disregards the established lore and character traits established not only in the ot but in episode vii which while deeply flawed had redeeming qualities the last jedis only redeeming qualities are its visuals and its soundtrack terrible story terrible characters terrible set up for a supposed finale to the sequel saga everything that was exciting or intriguing about the force awakens in ignored or destroyed and there is no tension left going into episode ix rey has proven herself more powerful than kylo ren on multiple occasions even though she has no training and earned none of her abilities why the hell should i be invested in the conflict going into the next film im not im morbidly curious at best  also i have no desire to watch the force awakens ever again because the last jedi makes all the mysterious moments seem stupid now case and point during rey and kylos duel on starkiller base when he has the advantage and tries to recruit her saying i can show you the ways of the force  rey says the force the music swells she closes her eyes gains a new focus and comes back to win the fight now ignoring the terrible choice of having your antagonist defeated in the first part of a trilogy this came across to me at least as a jason bourne type moment rey acted like someone who had been trained in the past and had her memory wiped for her own safety but now thanks to rian johnson doubling down on the mary sue factor that scene is now rey becoming more powerful because she hears and then repeats the words the force  what a crock of shit
Jun 15 2018,negative,the shot of snoke with his tongue hanging out was the last straw for me this was a parody at best
Jun 15 2018,positive,my favorite star wars movie ever besides revenge of the sith
Jun 15 2018,positive,a very beautiful film
Jun 15 2018,positive,just like all the hates i created this account just to say i love the last jedi
Jun 15 2018,positive,are people really so stupid that they believe disney is paying for reviews a full six months after a film came out why do people keep writing that what does disney gain from rigging a score than no one outside some crazy fanboys takes seriously everyone already knows this number is easy to brigade     why is it so difficult to accept that most people like the last jedi
Jun 15 2018,positive,the last jedi is masterful storytelling rian johnson rose to the occasion creating this fantastic film i recommend the director and the jedi behind the scenes doc about the film its a terrific insight in how this film came together
Jun 15 2018,positive,my favorite star wars film since return of the jedi
Jun 15 2018,positive,this movie delivers one of the biggest wtfmoments youll see in your life in theaters and has delightful performances by adam driver daisy ridley mark hamill and so many more of the cast  some characters die before you really get to know them which feels a bit like a shame but which is what the extended universe is for i guess finns entire storyline does feel exactly the same as it was in tfa which is a shame and the worst bit of the movie for me they could have been more original in that regard  johnson made some decisions i wouldnt have made in writing and shooting the movie but all in all it is a great movie with its heart in the right place and which might leave people a bit depressed at the end of it    the lesson of this movie is failure but i look forward to how much higher these characters will be able to soar in the last chapter of this trilogy    the creature designs were amazing and used at the appropriate times to bring some lightheartedness into an otherwise very dark movie
Jun 15 2018,positive,the force awakens and rogue one a star wars story want to please you they want to hit familiar beats and remind you why you love star wars they are so much fun but the last jedi doesnt want to remind you of anything it doesnt care about your relationship with star wars the only relationship that matters here is rian johnsons relationship with star wars and for the first time in a long time here is a star wars movie with a proper point of view one delivered by a storyteller who is unafraid to shatter a universe he loves to break down the heroes that mean so much to him a wise and noble luke is easy a luke with regrets thats hard thats tough to swallow thats what elevates the last jedi beyond a simple retread  it asks you to take these characters seriously in a way that other star wars films have not to acknowledge them as something beyond a vessel for escapism star wars can only matter in the long run if its given the room to grow and right now it feels like the sky is the limit right now star wars feelsunsafe and thats great
Jun 15 2018,positive,10 out of 10 great great great
Jun 15 2018,negative,worst episode since attack of the clones this movie sucked rian johnson is a joke and please disney do not let this moron make any more movies
Jun 15 2018,positive,the last jedi is one of my favorite star wars films i really appreciated the way the film grapples with themes of disappointment and failure it would have been really easy to make a star wars movie that pandered to exactly what fans and mainstream audiences wanted to see arguably the force awakens does that a bit too much but i dont think that would have made for a compelling narrative sure there are flaws with the plot of the last jedi but none are so overwhelming that they overshadow the central point of the movie we must learn from our failures as much as our successes our weaknesses as much as our strengths i thought rian johnson communicated an emotionally and philosophically complex story that really delivered if youve grappled with grief and disillusionment in a serious way this may be your favorite star wars film i know its one of mine thank you rian johnson for making a star wars film that was so different from and better than my expectations i look forward to your future star wars films
Jun 15 2018,positive,this movie kicked ass and i have to wonder if all of the haters have simply never watched good films outside of the star wars saga what people keep complaining as wasted opportunity or not getting it is actually a brilliant total reexamination of the stale formula that has gripped the entire series thus far i dont want spoilers in this review but the film has a very cohesive core pointmessage that every single negative reviewer here seems to have somehow completely missed out on both contextually and in general
Jun 15 2018,positive,a masterclass in glorious visual effects stunning cinematography and exquisite tension this is an absolute must see at the cinema with a storyline that is utterly captivating and some powerful performances this is a satisfying film for fans that delivers on its promises with ingenuity providing some of the most awe inspiring cinema moments in recent memory that are sure to be revered in years to come whilst some dialogue is occasionally overly simplistic the script is generally a delight that further endears us to characters we are now intimately familiar with an experience that will stay with you well after you leave the theatre i will certainly be seeing this again on the big screen may the force be with you 94610
Jun 15 2018,negative,what a piece of junk  no seriously it makes the phantom menace  look the godfather or some other cinematic  classic unfortunately ill never get that 2 12 hours back
Jun 15 2018,negative,terrible movie hyperspace is not a weapon and lukes character is completely trashed
Jun 15 2018,positive,the last jedi is by far the best of the star wars movies to come out in the last 30 years the cast is amazing the set pieces and visual effects are breathtaking mark hamills portrayal of luke was spot on and his story arc helped give the movie life the emotional plot was perfect and the many twists were created unexpected suspense best star wars movie ever made
Jun 15 2018,negative,it sucks it is a piece of sht
Jun 15 2018,positive,absolutely stunning it is the best in the series incredible action and gorgeous imagery the cast is impeccable bar maybe benicio del toros dj who doesnt quite work and the central narrative between kylo ren and rey has some of the absolute best scenes ever from star wars i dont know who these people are that saying its the worst ever its the best
Jun 15 2018,positive,i am big fan of star wars love this universe and this film was awsome story characters actions all this at the highest level looked at one go my favorite film so cool a lot of their ideas and innovations courageous moves the original trilogy is felt but the last jedi surprises with its plot turns and what is happening it was unexpected and interesting
Jun 15 2018,positive,one of the best movies of 2017 while not perfect it had me on the edge of my seat ive never had a movietheater experience like this before  i didnt know what was going to happen next i can understand and respect why some would not like this movie i used to be a die hard star wars fan who obsessed about lore details as an adult i care more about moment to moment impact emotion humor and surprisewonder this movie surprised and moved me multiple times spoiler it feels like the movie and series are breaking from the tired old usual mold of good vs evil and into something different we already had that story arc with episodes 16 jedi vs sith empire vs rebellion to phrase what luke said in the trailers its time for the jedi to end
Jun 15 2018,positive,all this negativity is why we cant have nice things tfa was too close to the originals and the fans hated it now tlj is too far and they hate it theres no winning honestly my rating is a 889 but someone needs to offset all the 0s could have used a little less humor let us live a little more in the emotion of the moment that being said at least the jokes worked sw has always been a little cheesy and thats okay but in my opinion they slightly cheapened the maturity of this entry i liked the movement away from the black and white morality of the series towards something more real and adult this is a star wars film thats finally willing to acknowledge the grey areas and i think the series is better for it yeah there are still a lot of toy commercials in this but its sw what do you expect    all the things you want from the series are here space battles ground battles adventure excitement heroes and villains the spectacle of it all is amazing if not a little overlong the saber duals featured here are by far the best choreography the series has ever seen no spoilers but about 23 of the way through is a sequence that i dont think lucas could have conceived on his best day these expected moments are solid but what this film really has going for it is when it steps away from those expectations to start with theres actual character development believable and relatable character growth tlj features some of the most nuanced people ive seen in a major studio franchise film finn could have used a little more to work with but his bstory is still fun and has some payoff for the future of the series what always made han so great was that he felt like a real person dropped into this fantastic world his presence is missed but rey and kylo make up for this in spades    this finally feels like a new direction for the series and as someone who grew up with the original trilogy im happy to move beyond the characters that shaped my childhood those characters are still here and feel so much more real than they ever have before you can feel the weight of 30 years of war on all of them especially when you look in lukes eyes life seldom turns out the way you expect it to and this movie acknowledges that i think this sentiment is the exact reason so many have trouble with the film they want a simple story of good versus evil they want the heroes that they know and love to be challenged but they also want it to be safe this movie is not safe it wants you to see beyond the space opera conflict to see that the universe is larger than rebels and empires it wants to break the cycle and become something more i applaud the audacity of this and enjoyed every moment in the theatre
Jun 15 2018,positive,incredibly beautiful movie loved the characterization of the characters and even some that fans hated loved luke rey and kylo war scenes and fight scenes are amazing rose and fins bit in the movie is unnecessary to the plot of the film rose herself is an unnecessary character given way too much screen time and importance
Jun 15 2018,positive,dec 15 2017  best movie in the series no complaints at all honestly it gave me answers i wanted and left me wanting more star wars i cant wait til episode 9 wonderful job disney
Jun 15 2018,positive,its hard to talk about the movie without revealing spoilers but it is excellent and a massive improvement over episode vii deserves a lot of praise
Jun 15 2018,positive,this movie is one of the best star wars movies however it is in no way the best star wars movie now some people dont like the movie because of some scenes that are in the film and now thats fine not everything works in the movie however there are still some many good scenes that really work some story elements are amazing for example snokes death is one of the best points because it puts kylo ren in command of the first order i feel like this because i really dont think that you need a palpatine type character in every trilogy now im not gonna spoil any more of the movie now there is something that the people must remember and that is you cannot instantly judge this movie immediately after you come out of the theater 95 star destroyers out of 10
Jun 15 2018,positive,i am a life long fan who was appalled at the prequels i had very low expectations for episode 7 and it was good but i felt it was lacking rogue one was my favorite movie since the originals and now disney has delivered a work i believe deserves a place in my top three this is the first movie that i feel actually scores on par with the original three movies do not listen to the naysayers frankly ive read the bad user reviews and i cannot find any coherency in the outrage nor do i share any of their opinions    this movie does something that star wars has been lacking since the original 3 movies it stands alone yet is part of a greater story    spoilers to follow    i have heard people complain about the casino planet i found it refreshing that star wars would take on something as cerebral as arms manufacturers and point out that wars are always armed by the same people who are just exploiting division    i have heard people complain that snoke was wasted snoke was never necessary in the first place we didnt need another emperor they could have just brought back clones of the true emperor there was so much emotion in the scene with snokes death it was the perfect end    ive heard people complain about luke but these people have obviously never explored any of the written works that were once cannon and are not now luke was always going to be tempted by the dark side and haunted by it well for he removed all the instruments of the dark from the universe except for snoke whom i believe was a terrible character to begin with and one of my pet peeves from episode 7 however we could have used a little more back story but i digress there must be balance and without balance luke starts seeing the dark in kylo ren he almost strikes kylo down in anger brilliant luke was never perfect i wanted to see his flaws and this installment did not disappoint    ive heard people complain that luke didnt show off his power what do you call him appearing from across the galaxy as he meditates on the ocean world of ahchto i mean come on not even yoda pulled off a stunt like that im glad they didnt have him bouncing around like a buffoon the way they did with yoda in the prequels i love the fact that they refocused the force as a religion and that luke becomes a proponent of the death of the old religion there has to be balance the jedi were not balance the jedi lead to the sith there answer is somewhere in between and i hope that episode 9 expands upon this    all in all episode 8 is now top 3 star wars movies of all time
Jun 15 2018,positive,clearly this film is divisive and its easy to understand why even among those that did not enjoy the movie many still agree that it is exciting and well acted most who didnt like it tend to take issue with its near disregard for the sanctity of the series it is a challenging movie a movie that exists in a moral grey area when star wars largely up till this point has dealt in absolutes blacks and whites but to me that is invigorating the prequels were criticized for their poor special effects poor plotting and dialogue poor acting and overall not feeling like star wars movies with the exception of episode iii which began to approach the feeling of the original trilogy we want a movie that feels like the original trilogy many fans said then came along the force awakens with great actors great dialogue great practical effects and sets and which returned the series to the kind of story and plotting fans had been asking for but then came the criticisms that it was too derivative played things safe and didnt try anything new now with the last jedi we have a movie with the fine acting spectacular action practical sets shot on film which takes risks moves the series in new directions and broadens our understanding of the force the light and the dark side and what it means to be a hero yet there are criticisms  how dare they change this how dare they make this character act in this way how dare they challenge what i thought i knewit hardly seems fair to me    i believe there exist fans who did not like the prequels who thought the force awakens was too derivative and now are up in arms about the last jedi to any fan that finds themselves in that position i ask what do you want i do not mean that flippantly but genuinely what is this star wars movie you have in mind that you have yet to see because if only the original trilogy is worthwhile in your estimate than perhaps you do not like the movies as movies as much as you like the fandom that comes along with them the original trilogy is not perfect and a lot of criticisms that have been directed towards the prequels and the sequels should and have been directed at the originals they are intentionally derivative of older works much of the special effects do not hold up the acting is often suspect and on and on but they are fun and they are cherished and they mean something to many    i think the problem with star wars is that its such a huge universe full of so many possibilities that sometimes when something in the universe doesnt conform in the way an individual imagined it should it makes them very upset but if you asked 100 different fans what should happen with a certain character or which direction a certain plot should go in you might very well receive 100 different answers so how do you begin to please everyone you cant so you have to make the movie you would want to see and hope that its a movie that resonates with the fans in this case i think johnson made the movie he would like to see which is one that does not play it safe and which challenges its audience to think consider and discuss    if you have not yet seen the movie i would suggest going in with an open mind and trying to enjoy where the movie takes you not dwell on how closely the movie confirms to where you hoped it would take you    and if you dont like it and you didnt like tfa and you didnt like the prequels then i guess youll just have to write your own star wars script and try to get it made
Jun 15 2018,positive,despite being a bit long 150 minutes rian johson delivered one of the most epic episodes of the saga he managed to make a somewhat kidfriendly film but appealing to young and adult audiences lots of questions are still open to the ix episode
Jun 15 2018,positive,great movie i love it almost my favorite star wars movie the characters that develop and just everything about it is awesome and dont forget daisy ridleys beautiful smile 
Jun 15 2018,positive,i would rate this film 910 for a star wars film though i admit there are some elements of the film that dont land that well what i cant believe are this 010 reviews that simply makes no sense i cant believe how angry these people are because the film didnt go their way overall i am really happy with direction the saga took to move forward i find kylo ren a truly fascinating character and im really looking forward to se where this all leads to so im giving it a 10 to compensate for this 0 nonsense probably a 10 is nonsense as well but we really need a balance
Jun 15 2018,positive,this is a great movie and is incredibly better that tfa and rogue oone if you like star wars you should definitely go see this movie now it is worth it also most of the people are giving this movie bad reviews are racist and sexist men who do not want women or minorities to not play a lead role in star wars or any film i would like to remind them that women and minorities have played major roles in star wars since the first film in 1977 and if you cant handle that this franchise isnt for you
Jun 15 2018,positive,a phenomenally innovative and extremely ballsy entry to the series the fact that many fans arent appreciating it is how you know it was a different unexpected and high risktaking film smarter less black and white and more complex than any star wars film before it gives each and every character new and old a ton of dimension deep motives and a reason to empathize with even the wildlife and droids characters that were lame in the force awakens now have plenty of reason for us to care for them and have worthy subplots that will be stuck in your mind long after viewing everyone is greatly tested the film takes the series to new places cracks open the flaws of star wars lore and questions them further strengthening the story of the saga as a whole the film has huge personality not afraid to make fun of itself and to cast aside dopey fan theories in a way that feels almost meta if you are a huge wars fan but also desire something new from the series this is your film long live supreme leader rian
Jun 15 2018,positive,beautiful mesmerizing hilarious rian johnson has made a masterpiece  perhaps the single greatest star wars film for the better part of four decades
Jun 15 2018,positive,amazingi had low expectations when going to the theater but i was happy to be proven wrong a lot of instances are simply epic and the design overall quality is great
Jun 15 2018,positive,dec 15 2017  cant believe some of the comments on here clearly people are just angry their fan theories didnt come true this film makes star wars fresh while providing an homage to what came before as far back as the prequels i really couldnt ask for much more and ill be damned if these bitter fanboys slander this film without response
Jun 15 2018,positive,one of the best star wars film ever made full of love and hope amazing film making
Jun 15 2018,positive,look at all the triggered snowflakes crying over a film for 12 year olds who pied in your corn flakes you babies its a great film get a new hobby a bunch of toxic losers complaining about politics  what a group of miserable losers
Jun 15 2018,negative,the story makes no sense and the movie was riddled with plot holes my least favorite star wars movie by far visually it was stunning so ill give it that but its not enough to make up for the terrible storytelling
Jun 15 2018,negative,the movie that killed the franchise  easily the worst major movie i have seen in a long long time  this movie is a ripoff for 250 at redbox  political correctness run amok
Jun 15 2018,negative,this movie is an abomination to storytelling bastardization of beloved characters for the sake of pushing a political agenda rey is a garbage character i feel no connection to her she is comparable to superman in this  the main protagonist doesnt grow through struggle or failure its simply i need this much power to win and so i have it  dull characterization of new characters and poor utilization of older established characters with complex backstories have caused this to be the worst star wars movie ever  ignore critic paid for opinion bull just look at what they did to luke skywalker the most tragic part of this movie is the character assassination of such a beloved character why can i not give this 0 stars
Jun 15 2018,negative,several months later and im still disturbed and upset at how rian johnson ran the skywalker saga completely off the rails i felt betrayed by this film and its flippant treatment of all the characters     adding insult to injury are the new onslaught of fake 5star reviews take a look they are usually about one sentence long and sometimes just a phrase truly sad that disney will stoop so low just to bump up a film so universally panned by the fans
Jun 15 2018,negative,this movie killed starwars for me and broke my heart i have zero interest in episode 9 now this movie retroactively made the force awakens worthless instead of giving it deeper meaning kathleen kennedy and rian johnson should be fired and never allowed to make another starwars film as long as they live
Jun 15 2018,negative,rian round head  johnson ruins a franchise by writing one dimensional characters and a terrible story then attacks the fan base for not liking the movie cuz theyre biggots and sexist no dudeyour movie just sucks theres been a ton of great movies well received with female and minority leads how about wonder woman and black panther for some recent examples id rather watch a three hour long jar jar movie with a migraine than watch this movie again
Jun 15 2018,negative,its hilarious how disney is paying a team to upvote this piece of crap movie john wayne playing genghis kahn was a better film you are pathetic disney and the fact that you are supporting this desperate crap even now is pretty funny goodbye kennedy and goodbye johnson  worthless trash
Jun 15 2018,positive,after rewatching this a few times i now give it 4 stars it is still not as epically bad as everyone wants to think it is
Jun 15 2018,positive,more layers than an onion i love this film so much
Jun 15 2018,positive,my third favorite movie of the year 
Jun 15 2018,negative,visually stunning but woefully lacking in writing directing and editing on first viewing 510 and on second viewing where the flaws are more obvious it gets 310 a shame as with some decent editing dialogue changes and reshoots it has the potential to be an enjoyable film
Jun 15 2018,positive,people are complaining about fake reviews by posting fake reviews its almost like all the reviews are fake hmmm
Jun 15 2018,negative,very poor writing destroys the sagas rich legacy and adds twist that make no sense  the humor is far off the mark and while the action is okay minus one fight sense and mark hamills performance is great it doesnt save the last jedi  the first order and its command are made to look completely incompetent and can not be taken seriously as antagonist  meanwhile the protagonist is a reduced to a mary sue that gets great power with hardly no training at all  by far the worst movie in the franchise
Jun 15 2018,positive,a near perfect film im just so happy with this tremendous chapter to the star wars movie i see all the hateful reviews i just dont understand the hate
Jun 15 2018,positive,a movie so great its shocking that anyone could hate it its well written performed and it has so many great twists and turns i love the porgs what a great idea rey and kylo steal the show and mark hamills performance is legendary
Jun 15 2018,negative,the sjw feminism in this filmbjust ruin my life after being a fan of the sw series this first ir for me looks like im ready to give into he darkside
Jun 15 2018,negative,what a horrible movie there is nothing i can say here that hasnt been stated i read 30 pages of audience reviews and of those 30 recent pages most are filled with phony one line reviews boasting 5 stars are the directors and producers such spineless losers that they must try to change history using bots you made it it was awful own up to it people are signing up to review this movie because of the bot activity disney and the critics are lying it is a steaming pile of dookie if it upset devoted fans so be it even the most devoted fans will still call a bad movie a bad movie the last jedi was simply a terrible movie
Jun 15 2018,negative,the story is boring as it is nonsensical  despite going into the theatre with high hopes and nostalgia from the past sagas this segment in the starwars franchise was nothing familiar to the seasoned fan and mediocre at best for the casual movie goer  the story movie revolves around a small event unlike the galaxy scale story that was starwars that seems to drag on for eternity while numerous of unmemorable characters carry on in side quest storylines that add absolutely no value to the main plot   adding to the already bad story the writers couldnt seem to resist forcing in a plethora of gags that are terribly delivered at the oddest of timings  distracting and annoying    although the reboot began with a generous dose of classic characters   they are nothing but the same actors in a simalar costume playing a diffent role all together  with no development carrying over from the past movies the seasoned fan is left confused and disappointed at the   shallow portrayal of the characters they used to love  there is little for anyone watching this movie to enjoy other than the soundtrack    i honestly couldnt recommend this movie to anyone as it would be a waste of precious time and money  i am not sure how they could have made this movie anymore disappointing    so what about the new characters
Jun 15 2018,positive,may the force be with you its certainly with this movie
Jun 15 2018,positive,five out of five stars
Jun 15 2018,negative,worst piece of shit ever
Jun 15 2018,negative,spaceballs 2 or a joke  101 how to kill a franchise
Jun 15 2018,positive,an amazing film 1010
Jun 15 2018,negative,this is a terrible movie
Jun 15 2018,negative,rian johnson absolutely ruined this film horrible jj abrams left him some gold to work with and he hacked it all out the window the amount of plot holes is absurd 
Jun 15 2018,negative,this film  deserves a spot in the guinness world records book for blockbuster with most plot holes im baffled by the incredibly high score its getting from critics how on earth can such an amateurish script get so much praise something very fishys going on here
Jun 15 2018,negative,so many plot holes and pointless scenes and corny jokes belittling and killing off love star wars figures this movie was really confusing to watch lots of social politics kinda ruined star wars for me
Jun 15 2018,negative,one of the worst films i have ever seen poorly paced nonsensical script the humor is out of place and the characters are bland i cannot understand how anyone who enjoys film can like this film
Jun 15 2018,positive,this is an excellent daring film fans arent happy with the same old but also arent happy when they take bold risks the last jedi has immaculate storytelling and wonderful visuals an excellent star wars film that im sure will only get better with time
Jun 15 2018,positive,the strongest star wars since empire strikes back it has more heart and character driven plot than all the other films its made me laugh and cry intensely at the very least it is a visually stunning masterpiece certain scenes left me utterly breathless most importantly the core thesis of the film is so inherently what star wars is about and leaves both old and young with an inspirational lesson message the fight is not about defeating your enemies its about saving those you love this is the type of message i want my children learning
Jun 15 2018,positive,dissapointed at first watch amazing and ecxellent on second viewing absolutely loved the movie for its originality it doesnt change the characters too much but still let the audience see them develop into the people theyll become and have become bravo rian johnson for bringing something new to the table
Jun 15 2018,positive,beautiful and daring a true work of art
Jun 15 2018,positive,the last jedi is an emotionally complex deeply philosophical movie with great lightsaber duels spaceship dogfights and actual humor yeah its really that good anchored by some truly remarkable performances and a host of good to great ones the people are both more believable and more important than the effects and the effects are amazing  mark hamills turn as luke skywalker will be on my list of best performances of the year he is funny heart breaking and legendary it is the best acting this series has ever seen carrie fishers performance is wonderful but the tragedy of her loss was impossible for me to separate but it is a perfect farewell if it is her last appearance the new heroes and villains carry the story and make it clear that the force is still with star wars and the rebellion if you dont love this movie you dont like star wars you like the star wars you have in your head not the one that exists a great movie on its own terms the last jedi is without question either the best or alongside the empire strikes back one of the best this series has given us i can not wait to see it again and again
Jun 15 2018,positive,its simple and dosent try to explain everything just like the ot the pt ruined that and everybody moaned now they dont do that and every body moans haha    snoke is snoke a powerful force user that controls the first order and kylo ren thats it just like palpatine even in rotj was the emperor that had force powers and controled vader and the empire thats it but snoke is dispatched without ceremony and the vader of this generation gets to be the emperor the sith are not explained in the ot none of it is the knights of ren neither    in anh luke was a nobody that was the son of a powerful user rey is someone that everybody thinks its linked to that but it isnt or is kylo lying in esb half of the audience didnt believe darth vader why should kylo be telling the truth    obi wan was a jedi knight that did nothing except confront vader and become all powerfull luke just did the same and in a cooler way    in ahn theres no reference to what controls what nobody knows the extension of the empire where the throne world is nothing  neither on esb    etc etc etc    man  this movie is everything a star wars fan would want almost nothing got explained in the ot just that luke was vaders and leias sister in the second and third movie    im really happy they didnt explain a damn thing this isnt greys anatomy this is star wars    the fanbase is spoiled if they want exposition the emperor never nedeed exposition to be powerful    i may be in the minority but this is the way sw should be
Jun 15 2018,positive,shocked by the number of poor reviews it was a great mixture of nostalgia and the new i have to agree with the critics on this movie a worthy addition to the star wars saga
Jun 15 2018,positive,amazing i loved it
Jun 15 2018,negative,everything that was set up with force awakens was ignored here and destroyed which made no sense this trilogy still has no solid story huge plots wasted talent on characters that are poorly written  new characters have no charisma and characters we love and are interest in are killed off in really stupid ways    feminism is a popular topic nowadays but when you destroy characters like admiral ackbar just to have a female character in is beyond stupid this is scifi and things like feminism shouldnt be implemented in n one cares good story is what makes the movie great in this case there was no good story
Jun 15 2018,positive,ended up walking out and demanding a refund about halfway through dont bother
Jun 14 2018,negative,terrible movie bad writing bad directing also this is probably one of the most blatantly condescending movies ive ever seen lucasfilm and disney should be embarrassed the one star is for the visual effects
Jun 14 2018,positive,there are so many reviews that say this movie is garbage and that its not real star wars that is so false on so many levels yes some people may be divided on the twists in this movie i personally loved the new direction but you cant say in any regard that this is an awful movie having grown up with the prequels i never felt that real love for star wars that people growing up in the 70s and 80s had now with the last jedi i understand it see this movie
Jun 14 2018,positive,this film does what is brave and new rather than safe and familiar i am so thankful for filmmakers who are willing to fight the urge to simply seduce hardcore fans with empty promises
Jun 14 2018,positive,this movie and the new hope are my top star wars movies the battle scenes are quite possibly the best of any sci fi movie out there and the character development in incredible
Jun 14 2018,positive,this film is about resistance through compassion and decency its about regret fear of choices made in the past irrelevancy and growing old its about rising above or sinking below our origins its also a star wars movie that takes a lot of risks the movie is a kick in the pants for the franchise i adored it
Jun 14 2018,positive,brilliant film made me very emotional in certain parts the cinematography is absolutely breathtaking really excited at the prospect of seeing it for a second time
Jun 14 2018,positive,my top star wars film ever
Jun 14 2018,positive,if episode 7 was a love letter to past movies then episode 8 throws the old rules out the exhaust port this is a beautifully directed written and acted movie nothing will be as you expect luke wasnt kidding when he said this isnt going to go the way you think this movie is bound to be divisive but it moves the series in exciting new directions    go in as blind as you can and enjoy one of the best movies of 2017
Jun 14 2018,positive,ive read every single user review before doing mine and it seems that there are too many dissapointed fans becuse of a reveal that im not going to spoil those who are dissapointed should rethink this again since this reveal has a great meaning for the kids that will see this movie    now i can safely say that this movie is far better than episode vii rian provided answers to most of what i wanted and some great twists to keep me engaged i love star wars but i only care about the episodes the spinoffs just dont make the cut for me so after waiting for two years for this movie i am happy to say it was worth the wait
Jun 14 2018,positive,i absolutely loved this addition to the franchise as a star wars fan of over 25 years this was a really refreshing change the movie was fun engaging and i really loved all the characters there were some moments that im not 100 sure about but the movie had so much to offer i need a second helping to full digest it its very much a movie for a younger generation and its about the new cast for me thats wonderful as the old cast had their time in the sun and they are helping to world build and bring in these new ones in the best ways possible let go of your hate and see this movie as soon as you can
Jun 14 2018,positive,there are no perfect movies but im giving 10 to the last jedi because even with its imperfections it is the best of the franchise by far and a great movie for fans and not yet fans rian johnson showed us what he imagined of the star wars universe and it was the best usage of its different creatures society and the force opening a vast range of new posibilities and stories  keep in mind that this is a movie not a book its focus is on what is most important so it wont answer all the questions naturally the movie give us everything we could ask for amazing batles and fights physical and emotional interesting characters great villian mounting tension and unexpected plot events plus it is a lot of fun to watch as well but not trying hard to be funny  well done
Jun 14 2018,negative,horrible rian johnson is the reason why i cant masturbait any longer he is the cancerous cyst that needs chemo to end this nightmare that is the last jedi
Jun 14 2018,positive,the force awakens  fans criticized because there wanst inovation  the last jedi  fans criticized because there was inovation    disney should stop doing star wars movies and not because the new movies are bad because the fans doesnt deserve to have new movies
Jun 14 2018,negative,horrible rian johnson is the reason why i cant masturbait any longer he is the cancerous cyst that needs chemo to end this nightmare that is the last jedi
Jun 14 2018,negative,i took my 13 year old to see this she hated it told me afterwards that the only thing in it worth watching was the porgs and that luke sucked she loved star wars and this mess of a badly written film turned her off of wanting to see any future films dont waste your money on it rewatch the original films instead
Jun 14 2018,positive,this film certainly struck a nerve just look at all the 5 and 1 star reviews most of them just regurgitate nonsense this is why no one takes the rt audience score seriously its too easy to manipulate when you look at other scores you see the divide is much less its just a very angry minority upset over a film which is bizarre because the last jedi is fun to each their own i guess although theres better ways to deal with it
Jun 14 2018,positive,the last jedi lives up to the hype easily one of the best movies of the year due to stunning visuals great storytelling humor and uniqueness it is very different from the original trilogy but thats what makes this movie refreshing to see star wars fan or not this is a must see
Jun 14 2018,negative,this is the first star wars movie that did not leave me excited for the next one  the force awakens may have been heavy on the fan service but the new characters were likeable and i was excited to see their journey along with the characters we already know and love the last jedi threw all of that out the window and disrespected the ot characters and all the work jj abrams did setting up the new characters lukes treatment is unforgivable the same person who believed there was still good left in vader gives up on a kid killing admiral akbar off screen and giving what should have been his glory moment to the beyond dull and predictable holdo was unforgivable carrie poppins was cringy all of canto bight was cringy  the movie is just one disappointment after another
Jun 14 2018,positive,really extraordinary its true thats it is really different than the orginal films but it doenst bother you because its refreshing a new kind of story with new problems but there are still refrences to the past and thats just utterly amazing this movie also suprises you in ways you coudlnt imagine this movie is there for the star wars fans who are open minded and appreciate new things because this movie was above my expectations
Jun 14 2018,positive,the last jedi will be the most fiercely debated and polarising star wars ever some of the humour and sequences are a bit off but make no mistake this is the most powerful star wars film ever made the last jedi has some of the most epic moments and lore in the sagas history coupled with amazing camera shots an exciting plot and the best character development its ever seen in ben and rey this is a very different star wars and many fans will feel negatively towards it it but theres no denying we begged rian johnson to take risks the last jedi will stand alone as one of the most unique and memorable films in the saga and i only have praise for this
Jun 14 2018,positive,best star wars film made as of yet everything about this movie was incredible aside from minor issues every performance the multiple extremely engaging plot points and insanely awesome character arcs and bonds the ridiculously amazing fight scenes and chase scenes with the most stunning cgi the humour and general star wars banter between characters and the creatures within the galaxy the asever intense battle between the first order and the rebels the only thing which i think they couldve handled better was the way they scripted finn as i was kind of disappointed at the way his storyline ended 100 go and see this film regardless of whether you know what star wars is or not i shed a tear
Jun 14 2018,positive,i stopped going to major releases a time ago because ive always found myself disappointed all of them seemed to be boring and predictable milking the same old stories good guys beat bad guys the young reckless kid is right etc    so i went to this movie fully expecting this kind of crap fortunately and surprisingly i was completely blown away by this movie every minute kept me on the edge of my seat waiting to see what is going to happen next i have not felt this kind of suspense while watching a movie for years    outside this the movie has some amazing scenes i was constantly getting goosebumps and im considering going to see it again only to watch one of such scenes    i would say that this movie is a masterpiece the best star wars movie since the empire strikes back by far i cannot recommend enough that you go watch it 1010
Jun 14 2018,positive,the new star wars episode is unique it has great sense of humor the movie have everything what a movie need humor action legends next level of jedi and sith clash if its a new beginning of the franchise i will be very glad wonderful amazing fight scenes good job johnson
Jun 14 2018,positive,this is overall a fantastic film great characters and worldbuilding however it struggles with pacing and struggling to find anything for some side characters to do
Jun 14 2018,positive,better than we deserve
Jun 14 2018,positive,nearly perfect great star wars flick
Jun 14 2018,negative,after the joy of seeing mark hamill onscreen again wears off im left with this horrible film which dishonors the lore the original characters and the rules of this world which were established in the original trilogy  not only that but characters such as finn are negative racist stereotypes of black people as he is cowardly flaky weak incompetent and hes desperately trying to impress the women around him to the extent of pretending to be heroic  and then the movie is decidedly politically leftleaning when past star wars movies took no side in politics and that leaves this movie smacking of marxist propaganda  i cant see how star wars can possibly recover from such an aggressive attack against everything that made this mythology beautiful and welcoming to all people
Jun 14 2018,negative,this movie was worse than dragonball evolution in terms of screwing up my favorite characters worst film ive ever seen in my life will not be seeing another star wars film in theatres ever again and ive seen every single one that has been released in my lifetime on opening day rian johnson sucks at writing a cohesive story he friggen kills luke skywalker after destroying his character if star wars means anything at all to you do yourself a favor and dont watch this shit movie
Jun 14 2018,negative,the more i watch it the more flaws i notice  no more kk star wars for me and that makes me so sad  space balls had way more star wars moments than this disrespectful movie
Jun 14 2018,negative,if a star wars movie has this much turmoil and drama then i dont even have to see it to make my own decision pathetic that society has come to this hollywood has had to shove their social justice agenda down a trilogy that never began that way
Jun 14 2018,negative,the director is good at making things look good but should have never been allowed near the script the movie makes no sense and at times i thought it was a parody
Jun 14 2018,positive,a truly amazing experience
Jun 14 2018,positive,my favorite film 55
Jun 14 2018,negative,my brain hurts from watching this movie
Jun 14 2018,negative,saddened by the film disappointed by the illogical selfcontradictory and poorly paced screenplay and the inauthentic and cynical character development what a sad sad end to a once great franchise
Jun 14 2018,negative,garbagetier flick from disneylucasfilm rian johnson is a hack
Jun 14 2018,neutral,so disappointing itï 12s beyond words rian johnson just didnï 12t have the writing skills to continue the great setups that were left by jj in the force awakens only watches it once in the cinema that was enough
Jun 14 2018,negative,one of the worst films i have ever had the displeasure of seeing
Jun 14 2018,negative,the wors star wars movie they kill luke in the most stupid and dissapointing way possibru so a half star its more than it deserves this movie makes god want to kill kitties
Jun 14 2018,positive,easily the best star wars film this century
Jun 14 2018,positive,its a beautiful told story i loved canto bight so much i hope future star wars film spend more time there
Jun 14 2018,negative,been a star wars fan since i was 3 years old prequels are great compared to this even the force awakens and rogue one wasnt this bad notmyluke
Jun 14 2018,negative,bad story telling plotholes out of place humor and the force as a marvel superpower its terrible
Jun 14 2018,negative,had the chance to do great things with luke skywalker and the franchise decided instead to destroy a much loved character and force unwanted social politics down our throats
Jun 14 2018,positive,this film is a love letter to star wars you can tell just how much it meant to the entire team that put it together in the wonderful script tremendous performances and outstanding visual effects
Jun 14 2018,positive,from start to finish this film is amazing a
Jun 14 2018,positive,film fans will like this common star wars fans not if you like episode 456 and 7 thus is another great installment to the star wars trilogy we all love so much
Jun 14 2018,positive,the last jedi is another great star wars movie dont listen to the fan boys this movie goes to places no star wars movie has gone great acting cinematography directing editing etc i only have one problem its an small scene with a lead character that does something thats seems not very star wars but all the rest works
Jun 14 2018,positive,best star wars movie and best movie of 2017 for me i had low expectations when going to the theater but i was happy to be proven wrong a lot of instances are simply epic and the design overall quality is great
Jun 14 2018,positive,the movie is one of the best star wars movies made the best things about it are the unexpected turns the viewer has to cope with it is not an easy movie be aware that you have to give your own interpretation of things
Jun 14 2018,positive,its a flawed masterpiece only for fans who are looking for a living breathing story rather than something solidified decades ago and cast in bronze the backlash to this movie is just dylan going electric all over again fear of the new there are definitely annoying flaws with this movie but they can barely detract from the incredible originality passion and style of what johnson made here
Jun 14 2018,positive,once again star wars the last jedi manages to bring back everything that made its predecessor worth seeing it was worth all the hype it deserves which makes it another one of the best of this year and the only movie with such a score automatically makes this one of the best films of this year in my opinion what makes this film truly deserves the score are the surprises it gives us like literally they are completely unexpected and arent forced onto the film unlike every other film that were released this year i see as a joke to tell what it attempts to do is completely difficult to say in a couple of words because they keep changing as the film progresses to its end and i got to say it was worth waiting for 
Jun 14 2018,positive,one of the best star wars films of all time
Jun 14 2018,negative,signed up to sayjesus christ what a stupid film this was no answers to any of the questions from force awakens all the characters are stupid no respect given to the original characters luke has turned senile leia can cheat death apparently holdo is an idiot rey is a still a mary sue snoke who cares hes dead pointless canto scene no one develops except maybe poe a bit phasma was wasted again so many things wrong im sure has already been stated before and im not even a massive star wars fan
Jun 14 2018,positive,perfect film i love it so much
Jun 14 2018,positive,the last jedi shines for its originality  there are so many surprises so many twists and turns you really dont know whats coming next  that to me was my biggest complaint with the force awakens  it lacked originality  i know fans wanted to see the star wars franchise go back to its roots after the abomination that was the prequel trilogy but the force awakens seemed like it was trying too hard to copy almost everything from a new hope  instead the last jedi went in so many different directions that it was difficult or almost impossible to guess the outcome before it happened
Jun 14 2018,positive,review star wars the last jedi great but still leaving many questions contains spoilers  by ziggy last updated december 17 2017    share  tweet  pin  ok so i just got back from the movie theater seeing star wars the last jedi and its taking every ounce of energy i have left in my body as this film completely wiped me out  so many of my friends who havent seen the last jedi yet immediately texted me asking how the movie was and i was at a loss for words  let me start out by saying it was a great movie and a worthy successor to the force awakens in fact i liked it better on first view but it still leaves many questions unanswered 16 of them to be exact     in the last jedi trailer you hear luke say this is not going to go the way you think and that pretty much sums up this film  there is one twist after another    before i go on any further let me warn you that this review contains spoilers  so if you havent yet seen the movie dont read my the last jedi review unless you dont care about getting things spoiled for some strange reason    im not kidding  dont leave me any nasty comments on my site saying you werent warned because im telling you this review contains spoilers    ok now that thats out of the way    the last jedi is a technical and visual marvel and is everything youve come to expect from this new generation of star wars films  but the films strength is how it builds on the force awakens strong point which are its interesting and lovable characters  watching the last jedi you get to know those characters that you were already deeply invested in over the last two years a bit more and watch their growth right before your eyes  director rian johnson takes massive risks with the characters the majority of which pay off  bb8 stole the show as he did last time but rey poe finn and kylo are also strong  and mark hamill gives what might be his best version of luke skywalker that he has ever done  there were a few parts in the middle of the film where it seemed to tread water but the thrilling finale made up for any slow parts        the film has in my opinion just the right amount of humor making it funny but keeping serious at the same time  i know some have complained saying the last jedi is too funny but those same people forget that during empire han cp30 and the gang were essentially a walking comedy act yet it worked  i thought rian johnson hit on working in just enough humor making it perfect
Jun 14 2018,positive,the last jedi is a technical and visual marvel and is everything youve come to expect from this new generation of star wars films  but the films strength is how it builds on the force awakens strong point which are its interesting and lovable characters  watching the last jedi you get to know those characters that you were already deeply invested in over the last two years a bit more and watch their growth right before your eyes  director rian johnson takes massive risks with the characters the majority of which pay off  bb8 stole the show as he did last time but rey poe finn and kylo are also strong  and mark hamill gives what might be his best version of luke skywalker that he has ever done  there were a few parts in the middle of the film where it seemed to tread water but the thrilling finale made up for any slow parts
Jun 14 2018,positive,he last jedi and its taking every ounce of energy i have left in my body as this film completely wiped me out let me start out by saying it was a great movie and a worthy successor to the force awakens in fact i liked it better on first view
Jun 14 2018,positive,love  love  love   my favorite star wars film
Jun 14 2018,positive,daisy ridley is amazing again as rey shes beautiful smart and courageous all wrapped up in one simply terrific
Jun 14 2018,positive,beautiful breath taking and full of surprises what more can you want
Jun 14 2018,positive,a staggering achievement in film im stunned that a script this good exists for a star wars film no wonder jj wanted to direct the movie himself when he ready it rian johnson has created a truly unique and amazing chapter in the skywalker saga thanks  rian
Jun 14 2018,positive,i dont think ive ever seen a better star wars film
Jun 14 2018,positive,it is inspiring to see all these five star reviews on this site after it was relentlessly brigades by angry fan boys for months they still show up in waves to protect their moronic audience poll this film is fantastic
Jun 14 2018,positive,this is another star wars classic that has a lot of things that will shock you
Jun 14 2018,positive,one of the best films of 2017 and easily the best written star wars film in decades
Jun 14 2018,positive,a sensational chapters to the skywalker saga
Jun 14 2018,positive,i was enchanted from beginning to end
Jun 14 2018,positive,top 5 star wars film amazing
Jun 14 2018,positive,the best film is ages
Jun 14 2018,positive,a stunning masterpiece
Jun 14 2018,negative,i hated this film  poor character development meandering plot no connection to past films
Jun 14 2018,negative,i hated this movie so much its like watching a train wreck with no plot
Jun 14 2018,negative,i liked the force awakened well enough it set up some interesting speculation in the fan community and hey its new and fresh this movie was a train wreck horribly written new characters contrived plot that boils down to a slow speed space chase with sooo many issues with how events could possibly occur at the same time and still pan out proper the character assassination of luke skywalker because we need to prop up rey as this unassailable hero who doesnt even need training to beat multiple trained assassins and a evil force sorcerer an entire set piece on a casino world to shove political ideology in the face of the viewer completely absurd examples of leias force power allowing her to survive the vacuum of space finally a capital ship using lightspeed to ram a fleet which in the star wars canon that was not thrown out with the eu is impossible becasue of how light speed works
Jun 14 2018,negative,all and all the worst star wars movie made wonder what theyll trow at us next
Jun 14 2018,negative,worst star wars movie so far followed by the force awakens kathleen kennedy should not have been part of any story input rian johnson kisses her bum noticed that someone has posted lots of fake reviews on here disney star wars is dead
Jun 14 2018,negative,where the force awakens was a rehash of the original movies this movie tried to be original but ended up filling the movie with useless scenes canto bight poor writing holdo keeping her plan from poe and the rest of the crew wasted character arcs finn and poe and gaping plot holes that freaking lightspeed ramming all in all it is an original film but one that makes a mockery of the vast scope interesting plots and likeable characters of the first three movies and even the prequel trilogy
Jun 14 2018,negative,who is paying for this propaganda the only reason it made as much money as it did was due to the fact that loyal star wars fans werent going to miss the next installment the rian johnson twist that was applied to this episode voids all previous mind you this is only a brief or small synopsis of the many things that are fundamentally wrong with this film im not bashing the actors just the director with his story line  answer me this why would the force direct rey to lukes lightsaber and eventually to luke only to have luke show her his morning routine for breakfast which includes squeezing the the breast of an alien yakbarry white or marvin gaye background music not included pole vault cliff spear fishing and hikes teaches her absolutely nothing while bashing the jedi order the whole time then a 900 year old dead muppet comes along punks luke and then displays more force power in one scene than luke does the whole movie if you can answer just those few questions honestly as to how those things enhanced the star wars universe really luke in star wars canon is considered one of the most powerful jedi ever and all he does is force ghost himself across the galaxy and then evaporated into thin air really btw whats up with the power ranger battle in snokes chamber
Jun 14 2018,positive,a great movie actually moving a storyhonors the series and bring new elements to it love that most of the main characters are all played by minoritt actors women african american latino and asian
Jun 14 2018,negative,easily the worst of al the star wars movies rian johnson showed he had 0 interest in keeping star wars lore kylo is actually rian johnson in the star wars universe wanting to destroy everything like a bratty child whos happy with nothing new characters rose tico and holdo were awful they both sought to submit 2 male lead characters under their own control one used a cattle prod and the other talked down to the best pilot in the resistance as if he were a child who shouldnt know what mommy and daddy are plotting  the story went no where and lead actress daisy ridley overcame absolutely zero adversity to become a jedi the jedi history is all about trails padawans going thru tough scenarios to learn and become one with the living force she did jack  the attempt at comedy fell flat in my theater awkwardness was the feeling of poe pretending to be holding on the line same with the reaching out to feel the force rian is awful  the half star is for the beautiful scenes n some creatures it was like looking at a dogpile of shit with glitter and sprinkled tinsel all over it the movie story and characters stunk but at times the shots of scenery were shiny n beautiful
Jun 14 2018,negative,watch this movie if you want to watch your childhood heroes be deconstructed and humiliated
Jun 14 2018,negative,half of this movie was rendered entirely unnecessary the movie equivalent of a makework project due to giant plotholes  the half that didnt suffer from this was quite good but unfortunately i was a bit distracted since it really stretched suspension of disbelief to the breaking point  in a weird way this has redeemed the prequel trilogy i guess
Jun 14 2018,negative,this movie was a huge disappointment to me i was excited to see what was to come with the new characters of rey finn and poe as the old ones pasted the torch and closed out their stories i enjoyed the force awakens even with its flaws but now because of this one i cant watch it either     the humor in this movie was just bad and offputting if it wasnt just plain dumb it was a complete tonal switch that disrupted any tension that the poor script provided     mark hamill was amazing as always even though his character was a complete 180 of the original portrayal of luke there was no effort to endear reys character to the audience and almost a creepy forced relationship between her and the main villain finns character was great in the fa fun exciting and hilarious in this one he was turned into the janitor of the first order and sent on a meaningless side quest poe the greatest pilot in the resistance was told to just follow orders and went along for the ride on an extremely slow and boring space chase     i loved rogue one i went and enjoyed solo even though the last jedi left a bad taste in my mouth unfortunately i have no want or need to see episode 9 everything interesting has been taken out of this trilogy by rian johnson what is left is not worth taking the time to go see good luck jj
Jun 14 2018,positive,i must admit i had some mixed feeling about the last jedi when i watched it for the first time luke skywalker is my favorite character i grew up with him so hes my hero no one wants to see their heroes fail a lot of time has passed since we saw luke ultimately you have a film about kylo ren and rey these two characters are at the center but the last jedi is about luke this story explores the emotional wreckage from the fallow of luke skywalker and ben solo     in a new hope obiwan has had to digest his failure with anakin skywalker for twenty years in the last jedi luke has been in isolation for a handful of years its not easy seeing luke so different at first but this help explains why he doesnt come to the rescue in the force awakens once i came to that realization that its obvious luke detached himself from the galaxy everything else clicked into place   ive seen the film now countless time and its clear that rian johnson wrote one of the best star wars scripts ever my only gripes about the film were kind of out of his control i look forward to what he does with his own story
Jun 14 2018,negative,very disappointing not only did it do a complete 180 from the original saga films but even from the previous installment jj abrams the force awakens between the poor and forced no pun intended use of childish outofuniverse comedy ala marvel films lore breaking depictions of characters and events flying leia evil and cowardly luke skywalker hyper space ram that negates all major star wars space battles prior it was an incredibly arrogant deconstruction of the star wars mythos and was frankly an insult not only the fans but to star wars george lucas and mark hamill i will never watch another film directed by rian johnson despite really enjoying looper and being excited for the last jedi when hearing he was directing wow how my expectations were shattered for the sake of subverting expectations let the past die kill it if you have to  congratulations rian johnson and kathleen kennedy you actually did it star wars may never recover from this you have lost the adoration and trust of over 50 of the diehard star wars fans of all ages as clear to see in the audience score here the solo box office numbers and the dvdbluray sales for the last jedi
Jun 14 2018,positive,i love this film so much
Jun 14 2018,positive,beautiful and outstanding
Jun 14 2018,positive,rian johnson has accomplished what i believed was a near impossible feat the last jedi is one of my top 3 favourite star wars films in fact i rank the last jedi as being second only to star wars return of the jedi as my favourite star wars film yes i prefer the last jedi to the empire strikes back and star wars a new hope    i understand if you are shocked by this statement still it is just my opinion no star wars film has emotionally impacted me this much since i watched return of the jedi for the first time as a child this became apparent to me during my second viewing of the film as i said i needed a second viewing because i was somewhat in shock after my first experience with the last jedi    truly the last jedi is a ballsy unique film which in a great way left me stunned indeed on my first viewing my mouth was agape during certain moments in the last jedi some of the moments in this film rank amongst the best of the star wars franchise i appreciated those shocking moments and the emotional moments of this film so much more during my second viewing    you better believe that they are plentiful in the last jedi still if a film does not have great acting from its cast it will fail in its emotional moments thankfully this is not the case with the last jedi the performances are immaculate indeed i would argue that no star wars film has ever had the quality of acting that is on show in the last jedi
Jun 14 2018,positive,for me this is just behind empire as my favorite star wars film
Jun 14 2018,positive,terrific sequel to the force awakens
Jun 14 2018,positive,one of the best films of all time
Jun 14 2018,positive,a great movie that has many amazing themes
Jun 14 2018,positive,5 out of 5 stars i cant wait for episode ix
Jun 14 2018,positive,at this point ive probably seen this film 15 times i just cant believe how good it is it doesnt really follow a three act structure theres an amazing action sequence to start the film and 34 shocking moments scattered throughout the movie i dont want to spoil too much but we get big answers about reys past and what caused kylo to turn that moment has left both student and teacher damaged theres just so much to love here
Jun 14 2018,positive,theres a lot to love about the last jedi its just an all around fantastic thrill ride the humor action and performance are terrific
Jun 14 2018,positive,i want my own porg
Jun 14 2018,negative,i am a longtime sw super fan i saw new hope 5 times look all the fan backlash is real and good reasons we fans want the canon resp cted we want zero sjw and political vi ws kept out of our yes our franchise this was a terribly made movie  on so many levels its just awful i avoided solo to help send a message stop screwing with the franchise 
Jun 14 2018,positive,a perfect star wars film
Jun 14 2018,positive,i saw a youtube video about people leaving good reviews for the last jedi so i went ahead and created on myself why would someone care about someone liking a movie why would someone care about other people like a hit movie that most people like very strange the last jedi is great
Jun 14 2018,positive,one of the best films in star wars history kudos to lucasfilm for green lighting this epic 55
Jun 14 2018,positive,the last jedi is near perfect film the plot is expertly crafted and there a plenty of twists and turns this is the way movies are supposed to be full of thrills and surprises hat tip to rian johnson for giving us something new and exciting
Jun 14 2018,positive,a movie that asks a lot of big questions and has a lot of satisfying answers
Jun 14 2018,positive,i have so many emotions watching this film its just pure gold

Jun 14 2018,positive,i just love this film so much
Jun 14 2018,positive,no one is perfect even our heroes fail but how do they face that failure great stuff

Jun 14 2018,positive,rian johnson created a masterpiece
Jun 14 2018,positive,great film ignore the haters
Jun 14 2018,negative,i feel betrayed as a fan of what they did to the character luke skywalker i do not recommend this movie to anyone
Jun 14 2018,negative,this movie was a big let down  so much wasted potential
Jun 14 2018,negative,we all understand what he was trying to do with this filmi get it i love beautiful artistic films and i really think that this one wasnt thought through in the process of trying to create something different they destroyed luke skywalker and insulted all the fans of luke in the process yoda was a fake version of himself insulting people who actually read i understand why some people think it is great just because it subverts your expectations but it tries to hard and as a result none of the characters deserve our sympathy or empathy they dont deserve anything because none of them are likable
Jun 14 2018,negative,very disappointed had so much hope from tfa and the delivery was lackluster at best
Jun 14 2018,negative,star worst worst star wars film ever and one of the worst films ever story sacrificed to heavyhandedly introduce agendas and to set up visuals meant to trick nonthinking audience to like it at least the prequels had a coherent story this story made no sense and totally contradicts the previous films setup and now lucasfilm getting bots to raise the rating of this travesty of a film id give this a negative star if i could it was that bad disney cancel rians new trilogy unless you really want to lose money
Jun 14 2018,negative,this was crap movie from the beginning i love star wars i was there from the very beginning with the ot what disney did to this movie is atrocious sjw propaganda all over the place poorly written characters with no depth mary sue female lead timothy zahn wrote a better trilogy
Jun 14 2018,negative,a garbagetier film rian johnson ruins beloved characters to subvert expectations while adding nothing but a ham fisted preachy disjointed trainwreck an unfettered disaster that has ruined the star wars universe    and this latest smear campaign painting disgruntled fans as racist sexist bigoted etc is a shameful desperate attempt to fool the public at large into thinking only old white men are hating on these films well disneylucasfilm people of all walks of life see through your lies they see through your latest shill campaign to pump up this mess of a film and they will no longer stand for it you are hemoraging customers left and right you have lost myself and my family forever we will never pay for another product you deficate out and try to jam down the throats of people who just wanted quality where you give them nothing but condescending tripe     it is only going to get worse for you this has only begun
Jun 14 2018,negative,this movie made me not care about star wars  the movie summed up in one scene  luke throwing away his light saber after rey hands it to him
Jun 14 2018,negative,lot of plot holes and that overpowered not trained padawan i guess  marey sue
Jun 14 2018,negative,what a pile of shiti  was 5 when i saw a new hope and since then i have been a star wars fanim now 46 and i cant believe what rian johnson has donethe force awakens was ok and it left alot of questions unanswered ready for episode 8especially when luke appears at the endi had a lump in my throattook me back to when i was a kidso i was excited to see the last jedibut rian johnson did not follow anything the jj had set up for in the force awakenshe completely did his own thing and fucked the story upno one wants to see luke drinking green tit milk from a space cowray is a mary sueno proper training at all and she  can beat luke in stick fightfuck offleia is now mary fuckin poppins lolcanta bitewhat a fucking waste of film timesnoke more powerful than the emperor and vader yet kylo ren can kill him like thatfuck offdisney or should i say kathleen kennedy has taken the best franchise ever and flushed it down the toiletno one wants politics in star wars its an escape from the real worlddont need to put your sjw agenda shit in ityou have killed off the best characters and no one gives a shit about the new onesavoid this film at all costsworst star wars film ever
Jun 14 2018,negative,worst star wars movie i have ever seen a complete let down and i have been a fan since day one  i left with fifteen minutes left and refuse for the first time in my life to watch the rest of that garbage or anything else they make until johnson and kennedy are gone i was literally so annoyed and angry by the time that i made it to that point in the movie that i looked at my friends as we were all fuming and asked are we actually going to do it and they all said lets go and we did along with many others that left the theater before us and some joined us on the way out the door how in the world did they actually consider that a star wars movie the slowest space chase in history with a goofy space casino no jedi training the emperor 20 is killed in one second by safe space emo boy and mary poppins leaves disney to join lucasfilm no im done
Jun 14 2018,negative,this is easily the worst stsr wars movie ever  they injected sjw feminist agenda into  it destroyed everything we loved about luke destroyed star wars as we know it none of the story arcs set up by the force awakens were remotely paid off  actually subverted which now makes the force awakens unwatchable  this trilogy now has nothing to look forward to for 9 which i wont see until they get rid of kathleen kennedy  rian johnson  kiri hart pablo hidalgo i wont give disney aboutget penny  a nd ive givenucasfilm thousands as luke skywalker and ben kenobi were my favorite heroes since childhood rian johnson am indie film director was allowed to direct one of the largestabd breasy cinematic ops in history and he did exactly whatyou might think an indie film director would do to this size a movie he burned the whole series to the ground awful  dont even sneak in and waste your time  its hurtful to your soul what he did to luke
Jun 14 2018,negative,how progressive of disney to hire a director who has been recently lobotomized to bad the film turned out so putrid it truly sickens me
Jun 14 2018,negative,ok since i did not put my review yet and i see some people blindly upvoting this piece of thrash  in what seems like an attempt to save this movies reputation here it is what are the elements of a good movie a great storyline one that makes you constantly wonder what will happen next a story that you dont want to tell your friends abou before they see the movie because you dont want to spoil the exitement the last jedi has none of thatit is inconsistent with the previous movie full of plot holes and pointless long scenes that brings nothing to the main story also there is the obvious sjw agenda forced down your throat shallow uninteresting stupid characters that fills the checklist  strong women  check ethnic diversity  check stupid men  check cheap cheesy jokes that even my kids do not find funny  check get rid of the characters that fan love and make sure they dont steal the show from the new ones  check   lets wrap it up the last jedi is the worst starwars movie ever made rian johnson should not be allowed to touch anything from this franchise ever again the solo movie is suffering from rian johnsons crap and so will all future starwars movies if disney dont fire him  if you want to keep good memories of starwars and havent seen the last jedi yetfor gods sake dont watch it it cant be unwatched afterwards and it will kill your interest in the franchise
Jun 14 2018,negative,i would give this movie negative stars if i could from the opening tone deaf scene of awkward comedy shoehorned into a dramatic intro to the schizophrenic narrative full of blandunrelatable characters the last jedi is not only a bad star wars movie but its a bad movie i could go on paragraphs but this movie doesnt deserve my time
Jun 14 2018,positive,without a doubt the best written star wars film ever created
Jun 14 2018,positive,best movie ever i love the porgs and the special effect ive watched this at least 20 times love rey
Jun 14 2018,positive,one of the best star wars films of all time
Jun 14 2018,negative,this is like watching pop team epic but someone inserted dry and bad jokes plot is like diarrhoea mess that has no sensenice going thanks for destroying this fantastic franchise
Jun 14 2018,negative,to the 5 star posters you are not just losing the cultural war you have lost it literally lost the plot and jumped the shark opie knows hillary is gone its time to stop dragging that poor dead soy donkey through the streets of media youre just not smart enough to pull it off comedy has now replaced your agenda and the fandom menace will squeeze soyless tears of laughter from it come over to the enlightened side there is always room even if an elephant resides in it
Jun 14 2018,negative,a completely disjointed story that does not fit within the ethos of what the previous star wars films created  the plot holes are too significant to make any portion of the film enjoyable  the character development is lazy and nonsensical  a terrible film that was seen once and will not be viewed again
Jun 14 2018,negative,it was like watching an epic ww2 movie lots of action and in the end it ends as and this is bob bob fought in ww2 and now he flip burguers lets watch the amazing bob flipping burguers the first 6 movies was the ww2 epic part last jedi was a scene that bob drops the burguer on the floor
Jun 14 2018,positive,a great film so many of these reviews have sexist terms like mary sue and then claim theyre not sexist it looks like an endless rant of uptight old white men its just gross
Jun 14 2018,positive,a fantastic good time
Jun 14 2018,negative,this film will only become more reviled more as it ages  i gave the film 1 star for competent cinematographyestablishing shots and mark hamill turning in a respectable acting performance in spite of fundamentally disagreeing with his character treatment      simply put this film delivered an extremely story with dead end subplots canto bight disregarded previously established character tenets in order to tell its story and retroactively tainted episodes 46 with its treatment of luke      i do not know what possessed rian johnson to write luke the man who was able to turn the far more convincingly evil dark vader back to the light to attempt to kill his nephew in his sleep simply because he was being tempted by the dark side      luke was able to turn vader a known tyrant known jedi killer and right hand of the emperor who for decades who subjugated and destroyed entire worlds but he felt the temptation to kill ben solo in his sleep  a teenage ben solo who wasnt even yet committed to the dark side      lukes dealings with vader should have made him more confident when faced with the dark side not less so as rian johnson illogically seemed to conclude        the last jedi story fails on virtually every level of storytelling and the way it taints the legacy of luke skywalker and the promise of the original trilogy is simply unforgivable     this film wasnt fun it abused and misused bathos blatantly and it mistreated and mischaracterized luke skywaker  theres a reason this film had such a negative audience reaction returned only 61 of the force awakens box office tally and subsequently sunk solo  the reason is because it was a fundamentally bad movie
Jun 14 2018,positive,besides empire the last jedi is my favorite star wars film this chapter adds a lot to the star wars lore
Jun 14 2018,positive,terrifically performed directed and written bravo
Jun 14 2018,positive,a sensational achievement in film
Jun 14 2018,positive,easily the best star wars film in decades so rich great storytelling an action film that requires a brain what a concept
Jun 14 2018,negative,this is by far the worst star wars movie ever i dont even want to call it a star wars movie complete garbage i didnt care for these new characters in tfa but in tlj it has gotten so much worse it is not even funny i will never pay money to see another disney star wars movie ever
Jun 14 2018,neutral,fire kathleen kennedy pls im not racistmysoginstictransphobe btw
Jun 14 2018,negative,lol why are they posting fake 5 star reviews the fans have spoken rian johnsons antisequel and troll film is trash
Jun 14 2018,negative,what an absolute waste of time this could be the final nail in the coffin for the sw franchise
Jun 14 2018,negative,wow such amazing visuals such terrible writing rian johnson can film it but he cant create a good story all the great set ups from force awakens were wasted and all the characters were so week fin and rose could of been good but a real missed opportunity and why destroy the past only bad people burn books and hide the past so makes sense with kylo but not yoda the past had some good lessons to learn from   how anyone can give this film a 5star is very strange
Jun 14 2018,negative,disney cant ever be trusted disney is satanic af throughout the decades disney is notorious for disguising indoctrination as entertainment and purveying racial stereotypes overtly and covertly making nonwhites the subject of ridicule long story short  they set up the actress playing rose to fail because they dont think enough of ppl of color anyway then project what they did on the fans its so condescending on the part of liberal minded sjws to think being nonwhite or being female is a social handicap ppl like rj deal with their own covert racist guilt by patting us on the head and overcompensate by writing in useless parts for minorities to play because he thinks he helping us out it all plays into the satanic divide and conquer nwo agenda anyways
Jun 14 2018,negative,i want to start this review by stating first and foremost that i am huge movie fan im also a huge fan of star wars  or at least i used to be   unfortunately the last jedi is by far the worst star wars movie made to date there are many reasons for this from lacklustre story writing plot holes unbelievable characters with near nonexistent character arcs to being dismissive of the former star wars stories and flat out disrespectful to the original characters and ideas  the last jedi is a bland forgettable badly paced disaster and has as much imagination and creativity as the first sequel the force awakens  star wars fans  or even just plain old movie fans  want a clever well thought out story with emotional highs and lows and with believable characters that we can root for  is that too much to ask  and just to make it clear my negative review of tlj does not make me a sexist a misogynist a racist anti lgbt or any of the other pejoratives which disneylucasfilm have used to try and deflect the deluge of genuine criticisms that have been directed at their awful sequels by thousands upon thousands of concerned and disappointed star wars fans
Jun 14 2018,negative,lucasfilm and disney are in temper tantrum mode now  everything theyre doing is dragging them further down  how funny is that
Jun 14 2018,negative,we are witnessing the most embarassing psychological meltdown and public relation suicide of lucasfilm kindly assisted by disney shills everywhere  you are falling apart please all of you get a good therapist and maybe also a better pr
Jun 14 2018,negative,some pretty visuals but the rest is just horrifying can best be used to get kids to behave by threatening them with having to see this movie
Jun 14 2018,negative,do not ever want to see this kind of shitmovie again
Jun 14 2018,negative,we are witnessing the most embarassing psychological meltdown and public relation suicide of lucasfilm kindly assisted by disney shills everywhere  please all of you get a good therapist and maybe also a better pr  if you continue doubling down youll going to losa also the minority of fans who still want to go watching episode 9
Jun 14 2018,negative,appears to have been written by an amateur a complete mess of a film characters are one dimensional and annoying the humour is completely out of place and jarring very childish difficult to even sit through once
Jun 14 2018,negative,this movie is hot garbage if you like the original trilogy or even the prequels this is not for you not only is the comedy so out of place there is clearly a lack of direction with this movie sure the actors do the best they can but sadly rian johnson and kathleen kennedy have made this franchise unwatchable    now it is up to jj to fix this with the next installment and i dont know if he can everything he set up with the force awakens has been pushed aside and if he tries to tie up those loose ends now it will feel forced because this move tried its best to make sure you know it doesnt matter    all i can say is that the future of star wars does not look bright not only is the storytelling really bland but the characters themselves are equally as bland its fairly obvious after watching this movie why their toys are having trouble flying off the shelves my advise is to the studio is for them to get a better creative that can actually plan these movies in advance
Jun 14 2018,negative,its definitely the worst star wars film i couldnt even finish it in one sitting if it was an indie movie i wouldve rated it higher but this is supposed to be an entry to the star wars saga yet it spits in the face of everything that came before it  like it wants to be its own thing but it wants to benefit from having the star wars franchise audience
Jun 14 2018,negative,if you love star was you will want to skip this one  finally watched it to see what all the drama is about wish i didnt
Jun 14 2018,negative,rian mangina johnson should never be allowed to come near to a camera again
Jun 13 2018,negative,ruined the franchise
Jun 13 2018,negative,the completely fake 5star reviews that appeared all of a sudden only confirm that rian johnson is a sore loser  he conceived the fake twitter harassment of kelly marie tran and probably convinced or coerced her into participating to this abominous hoax and now he is paying lots of people probably child slaves for flooding this site with fake positive reviews  shame on you rian you really have a typical inferiority complex get a life and stop making movies you are not good at it
Jun 13 2018,negative,after butthurt leftist colbert made that sketch equating star wars fans to rightwing nerds the most stupidest people of the world aka the american leftists whose butt still hurts after hillarys defeat have started this evidently coordinated effort to bring tlj score up again  you poor things should consider 2 facts    1 a lot of star wars fans are not right wing supporters maybe the vast majority of them are not most of them hate trump and did not vote for him  2 you are defending a movie made by the most capitalist whiteenslaving chauvinist bigot company in america disney and by a failed social justice warrior director and a feminazi producer    if you fail to understand this 2 absolute truths you will continue to fight for the people you actually hate most  and this demonstrates how stupid you are    moreover this abrupt rise of 5star reviews only demonstrates that it is you who manipulate the score not any hypothetical altright group you should be ashamed
Jun 13 2018,negative,i see rotten tomatoes is perfectly okay with fake giving this movie inflated scores cmon five star in a row from 14 fake accounts as a coordinated effort those moronic sjws are not even trying hard enough to enforce their point of view on the reasonable ones this movie sucks from all possible angles and so does the disease called political correctness that has been steadily feeding of star wars for the last 3 years by the way i established a second account to prove how worthless are all the unsubstantiated all 5star scores are finally a star wars film with a brain  who tf with a reasonable mind writes such a travesty dont let the disease spread by ruin johnson kill star wars if they can overstate the value of this movie and claim to have a moral highground so can we
Jun 13 2018,negative,dear rian johnson please stop writing hundreds of 5star reviews we all know its you kathleen kennedy has already lost her throne at lucasfilm and you will never make the trilogy she promised you all mankind and womankind too would not be able to survive another abomination like the last jedi
Jun 13 2018,negative,this movie has killed the whole beloved franchise whats worse it it is plain to see with all these recent 5 star reviews that they have also corrupted the real audience scores further religating the real fans opinions to mean nothing while they try and prop up thier bottom line with more lies and bullshit all of this is un acceptablethey ruin things and then lie to us all and turn on the people that always supported themwhen bands get invited to the rock and roll hall of famethe number one thing they say is we could not have done this without our loyal fansso i give a 1 star because they have taken the name and produce an infirior product that is truly not even close to what it was intended to bei only wish this site actually counted all the half and no star reviewsstar wars is dead
Jun 13 2018,negative,complete and utter trash one of the worst movies i have seen and by light years the worst star wars movie

Jun 13 2018,negative,nice music nice effects awful story
Jun 13 2018,positive,i dont quite understand why nerds bash this one as if its the worst sw movies ever made its notsome of the prequels easily win that ignominy  and lets face it if you view the first 3 every movie after it is based on some central light vs dark and miniplots of ancillary characters whether its han solos adventures in the first two or finn  rose in this one formulaic yeah but we still enjoy it  this one brought it home for me since its the last we will see of lea and luke triumphantly sign off  peace out sad  whats more interesting now is how the new generation will pick up the legacy and keep us excited

Jun 13 2018,negative,made an account just to give it one star i enjoyed the film when i first saw it but things have finally sunk in worst star wars film ever thanks disney
Jun 13 2018,negative,i watched every star wars movie and like it  not this one  men are all stupid the story doesnt matter  the physics of the force have completely changed  all the female characters are pretty perfect never need to learn everything just comes to them  exactly the opposite of what i want to teach my daughter i was excited to see rae fail and learn and take time to become a jedi from hard work and determination like in every single other book movie tv show or video game ever   what do young boys learn that no matter what they are never smarter then a woman look i am really happy that woman are taking a huge leading role in films but if your trying to correct the mistakes men made in the past by doing the same in the other direction then you havent learned from our mistakes look woman arent perfect just like men arent perfect if you want equality then be equal that being said this is star wars no  this is not star wars   it should be called something else like the last star fighter girls version  did i mention luke skywalker is the dumbest person in the universe now oh and even though he saved his child murdering father from the dark side he decides to try and murder his nephew because he feels bad vibes when he sleeps
Jun 13 2018,positive,porgs are awesome
Jun 13 2018,positive,the star wars film i always dreamed i would see

Jun 13 2018,negative,only bad star wars movie ever bad jokes and even worse plot just aweful
Jun 13 2018,negative,the only good thing about this movie is the picture how the scenes are visually set up everything else is horrid
Jun 13 2018,negative,i remember walking out of the theater of this move and thinking it was good but sad because spoilers lukes death while driving home i started to realize it had some flaws but still okay by the time i got home i realized it had to many plot holes and flaws and started to hate it so in the span of 20 minutes i went from liking it to hating it it took much longer for that to happen for me with the prequels before someone ask or thinks no my expectations were not too high i saw the movie a month or something after the movie the advertisement didnt pull me in like before and planing it around friends and family schedules meant that the hype and expectations for this movie for me where very low     this movie has some major flaws with its story and bad jokes worst of all is its treatment of luke who in my eyes is the heart and soul of star wars without him its empty void of the hope that star wars had he does so many things outside of his character that you dont even recognize him the story of luke is the story of adulthood from a teenager stuck on a farm too a grown adult rey doesnt have that same connection with me she just is a plot device everything just comes easy to her     this movie is the complete opposite of a star wars film filled with nihilistic and on the nose politics which bores and eye rolls the audience speaking of eye rolls there are so many scenes that make you eye roll with the amount of lack of logic so many scenes with the new characters like rose who is just dumb and make her feel unnecessary for her to be there the vice admiral holdo is the worse so many things could have been avoided if she just tells poe her plan instead of acting all high and mighty i also would have liked to akbar to have replaced her would have been a better scene with the kamikaze scene both snoke and phasma have no reason to exist they offer nothing to the story the gamble world was dumb and felt like fillerwhich i think the most advat fan of this movie doesnt like that plot porgs why do we have porgs    im still only scratching the surface of some major flaws but what are some good things well there isnt a lot for me the effects and the action are very good worth the millions they spent of this moviekylo ren character is that badly done in this one added some good layers throne room battle was really well done uh and um thats about it for me for positive things    if your you turn your brain off or your a new fan aka a kid you might like this movie for its effects and action if your old time fan that watch the older movie since you where a little kid you probably not going to like it the motto of this movie is let the past die kill it if you have to they definitely lived up too that probably going to be the only star wars movie ill never buy     well thats it hope you got the message
Jun 13 2018,negative,visually stunning but the overuse of deus ex machina plot device is distracting the story is incoherent
Jun 13 2018,positive,its just so great i was really worried about this movie living up to the the force awakens but rian johnson wrote an amazing script no wonder jj was jealous that he didnt get to direct it at no point was the film predictable the throne room scene is the best moment in star was history just an amazing sequence there are so many great moments for old fans r2s moment with luke and of course yoda bravo    star wars is in great hands with rian johnson being a creative partner so much love and care went into making this film i highly recommend the documentary about how the film was made were so lucky that this film turned out so well
Jun 13 2018,positive,its insane how great the last jedi is more yoda

Jun 13 2018,positive,10 out 10 daisy ridely delivers an amazing performance again and mark hamill is just amazing in his return as luke skywalker even the new actors like kelly maria tran as rose tico are fantastic rose has the best line of the film near the end love love love this film

Jun 13 2018,negative,i love all the oneliner five star reviews all lined up neatlynothing suspicious about that at allas for the movie all i can say is that abrams has one helluva task ahead of him
Jun 13 2018,positive,it seems that the last jedi thought that it was more important to promote feminism than to make a great movie i dont blame true star wars fans for being disappointed
Jun 13 2018,positive,its astounding that hollywood would allow this kind of bold and free film making im looking forward to more rian johnson films in this universe
Jun 13 2018,negative,i would give this movie 0 stars if they counted it in the rating  this movie completely strays from what star wars has been and what it should be  the plot is horribly designed and only seeks to destroy anything created by previous movies  rian johnson completely ruins what lukes character used to be and what is signifies  rose is completely useless to the plot and is only there to push sw propaganda  the decisions that are made in this movie completely contradict the force and everything star wars  it is a disgrace and should be removed from canon
Jun 13 2018,positive,two thumbs way way up
Jun 13 2018,positive,the last jedi rocked my socks theres so much to cheer about in this movie

Jun 13 2018,negative,rian johnson and kathleen kennedy destroyed star wars with this film what exactly was the point of canto bight the character of luke skywalker was weakened and on top of it all killed rj spent so much time introducing pointless characters and plots more time should of been invested introducing the knights of ren lukes mourning of han and explaining who snoke is oy vey
Jun 13 2018,positive,a real crowd pleaser
Jun 13 2018,positive,i havent met anyone who hates this film a couple people with mixed feelings but most people just love it theres so much joy in this film a
Jun 13 2018,positive,its just so good i was really worried about this film ruining everything set up in the force awakens but this film just nailed it wasnt predictable the throne room scene is the best moment in star was history just an amazing sequence there are so many great moments for old fans r2s moment with luke and of course yoda bravo

Jun 13 2018,positive,the way luke skywalkers character has been treated with so much love and care love it
Jun 13 2018,negative,the worst movie ever made in sw
Jun 13 2018,negative,can you imagine going to see a superman film in which superman refuses to fly because he feels depressed or a batman film where batman does not drive his batmobile because he forgot how to drive  thats how i felt when i saw luke skywalker in this film  the way luke skywalkers character has been treated here is unforgivable  it has ruined the whole star wars story for me  mark hamill the actor deserves an apology from disney  the story the script the unfunny humour this film is a disaster  k kennedy and r johnson should resign  i would not be surprised if the next sw film has pansexuals and romantic stories involving droids  the only way to fix this is to delete the force awakens and the last jedi from the canon  start again and this time have a clear storyline and follow it through until the end  dont make up the story as you go along it doesnt work  crappy film i dont recommend it i ended up missing jar jar binks
Jun 13 2018,negative,the problem with the film is this its not feelgood in any way after watching it you just feel kinda depressed the plot destroys everything that was so likeable about luke skywalker yet another eyerolling case of the film industrys obsession with showing every goodguy becoming bitter  jaded  evil  a failure and thats just the problem  they may be trying to make the point that everyone is human and flawed  a very valid point  but thats not why people go to the cinema to watch star wars they go for a bit of feelgood escapism with their kids and this was just a bit too depressing and felt a bit too political too  in a way that will probably not age well and be seen in retrospect as a bit propagandaish in some ways too solo a film that took itself less seriously was more kidfriendly and less political was much better in my view at least
Jun 13 2018,negative,its hard to leave this a one star review but after renting it and watching it i have to say it is without a doubt the worst star wars movie ever made
Jun 13 2018,positive,a tremendous adventure film i love rey
Jun 13 2018,positive,ill cherish this film forever
Jun 13 2018,positive,in a world full of hate this film sticks out as a shining light of hope

Jun 13 2018,negative,i dont get why it focused on useless characters rose  and made the best characters luke weak it didnt feel very star wars to me
Jun 13 2018,negative,absolutely ruined star wars for me the characters never grow or learn anything in this movie and dont get me started on the sjw garbage being rammed down our throats
Jun 13 2018,negative,a near flawless film full of hope and love
Jun 13 2018,negative,better than citizen kane
Jun 13 2018,negative,this is one of the worst star wars movies to date sadly it destroys all the plotlines set up by the force awakens it feels like a bad star trek episode rather than a star wars movie
Jun 13 2018,positive,best film of the year
Jun 13 2018,positive,this is a perfect family film its a lesson about failure hope and perseverance great script
Jun 13 2018,positive,a cinematic knock out
Jun 13 2018,positive,best star wars film since empire probably better
Jun 13 2018,positive,it is astonishingly difficult for me to discuss how much i love the last jedi i stumbled from the cinema face utterly aching from all the ridiculous expressions i had pulled and mind a haze of images but i was a different person    i say the last jedi is transformative because it transformed me    and that is very very hard to quantify my years and years of critical and analytical training fall by the wayside not because i am incapable of seeing its flaws this isnt turn off your brain entertainment but that whatever else one says about its negative qualtities i could but numbly point to myself as testimony to its power for the first time i felt seen truly seen by another in the medium of fiction i felt reborn the voices of doubt that have haunted me for so long are muted i felt braver than i have in years and more able i felt more at peace i felt balanced    and i appreciate that all of that is very very emphemeral if you arent me and in my head    so here is me trying to explain myself and why i suddenly have a converts burning fervour        star wars as a language    ive always described star wars as a language of icons and symbols that i spoke with near native fluency and this is all still true they are so very much part of our popular mythology1 especially in the quadrants of geekdom which i inhabit that it is impossible not to have them mean things to me leia in her buns with a blaster yoda muttering wisely luke staring out under twin suns all these images mean things to me and of course most of all there is carrie fisher with her iconically sharp wit and her honesty when it comes to discussing her mental health problems over the years2 so for all that i didnt really care for nor do i think ive seen all of the original films i spoke their language i expressed myself in their paradigms and drew strength from the inspiration they provided3    but it wasnt wholly my mythology    until now    the last jedi told me a story using that language i spoke that i had learnt that was almost mother tongue to me but not it looked at me and told me that i was not a foreigner and embraced me as i am it told me a story in that language but the difference was that this is a story that saw me and affirmed me    and theres a lot of power in that    a story about stories and the spark to inspire a revolution    on a basic level the sequel trilogy has become a story about itself turning inwards to reflect how it has inspired a generation of fans luke leia and han have become inhuman icons legends even as luke so bitterly puts it and the new generation of characters have an intense relationship with that legacy and legend be it kylo ren who is crushed by his own ambition and expectations or rey who aspires and dreams and claims those are the stories they grew up on the stories that give succor their souls    the last jedi looks to those legends and seeks to make them human leia is frail complex and a leader worn to bone for all that she holds it desperately together4 and luke he does not wear the mantle of legend lightly he has failed his own nephew and is hiding from the world waiting to die the beacon of hope is heavy thing to carry alone but as the last jedi shows it is not a thing that need be carried alone    the last shot of the film is of an abused slaveboy of canto bight pulling a broom into his hands with the force and looking to the stars for all that he and his friends are oppressed that spark of revolution has ignited and theyre telling the story of luke skywalker the man who has become again myth his story inspires as the resistance is reborn it is impossible to not see in those children our own young selves and future generations of children and to be inspired to fight as they will    it is not easy being a legend to preserve and inspire but it is also necessary in dark times much like that came before and will continue in the months ahead it is stories like these that will keep us in hope do we not tell stories like these to each other of each small victory    the way to defeat the first order with only a laser sword in hand is not through violence itself but through inspiration5 to keep that fiery spit of hope alive    war is but the metaphor through which the story of the resistance is told it is not so much really about xwings and star destroyers the stakes are magnified but the need for hope for inspiration is the same the fight against exploitative governance against fascist rule against opportunistic centrism that all rings painfully true it is the perfect desperate story to close 2017 with    and there is power in that    a resistance of women    for the first time i saw a resistance movement brimming with women and unlike say the amazons of wonder woman there was no contrivanced in universe reason for this beyond this was a resistance this speaks a bonedeep truth that we very rarely see depicted that women have always always fought that women are still today the backbone of the resistance    it was beautiful beyond words to see three women speak one after the other on military matters6 i couldnt believe my eyes when i saw that any other film would have spaced them out with male voices    that women occupied both important and marginal roles in the resistance meant the world to me they hold up more than half the sky    tallie paige tico vice admiral holdo lieutenant connix commander dacy the litany of their names can bring tears to my eyes    i didnt know i had been waiting all my life to see this i didnt know i needed it so much    furthermore whilst there are a lot of stories of sisterhood and motherhood in the realms of womens fiction there are far fewer that deal simply with curt professional respect between women and more than that this isnt a film about female resistance like say suffragette this is simply a film about resistance that acknowledges womens impact    and there is power in that    burning the old order    tearing down old poisonous systems emerges as a core theme in the last jedi luke burns down the sacred tree of the jedi religion rose talks of wanting to put her fist through the glittering world of canto bight and of course kylo ren wants desperately to kill the past    the last jedi holds both the jedi and the empire accountable for past sins but doesnt fall into the trap of suggesting that they are both equally bad it has luke look back and see his own failings as well as poe being taken to task for his flyboy bravado but despite this ability to make human its heroes it condemns half hearted centrism and the smug moral superiority of not choosing a side in the figure of dj the replacement master codebreaker he makes the argument to finn that there is no such thing as good guys and bad guys and tries to pull him down into that grey sludge of a paradigm with him this is the argument all too often mistaken for complexity and nuance the idea that both extremes are somehow equivalent they are not7    i have reys nostalgia for the old world her desire to carry on the torch and preserve ancient texts i know that feeling all too well and i know i needed to hear that some things however much it may hurt to do so need to die i know it even in my own writing where for years ive stalled at endings because i was unwilling to kill off a character or to topple the systems ive so carefully constructed    and for all that there may be overly destructive ways to tear down the past sometimes it does just need to die the last jedi gave me courage to confront this both in fiction and in myself    canto bight and its worldbuilding of the larger conflict in the galaxy shine an important light on the broken systems that exist around them how the nature of the war itself needs to change i am all too familiar with roses desire to just break it all and the fathier herds gloriously destructive romp through the glittering ugliness of the place is immensely cathartic    but rose doesnt lose sight of what matters to save those you love it is the sentiment she utters to finn as she unsaddles the fathier that carried her all this way she echoes it again in what may be the heart of the film to him again after saving his life we need to do more than just destroy our enemies we need to do more than hate    it is a very simple sentiment cloying even but in a year like 2017 where rage and despair have become second nature to me i had desperately needed to hear this it reminded me what should ground me    and there is power in that    a parable about failure    yoda utters one of the central statements of the film that failure is the best teacher and the last jedi is a film about failure perhaps it is just because it is the middle film of trilogy but everyone fails in it gloriously and ingloriously victories are pyrrhic at best all three times i watched it i was left emotionally drained but it is also immensely cathartic    canto bight forms the heart of this meditation on failure the subplot has struck many as pointless because it ends in catastrophic failure but is hugely important to me because it ends in failure we are perhaps too used to the idea that narrative needs to like clockwork in how rigorously engineered it is without loose ends it is the same thinking that makes executive producers want to cut the no mans land sequence in wonder woman  because it doesnt contribute to the larger plot of murdering ares yet much like canto bight that sequence forms the emotional and thematic core of the film when it comes to how the conflict between first order and resistance fits into the larger world how those who not fight can be complicit how the resistance can and should inspire    but more than that canto bight is a subplot where the milliontoone chance doesnt pay off where the mad heroic last stand ends catastrophically not all long shots work out    and the failure isnt softened by glory by heroic beauty this isnt the tragedy of bambis mother or the iron giant this is raw and ugly this is unexpected and difficult    but at the same time failures arent simply things to be expunged from your past not all that ends in failure is itself a mistake the world isnt a logic puzzle one can simply optimise and plot a perfect speedrun of which i know all sounds rather pompous but it is also a critical lesson    and there is power in that    the refocusing of star wars    rian johnsons work has long deconstructed toxic masculinity and a recurring theme is the destructive potential of scared little boys looper in particular comes to mind as does brick and these are themes that recur in popular culture as well from fight club to guardians of the galaxy volii from breaking bad to beauty and the beast we are constantly talking about men and masculinity    but the last jedi does something different than many if not most of these films it refocuses on the characters who arent the tortured men film critic hulk writes very eloquently about this in the force belongs to us which has incidentally led me to the conclusion that the correct response to may the force be with you is the force belongs to us all    the last jedi doesnt simply show the failings caused by toxic masculinity  but it also shows with hope how we can heal especially in kylo ren the film shows the dark path and unflinchingly shows the consequences of his choices his inability to well as this article put it join the team there is a lot more to be said here that sam says better than me so i urge you to among all the other links read his take on kylo ren the last jedi toxic masculinity and showing your place in all this    and if it were just rey and leia and holdo the picture of female heroism in the last jedi would be problematically white but there is also rose    there are few things about rose i can say that havent already been said she truly is the hero we have been waiting for and she is just perfect    and i know many are disappointed about her kiss with finn partly because they ship stormpilot and tbf so do i and partly because many felt it lacked chemistry    but it is the first interracial kiss i can name on the big screen that doesnt involve a white person i know that sounds weirdly specific but it feeds into that refocusing of the narrative away from the assumed defaults of our popular culture it felt momentous in a way i cannot describe    and this all there is power in this all    rey as an imposter    ive left this point last not because it is the least important to me but because it is the hardest to articulate and rather the most personal to me and where above i feel like im echoing points that you will see elsewhere on the web this is likely unique to me    so please permit me a rather personal preamble all my life ive been laying claim to a literature and legacy that is not my own by blood and birth im ethnically chinese and i spent the early years of my life in the colony of hong kong i went to boarding school and for better or for worse i spent my childhood dreaming of king arthur and robin hood of the brontes yorkshire moors and the lake district of arthur ransome    and i wrote a novel bound up in that legacy of northern england and british literature it came out in 2017 and all year those feelings of being an interloper and imposter have been welling up i had a lot of bravado in my youth i would declare that i belonged but now but a debut novel i feel all the more vulnerable than before and my claim feels weaker than ever the question that had been asked again and again of me in my youth why do you care about this comes back to haunt me    and this is what i see in reys story on some metaphorical level her arc felt utterly about me like how the refrain of a good pop song can seem to perfectly fit you and your mood but moreso a thousand times moreso i felt seen and understood    rey has that same bravado i recognise in myself the assumption that she belongs she feels it in her bones and she dreams of it at night she claims the legacy of the jedi as her own asking luke to teach her of the ways of the force    but beneath the island is the dark side and the dark side is a mirror she has operated under the assumption that she must belong that she has claim the details of which she simply doesnt know yet that there is a grand secret to her origins one admittedly that i dont have one that will vindicate her but all she needs and all she has is herself    the fandom speculation in the years building up to this makes all these themes all the more acute that feeling that these are stories that one must inherit that this legacy cannot simply be claimed by those outside of it    but this much the last jedi makes clear reys blood and her birth dont matter she belongs she belongs she belongs    and that to me is everything

Jun 13 2018,positive,a film for the ages it makes some old white men angry online but theyre always angry anyway
Jun 13 2018,positive,a near flawless film full of hope and love
Jun 13 2018,positive,interesting people are bragging faking 1 star reviews its almost like this 46 is meaningless well thats because it is
Jun 13 2018,negative,hate this movie has been made by people full of hate they hate star wars because it is all about family faith courage sacrifice these true values are the ones they despise so they tried to destroy everything we loved in star wars they transformed our heroes into failed human beings the villains into bumbling buffoons the women into alltooperfect mary sues without any need to learn struggle fall and rise again  then they accused us of being mysoginists sexists racists truth is that disney is all of that and even more they are also hypocrites
Jun 13 2018,negative,stephen colbert is an old man with senile dementia im not surprised he really believes that the fan backlash essentially comes from white overweight bald impotent womenhaters the truth is that this movie sucks donkeys ass big time disney is reaching new levels of lameness every day and their desperation is becoming evident  their last weapon of mass distraction in order to avoid admitting solos failure is the fake kelly marie trans drama on twitter you really think we are stupid dont you disney     i read a lot of comments every day and a very few attacked the poor actress the vast majority of the comments say 99 are about the futility superficiality and lameness of rose tico character and every single comment points out that it is rian johnsons fault
Jun 13 2018,negative,i promise that i will stop boycotting disney the exact moment they apologise to the fans and admit they did a colossal mistake by hiring a manbaby with a huge inferiority complex to direct the last jedi cmon disney isnt this movie all about failure just admit yours
Jun 13 2018,neutral,first and foremost i think it was completely disgraceful how they treated beloved characters that made the franchise what it is and has been as for the new characters that were completely over pushed i found they were distasteful and poorly written i also believe everything that jj abrams planted in episode 7 was completely ruined and disrespected leaving episode 9 with not much to look forward to with all that aside i thought the last jedi holds some of the most entertaining scenes in the franchise to me the most gripping aspect of the movie was kylo and reys connection and is the only thing im looking forward to in episode 9 in my opinion reylo babies is the best and only thing i can hope for the future of star wars 
Jun 13 2018,negative,i went in with low expectations and still managed to be disappointed im a woman a longtime ot and pt fan someone who loves diversity and strong women in films and even i agree that the diversity sw is pushing has come at the cost of plot and character development throwing in dozens of new characters without fleshing any of them out enough for the audience to grow attached to them or care about them at all all while killing off the original characters that we have come to love so much    get a grip disney manbabies arent the only people complaining about the complete mockery youve made of a beloved franchise and its  characters start listening to your fans before its too late
Jun 13 2018,negative,rose isnt going to smash the patriarchy shes going to eat it
Jun 13 2018,negative,at best you can say they tried hard to make this an atypical star wars movie  well i guess on that criterion they succeeded    the problem is stories like star wars have established lore that audiences expect to be followed  by all means add twists whod have thought darth would be lukes father but throwing the lore out the window to be edgy is just poor storytelling  this is exactly why alien 3 failed  this movie would have been better if it did not have any established characters in it at all  for example set 100 years in the past or the future  it might have worked on a certain level  but as it stands this movie can only be seen as an abject failure  unfortunately its probably set the 9th movie up to fail because the narrative train has already left the station  this movie also says a lot about movie reviewers and rt itself if it can get rave reviews  it says a hell of a lot and none of it is good
Jun 13 2018,negative,slow and corny with strange twist style humor inserted regularly at the most unlikely and unwanted opportunities will make fans want to vomit but may leave the average movie goer chuckling about as much as an 80s buddy comedy easily the most disappointing and poorly written of all star wars including including flawed phantom menace remember young aniken midiclorians and jar jar binks acting is good all round casting very below par for visuals music and effects it is a 510 for story and dialogue charactersetvehicle design its a 210 so split the difference for total score 310 it made me walk out of the cinema feeling hopeless and depressed i can really understand the people that cried it was so disappointing and i have had other reboots and sequels of my favorite franchises terminator predator robocop ghostbusters to name a few be really terrible but this it would have been so easy to write a cool and satisfying installment but rian johnson had to have his own weird humor every 5 minutes or so usually during drama seemingly just to entertain himself there was so many inconsistencies mistakes and missed opportunities i honestly think rian johnson and kathleen kennedy will end up costing disney over 3 billion when you count the short fall of this movie the massive amounts the soloboycott lost due to fan hatred of this movie and the episode9boycott episodeixboycott in 2019 still to come
Jun 13 2018,negative,kathleen kennedy and rian johnson should refund disney for all the losses they caused
Jun 12 2018,negative,great visuals  terrible story writing
Jun 12 2018,negative,lets give disney a lesson you can pay thousands of shills to insert hundreds of fake 5star reviews but    1 this campaign will cost you a lot and will obtain nothing tlj score vill sink anyway  2 your paid shills will stop their dirty job the exact moment youll stop paying them we will never stop we want tlj to reach 10    ill start inserting at least ten 1star reviews a day forever
Jun 12 2018,negative,rose crashing into finn was amazingly bad how did disney not see all the flaws in this script dozens of story plot holes how why did this happen to star wars movie looked good visually although story was a mess   i actually cried after seeing it star wars has been ruined
Jun 12 2018,negative,just how bad was the last jedi well that depends on which part youre talking about they nailed the iconic opening scene where the bright yellow letters announce the title scroll up and disappear everything after that was utter drivel i dont use that word lightly you would be better off watching a play written and directed by 4 year olds you know the kind that children put on for their parents to watch at least then you couldve saved your money from the your mama joke that poe drops on general hux all the way to luke force projecting himself into a battle and then dying the movie was a complete face palm how do you mess up a star wars its a softball tossed over the middle of the plate heck even a schmuck like myself couldve written and directed a better movie there are literally too many bad moments to mention so ive decided to intentionally limit this review seriously i could write a two thousand word treatise on how deplorable this movie really was but whats the point when i saw it in the theater i audibly said youve got to be kidding me several times jar jar binks has nothing on the last jedi and i mean that sincerely rotten tomatoes has a policy where they dont count  12 star reviews because that makes sense  no matter growing up i was taught to be honest and if my vote doesnt count so be it my conscience is clean please friend i beg you dont see the last jedi or any other new star wars for that matter let the franchise die a natural death to prolong its existence would just be cruel
Jun 12 2018,negative,this movie is a prom night dumpster baby 010 stars
Jun 12 2018,neutral,are you joking you spent 4 billion on a franchise and you forgot that you actually need to write a story that makes sense that flows   strong women  it takes experience to be strong this simply does not just occur to be amazing at something takes effort even if you have talent failing is part of life we gave you the benefit of the doubt with the force awakens but sorry your done    there will be no more of my money for this crap i am astounded that rian johnson still thinks he is wrote a great story    you guys need a counselling session or two you will definitely need it but the time you release episode 9    get some perspective
Jun 12 2018,negative,this movie seemed like it was written and directed by someone who hates star wars  there are so many parts where it feels like a middle finger to fans of the franchise  so many bad choices a story line that goes absolutely nowhere a main plot with holes so big you can fly a star destroyer through them  i am truly disappointed and i no longer look forward to more star wars movies
Jun 12 2018,positive,if these new trilogy movies show us anything its that the chosen one hero isnt the solution in the original trilogy the rebel alliance wins through lukes personal victory in defeating the emperor and turning his father back to the light side and through leias leadership in destroying two death stars    however their victory is shortlived luke tries to reform the original jedi order and fails the new republic is fraught with dishonesty and bickering forcing leia to form the resistance in secret and witness her democratic republic literally crumble into space dust    instead the last jedi shows us that true heroes arent just one person chosen to hold the power or prestige to succeed but are made up of a group of people its people like rose tico who represent the hundreds with the resistance that have a real stake in fighting the first order and its people like finn and rey who have only glimpsed at a world bigger than themselves and are willing to fight to keep it and find their place in it
Jun 12 2018,positive,this is going to be a bit different than the usual post i write  typically i seek to connect the things we love with the god who loves us    the last jedi had a lot of deeper meanings and truths in it and in the future i will write about how this movie has faith and scriptural connections  however now my intention is to share why i love the last jedi and why i think it is such a great star wars movie     i loved it so much that it just might be my favorite of all the star wars movies  i am not alone in this opinion but there are also a lot of people who feel the opposite  one of the tendencies of the internet is that the negative tends to be emphasized and amplified  i have deep feelings about the last jedi and i want to add my voice to the conversation in a positive way so here are all the reasons why i absolutely adore the last jedi      if the last jedi is to be my favorite star wars it will be bumping the empire strikes back off the top spot   i appreciate that both movies share a similar story telling device  both movies essentially tell different stories that weave together in the end   empire strikes back has the story of han and leia as well as the training of luke   the last jedi ambitiously tells the stories of rey poe and finn  i found all three stories to be equally compelling      the biggest of the stories being told is reys story   i love what they did with luke  luke has always had an interesting mixture of heroism cockiness and pessimism  it was a surprising turn to see a defeated luke that had the pessimistic streak win out   luke was not the symbol of hope that everyone wanted him to be because he was defeated and he was resigned to defeat   watching luke struggle with that and then face his demons by confronting his biggest regret was powerful storytelling  i was absolutely in awe with lukes story ending with the sunset  this clearly called back the famous binary sunset scene from a new hope  these two scenes create footing bookends to the character of luke skywalker and it truly does feel like he fades away at peace       the interaction between rey and kylo ren is also incredible  they are opposite sides of the same coin dark and light rising to meet it  this gives them an undeniable bond and attraction while forcing them apart these scenes were portrayed very well  the attraction and repulsion between the two characters was tangible  the scenes with snoke were some of the best in any star wars movie  i am fairly sure that i audibly gasped when he was killed  i know that this is one of the points of contention with the movie but i am fine with it  snoke was never the big bad of this trilogy  it is kylo ren and in this movie he claims his place  it was unexpected and it worked well because it turned the standard plot conventions on their head  it made watching the movie extremely exciting because i had no idea what was going to happen  would kylo ren turn and join rey or would rey join kylo ren  after snoke was cut in half it all seemed possible  when i took my son to see the movie he said no rey when kylo ren made his join me offer  i was with him  i do not think any movie has ever had me on the edge of the seat in anticipation of what was going to happen next like the last jedi did in that moment      i also really enjoyed the story arc with poe  poe was one of my favorite characters from the force awakens and i have been faithfully reading the monthly comic book series that features the character  poe the hotshot hero had to learn a tough lesson in leadership  the way this played out was masterful storytelling  vice admiral holdo was a fascinating character  the movie immediately sets her as a foil against poe and it naturally has the audience on the side of poe  however holdo is not a villain  in fact she is far from it  the character is only ever portrayed as a paragon of resistance virtue  there is a lot of criticism about holdos bad leadership of not telling poe the plan  but why would she  poe especially after being demoted was not a member of senior command   the mission plan did not concern him  poes orders were to wait at his post and like most of the crew on the ship that is what he was supposed to do  however he can not do that  he can not be part of a team he is driven to be the hero he formulates his own plan and does not tell holdo  poe essentially does the same thing that the audience is mad at holdo for but the audience gives him a pass holdo has valid reasons not to tell poe but poe is just being a hotheaded hero  this is why the storytelling is so brilliant  the audience fails right along with poe      the final story arc in the last jedi might be my favorite and that is finns arc  at the end of the force awakens finn is left unresolved  he helped bring down starkiller base but he is not a hero  his motivations were still mostly selfish   at the beginning of the last jedi he is still being selfish and cowardly   finn is shown extremes   he experiences the desperate plight of doomed rebels and then at the casino  he sees what blissful ignorance looks like   rose shows him what it looks like to live for a cause and dj shows him what it looks like to life only for ones self  the source of finns selfishness is fear  he confronts this fear in his fight for phasma and then he chooses his side as rebel scum   at the end  he becomes a true hero as he learns it is about saving what we love  by the end of the last jedi finn has changed a lot from the scared stormtrooper he was at the start of the force awakens        the reason why i loved the last jedi is because all of these wonderful characters grew dramatically throughout the movie  i especially liked that what caused them all to grow was learning from or confronting failure  this was one of the great moral of the last jedi and the filmmakers had yoda state this just in case it was missed       the last jedi brilliantly continued the force awakens  it did so in a way that left the principle characters more mature and sets the stage for episode ix  for the majority of my life i have loved the star wars universe   however it is the characters not the universe that makes the movies  i love the last jedi because it puts the characters in the forefront and i get to join them on a difficult journey of personal growth throughout the movie   the movie is a compelling journey to a galaxy far far away and it is a worthy addition to the growing star wars canon

Jun 12 2018,negative,i loved the force awakens  i remember talking to my friend as we gushed over what we considered a homage to the original trilogy and a future rife with plot hooks that could enrich the star wars universe   rain johnsons abomination of a film not only screwed any future movies but went back and ruined everything tfa offered
Jun 12 2018,negative,they dont count half a star put one star for them to count the ratingthe people putting 5 star scores are bots or people working for disney because there is no way these many 5 stars would be popping up all of a sudden with in a couple of days ive been checking these reviews for months with most of the ratings below 3 stars now for the review there are so many things wrong with this movie like how they handled luke skywalker  and killed him off for no reason how rey all of a sudden knows everything to know about the force within a day of training and lifting some boulders its just so badly written that a drunk 5 year old could write a better story  it was so bad that i made an account just so i can rate how horribly bad of a movie this was
Jun 12 2018,positive,a beacon of hope in a sad world thanks to lucasfilm for giving us this jewel

Jun 12 2018,positive,a near perfect film better than we deserve
Jun 12 2018,positive,the whole set up with luke was great it wasnt what most people were expecting but it worked so well lukes arc really pays off in the end
Jun 12 2018,positive,there are so many things i like in tlj for so many reasons from the big turns of events to the small little moments    and one small little moment is when luke is teaching rey about the force by letting her reach out and feel her surroundings it eventually leads to a force its the force but because she narrates what she feels as she goes she says a force i imagine just the millisecond before it dawns on her ahh of course the force    and its so perfect because they went with a force we really get to discover the force with rey if she said the force it wouldnt give the same sense of discovery it would feel more casual like yup and the force between it all    its such a beautiful moment and i love that rian  co paid such attention to little subtle details like that
Jun 12 2018,positive,1010 its just that good i cant wait to see what jj does next

Jun 12 2018,positive,i am going to make my best attempt to break down the film    i think the last jedi more so than any other film in the series relies on parallel themes first the theme of legends and how holding someone or yourself at a high standard only leads to disappointment and failure    kylo with luke  poe with holdo  rose with finn    or surpassing you former idol  we are what they grow beyond as yoda said  finn with phasma  kylo with snoke    the luke complaints in my opinion are unrealistic do you think a human being is incapable of making a mistake like luke did the whole point of the film is that no one even a legend is incapable of mistakes someone as great as obi wan did with anakin not a huge stretch of the imagination to me    there have been a lot of complaints about snoke as well he gets no more or less a back story than palpatine in return of the jedi he is a victim of his own arrogance kylo who couldnt win a fight with snoke one on one defeats him the only way he can by exploiting a character flaw he thought he was so powerful and knew kylo so well he underestimated him because snoke believed his own myth he closed his eyes and looked into kylos mind but couldnt see what was happening right in front of him    poe was so disappointed and distrusting of holdo he refused to hear her reasoning before calling her a traitor and committing mutiny because she was famous and he held her to an unrealistic standard    finns ambivalence to the cause is reflected through his willingness to run away at the beginning in the escape pod scene rose as a result feels betrayed by her legend image of the finn the hard truths of the moral ambivalence of canto bight and djs betrayal lead into finns defeat of phasma and embrace of the name rebel scum these the beginnings of his embrace of the rebel cause ending with his willingness to sacrifice his life to save everyone    the next is destroying the past and moving forward    kylos mask  reys parents  the jedi tree  anakins lightsaber    kylo destroys his mask to move away from vader idolotry and become his own person    rey thought her parents identity would give her meaning or the fans thought being a skywalker would give her a place in the saga    the destruction of the tree is a symbol of the end of the old jedi order and a move away from the religious aspects of the black and white jedi vs sith as luke says why should a religion take ownership of something as universal as the force    the final scene between kylo and luke is an act of pacifism he has no intention of killing kylo like obi wan in a new hope he sacrifices his life against a failed apprentice to save the others and the last jedi    the two suns arent merely a call back but an emotional parrallel in a new hope he was a farm boy ready for something greater and now he is a jedi master in the same place he was then ready for something greater luminous beings are we not this crude matter    i wrote this in a past post but i dont think anyone payed attention a detail i caught at the beginning of the film is when rey hands luke the lightsaber hes wearing white robes luke then returns to his hut then puts them up in a box we do not see him wearing this until near the end it seems he was ready to die at the beginning of the film and rey interrupted him
Jun 12 2018,positive,there are a lot of small moments in the film that will be great for future viewings when leia goes back to the ship theres a bit of foreshadowing of the supremacys future fate the attention to detail in the last jedi is amazing
Jun 12 2018,negative,dang this movie stunk  hated it in theatres but thouhgt i would go back and give it another try and it was worse  sad to see what they have done with starwars
Jun 12 2018,positive,just had my second viewing and loved it again the acting is tremendous when you can pay attention to the quality of the acting in every single scene there are so many wonderful moments looks glances etc that really shine through this time i noticed john boyegas excellent work during the crait sequence     also i noticed r2d2 did one small thing in the movie in addition to the leia hologram scene during the crait sequence he was helping rey scan for life signs
Jun 12 2018,positive,one of the best movies of all time
Jun 12 2018,positive,outstanding film its so great
Jun 12 2018,positive,cant stop watching this im a mega star wars fan totally obsessed and was really happy to see this different pacing and different approach great acting great moments great film
Jun 12 2018,negative,hello     my name is marcel and i am a mysagonist racist and i hate women oh sorry thats wrong i just do not like tlj    i just want to leave my 1  as  everything has been said already multiple time    just 2 things to add     rey obviously is the daughter of the force as we known its female and chuck norris    and my kind of humor would have been chewie sitting at the camp fire about to take the first bite been interrupted by the porg than a cut to chewie taking the bite with another porg roasting over the fire
Jun 12 2018,positive,fantastic thrill ride for all ages
Jun 12 2018,positive,this is the best star wars film ever dont let the angry internet men scare you away love it
Jun 12 2018,negative,you just took a giant shit all over the first movie and rogue one disney has fallen from grace with this flop of a movie  the political nuances that escaped the first movie hasnt snuck into this movie they have been splashed throughout the entire plot rose had absolutely no reason for being in the movie could shorten it by eliminating her scenes making finn a wussy i understand because he was in force awaken luke an ass was a little extreme making a love interested between rey and ren was so stupid if you were going for the feminist i dont need a man  just make them the exact opposites and leave it at that ps killing him was a bold move which i did love
Jun 12 2018,positive,simply fantastic in every way provided you dont mind strong female characters and understanded homages to the empire strikes back everything you could want and more in a star wars movie
Jun 12 2018,positive,two thumbs way up love it

Jun 12 2018,negative,this movie actually makes me like the previous movies less and stops any momentum the force awakens generated right in its tracks
Jun 12 2018,positive,i enjoyed this movie so much that it took me almost a week to consider all of my favorite moments so that i could narrow it down to one and im still not there yet so im going to give you two chewie almost eating a porg in front of other porgs and any time that benicio del toros character stuttered

Jun 12 2018,positive,this film is so much fun
Jun 12 2018,positive,i just love this film so much it means a lot to me
Jun 12 2018,negative,the worst star wars anything since the xmas special awful writing awful  character development  terrible attempts at comedy forced and preachy politics and a rehashed score that even the amazing but inconsistent lightspeed scene cannot hide avoid
Jun 12 2018,negative,a terrible star wars movie  ive been a fan for 35 years but after this im done
Jun 12 2018,negative,this movie sucked plot holes and stupidest star wars characters ever are found in this movie
Jun 12 2018,negative,tlj isnt the worst star wars movie but thats only because clones is just amazingly bad
Jun 12 2018,negative,absolute vile trash  a total character assassination and force fed political diatribe into a science fiction world for children  a total assault on the fans that have built the most successful franchise  in addition its an absolutely horribly written film with terrible awkward humor  introduces significant issues into the star wars universe and attempts to further destroy everything fans have loved  a criminal enterprise
Jun 12 2018,negative,piss poor i feel bad for mark hamill and the staff of lucasfilm
Jun 12 2018,positive,on first viewing i was appalled in places surprised at the audacity of over the top powers reveals and literally laughed in places i dont think were intended to be funny viewing it again and again brought a deeper understanding of the plight of luke skywalker  the new rebellion the resistance and saw the vision johnson had in creating this next installment of the sw franchise this is not going to go the way you think as luke puts it and there are certainly parts of the whole that you wont like on 1st viewing watch it all watch it again and make your judgement after letting it sink in its definitely worth it
Jun 12 2018,positive,had many friends tell me this movie was amazing although i had high hopes seeing the 91 review i also saw many one star ratings even though it is at 46 for audience score i just watched it and was amazed how much this is a great star wars film looked at reviews again and can easily tell someone keeps making profiles to give it 1 stars the critics were right to  give it 91 i guess the 1 star reviews are people who hate good stories and have the imagination of a donut the 1 star ratings could be a little more creative to hide there tracks sadly that will never change how great this movie was i am happy to see what happened to the story of star wars
Jun 12 2018,positive,i love the last jedi visually stunning loved the new armored walkers and the crystal foxes hell i even love the porgs it tells a deep reflective story we still have chewbacca and the falcon  keep the momentum going jj abrams and may the force be with you all
Jun 12 2018,positive,i genuinely find how episode viii has affected people fascinating i felt the film had almost no filler at all and i was engrossed the whole way through i loved it its very rare that a film has that effect on me    i think then that the reason this film affected people so runs deeper i think this film destroyed many peoples conclusions from the original trilogy  and they dislike it for that for me however lukes mentality and the way the force was portrayed made sense i thought the way luke fought ren at the end was a representation of the nature of the force itself luke was completely passive he wasnt even there while ren let his own hatred and passion thwart his own plans by aggressively flailing around at nothing this was a victory of light over dark and i believe luke did it to save his friends and teach ren a lesson about how the dark side clouds judgement the philosophy in the film stayed very faithful to the originals for me and i loved it for that
Jun 12 2018,positive,so many exciting moments packed inside a film its an real achievement
Jun 12 2018,positive,outstanding movie love it
Jun 12 2018,positive,another awesome thrillride from lucasfilm

Jun 12 2018,positive,my sister dragged me to this film after the trainwreck of the force awakens but this film brought me back from the dark side the last jedi is a stunning return to wonder bravo
Jun 12 2018,positive,great writing great cast where do you begin with a film that is this great rian johnson came up with an amazing story and his cast did a terrific job of putting it together this film answers the big question from the force awakens in a great way we learn about what happened between kylo and his mentor luke we learn the true nature of reys past all with amazing twists and turns i cant recommend this film enough
Jun 12 2018,negative,just so dissapointing i didnt hate it enough to give it one star but lucasfilm has been shoving down poltics down fans throats and calling them bigots for levelling legitimate complaints that my hate for this film has grown larger and i no longer want to see any star wars films until kathleen kennedy resigns and rian johnsons trilogy is cancelled
Jun 12 2018,positive,what a great time to be a movie fan the last jedi is fantastic in an few weeks well get black panther and then the avengers good times
Jun 12 2018,positive,i cant rave about this film enough well miss you carrie fisher
Jun 12 2018,positive,ive always loved luke skywalker so i had some mixed feelings about this film at first however over time ive realized just how great this story was and how much it honored luke hes the hero in this film what a master class performance by mark hamill
Jun 12 2018,positive,im not sure its the best film of all time but its pretty close
Jun 12 2018,positive,george lucas has to be proud of this amazing team that put together this masterpiece
Jun 12 2018,positive,the last jedi is the best film ive ever seen its fun for the whole family
Jun 12 2018,positive,one of the best films in a generation
Jun 12 2018,negative,and this is how i know critics arent worth listening to just what is there to like in this movie the new characters are unlikable the story is extremely inconsistent and old favorites no longer represent what they used to plus rey hasnt really improved as a character and other characters like finn and poe seem to have gotten worse over the course of this movie and rose holdo what was rian johnson thinking when he wrote this pile of feces this was just incredibly bad and i personally recommend avoiding anything touched by lucasfilms and rian johnson in the future if you have anything that resembles taste     also for some reason everything i type in the text editor is in all caps unless my computers caps lock is broken rt might want to check their site
Jun 12 2018,positive,a feast for the senses a delight like no other cheers to lucasfilm
Jun 12 2018,positive,we love you rian johnson theres no politics in this film those suggesting theres an agenda have mental issues
Jun 12 2018,positive,it was a blast fun fun fun

Jun 12 2018,positive,greatest movie n star wars anyone who says different is on the payroll of another studio or blind
Jun 12 2018,positive,my review was deleted by rt or disney  but ill be back     attention   on the 17th of december over thousands of  onestar ratings came most of them one line can one no longer trust rt
Jun 12 2018,negative,beware of all the 5 star one sentence reviews disney must be trying to inflate the numbers absolute garbage plot holes everywhere disney needs a do over and pretend this and the force awakens never happened i cannot get over the fact that they completely crap on the older trilogies 
Jun 12 2018,negative,horrible movie full of sjw dogmatic   the visual and cinematic effects are good but the storie and the character development is so bad and cringie it makes me sad 
Jun 12 2018,negative,i mean how much did they pay you guys
Jun 11 2018,negative,shills out in force it seems    listen  if all you want is a visually fantastic scifi actioncomedy romp with some pretty odd moments of sobriety this may be the movie for you and i truly mean that decent summer flick wearing star wars skin    if you are looking for competent storytelling look elsewhere plot holes abound and the heavy handed moralizing the film does is at best condescending at worst nonsensical eg we win fighting to save what we love the comedy is used to cut dramatic tension quite inappropriately at times interesting plot threads that may have lead to some much needed character development are wasted other plot threads forgotten if not subverted seemingly for the sake of subversion this is not going to go the way you think indeed is a bit too on the nose a foreshadowing statement expect to have every plot arc end with a twist whether or not the logic follows    the greatest sin for this movie i think is the completely dramatically ineffective characters played competently yes but weak writing has dealt the unfortunate souls playing the film roles a weak hand heroes first  rey mary sue cardboard cutout finn pointless wasted potential luke faceturnheelturnface poe emasculated castigated rose literally whowhatwhy holdo incompetent commander mega stereotypical feminist type villians  hux bumbling ineffective comedic foil phasma wasted snoke unimportant dead kylo whiny impotent occasional foil    none of these characters are good at getting me to do what they need me to do  care with incompetence being the name of the game save for rey  space messiah she is ineffectual heroes villains that would fail to properly intimidate a toddler the big bad dead there is literally not an iota of conflict left worth exploring by the end i couldnt give a toss what happened to any of the characters my hope for salvaging the potential from the first movie dashed    it subverted so many expectations and yet where subversion of expectations may have been interesting rian clings fast to safety for some reason refusing to push that particular envelope rey is as always dedicated to the path of the light beacon of unfailing righteousness that will unerringly make correct decision after decision completely foregoing all chances at the failure a characteristically empathetic character makes    hadnt intended to review this movie honestly but the influx of people giving brazen passes because this movie suits their politics is absurd if they arent purely corporate shills looking to secure a better reputation for their pet project the mouse needs to get his house in order
Jun 11 2018,negative,horrible disney completely chucked all of star wars logic out the window watch solo instead
Jun 11 2018,negative,rian johnson great visuals but horrible story way to make rey a perfect character who has no faults what great character development   sarcasm   canto bight was terrible couldve cut the entire plot line from the movie and it wouldve actually made the movie better   lourds  character was trash i hated her the whole time why wouldnt she tell anyone about her plan just terrible leadership and terrible storytelling   butchered lukes character fu rian johnson for ruining my actual childhood hero and completely messing up the small amount of actual good plot you may have had going with him and the jedi needing to end by backtracking at the end of the movie grey jedi code wouldve been cool bendu and his philosophy and all that from rebels would have been an interesting way to go with this but youre dumb     plot was bad rey isnt a real person shes too perfect finn had no development the only real character i was interested in is kylo ren ben because he actually had an interesting backstory and development its just too bad that it incorporates the crappy version of luke that rian johnson saw fit to shove down our throats the luke that saw the good in the most feared and terrifying person in the galaxy almost killed a young boy because of some bad dreams nope not our luke just rian johnsons twisted perversion of how he wanted luke to be in his film btw he told mark hamill that it didnt matter what the fans wanted or thought the only thing that mattered is the story when mark voiced his concerns over the direction johnson was taking lukes character such bull crap johnson doesnt even understand what star wars is about     also whats with all the fake accounts posting one sentence five star reviews for sure not real people and if they are prob hired to raise the average rating pathetic that mouse house cant take any criticism
Jun 11 2018,negative,that 91 of critics certified this fresh strongly suggests that critics are either idiotic by nature or financially dependent on the industry an utterly abysmal film only redeemed by some perfectly savage reviews
Jun 11 2018,neutral,so when i first saw this movie i thought it was pretty damn good however i left with a strange feeling something nagging at the back of my mind that i couldnt quite shake then i saw it again and then again i wanted to really get a good feel for why i felt so weird the first time even though i enjoyed it   the answer   the movie completely destroyed multiple characters and made them either uninteresting completely different from what they should be or downright bad characters   luke in no way this is the luke skywalker we have been waiting for so long to see on the big screen once again rian johnson screwed him and the fans over by making him this woos of a character whos motivations for leaving and hiding on the planet completely dumb then he had some interesting development with his view of the force and the jedi and why they needed to end and completely went back on that interesting development at the end of the movie for no reason and killed him off for no reason great scene dont get me wrong looking off into the twin suns but that should have been saved for the last movie and not this one   finn crappy crappy crappy terrible plot line completely useless and annoying   rose unneeded addition not a bad character just seemed too goodie goodie and kind of pissed me off for that reason   leia could have been killed off in that tragic explosion but instead pulled a mary   poppins
Jun 11 2018,negative,terrible awful appaling atrocious poorly written script with a complete disregard for source material that preceded it in a franchise with the richest lore in maybe all of cinema and not just disrespectful to the originals and the prequels but the plot points created in the force awakens  the characters are all lack luster and uninteresting interesting characters were killed or turned into slap stick comedic reliefs hux and nothing made sense the plot was insanely nonsensical as someone who lived and breathed star wars i now have zero interest in any of the characters i hated every second of this movie and rt poetically made me give this movie half a star if i had to attribute that half star to something its for making me cherish the soap opera prequels and jar jar
Jun 11 2018,positive,my review was deleted by rt or disney  but ill be back 
Jun 11 2018,positive,so amazingly brilliant i still cant believe how good this movie turned out to be
Jun 11 2018,positive,a new chapter in the sage the last jedi takes us places weve never gone before rian johnson is a master
Jun 11 2018,positive,this film is just a delight some people just want to be miserable i guess if you read some of the one star reviews theyre just hateful its a strange kind of sickness dont give into hate the last jedi is a masterpiece

Jun 11 2018,positive,a movie that inspires the soul
Jun 11 2018,positive,marvelous and entertaining
Jun 11 2018,positive,to me rian johnsons the last jedi script it the best star wars script ever ive probably seen the movie now 20 times and its not perfect but for a star wars film is about as good as it gets i do have issues with this trilogy but most of those issues are primarily laid on whomever came up with the original concepts of the trilogy the first film sets up luke not helping his friends and becoming a hermit people dont like rj for going down that route but that was the hand he was dealt at the end of tfa we care about luke but it obviously luke has quit caring about the rest of the galaxy     the luke question was always going to be divisive which is why jj simply punts it to the middle film there are so many little things in rian johnsons script that make the film worth watching over and over
Jun 11 2018,negative,disliked how they treated luke skywalker
Jun 11 2018,positive,a wonderful adventure

Jun 11 2018,negative,it took the characters we actually cared about crapped on them and killed them in disrespectful ways not to mention the new characters were written completely different from how they had been established in the previous film
Jun 11 2018,positive,not only did this film break all the rules it opened up a million new idea now that rian johnson and severed ties to the predictable status quo do we really need every force user related to anakin skywalker this film was a breath of fresh air

Jun 11 2018,positive,to me star wars has always been about the power of myth and how the films move me this film did not disappoint even though luke wasnt the luke we and hamill himself envisioned it was his character that spoke to me the most and provided the insight i needed at a time of adversity no more wallowing on the island time to get back into the fight there are many other things i could say about what i liked about this movie but that is the most significant imo
Jun 11 2018,positive,i stayed away from predetermined expectations and went into this movie as a fan just looking for a good story i walked out blown away by the rich depth of entertainment in each act with intriguing new characters like holdo and rose this movie was almost irreverent to the star wars movies of the past and it may have not went the way i or anyone else wanted ut this was exactly what this franchise needed i loved reykylo teasingthe stalking supremacys decimation of what is left of the resistance across open space was a throwback to the old blackbeard pirate moviesthe throne room scenelukes returnthe stable boy holding the broomall of it and yet none of it went the way that i thought it was going to go and the genius of the story was luke warned us of this early ongreat job i cannot wait until ep9
Jun 11 2018,positive,may the force be with you
Jun 11 2018,negative,still not over the fact that they actually let all of this happen
Jun 11 2018,positive,this will go down as one of the great star wars films of all time its an epic masterpiece
Jun 11 2018,positive,so many great moments in one film
Jun 11 2018,positive,the opening bombing sequence in this film is a amazing it keeps getting better after that
Jun 11 2018,positive,great story great cast whats not to love
Jun 11 2018,positive,i am just absolutely stunned in a great way absolutely loved itall of it yes rj took risks but i think the time was right and i have no problem with the mantle being passed to these new characters this coming from a guy who saw the original sw in the theater in 1977 as a 13 yr old    my favorite scenes in no particular order     the cavemirror scene was just incredible cinematography stunning will be talked about for yearswe need a thread just on that one scene   opening space battle was awesomepoe once again is the xwing god   lukelukewhere to begin my most fave character of sw and i loved hamills performance no problem with showing his human flaws   luke and yoda  what a great throwback to ptot   loved showing poe growing into a leader   snokekylorey showdown was superb  tense  well done all around awesome power of snoke glimpse into kylos head   however my most favorite scene was the last one with the random boywow so powerful on so many levelswhat a great way to tie it all together
Jun 11 2018,negative,not only was it the worst star wars movie but possibly the worst movie ever made
Jun 11 2018,positive,i loved this movie     i didnt love tfa for reasons which i wont belabor again here with this movie i felt more as if id seen a star wars movie not as tight a story as the ot but with the same genuine feeling of camaraderie and mystery that was missing from vii i teared up several times during this movie maybe it was because i didnt know much about it and was genuinely surprised who knows i had no actually low expectations going in     a few highlights im sure ill have more to say later after ive had time to see it a few more times    nothing and i mean nothing makes me grin like seeing that classic sw logo and hearing the sw theme song play   leia was magnificent and clearly warweary but no one has suffered like she has and thats pretty clear imill not sure if that moment of truth with kylos finger on the button was a blessing or a curse for her it clearly gave me hope for him but prolonged her suffering in several different ways it may have been hokey but i did love seeing leia defy the vacuum of space had a little training in the force after all i guess  laura dern as admiral holdo was superb i remember seeing her in jurassic park and wishing i looked like that i had the same thoughts again  kylo continues to fascinate me hes still a boy but hes growing up i cant figure him out but i can see that theres more to him than the simple dark side bad seed  the part in the cave where rey asks to see her parents was genius not just the reflection back at herself but the different reys at slightly different points in time it made me about time  perspective which is the real rey did we just see time split which path will she choose is she really rey rando   kylo  rey fighting together i dont know what to say except it seemed right despite the violence it was more like ballet theyre two of a matched set  im not normally much for battle scenes but there were some brilliant bits here with poe holdo and finn  rose tico we fight to protect those we love not just against those we hate that just about sums up the difference between the dark  light sides of the force  when luke walked out to meet kylo the look on the faces of the few remaining rebels was awestruck as it should be  the ending with the little protopadawan and the broom that jumped the last inch or to into his hand what a beautiful setup for the next film and a sweet little easter egg too there were many great little moments like that in this film     i could go on but these are the parts that come to mind right now the story was a bit complicated but seemed to hold together very well the characters hit all the right notes the acting much improved and there was less perfectrey and more uncertainrey especially in the beginning
Jun 11 2018,positive,yes a masterpiece this one is going down as top 3 all time for all things star wars for me
Jun 11 2018,positive,i loved the movie i thought it was creative and original we saw some things we havent seen before and were waiting to see i know a lot of people are disappointed about the character development i honestly think there was a sufficient amount of character development killing smoke quickly placed more emphasis on kylo ren and the main villain which i thought was a genius twist luke was very believable considering what he went through lastly i think rey didnt need to be related to a previous character when kylo is already to have two decendants of previous characters show down would have been too chiche a new force sensitive character was badly needed i know a lot of people wanted rey to be a skywalkersolo or even kenobi but star wars needs to move on otherwise its just silly that characters children keep fighting each other the galaxy is much greater and expansive than that people need to get it out of their heads that characters do not always have to live on change was needed the movie was original and creative i think they did well with this one i give it a 910
Jun 11 2018,positive,people are so emotional about not getting what they wanted and luke dying that it overshadows a great movie and when the objectively look at it they realize yeah that was one of the best star wars movies ever
Jun 11 2018,positive,for me the standouts in this series are anh the original groundbreaker that still works as a stand alone movie tpm totally unexpected novelistically thick fantastic visuals rots a great tragedy  sw style and ro more mature in tone stylistically different excellent characters and now tlj ambitious offbeat emotional  broke sw so sw could grow beyond copying gl forever
Jun 11 2018,positive,i suspect this film will grow on my upon further viewings i actually might step back and debate things less for episode ix so much happens in this film its difficult to take it all in on the first viewing the opening sequence is so great even though i felt like the cb scenes with finnrose were the weakest part of the film it still was full of great moments
Jun 11 2018,positive,i absolutely loved it this time the first time was great the second time was even better without all the shock and awe i was able to sit back and just enjoy it ive always felt star wars just becomes all the more enjoyable when youre familiar with it probably since many of us spent so many years watching the ot we can hardly remember seeing them for the first time they were just always there in our lives i thought maybe it was a tad too funny the first time not that the humour was bad just perhaps too much of it the second time however all the humour felt very much part of the movie and classic star wars
Jun 11 2018,positive,i love the finn and rose arc so much
Jun 11 2018,positive,amazing love love love the porgs
Jun 11 2018,positive,best film in the franchise its not really close
Jun 11 2018,positive,classic space adventure
Jun 11 2018,positive,outstanding film rey is the best and luke is my hero
Jun 11 2018,positive,good if you like this sort of thing
Jun 11 2018,positive,the last jedi is a masterpiece i loved the force awakens but it was a bit of a nostalgiafest it would have been so easy to make rey a lost skywalker child but this story rejects all those tired tropes     snoke could have been another palpatine but hes not instead his mystery is a fools errand when the story is about ben solo and rey rey is challenged when her mentor is aloof hermit who no longer believes the jedi are necessary in the end rey faces her fears and luke overcomes his failure rian johnson should be praised for this epic story its a real achievement
Jun 11 2018,negative,its terrible the worst star wars movie ever made it could be a sequel to spaceballs but that movie was much better disney dropped the ball with rian johnson and lucas film with kathleen kennedy please just stop ruining our childhood and beloved characters
Jun 11 2018,positive,amazing thank you george lucas for this amazing universe thank you kennedy for keeping it going
Jun 11 2018,positive,epic story fantastic writing rian johnson is the master
Jun 11 2018,positive,one of the true great fantasy films of all time star wars was desperate for some new creativity and this film delivers
Jun 11 2018,positive,this film is cinematic achievement huge scope and filled with humor hope and the stuff people love to dream about
Jun 11 2018,negative,this is the worst star wars movie i have watched have the studio ran out of talented writers and directors     this movie has destroyed my interest in any future sequels
Jun 11 2018,positive,think this is the best star wars movie in the franchise love the main characters a real dramatic arc for the leads with a good sense of pacing and humor too
Jun 11 2018,negative,if you think this is a good film just rewatch it i had a passably enjoyable time at the cinema but this is just a terrible terrible film that gets worse and worse the more you think about it beyond the oohhh ahhh visuals this has nothing to do with fans vs nonfans its just bad writing star wars has always been at its core a well written fairytale story in a scifi backdrop tlj however is using these preestablished mechanisms simply to drive a bad and now inconsistent story arc essays could be made about the terrible story devised by rian johnson and plot holes hes written disney for the love of god please fire kathleen kennedy movie sagas need an executive producer that knows where they are going with the story and direction     spoilers    the humor is terribly misplaced and misses the mark most of the time even when a sombre moment is building the director decides to break away or cut the tension with a porg    the characters are awkward and act very oddly for their roles  i genuinely thought that holdo was the infiltrator because of her behavior to poe her fleet commander and established hero and that poe was entirely justified in mutiny she is belittling and petty you do not write characters like that if you want the audience to like them  holdos death was supposed to be heroic but came off as contrived and was almost enjoyable to see her gone from screen     worse still the actual villains are reduced to generic bumbling idiots phasma was again wasted and stupified and hux holds no power or dread needed from a primary antagonist as soon as you place humor at the villains expense you have removed their menace this happens in several ways but huxs bumbling interactions with poe at the start and the reys oh put a shirt on with kylo kills the menace of these characters completely compare tarkin and vader to these morons these are menacing and dangerous and we know that the heros are in peril wheres the threat once snoke is dead there is none our heros just need to be slightly less stupid than hux to survive     rey is still ridiculously overpowered and completely unrelatable theres nothing she cant do shes never in any danger and as such she is just a boring antagonist she finishes the film more powerful than kylo or snokes guards with a ridiculous skillset of crackpilot wookie linguist swims like a fish despite coming from a desert planet lightsaber and force wielding expert with absolutely no character flaws and shes earned none of it  that is the very definition of a marysue male or female i dont care thats what she is luke anikin darth maul sideous these people had strife and flaws and growth how can you relate to anyone who has no character flaws and needs no training to attain almost godlike power theres a reason that hasbro rey figures are everywhere  nobody finds her interesting nobody can relate to her    in this movie rian johnson brought in choreographers and martialarts specialists to train daisy but forgot to train rey    worse than attack of the clones absolutely at least in that film there is a continuation of story and some semblance of worldbuilding we have aotcs i dont like sand dialog vs tljs leiapoppins back into a moving starship and frankly this looses that battle  anytime you have an audience laughing as they were in my theater during a serious scene its a very bad sign it could and should have been reshot and made poignant after carrie fishers death however now it will be even more jarring to see how she is killed off in the next episode    here rian actively insults the original trilogy with his let the past die but ripsoff many aspects of the ot in this film only those bits are far far worse the emperors throne room the ice sorry salt planet its all knocked off and butchered what is original is just so stupid  did nobody in the creative process question johnson on the fuel chase or the pointless canto byte subplot or did he just have a first draft and run with it      the worldbuilding is non existent johnson apparently had no idea or no care about the state of the galaxy after tfa and wanted his pieces in place somehow the new republic is completely gone after the destruction of those 5 planets and everyone has now joined the first order were now back to rebels and empire another ripoff without any sense of how we got here or what the stakes are its making me angry just to think about how lazy the writing is  this is part of a saga the rules of the universe are defined but johnson ignores it for plot momentum     this shortsightedness causes numerous problems for the saga as now force ghosts can interact with the realworld yodas lightning and how did lukes projection give the dice to leia  turboblasters on capital ships cant destroy fighters and they have no shields to protect them deathstar tech is small and portable and the biggie sublight speed is now apparently uniform in all of these ships and the first order care about their fighters not to risk them why the frig cant the first order jump ahead of the rebels oh yes plot not story  the holes perforate the story like swiss cheese i could go on for hours on the problems but here are a couple off the top of my head   why are the bombers so inferior to everything weve seen before   rey magically turns up exactly where she needs to be and escapes just as easily without any explanation onscreen   why is it that the code breaker is so conveniently in the same cell as finn and rose    how does rose not kill finn when she rams into him to save him   how does finn drag her back to the base without being blown to bits by the first orders gorilla walkers   every single part of the phasma vs finn execution  fight is hugely convenient and makes absolutely no logical sense     this is not socalled fanboy nitpicking these are plot holes a mile wide and in any other movie would be justifiably torn apart for it people try to come up with explanations for the numerous plot holes in the film but you are doing the directors job it is rian johnsons job to create story not the audience     the scene that everyone points to as a shining example of the films quality is the hyperspace destruction of snokes ship but after youve stopped drooling you realize that it screws up the physics of the sw universe  why was the deathstar not destroyed in this way simple because johnson wanted his shot and the shot is always more important than logic or universe consistency     the less said about the butchery of lukes character the better there is simply no way that the character we know the one determined to find the good in his relentlessly evil father would try to kill his nephew in his sleep its a fundamental change in the character without any explanation this is rians subversion for subversions sake and its insulting to everyone    some twists and turns are fine but it is just allencompassing here    who is snoke and how powerful is he why does he want rey brought to him   where are the knights of ren    why is luke on the island what is the reason for the map    finns back wound how will he recover   who are reys parents and how is she so powerful    how will snoke complete kylo rens training   lukes lightsaber a good story for another time    all of it every plot thread is tossed away literally in favor of what nothing all of the answers to these questions are nothing fans of the film will say that this is what made the film interesting but it is the exact opposite the storytelling is quantifiably bad and there is now nowhere to go from here nobodys special and nothing that was set up has any consequence  oh but rich people are mean and animals are cute brilliant the social messages are so ham fisted especially canto byte its a childs view of the world they are mean so lets break their stuff and itll all be worth it i wonder who will be cleaning up that mess finn could it be the sanitation workers im sure its all worth it    this is a sequel and yet none of the story follows any of the sagas law nor is well explained as new all potential story arcs from ep7 are subverted with old and new characters butchered to the core without a single thought to how they got there it would be story over substance if only there was a story here the tragedy is that this garbage is now canon good luck jj picking up any kind of story from this mess unfortunately the director who only loves the mystery box is not the man to provide a satisfying finale does anyone care enough to see a kylo vs rey battle with absolutely no stakes or story to resolve im betting on lucasfilm flogging a quadrilogy now    kathleen kennedy says that she doesnt need to cater to male star wars fans congratulations youre doing well alienating all star wars fans through your mismanagement of the franchise
Jun 11 2018,negative,this movie makes me want to sell all my star wars legos any takers
Jun 11 2018,positive,a heart racing triumph highly recommend

Jun 11 2018,positive,probably the best movie of all time if were being honest
Jun 11 2018,positive,a mesmerizing adventure luke leia yoda rey poe holdo rose chewie and the droids what a great movie
Jun 11 2018,positive,i was sad to see the actress playing rose attacked by vicious trolls rose tico is the heart of the film and shes amazing
Jun 11 2018,positive,i love the old and new characters so much even the smaller threads like canto bight were done expertly
Jun 11 2018,positive,what a wonderful surprise this film turned out to be after playing it way too safe rian johnson takes all the tired star wars tropes and turns them on their head

Jun 11 2018,positive,rian johnson delivers the best star wars film since empire
Jun 11 2018,positive,one of the best star wars movies ever made well written great surprises and outstanding cast
Jun 11 2018,negative,the character assassination of luke and the lame attempts at humor made for an experience that was unrewarding and groanworthy
Jun 11 2018,negative,a piece of non sense with a deus exmachina girl from nowhere
Jun 11 2018,negative,had many friends tell me this movie was bad although i had high hopes seeing the 91 review i also saw many five star ratings even though it is at 46 for audience score i just watched it and was amazed how much this is not star wars looked at reviews again and can easily tell someone keeps making profiles to give it 5 stars also wondered how critics gave it 91 found out many are employed to companies related to disney the 5 star ratings could be a little more creative to hide there tracks sadly that will never change how bad this movie was i am sad to see what happened to the story of star wars
Jun 11 2018,negative,a nobody main villain a mary sue protagonist a disillusioned mentor  a snailspace chase sequence a star warsbreaking lightspeed ram a pointless casino diversion incompetent sidecharacters incompetent villainsetc would not recommend
Jun 11 2018,positive,my favorite star wars film of all time an amazing achievement
Jun 11 2018,positive,outstanding film that builds from the original without caving to weak predicable reveals this is a film that requires a brain
Jun 11 2018,neutral,there is a golden storyline mixed in with a lot of pointless disnified mess the story of how luke skywalker fell from grace and redeemed himself is worth one watch but this is by far the least rewatchable star wars entry to date
Jun 11 2018,negative,while visually gorgeous the script is awful rian johnson dismisses everything tfa set up destroys characters he doesnt understand and slaps the audience with stupid twists because he is more interested in subverting expectations than in telling a coherent story
Jun 11 2018,positive,this film is great on so many levels luke is my hero and the last jedi is his best film
Jun 11 2018,positive,an amazing triumph of hope and love bravo
Jun 11 2018,positive,new star wars classic

Jun 11 2018,positive,i love this movie so much its a classic
Jun 11 2018,positive,all the one star votes on this vote rigging site these people should get lives the movie was a hit with critics and audiences
Jun 11 2018,negative,this movie is terrible plot holes bad jokes and the destruction of everything that had been built up over episode 7
Jun 11 2018,negative,leia fly luke trying to kill his own nephew after what he did with his father when you step into the dark side there is no coming back they made 6 movies for the one who could do that vader through his son luke and here kylo is always crying i am good ai am bad boy you killed your own father apart from many other people you should have at least dark side eyes is impossible being struggling at this point rey is a flat character like i didnt saw in many time its true half of the movie was senseless for the plot and the other half an insult to the previous work it doenst really exist to me star wars ended in ep vi
Jun 11 2018,negative,this make the prequels look like citizen cane is like if in the lord of the rings frodo become into an assasin legolas fights for sauron and gimli shaved his beard just imposible things with these characters and story there is absolutely nothing to watch in ep 9 there is no bad guy the new empire doesnt have my respect and none of the good guys deserve nothing
Jun 11 2018,negative,very bad storytelling slow and sluggish chase in space with gravity bombers in space really and luke character massacre this script should have been reviewed by script doctors i have not see such a bad story in large production movies
Jun 11 2018,negative,i must say i dont know star wars anymore i was introduced to it by the prequels and have never gotten the chance to view the original trilogy i have to say this story left me feeling more depressed than when i entered it doesnt help i felt horrible coming into the theater due to personal issues the film doesnt treat any of its side characters with care it has holes in its conflicts raises even more into the films before it the diverse cast  the aliens are given poorly constructed plotwheels to turn outside of 3 characters id say that the filming even portrays a level of pure incompetence onto them most who happen to be the diverse cast as if casting a condescending light they even make the same mistakes as the prequels and manage to bring the whole of jar jar binks into one movie through one of the diverse cast and my greatest passion of star wars fighters battles is now questioned at every turn with why isnt anyone pulling a a specific maneuver that a specific character does even though that character created the pickle jar indirectly they were stuck in   i feel like im losing a good friend whos been there for me due to disease the cinematography holds up the music fits well the visual effects are great but all of that is wasted on a story twisted and jagged on par with michael bay  mnight shamalan quality
Jun 10 2018,negative,basically why fan fiction should never be made into a movie
Jun 10 2018,negative,how do you ruin an entire star wars movie i mean an infant could have made a better death scene for luke skywalker worst star wars ever  pure trash way to ruin everything ever
Jun 10 2018,negative,an abortion of a movie
Jun 10 2018,negative,over politicized piece of junk
Jun 10 2018,positive,i was blown away i got from tlj what i desperately wanted from tfa though i get why that film played it safe    it continued the story in an original way without dismantling the canon or ruining the important concepts of how the force works    every character had a role within the complex philosophical and mythological messages that were being told    the concept of the jedi wasnt overridden but expanded  the scene with yoda putting everything into context and making the old jedi master my favourite character as wonderful and inspiring as ever    the scene with rey ren snoke and the guards is in my top 3 along side the yoda scenes on dagobah and vaders redemption    the luke vs kylo scene is the most beautiful scene ive seen committed to celluloid    and i have never been so pumped in a sw movie as i have in this one to the point i was letting out squeals of delight the reyren fight the falcon on crait with ot music luke vs ren i havent reacted like that since yoda flipped out his saber vs dooku and sidious  and this time it was amplified a hundred fold    i literally cannot fault this film even the bits i didnt like i loved for being so daring and fresh i embraced everything    ive fallen in love with sw afresh
Jun 10 2018,positive,watched tlj last night and i was blown away before talking about the content the actual execution of the film was fantastic the script cinematography acting and score were superb the only exception was daisy ridleys performance which i thought was lacking emotion at certain points especially in the first two thirds of the film but she was still good     as for the content there were a lot of surprises obviously but not one of them that i was disappointed with i thought the evolution and characterisation was natural and unforced and it made sense     one of the only real criticisms i can make of the film is some of the humour imo came at the wrong time there were some tenseemotional moments that were waylaid by humour which i thought disrupted the tone in parts    as a film on its own it gets 85 out of 10 for me however after 9 is released and all the mystery is revealed i expect that score to increase i think this trilogy is gointo be so intrinsically linked it will be hard to judge each film individually until the series is completed
Jun 10 2018,positive,this is a very good movie it is quite deep it changed and expanded the saga in significant ways while still being accessible to the general audience thats a difficult thing to pull off there were so many wonderful little moments and the acting was very good it runs 25 hours but felt very short
Jun 10 2018,positive,rian tore my heart out stomped on it threw it in a toilet sneezed on it then used it as a loan for his new house     and i loved every second of it
Jun 10 2018,positive,i loved the movie i truly enjoyed that it was so different that so many of my theories went right out the window i loved that it was one of the most human and down to earth stories of the series truly surprising it was bold and not simply adhering to the past or what we are comfortable with plus i have no idea where they are going with episode ix but as they look forward with the saga i look forward to where it will conclude
Jun 10 2018,positive,after initilly walking out of the theatre i felt very overwhelmed and didnt know what to think besides that i loved it upon letting it sit with me and thinking about it more and more its only getting even better i cant wait to watch it again
Jun 10 2018,positive,the last jedi blew my mind it was nothing i expected but everything i couldve ever wanted i am simply stunned of course like any movie there were parts that faltered moments that seemed like a bit of a reach some charactersmotivations not fully explained etc it looked and felt nothing like a star wars film and it was this fact the cinematography the pacing the bold risks the incredible performances that launches this film to the near top of the star wars franchise the last jedi has been the only star wars film in a long time to actually expand the universe our idea of the force and push storytelling boundaries i have never been more impressed
Jun 10 2018,positive,loved it might be my new favorite honestly rian took elements from the ot pt and put his own unique spin on things to push the boundaries i totally see why he got his own trilogy the force is strong with this one
Jun 10 2018,positive,one thing i really liked is i feel they made me empathize with the tragedy of the loss of so many resistance members so many movies just dispose of human life like its nothing i thought this was a much more realistic portrayal of the horror of so many allies being killed around you and the horror that the survivors could join them any time
Jun 10 2018,positive,the last jedi sits right there with the ot for me as of now but it can change when i have seen it a few more times i have been thinking about this movie for 2 days straight and i adore what they have done
Jun 10 2018,positive,amazing movie it was really fun and unique cant wait for episode 9
Jun 10 2018,positive,this is the best written and best acted star wars film since empire and the star wars film that goes the farthest in asking its audience to challenge itself driver and hamill put in exceptional performances and the practical effects and kurosawaesque visual style harken back to star wars roots

Jun 10 2018,positive,reminisent to empire strikes back but not in a way i really liked this film i believe luke is not dead and he is a doppleganger
Jun 10 2018,negative,this is a piece of trash that somehow got greenlit and filmed it seems as if nobody even bothered to read the script or just didnt care pretty visuals mean nothing if your story breaks established lore isnt funny forces humor deletes lightsabers to save a hero and destroys a major infuential character not only in the movies but also in rea life

Jun 10 2018,positive,star wars the last jedi is a triumph in storytelling and filmmaking visually every scene evolves and stays true to the original trilogy enjoy the film for what it is and do not take it too seriously and you will be pleasantly surprised
Jun 10 2018,positive,ignore the haters this is a worthy addition to the franchise
Jun 9 2018,negative,low iq dialogue and had a storyline which made no sense in the context of extant canon i almost burst out laughing at the space leia scene in the theater if rian was trying to nail the coffin shut on this franchise he certainly sped up the process with this hot garbage
Jun 9 2018,negative,i would give 0 stars if i could they are ruining the star wars franchise
Jun 9 2018,negative,huge fan of star wars i wasnt a big fan of the force awakens however i was looking for ward to what they would do with rey and her training with luke skywalker also of course to see more about luke becoming the next grand master however all we got a was grand pile of trash it is sad to see the legendary characters tossed aside so easily many plot holes plenty of scenes that were time sinks and stories not answered or wasted from the force awakens seriously you are going to save the animals which will get recaptured anyways but leave the kids to endure  slavery and now more hardship because the animals were freed read any of the reviews not the pro critic bot reviews and you will see why this movie became one more nail in the coffin for future star wars movies
Jun 9 2018,negative,worst star wars yet so insulted by how disney hacked up not only the franchise but the beloved characters this is a social politcal film at best and not even bluray worthy just dont
Jun 9 2018,negative,really bad lukeray dialogue turning poe into an unsympathetic heel the deus ex codemaster poorly timed and outofcharacter humor  so much sloppy stuff in this film also while i have no problem with rose or the actress who played her her character was one of the better comedic deliverers  the finnray chemistry which made the previous movie fun is totally gone here its a necessary part of the cannon to watch this but its not one ill be watching again which is disappointing after force awakens and rogue one
Jun 9 2018,negative,they should have called this movie  the character assassination of luke skywalker  the idea that they would ignore mark hamills input and go so out of their way to disrespect the original series was the most amazing display of arrogance and downright mean spiritedness that i have ever seen in mainstream production  in general im fine with the new characters i am opposed to the trashing of the old characters  i decided to review the movie because i discovered that rotten tomatoes popcorn score should actually be more like 24 not what it is now 46 at the time of this writing i decided to weigh in and try to move the score closer to reality
Jun 9 2018,negative,the last jedi is even more disappointing than the phantom menace luke skywalker didnt seem like the strong jedi we all know and love i love star wars but the newer movies just will never live up to the original trilogy
Jun 9 2018,positive,a pretty good movie with interestic visuals and aesthetics however it also has a somewhat messy plot that can be either rushed in some places and even non sensical in others leia im looking at you not the best star wars movie but definitely not the worse
Jun 9 2018,positive,the last jedi has some really great scenes but there are also this awkward jokes and logic issues the most serious however is the damage this film leaves to the universe and its characters
Jun 9 2018,negative,starwars fan but omg this movie suck big time
Jun 9 2018,negative,its unbelievable how much the director can screw this frenchise up with perhaps one of the greatest source materials in the movie industry the last jedi was nothing like a star wars weak plot story characters and plotholes ruined the movie so much to a point where the ep9 failed befote its even released
Jun 9 2018,negative,terribly disappointing  theres just so much wrong with it  they literally torched jedi lore  i honestly dont know where they go next with this weak storyline  leia shouldve perished luke shouldve continued onetc etc  arrrggghhh just plain sad that id rather watch a prequel  jj has an even bigger task ahead of him now than he did reviving the franchise with tfa
Jun 9 2018,negative,i found the last jedi to be a very poorly written and badly directed movie to me it was the worst star wars movie in the whole franchise with all this political bs getting shoved down our throat the original characters getting spit on and no effort on actually trying to tell a compelling star wars story shame on lucasfilm for pushing this sjw crap in my face and telling me to either like it or get told that im a racist white supremacist who hates women if i dont    my advice to everyone who wants to see star wars go watch the original trilogy dont waste your money on this sjw crap
Jun 9 2018,negative,worst director ever
Jun 9 2018,negative,from flying space nuns to scenes where nothing got accomplished but to waste time and put more scenery in the movie to obvious ideological beliefs of the director and president of lucasarts being shoved down our throats this movie severely dissapointed me  the writer and director basically disregarded all prior lore and canon and physics to push his own story on this utter garbage  if you truly want to watch this movie watch it for free somehow and do not give money to disney for this trash
Jun 9 2018,negative,i was in shock i was so hyped for it and when it came out i was just broken and when i was leaving theatre any hype for episode ix is gone and any hope for great star wars future gone too
Jun 9 2018,positive,i think we the audience was searching for ansers in this movie that we didnt get instead we got a good going forward with this univurse and some character development that was good i think for the third movie mark hamil did the best performance of his lifetime and i was in awe of the depth hi did ok this wasnt the luke we wanted but the luke we deserved
Jun 9 2018,negative,the force awakens and the last jedi have been the only star wars moves that i have only seen once  i have lost all desire to finish this story  they have killed any passion i had for this universe
Jun 8 2018,negative,i cannot come up with a single reason why the worst star wars movie ever and a subpar movie in general would have  90 tomatometer score other than that the critics are obviously pandering to disney it is also highly disappointing that rottentomatoes would compound the problem by artificially inflating the audience score by ignoring half star ratings it doesnt take a genius to scroll through the fan reviews and see that the average of all the ratings is well below 46 what a joke    the feel of the movie was disrespectful to the history of the franchise even more so to episode 7 which was so bizarre arent these supposed to be part of a cohesive narrative    the entire cantobytes diversion was completely unnecessary and a waste of time it would have been more powerful and character enriching to have finn and rose stuck on the ship engaged in dialogue about loss and frustration that they cant help instead we waste 40 minutes and they improve things not one bit    the snoke throne room scene was a complete throwaway fight scene i dont see how that did anything positive for the story either probably just a vehicle to make more toys    this movie and more importantly how the movie industry including   critics and journalists responded to it and to fan backlash about it has   completely deflated any enthusiasm i have for the future of star wars   at disney i wont be spending any more money on anything star wars   until we see some real acknowledgement from disney that they messed up and actually take real steps toward change
Jun 8 2018,negative,ahh what a disapointment the movie is beautiful as far as photography and cgi goes but the plot and the characters absolutely ruined it entire lenghty segments could be removed without affecting the story classic characters loved by the fans had their personality and actions go against everything we seen on previous movies several misteries and elements that made fans excited turned into flops there is no excuse here this movie has bad story telling and pays no respect to the previous movies and materials of the star wars universe pretty much all hype that was built up after the force awakens died in this movie if not for this franchises history i would probably dont even care about episode ix as the last jedi destroyed the positive trend the franchise was on
Jun 8 2018,negative,quite possibly the biggest middle finger in the history of a film franchise and an absolute killer of any interest in this new sequel series
Jun 8 2018,negative,the worst star wars story
Jun 8 2018,positive,a very different but worthy and emotional continuation of the star wars saga a lot of odd choices that will upset many but still an engaging and good film
Jun 8 2018,negative,betrayed the internal consistency of star wars
Jun 8 2018,negative,absolute garbage if you hold luke skywalker sacred in your heart do not see this film
Jun 8 2018,positive,with a combo of gamechanging narrative and aweinspiring visual effects this adventure in a galaxy far far away is one of if not the best film in the star wars franchise
Jun 8 2018,negative,yeah this was the worst star wars movie in my opinion
Jun 8 2018,negative,i walked out of the cinema thinking it was a great film great cinematagraphy sets and visuals however by the time i reached home i realized how empty it was not only did it not have a self contained good story but it actively destroyed the history and characters of the franchise
Jun 8 2018,negative,i feel like disney wants to take a space opera and make it a space comedy  but they fail at doing it  i didnt enjoy this movie as much as i wish i would have  i left with a crappy empty feeling that there were no answers again and disney keeps trying to reinvent star wars itself which they need to be careful with because many of the franchises fans played with the video games and loved the original movies and feel like this just isnt quite the same thing anymore
Jun 8 2018,negative,absolute garbage  the main storyline is has huge plot holes like why the imperial warships didnt jumped ahead of the rebel fleet and why they didnt told nothing to poe about the plan resulting in a mutiny that may have lead to their deaths   the segment about rose and finn is inrellevant and clearly a giant and drawn out filler not to mention the scene where rose saves finn from doing some thing useful btw even here theres a plot hole because they should have been killed by the walkers that were like two meters away  the characters are average at best but theres some really ideous stuff in here as well  the admiral is a muppet even for a star wars movie theres no excuse he acted like a child at the beginning where he wined about poe mocking instead of opening fire on him  rose is simply useless   the character of luke has been literally flipped around   they had to explain a little bit more about snoke and phasma before killing them resulting in a bitter disappointment in my behalf and i dare saying in the behalf of most of the public because they killed off the main villain without explaining who he was and even if he was a threat at all seeing how he died  and for the last point we can all agree that they should have killed off leila instead off doing that moronic space superman scene    in the end i say dont buy the blue ray its the worst star wars movie since
Jun 8 2018,negative,they killed my childhood jokes are plain dumb luke is like a totally different character massive fail
Jun 8 2018,negative,utterly terrible film main protagonist the most cookie cutter mary sue ever written unwatchable
Jun 8 2018,positive,surprising technically and aesthaeticaly stunning tlj is a brilliant moving forward vehicle for a saga in peril of getting entangled into its old mythology and ending up choked by itself
Jun 8 2018,negative,it looked like a star wars movie and thats the name on the title but beyond that this is a dreadful film ive seen b movies with tighter stories than this just super lazy writing will frustrate even the most casual viewer
Jun 7 2018,negative,id rather still my balls in a sarlac pit than watch this crap again
Jun 7 2018,negative,absolutely no doubt the worst sw movie ever made what is the point of fin and rose why can rey use the force so well why is luke such a sook and what is the first orderwhere did they come from back story character arc refusing to see any more sw movies at the cinema ever
Jun 7 2018,negative,i never thought i would long for the days of the prequels but here we are i cant for the life of me understand how 91 of critics thought this wasnt a huge waste of time audiences have it right  this movie is terrible granted the cinematography is amazing i mostly enjoyed the scenes with luke simply because hamill delivered the performance of his career although i agree with him and everyone else who says this film was a huge disservice to the character everyone who says it was original is stupid rebel base discovered which leads to a long chase through space where a scoundrel betrays our heroes while the young protagonist gets trained by a wise old jedi culminating in a duel with the bad guy who makes a big reveal uhg  seriously an hour could have been cut by eliminating the absurd tedious sideplot  i nearly fell asleep  thats a first johnson is an ass for not following jjs abrams lead but it does beg the question did they ever have a plan for these movies at all or is this simply a multimillion dollar game of cinematic telephonelucas may be a terrible director writer but hes an incredible ideas guy  he probably should have been listened to from the beginning as far as an original story ultimately this trilogy can not be fixed no matter what they end up doing with ix maybe a scene where luke wakes up and it was all a bad dream id happily take that
Jun 7 2018,negative,its like the person who made the movie had never watched star wars before everyone came to watch this movie to see what luke skywalker was up to and they made him a joke they made the bad guys dumb and nonthreatening and it was just a slog to get through this movie so dumb will not watch again
Jun 7 2018,negative,worst star wars movie the actors did fine with the roles they were given the plot is horrible the writers should be fired
Jun 7 2018,negative,garbage star wars is dead to me thanks disney
Jun 7 2018,negative,riddled with plotholes poe and holdo too long due to unnecessary plot lines finn and rose demolishes any mysteries leftover from previous movies rey and snoke potentially worldbreaking mechanics suicide hyperspace jumps completely abusing the force skype calls and holograms subversion of expectations used to undercut the audiences emotional response rather than to genuinely surprise luke teleportation and time management problems how did they get there so quickly and to top it all off its literally a slow motion car chase  but it does have spacecow milking and superman flying through space
Jun 7 2018,negative,worst star wars movie ever so many flaws i could write better sceans and i am not a writer
Jun 7 2018,negative,a poor excuse for a star wars  film picks up all the threads of plot seeded in 7 and gives em a good yank before setting them on fire the new director seemed only to want to ruin everything the last director set up nothing pays off every plot point is ruinously misused and hey the only living original character is the only dead actor go figure
Jun 7 2018,negative,this is a terrible movie at least for causing such a divide in the sw fanbase usually when a product is good you dont see so much people arguing about it for example how many have you see arguing pizza is bad this is for those that give this 5 stars dont be blind and hypocrites this is a product we are the consumers and theres certainly something wrong with it
Jun 7 2018,negative,so much wrong with this flick
Jun 7 2018,negative,the worst star wars movie of all time
Jun 7 2018,negative,who is snoke who is rey etc apparently it doesnt matter add to unanswered questions like these the absolute betrayal of the character arc of luke skywalker and you have this disaster of a movie    i would give it 12 a star if rt didnt refuse to factor those scores in the the films total
Jun 6 2018,positive,i love this movie and i give it a 1111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111
Jun 6 2018,positive,movie had some great visual effects  thought the whole casino side story was irrelevant to the movie and never did payoff  wanted a little more from luke but overall it wasnt a horrible film
Jun 6 2018,negative,after seeing this abomination i have found an appreciation for the prequels because they were somewhat enjoyable in comparison
Jun 6 2018,negative,worst story plot in all of the star wars universe dont even need to mention the plot holes and other horrifying garbage this was
Jun 6 2018,negative,story wise this movie is awful tries to subvert expectations for the sake of the subversion and not for creating a better and more engaging story destroys old characters that made the franchise great for the sake of being different full of jokes that tonally are inconsistent with the emotion that the scene is trying to achieve badly written full of plot holes  the only thing that it is great is for the visual and vistas  so if you are interested to watch a movie that requires that you just shut off your brain and just accept the beautiful scenes that the movies throws on your eyes and just accept the blatant political message that it ungracefully spouts at you thats your movie
Jun 6 2018,negative,just a terrible movie never seen a movie make so little sence and so full of plotholesa second movie in a trilogy that almost completly ignores the movie before that
Jun 6 2018,negative,created account just to review this hunk of crap  giving it 1 12 stars just because i heard they dont get counted otherwise  should be 0 stars  movie is an abomination that contradicts given history from prior movies completely dismantles all setups from the force awakens which btw also sucked and even contradicts itself in several places  it has some of the worst writing in any movie in modern memory  it was made by someone who clearly cares nothing about the star wars universe
Jun 6 2018,negative,not really sure how i feel about this one i liked a lot of the things they did with the characters and their arcs while also feeling bored throughout
Jun 6 2018,negative,this movie disrespects all the star wars mythos that came before it in a fool attempt to be contrary
Jun 6 2018,negative,too many plot holes rey is still overpowered luke was worthless how in hell couldnt the first order catch up with the rebels they can when traveling in hyper space but regular trouble was an issue i could go on forever
Jun 6 2018,positive,the last jedi is the best film of the sequel trilogy and the best star wars film since the empire strikes back a nuanced compelling drama of a nobody girl from nowhere trying to find her place in the galaxy a spiteful  powerful young man burdened by his legacy and the phantoms of the past a reluctant legend and a small band of freedom fighters desperately trying to survive the onslaught of a rising evil  
Jun 6 2018,negative,i see reviews of people saying these are for the young then why bank on the old characters to bring back fans this movie sucked and johnson made a bad movie
Jun 6 2018,negative,how this has a 91 on rt is beyond me  honestly how 46 of viewers thought this film was good is beyond me  and this has a higher rating than rogue one  i guess the prequels are no longer the worst sw movies lol
Jun 6 2018,negative,this film is depressing how the critics have scored it so highly is unbelievable the visuals are stunning but thats seems to be limit of rian johnsons ability the storey is riddled with plot holes everywhere the characters dont develop anywhere further than the force awakens and know one acts in a believable way like leia and holdo saying they like poe after he kills most of the fleet and stages a mutiny   fin rose and phasma are all noticeably shallow characters that could of been so much more these good actors deserve so much better than this  i know starwars is based way outside the laws of reality but it seems like rey did nothing to hone the skills to be the best sword fighter and force user in the galaxy where luke spent 3 films learning and improving slowly luke is also somehow transformed from the most optimistic jedi in history that believes everyone can be saved and is willing to take on the empire alone into a man who nearly murdered his nephew and wants to hide while the evil dictators take over the universe
Jun 6 2018,positive,not without its faults but still a good movie starship chase scene a bit on the nose and laias survival of the bridge explosion was a bit off putting besides that an interesting thought provoking and fun experience
Jun 6 2018,negative,the legacy of a lifetime destroyed in one movie
Jun 6 2018,negative,i wanted to give it negative stars if i couldthats how much of a joke this movie isthis is the movie that killed star warsat least they cant take away the ot from usdont support these films and there agenda
Jun 6 2018,negative,when subverting expectations is given a higher level of value then the overall story character growth characters being true to themselves and so on this is a film made by someone who was more interested in shocking the audience with decisions than treating the characters and story we all love with the respect that it deserves i have never been more disappointed leaving a film in my life
Jun 6 2018,negative,the movie has more failings than positives i will point out the most grievous ones first  luke skywalkers character is horribly assassinated every character trait he earned from the original trilogy butchered and given to others who didnt earn them couple this with every character that jj set up being made even more bland there are plot points that go nowhere and just take up screen time instead of developing the characters to justify them one must go to ridiculous mental gymnastics and start writing the plot for the writers after youve seen the movie political themes are hamfisted without any sign of subtlety its just jammed down your throat and the film beats the audience over the head with it repeatedly from a plot perspective this movie is a nonsensical mess thats insulting to the audiences intelligence if you care about the stories and character consistency you will not enjoy this movie    on to the positives it is the most visually stunning star wars movie the music is also on point and there are cute animals if that is all you care about you can enjoy this movie
Jun 6 2018,positive,snokes scene was good and so was yodas and luke skywalker at the end was really good
Jun 6 2018,negative,well it sucks but it does have gorgeous visuals at least
Jun 6 2018,negative,a plot hole of a movie star wars is dead 
Jun 6 2018,positive,it has a tons of flaws and its not a terrible movie its just okay i wish i could say its underrated entry of the series but despite it carrie fishers last film to go out on with some memorable lines john williams score and the action was very good in other way i may find this a disappointing it should being a hell a lot better
Jun 6 2018,neutral,not all terrible but what they did with lukes character is so disappointing and leia floating through space just too left field
Jun 5 2018,negative,i created an account just to review this movie it was horrible disney destroyed star wars for me i didnt see solo because of it and cant imagine spending money to see another star wars film
Jun 5 2018,positive,i loved it was pretty entertaining and thoughtful
Jun 5 2018,negative,the worst movie ever made a meddling ceo with a political agenda an im such a talented artist i know better director with no clue about how to make a science fiction movie let alone a star wars yes they did open a door to space pull leia through it and then close the door again this movie was doomed from the start and now the whole franchise as well as the hearts and minds of the legions of dedicated fans have been destroyed i wont be spending another dollar on the star wars franchise until rian and kathleen are gone
Jun 5 2018,negative,when i saw it opening night i left feeling good i was happy that it wasnt another rehash of original material like i felt tfa was then i saw it again the lack of continuity with tfa is jarring once you notice it and without any spoilers i will just say that the characters are essentially still undeveloped i find myself not even excited to see how it ends
Jun 5 2018,negative,the fact of the matter is that this film is unintentionally desperately depressing for the fan base they know it is over  rip star wars 19772017
Jun 5 2018,negative,i cant see how anyone couldve enjoyed this space crap why is disney ruining star wars in my opinion the positive critic reviews had to be paid for by disney  because there is no way a reasonable movie goer couldve enjoyed this nonsense  hugely disappointing
Jun 5 2018,negative,visually amazing but that doesnt make up for the absolute destruction of the story and horrible characters  i understand you have to kill off the old guard but to turn all their characters into losers and then give them loser deaths is insulting to the fanbase  there were so many other problems with the movie i cant even scratch the surface here  worst sw film ever that includes phantom menace
Jun 5 2018,positive,i love star wars and i hate everyone who doesnt
Jun 5 2018,negative,could do wo luke in this whole movie honestly if you were hoping for closure with beloved characters none to be found here
Jun 5 2018,positive,best star wars movie since the empire strikes back
Jun 5 2018,negative,this moive was horrable and i wish i never saw it but i love the original star wars movies
Jun 5 2018,positive,i really liked it as a non star wars fan a wonderful movie that subverts existing tropes and brings in something fresh
Jun 5 2018,negative,ty disney for murdering sw
Jun 5 2018,negative,i feel for mark hamill i wont be seeing another star wars movie
Jun 5 2018,negative,subverting expectations is not a good way to make a sequel and the character of luke skywalker was completely changed for the worse in my opinion a lot of the movie and subplots felt so unnecessary and too many moments had me feeling disconnected from the movie or putting me in a state of disbelief such as the leia force scene an already lovable cast was pushed aside for 3 new characters to be developed that all felt flat and 2 of are out of the rebel group now poe and kylo were the only characters from tfa that i liked the development of everyone else was developed poorly or could have been done better hopefully the next movie has a director who can properly make us love our characters and wrap up a clear good vs evil star wars story disney and lucas films has a lot of criticism to learn from and give the fans what they want
Jun 5 2018,negative,not a star wars movie as simple as that
Jun 5 2018,positive,the best star wars filmwhich has an exciting story full of action
Jun 5 2018,negative,major deception poor storry what happen to those poor caracters is unspeakable
Jun 5 2018,negative,what a terrible and disappointing film what was the director thinking  just goes to show how quickly a good thing can messed up it has put me off watching future star wars film
Jun 5 2018,negative,i keep seeing articles referring to a small vocal group of fans who were displeased with the last jedi as a nonvocal fan of both the original series and many of the new films as well i feel compelled to have my voice heard as well     unlike many older fans i enjoyed tfa it was great to see my childhood heros again and i was very happy with the new cast jjs film left me wanting more quite excited to see what adventures will follow in what should have been an amazing middle film tlj dropped the ball on that in every possible way ryan johnson decided to make his own kind of movie with meandering plot lines that were wholly unnecessary and made the movie drag hollywood cameos that took away time and storylines for already established characters that were already working well sophomoric humor that was out of place and frankly eyerolling agendas that felt arrogant and pandering he disregarded everything that had been established in the previous film and for decades before him the script did nothing to move the story forward except to abruptly end the skywalker saga with nowhere to go next and for no good reason      i left the theater feeling dumbfounded this was carries last film and there was no goodbye both she and mark and ackbar deserved an amazing last film and were given the worst possible in the franchise everyone in my family fans and casual movie goers both equally despised this film it is not a small minority most intelligent humans who witnessed this 2 mileanhour space wreck will never love star wars the same way again this one film managed to cheapen the entire franchise and discourage future any sw viewings
Jun 5 2018,negative,unbelievably underwhelming this did not feel like a star wars movie the lack of lightsaber fights the weak lightsaber fight between luke and kylo and the vast amount of social justice forced into a lacking story are just some problems thank god i rented it from redbox for a dollar fifty and not spend fifteen for a ticket
Jun 5 2018,negative,its just terrible whole movie was meaningless if you guys wanted to make no country for old man or ghostbusters 3 just make new one dont throw shit to the franchises
Jun 5 2018,negative,after all this time i dont think i need to explain how bit of an utter shit this is
Jun 5 2018,negative,this did not feel like a star wars movie so many things wrong
Jun 5 2018,negative,numerous plot holes inconsistencies lack of any logic and terrible humor contrasted unskillfully with overly saturated drama renders this film a slap on the face for star wars fans and an unbearable experience for any viewer who expects a bit more than mindless visuals
Jun 5 2018,negative,worst star wars franchise ever a bad film bad dialogs and ridiculous scenes
Jun 5 2018,negative,rose tico ruined this movie for meimagine jar jar binks but worse thats how much of a bad character she is
Jun 4 2018,negative,this is simply a bad movie its sad to see so many delusional people blaming its bad ratings on bots or trolls wake up and smell the milk
Jun 4 2018,negative,really  worst star wars movie ever
Jun 4 2018,positive,watched it with my 7 year old son and he loved it
Jun 4 2018,negative,i actually created an rt account just to i can review this film and give it half a star  ive been a star wars fan since i was 6  luke was my hero  when my friend asked me if i had high expectations for this film i told him not really i just expect it to be good  there is no way i can dislike a film that has luke skywalker in it  boy was i completely wrong  the sad part about it was that i really really wanted to like it  ruining my childhood hero is simply unforgiveable  there was no reason to do it  congratulations rian johnson youve done something that i never thought would be possible  youve completely soured me on the entire star wars franchise  im actually selling all my toys now and im not going to spend another cent on any star wars film going forward  im sticking with the mcu
Jun 4 2018,negative,i hated this movie this is a franchise breaking film this movie is such a slap in the face for anyone who waited 30 years to see luke skywalker on screen again that i threw away my copy of the force awakens the turned the greatest hero in star wars into a cowardly loser that refuses to help his family then he pointlessly dies at the end such a huge disappointment and insult 
Jun 4 2018,negative,hated it hated everything about it didnt go see solo because of it wont go see ep 9 because of it it did what even the prequels couldnt do it put me into brand divorce i was a lifelong fan but they wont get one more penny out of me     i guess im part of the small vocal minority i keep hearing about in these articles about tlj well maybe when we dont show up for ep 9 they will start to take us seriously one of the arguments people make in support of tlj is that it made 12 billion dollars yeah thats because a lot of star wars fans went to see it the problem for lucasfilm is that a lot of the people who walked out of the theater after tlj were not star wars fans anymore i know because im one of them     boycott everything the only way to kill the beast is to starve it
Jun 4 2018,neutral,not the skywalker we used to know and should know a movie made for the money not for the fans innecesary sequences that put us far far away from the interesting stuff
Jun 4 2018,negative,i wish i could give this movie zero stars this movie is an overall mess from the screenwriting to the continuity i wont be seeing a disney star wars film  for years to come
Jun 4 2018,negative,this was the single greatest disappointment of a movie i have ever experienced i never even thought it possible to create a star wars movie that i cannot bear to rewatch they butchered luke skywalkers character rey remains an irritating mary sue and gets no character development huge questions and key plot points from the force awakens are completely disregarded and makes this movie feel like it has absolutely no continuity phasma and snokes characters had so much potential but are completely wasted the movie blatantly defies basic physics as well as star wars lore and logic  which stands out like a soar thumb it makes a painfully clear effort to inject politics in all the wrong ways it introduces a couple new insufferable characters rose and holdo that are portrayed in ways that try to make us care about them yet all they do is annoy us with nonsensical logicactions and introduce entirely new and unneeded subplots that muddies up the flow of the movie several times it makes the first order look like a bunch of bumbling idiots which detracts from the suspense the entire main plot being a slow chase makes absolutely no sense as the first order couldve done many things other than waiting until the rebels fuel ran out the only reason i give this movie even one star is because kylo rens character was interesting i enjoyed his scenes yet he too couldve had more character development and couldve been made a more ominous villain than what he was this movie was littered with annoying politics missed opportunities and nonsensical decisions made with the sole purpose of subverting expectations at the expense of logic and the story its a complete fu to the hardcore and longtime fans
Jun 4 2018,negative,total fail star wars is now dead thank god for the mcu
Jun 4 2018,neutral,an oddly mixed bag overall  the film contains some of the best scenes and new elements of all the star wars saga in the interesting relationship between rey and kylo  true blurring of the dark and light side and indeed the majority of kylos story  at the same time some of the worst elements are also found here the shaky writing in both plot holdo canto bight and dialogue rose rebel scum at times comedy which often overstays its welcome often taking away from the tension of scenes and feeling more akin to a parody than an actual star wars film  many elements seem wasted such as the blurring of light and dark which whilst a good element could have been explored further and villains such as snoke hux and phasma are all made largely devoid of any small element of character and nuance hinted at within tfa and are incredibly disappointing to see utilised so poorly  overall the film has some excellent moments and good character building for both kylo and rey but sadly is let down by shoddy writing an incongruent tone and a desire to be subversive in a way which doesnt fit in with the narrative set by the previous installment
Jun 4 2018,negative,by far the worst entry into star wars canon     despite the sometimes awe inspiring visual effects the film features some of the worst characters and writing in a series that created jar jar binks   kylo ren often repeats let the past die kill it if you must and this movie attempts to do just that breaking classic characters retconning classic arcs and ignoring previous films    rian johnson has been praised for subverting expectations  and in a way he does for example i expected to enjoy this film he sure subverted that expectation
Jun 4 2018,negative,many many plot holes breaks many established rules and a great deal of star wars lore a poor addition to the saga
Jun 4 2018,negative,the film falls short in many ways and destorys characters of the original series by contradicting behaviors in the previous movies while also adding unnecessary plot lines to an already long movie to teach a lesson that makes no sense to the plot but also doesnt give context to why the first order is so strong in this movie when in the last movie they were a tiny force but now they arent the film also treats their audiences like idiots and doesnt give any intellectual storylinest to the audience and lets them think too many misplaced jokes that were not well times and the ex machinas were in too plenty this film is a disgrace to the star wars films and as a huge fan is extremely dissapointing
Jun 4 2018,negative,this movie made me a star wars fan because i could not believe what i watched at the end i didnt give a damn about star wars but i know how much it means to many people around the world especially luke and what they did to mark hamil in this movie is unforgivable ruin johnson is a child that cant take criticism watch the dvd extra and see that buffoon not listening to anybody but his giant round head what a shame
Jun 4 2018,negative,can i leave no stars  imagine you come out to your back yard your home a familiar place to find that someone dumped truckloads of garbage in it then lit it on fire and then when you disapproved of what they have done they spit on you and slapped your kids and your wife kicked your dog as it tried to defend your home and flipped you off as they drove away to the cemetery where your ancestors are buried to shit and piss on the graves essentially this is tlj
Jun 4 2018,negative,this movie destroys everything we have known regarding the star wars universe for decades it dishonours luke the redeemer as well as yoda and leia it feels more like a fan made film with its petty humour consistently overtaking plot and injects our own worlds sociopolitical issues into a galaxy far far away if you enjoy star wars because of the universe the people and the story  dont watch this atrocity
Jun 4 2018,negative,full of everything that makes a movie bad plot holes plot armor idiot plot  mary sue product placement and the most unforgivable of all the embarrassing way they handled luke skywalkers character but what can you expect from the people who brought you the last airbender perhaps they confused star wars for space balls
Jun 4 2018,negative,a missed opportunity and a waste of time
Jun 4 2018,negative,rian johnson with his bloated ego has completely spoiled it
Jun 4 2018,negative,terrible too much humour which is a shame because i was a huge fan of star wars until disney took over
Jun 4 2018,negative,such a disappointment especially with lukes character johnson totally missed the point of lukes growth from the original trilogy  totally
Jun 3 2018,negative,this just didnt make sense too many plot holes to even count
Jun 3 2018,negative,someone should arrest johson for shitting on star wars legacy and disrespect the loyal fans
Jun 3 2018,negative,has to be one of the worst movies made of all time
Jun 3 2018,negative,ruins star wars plain and simple i can talk forever about the flaws of this movie  rian johnson ruined childhoods ruined escapism and ruined somes happiness  please go back to writing school
Jun 3 2018,positive,very good and it gets better the more u see it
Jun 3 2018,negative,horrendous on every level may be the last one i see def last one i pay to see
Jun 3 2018,negative,worst movie ever made unforgivable spat in the face of everything we have known and loved about star wars for all time
Jun 3 2018,negative,worst star wars movie ever this generation and its agenda is so boring that sucks as leia flying in the space disney kills the force
Jun 3 2018,positive,a real fun ride with an awesome ending  it did feel like it took a long time to get going though
Jun 3 2018,positive,this movie does not deserve the hate its been getting though i love the star wars movies dearly this is probably the first star wars movie that had a truly compelling overall message the cinematography is absolutely gorgeous and its beautifully shot there are plot conveniences and plot lines that arent completely necessary but thats present in many movies and i found it rather easy to look past especially since i think the side plots really helped strengthen the movies themes i would rank this movie right up there with a new hope and the emipire strikes back
Jun 3 2018,negative,not good do not whatch
Jun 3 2018,negative,looks good great as a space movie but awful just awful as a star wars movie the damage has been done sad
Jun 3 2018,positive,epic scale visually stunning amazing character arcs and enough wellplaced humor all add up to a new classic and what is in my opinion the best star wars movie to date theyve done some new interesting things with the force and luke skywalker is a badass
Jun 3 2018,negative,simply awful in every conceivable way and many more which are simply inconceivable
Jun 3 2018,negative,this movie has simply killed all of my love for the starwars universe and considering starwars was a form of religion for me i hope its clear enough that to me this movie is not even worth one single star the plot doesnt make any sense the characters are inconsistent and mostly useless and probably the most representative scene is the levitatinginspace princess leia to be kind the movie is a parody so to a certain extent you may have a laugh i did but the price is starwars is now dead rip ill keep watching the original trilogy without cgi
Jun 3 2018,negative,changed my review from 12 star to full star to make sure it counts    this movie is bad like indiana jones  crystal skulls bad   its so bad it pisses people off 6 months later   literally squanders all the good will of tfa with yo momma jokes and being contrary for the sake of being contrary and has the balls to call itself brilliant   how can infinity war come from the same company that greenlighted this stinking pile
Jun 3 2018,neutral,although there seems to be a lot going on from a story pov it doesnt really make much headway and opts instead to focus on definitively setting a new course for the characters speaking of theres not a lot of development for them either at least for the ones that the franchise is focusing on moving forward without giving too much away its the decisions made in that general area that probably arent going to go down well with devotees of the franchise for casual fans however there should be enough laserblasting ship battles lightsaber and forcewielding action to give them that star wars thrill theyre looking for in short its your average hollywood blockbuster a poorly written story with poorly written characters but with a lot of flashy action that doesnt fail to entertain take from that what you will
Jun 3 2018,negative,terrible  movie had nothing to do with star wars
Jun 3 2018,positive,this was a pretty good film and i left the theater feeling proud  this also had a few meh moments like the storyline with finn and rose  i did like the plot with luke skywalker and rey and kylo rem though  this was shocking to say the least
Jun 3 2018,negative,this was very disappointing hoping disney reevaluates the scripts planned for future movies prior to production next time
Jun 3 2018,positive,this is probably my favourite movie of the saga
Jun 3 2018,negative,garbage  just garbage  finished what force awakens started garbage
Jun 3 2018,positive,there were a few too many jokes some of which do not land and the character of rose was slightly only slightly undercooked but all in all it was a brilliant movie i have every confidence in the direction of the franchise moving forward
Jun 3 2018,negative,what can i say that hasnt already been said by hundreds of youtubers and die hard fans when i first watched this movie in the cinema i thought meh had a couple half decent moments the film dragged on a lot at times and i found the characters less engaging this time around than the force awakens   the big thing that bothered me like many others was the heavy handed feminist agenda being rammed down our throats via admiral purple hair it felt so overly forced  that it took me right out of the movie and had me rolling my eyes i simply could not enjoy this movie i wanted to but i couldnt while tfa was decent and had me smiling at the nods to the original trilogy and even somewhat likeable new characters in rey and finn this one fell flat completely   keep your political agenda out of star wars this is supposed to be a space epic about good vs evil not a social commentary on feminists vs the patriarchy bleh
Jun 3 2018,negative,awful experience how does one make a star wars movie be worst than episode i
Jun 3 2018,negative,a pile that spits in the face of loyal fans having the attitude of i will do all i can to unravel the story i was trusted to continue in the tradition of those before me stunning to look at and view but an erupting volcano is also a majestic and beautiful thing to see the point being its still rather destructive pod race 20 was a waste along with that entire plot line space leia lame and do you think the pilot who shot got force ass kicked by kilo when they landed where was that i think the thing that annoyed me most was the whole laze fare attitude i did appreciate the nod to the original yoda and r2s playing of the holo image from a new hope
Jun 3 2018,positive,one characters substantial lack of logic made way for the second half of the movie which is very annoying and not at all in character for rian johnson     despite that i still liked it
Jun 3 2018,negative,this movie is up there with phantom menace as the worst star wars of all time it really is that bad basically transforming like from a hero to a chump that gave up really ruined it
Jun 3 2018,negative,the beautiful cinematography unsuccessfully tries to mask the terrible story
Jun 3 2018,negative,they completely ruined the franchise with this one bring back all the beloved characters and just kill them off wonderful
Jun 3 2018,negative,by far the worst in the skywalker saga this episode fails to capitalize on all that was set up before it instead it chooses to wipe the slate clean and focus on new characters that while interesting the audience has not had time to get to know and the studio has not invested the time to develop the characters with any significant backstory why do we like rey fin or poe all we know of rey from the movies was she was abandoned on a planet for several years looking for her parents is that all her life ever consistented of did she have to fight had she ever shown signs of force sensitivity before all we know of fin is that he was a stormtrooper did he have friends how long was he a stormtrooper how long has poe been a pilot how did he obtain his position why do any of them feel a moral obligation to fight for the resistance none of these very basic and important questions are addressed it seems the producers and directors were just satisfied with allowing us to fill in the blanks if thats the case that is the ultimate pinnacle of lazy writing
Jun 3 2018,negative,this is the worst straw wars yet  what they did to this story is wrong i will never watch another save your money
Jun 3 2018,negative,simply put this was the most terrible star wars movie i have ever seen  it had great visuals and music but thats it  nothing made sense in this movie and i will not see another star wars movie for a very long time  it is sad but star wars is dead to me
Jun 3 2018,negative,this was a terrible middle movie for a trilogy and a terrible sequel to tfa subverting expectations is not an excuse to ignore virtually everything the previous film set up while some of the plot twists were welcome they were way overdone by the end of the film i appreciate the movie trying not to be a carbon copy of empire but that is not an excuse for what they ended up doing i would rather have had a remade empire than have this movie as an addition to the star wars canon
Jun 3 2018,negative,i signed up for an account just to rate this movie a half star because how disgusted i felt after viewing
Jun 3 2018,negative,when simple jack makes a movie should have stayed home and watched paint dry just a bad movie remove the star wars veneer  and you still have a bad movie
Jun 3 2018,negative,ive waited to watch it again on dvd and yep i was right back in december with my first impression its so bad its of a i wish this wasnt associated with star wars and can they delete this from ever having existed and start all over again you could write an essay on what is wrong and very little on what is right im not advising rehashing episode v as per jjs tfa did of episode iv but surely these highly paid hollywood individuals could have come up with a unique and original story line and plot for this film that carries on in a vein of what we know in this created universe im sure even the most casual viewer of the star wars films given the title and their background knowledge could have come up with a better story and plot that would be umpteen times better than this turd of a movie here the story is crap the plot just as crap some of the characters well i dont care for not the actor or actresses fault while others im interested in are either killed as with holdo or mere cameos like phasma and what the hell was the idea with giving dj a stammer scenarios make no sense even with looked at with a modicum of common sense supposed cliff hangers or big story moments are just discarded as meaningless if this was homework it would be ungraded ive no issues with the actors and actresses as they can only do what they can with the script and how the director wants them to portray their part i suppose so bravo to hamill for putting up with filming this as in his shoes id have been pulling my hair out at what they were filming and doing if i was george lucas id be seething ive got to watch episode 9 just to see how jj abrams rescues the steaming pile of turd of a story hes been handed by r johnson and i hope that individual is never allowed near this franchise again as this willwill go down as the worst star wars film ever
Jun 3 2018,negative,glad i didnt see this piece of crap at the theatre just saw it and it was a waste of time 
Jun 3 2018,neutral,enough time has passed that i can finally review this film    being a big star wars fan it took me a while to digest everything thats happened    lets begin with the positives this movie is beautiful visually really beautiful the colors the scenes the costumes cgi is coherent and breathtaking    the plot i saw the movie on the premiere didnt know what to think saw it again a week later the more time passed i realized the story is very weak the opening sequence is quite okay but from there it goes downhill i will keep it short because it would be wayyy too much reading otherwise   admiral ackbar killed off screen new and unlikeable character of amylin holdo takes what should be his place  worst part is that she doesnt reveal any survival plan for the resistance leading to an unnecessary mutiny of poe why would on earth would she keep it for him   canto bight  a hazard city where finn and rose are supposed to find a hacker is set to be both another social commentary as well as some comic relief it feels weird having this when the resistance is at a brink of destruction   rey is not trained by luke at all despite him promising 3 lessons lukes character is desecrated he is inconsistent with the ideals he fought for throught the original saga worse yet everything luke achieved is undermined by his actions   in the final clash between the first order and what is left of the resistance a couple stupid things happen finn who became a human parody is denied a meaningful sacrifice by rose  the resistance uses unarmed fighters but after half of them are shot down poe calls the whole thing off why what was he expecting rose rams finns fighter risking both of their lives anyway it took them like minutes to get to the cannon that threatened the resistance and we are supposed to believe finn made it back on foot with rose on his back while the whole first order watched jesus   reys parents are drunkards she succeeds in everything just because   the biggest let down of the movie of course is the fact that luke doesnt come to the aid himself he projects himself which is obvious no marks left on the surface he has that damn lightsaber that was destroyed 10 minutes earlier etc then luke dies after the effort really he didnt even tell the resistance fighters to run    sorry for the bad writing long story short the movie is set to deceive us on every step every plot hole is resolved in a unsatisfying way just to shock you this could have been such an awesome movie so many oporunities were wasted kylo and rey switching sides now the damage is done and i really dont know what they can do to fix this and save ix
