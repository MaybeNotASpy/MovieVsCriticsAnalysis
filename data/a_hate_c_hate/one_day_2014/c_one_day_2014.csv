Feb 14 2024,positive,lone scherfig navigates the ebb and flow of dexter and emmas relationship with a sure hand 
Oct 27 2020,negative,unfortunately the end result is a halfbaked virtually humourless romantic muddle that doesnt do the muchloved book justice
Sep 18 2020,negative,anne hathaway is uneven overwrought and frequently butchers the british accent as emma
Jan 28 2019,negative, july 15 1988  after a meet cute on the night of their college graduation emma and dexter begin a lifelong friendship spanning over two decades and different countries emma anne hathaway is a middleclass bookish with a more realistic and at times pessimistic outlook on life  dexter jim sturgess is a charmer from a wealthy family who could be anything he wants to be  every july 15 were shown snapshots of their lives  aspiration career love loss divorce death  together and apart hathaway fits the role of emma although it takes getting used to her british accent  while we get to see dexters side with his family we do not get the same benefit with emma  with booze and drugs and women the character of dexter isnt likeable it is to sturgess fine performance and boyish charm that hes very much tolerable while emmas fashion sense and inner confidence blossom its actually dexter that we see the evolution the most the weary older dexter in the later part of 2000s is a world apart from the freshfaced eager dex when he first appears there are adorable and tearjerker moments for sure  the first july 15 carries great promise of whats to come  although when part of the ending reveals the last half of their first day together its hard to believe that they would decide to remain just friends  the flirtatious french jaunt earlier in the years is fun and the later reunion an emotional one based on a novel written by david nicholls the story does not translate well onto the screen  as the years progress we see changes in emma and dexter and their surroundings but it feels like the scenes are merely events moving along through the motion in attempt to fit in as many years as possible the result is almost like being read narratives about what they do  instead of delving deeper into certain segments of their lives investing in the characters and connecting more with their relationships in the process the film inexplicably leaves pivotal milestones offscreen the execution makes it nearly devoid of what makes a story interesting the buildup character and relationship development and payoff  the last third act leading to the ending is very anticlimatic  and the ending appears to be out of nowhere aiming for a shock value  its a shame for a story that has so much potentials to be a classic like the notebook nathalia aryani is a rotten tomatoesapproved film critic rottentomatoescomcriticnathaliaaryani  she has a movie blog the moviemaven sdmoviemavenblogspotcom  twitter themoviemaven she can be reached at email protected currently you have javascript disabled in order to post comments please make sure javascript and cookies are enabled and reload the page click here for instructions on how to enable javascript in your browser
Jan 8 2019,neutral, its a common cliche of both romantic comedies and romantic dramas the one youre meant to be with might be the friend youve taken for granted all along unfortunately thats not the only wellworn trope used in one day though it is indeed a rare film one made by a talented director and clever writer with two beguiling actors that isnt particularly engaging emma anne hathaway and dexter jim sturgess spend their first day together on july 15 1988 the two brits graduated the day before from the university of edinburgh and after an evening of drinking with friends go home together a clumsy attempt at going to bed follows and the pair decide to be just friends but relations between a man and a woman are rarely that uncomplicated  especially when one begins the friendship with feelings for the other   its easy to see why emma falls in love dexter  and the man who plays him  is incredibly charming at first with an easy confidence that still allows him to poke fun at his privilege but it doesnt last as dexter succumbs to the drugs and girls that come with fame he gets more and more obnoxious by the time it appears that these two might finally get together  after a marriage a childbirth and a divorce  you cant possibly understand why shed still want to   its not the fault of sturgess or hathaway who are as appealing as ever were meant to see emma and dexter as opposites who attract yet we learn nothing about emmas family or formative years we just know from the odd joke that her people dont have as much money as dexters these characters lack depth which makes it hard to credit their transformation   screenwriter david nicholls adapting his own novel also wrote the likable comedy starter for ten director lone scherfig made the intelligent drama an education lets hope one day is just a single aberration in two capable careers 
Nov 15 2018,positive, film critics can be such heartless bastards at times ive read many assassinations of one day 2011 in the last 24hours and although i expected lots of whining and overintellectualised prose i was hoping lone scherfigs follow up to an education 2009 would have gained more favourable reviewsi have one simple rule when it comes to critiquing other peoples work if you make me cry then you have achieved something remarkable laughs are tenapenny and thoughtprovocation is no great shakes but if you can stirup someones emotions and get the tears flowing freely then your creation is worth a damn for the last 20minutes of one day i was a weeping wreck some reviewers have expressed anger and claimed they felt manipulated into caring about the protagonists but i find that perspective ridiculous all good cinema manipulates the emotions and its snobbish and pompous to slate a film  just because its not a masterpiece of acting and direction based on david nicholls bestseller one day is the tale of emma anne hathaway and dexter jim sturgess two students that spend the night together after their college graduation and become friends each year on the same date for the next twenty years we revisit dexter and emma to see where they are in their respective lives sometimes they are together on that day and sometimes they are not cue lots of heartache broken relationships life lessons and longing looks essentially one day is your standard hollywood romance for the thirtysomething generation the soundtrack of the film is the soundtrack of my youth with everything from primal scream tears for fears and tricky making a welcome appearance anne hathaways accent is somewhere between jane horrocks and the resident of an obscure irish village but shes pretty solid and once again stakes her claim to being one of the most endearing and watchable actresses around jim sturgess has never really impressed for me but he does show glimpses that he is capable of more though many will find his character to be a little too odious to care about give the man a chance and im sure he will win you round the pacing of one day is sadly not what it could be some years get more screentime than others and those that dealt with dexters fame and substance issues could have been fleshed out as for the couples chemistry i found the relationship to be totally believable but i can appreciate that there are those who wont buy it i recognised my own experiences and romantic history on screen and i have no doubt that is why i became so emotionally invested but for me that is another sign of greatness lone scherfig is doing little more than using the characters as a mirror to the audience if youve ever been in love then your mind will drift to that person which creates a powerful cocktail of real and onscreen sentiment all great love stories have that power the likes of ghost 1990 and the notebook 2004 will never be at the top of any greatest films of all time list but they will be watched and rewatched for decades to come because people like to be reminded that romance isnt yet dead one day will be playing in living rooms to the sound of sniffles and crumpled chocolate wrappers for many years to come and that for me is worth applauding
Feb 28 2013,positive, for everyone whos grown tired of the summer onslaught of superheroes savetheworld plots and explosions hollywood finally offers some decent counterprogramming in the form of the brainy romance one day based on the novel of the same name by british writer david nicholls and adapted by the author the film introduces us to two people in their early 20s who are about to spend july 15 1988  the night and day after their university graduation  together bookish emma anne hathaway possesses a caustic wit that masks a deep insecurity as well as a schoolgirl crush on rich boy dexter jim sturgess who radiates selfconfidence and the surety that hes going places in life because no ones ever told him no she wants to be a writer and he wants to be famous the two forge a connection despite their many differences and thus begins a close and often times combative friendship that flirts with true love from there on the movie looks in on emma and dexter on every subsequent july 15 from 1989 through to the present day taking us through 20 years of july 15ths  st swithins day in england offering a series of snapshot portraits of two often separate lives from young adulthood to early middle age we see emma grow in confidence just as dexs selfesteem takes a hit with the failing health of his mother the radiant patricia clarkson and his fading television career from year to year we also get to observe how their life and relationship choices both sensible and foolish leave lasting impressions on each of them and inform their bond with one another as july 15 becomes the most important day in both their lives danishborn director lone scherfig has tread these waters before namely with her spoton portrayal of keening adolescent love in 2009s oscarnominated an education with one day she continues her track record of sure and insightful direction by including accent notes in the story that quietly release the pentup power of a relationship that grows and strengthens over time without relying on typical hollywood histrionics or rainsoaked declarations of love this is a movie about a life that happens while youre busy making other plans and even despite the starcrossed lovers undertones the central relationship feels surprisingly real hathaway and sturgess have an undeniably lovely chemistry both as friends and lovers and despite the fact that hathaways accent takes a tour across the british isles they both do well with the material infusing their realistically flawed characters with charm and relatability the supporting cast is also a treat to watch clarkson plays dexs doting mother with grace and humour while romola garai atonement and rafe spall shaun of the dead take on the thankless roles of the significant others that are not meant to be and elevate the limited screen time theyre given on the downside some may find the rapid passage of time and frequent scene changes jarring and too quick to really settle in with the characters on a truly deep level checking in with emma and dex just once a year could have easily been a momentum killer and yes occasionally certain scenes will leave you wanting a just little bit more ultimately though the gimmick works because the actors sell it they will you to believe in them and in emma and dexs troubled yet transformative relationship  its a simple story that feels like a sweeping romance and thats enough to make one day well worth two hours at the cinema this weekend
Jan 14 2013,neutral, not a lot of love affairs real or cinematic can have it said of them that they end better than they begin  but one day ends with a heartfelt flourish that was sorely missing from its first 90 minutes this episodic romance works in fits and starts and captures a bittersweet faux british turn by anne hathaway plainly mismatched in being paired with reallife brit jim sturgess the conceit in novelistscreenwriter david nicholls tale  two friends drunkenly tumble into bed on the night of their graduation from college but nothing happens  so they say hes game then shes game then he isnt so they talk instead since they are both brits they note the date  july 15  saint  swithuns day  the book and film catch up with them over the years as they catch up with each other on saint swithuns day emma hathaway settles into a waitress job at a mexican restaurant resisting the overtures of the clumsy wouldbecomic ian rafe spall dex sturgess takes on the guise of the one that got away and who keeps getting away he travels he lands tv host jobs and over the course of the next 18 years they dosido around the idea that they should be together he flails about through fame then infamy shallow affairs and addictions and she settles  letting her low selfesteem hem her into a life of quiet doeeyed desperation the banter is pleasant enough but theres a funereal air hanging over the wouldbe affair her routine settles in  head home cupo tea weep hes meant to build her up save her you cant throw away your life just because you think its funny but theres just no magic in any of this for a movie seemingly designed to have this wistful romantic arc to it one day never quite reaches that opening meet cute moment she reads the popular novels of the day unbearable lightness of being at one point and he pleads with her to be spontaneous never once suggesting that hes the sort of chap shed want to be spontaneous with hathaway is an old hand at british accents and is convincingly demure uptight and english patricia clarkson playing dexs mom doesnt have to play the first two and fails at the third  a rare offkey offaccent performance for her its a frustrating film never light enough on its feet to be cute never heartfelt enough to achieve you had me at hello lone scherfig an education cant find the pulse of this story the romance its a british adult version of flipped in which the guy doesnt seem selfaware enough to realize in any decent interval of time how special the girl is and how he should stop letting her down dex and emma have their ups and downs but its never obvious why she carries a torch for this guy after shes aged out of her girlish hes so handsome attraction that results in a romance that is wistful halfhearted and melancholy a love affair without the spark that ignites such love affairs and if we cant root for the couple what is the point of the couple
Sep 28 2012,negative,  in the positives column rafe spall is a great addition as luckless comedian ian managing  the tricky task of making some who isnt funny appear funny and ken stott brings the required gravitas as dexters dad how he landed patricia clarkson as a wife is a gag that translates well from page to screen there are a number of wonderful character moments not from the book that raise a smile emmas awkward cartwheel on the beach dexters cringeworthy interview with a bunch of rappers tilly killicks karaoke but one day is largely a faithful and surprisefree adaptation of the source material  surprise free apart from that bit obviously which is just as gutwrenching and completely fucking horrible as you expect  but then im coming preloaded with 20 years worth of backstory which i shouldnt let affect my judgement hathaway and sturgess obviously enjoy an easy chemistry and the timeskipping format does at least keep the pace zippy albeit at the cost of some of the more characterbuilding moments dexters letters emmas school affair etc determined to get another point of view i texted a friend who also saw one day and asked her what she thought her response was as follows   well there you have it it wasnt just me maybe two stars is stingy add a star if you havent already read the book but then you could just read the book yeah definitely do that but dont say i didnt warn you 
Dec 22 2011,neutral, an average romantic dramedy one day tips its hand so early in the game that you wont be a bit surprised by anything that ensues anne hathaway stars as emma who graduates from college the same day as dex jim sturgess across the universe that day happens to be july 15 1988 st swithins day which is observed in england and thats when we see the couple in succeeding years their awkward beginning forms the basis for a lengthy friendship he comes from an aristocratic family mom is played by the alwaysenjoyable patricia clarkson and he figures hes bound for something great emma who lacks confidence doesnt share his aspirations she ends up working in a mexican restaurant although she would rather be a writer dex becomes a latenight tv show host hooked on cocaine and drink into which the fast lane has propelled him still the two seek comfort in each other particularly on july 15 during their annual meeting as best friends they encourage each other through bad choices in intimate partners and through good choices that steer their lives toward the better they also help each other deal with losses in other words they continue to be in each others lives as they mature and just plain grow up taking responsibility for their lives and for teaching each other lessons hathaway as always is gorgeous to watch she always radiates a genuineness that is so engaging that you wont mind the fact her british accent isnt always on the mark sturgess is fine as dex who comes off more and more as a spoiled cad who doesnt think much about tomorrow or for that matter planning the next hour or so some of this is fun to watch particularly when the two are feeling romantic toward each other although neither will confess the feelings they have there is chemistry at work between these two nicelooking leads and the european settings are as luminous as the two stars are striking which makes for some beautiful eyecatching moments but the movie which occasionally moves back and forth in time is so easy to predict that you may feel let down at the end its not a bad movie its just not a particularly memorable one if you want to see this theme played out in a way that will make you laugh and cry watch the classic same time next year with alan alda and ellen burstyn that is a movie to remember
Dec 7 2011,negative, it should have been a match made in heaven teaming up the stars of two of the more avantgarde and risque romantic movies for the past few years  love and other drugs and across the universe  with a danish director who had already made an acclaimed periodset literary adaptation unfortunately the end result is a halfbaked virtually humourless romantic muddle that doesnt do the muchloved book justice a cross between when harry met sally can they ever really just be friends and 500 days of summer a distillation of a relationships falls and rises one day lacks the formers wit and the latters invention part of the problem is that theres little chemistry between the leads and the storys brief running time and episodic nature doesnt help that sturgess cant transcend the fact that dexter is basically an upperclass prat while hathaway just struggles with the accent and a terribly underwritten character scherfig tries to enliven proceedings with clever teachersesque titles and a soundtrack that includes everyone from tracey chapman to tears for fears and del amitri to fat boy slim but you cant help feeling this dreary tale could have done with a bit of fancy editing or narrative reconstruction
Dec 1 2011,positive, the most entertaining and engrossing romantic film to hit theaters in ages one day details the comings and goings of platonic friends emma morley anne hathaway and dexter mayhew jim sturgess over a period of about two decades  with the movie catching up with the pair on the same day once a year its a decidedly unusual premise thats employed to consistently enthralling effect by filmmaker lone scherfig as the director working from david nicholls script deftly transforms emma and dexter into likable engaging figures right from the getgo  which in effect does force the viewer to immediately sympathize with and root for the wouldbe couples ongoing exploits the palpable chemistry between hathaway and sturgess undoubtedly plays a pivotal role in the movies success and theres little doubt that the episodic nature of the narrative which admittedly does take some getting used to ultimately proves instrumental in cultivating a remarkably complete picture of the ups and downs in the protagonists lives by the time the unabashedly tearjerking finale rolls around one day has certainly established itself as an uncommonly captivating thoroughly moving romance that stands among the best that the genre has to offer based on a novel by lissa evans their finest follows several wwiiera filmmakers as they attempt produce a moralebooasting propaganda picture  with their efforts consistently and predictably confounded by a series of frustrating complications its immediately clear that filmmaker lone scherfig along with scripter gaby chiappe isnt looking to cultivate an atmosphere of subtlety here as their finest from its opening minutes has been suffused with an overly polished feel thats been geared towards the lowest common denominator  with scherfigs increasingly desperate efforts at cultivating a feelgood vibe growing more and more unpleasant and distracting as time progresses theres little doubt too that the movies wholly uninvolving nature is compounded by a series of bland lead performances with especially gemma arterton and sam claflin unable to infuse their respectively onedimensional characters with anything even resembling energy or charisma its a situation thats compounded by a thirdact emphasis on the pairs almost hilariously lifeless romance and while some of the behindthescenes stuff on the film shoot is admittedly interesting their finests total lack of momentum results in a narrative that lurches from one dull paddedout setpiece to the next  which ensures that scherfigs eventual efforts at transforming the movie into a fullfledged tearjerker fall hopelessly flat its ultimately difficult to envision a less effective treatment of somewhat promising material with scherfigs slick bythenumbers approach inevitably rendering the movies few positive attributes utterly moot eg a  typically charismatic performance by bill nighy
Sep 18 2011,negative, lone scherfig most recently known for directing an education with this adaptation of the successful romantic novel of the same name brings to life a tale of two people that is told by checking in on them on july 15 every year through two decades starting in 1988 with their graduation from university in edinburgh we follow idealistic emma hathaway and the charming dexter sturgess who get acquainted on graduation day and begin a friendship that follows them through the decades as the years roll by we see them in various situations but always held together by the connection they share perhaps some things just do not translate to the big screen or perhaps the slightly new narrative twists added by author david nicholls who also wrote the script were one modification too far but one day lacks the emotional impact the book was famous for the leads work well together but are held back by cheap sentimentalism when we should be on a journey with the characters opting to lend more from weepies gone by than the source material scherfig still manages to evoke a lump in the throat by the end still this story of two lives intertwined should be far more powerful than it is
Sep 16 2011,negative,such a simple and small premise would and should yield a simple and small movie  something not so heavy and epic but more lovely and amazing
Sep 8 2011,positive,sherfigs visual knack is better than she realizes she should stop dressing it up within an inch of its life
Sep 2 2011,positive, same time next year anne hathaway and jim sturgess play friends whose rocky relationship is revisited on the same day each year in one day those who were enchanted by the novel storytelling structure in the 2009 romance 500 days of summer where moments throughout the 500day lifespan of a relationship are randomly accessed should find the device employed here similarly engaging after hooking up on graduation day in the late 1980s young brits emma anne hathaway and dexter jim sturgess embark on a lifelong friendship the progress of which is chronicled on the same day each year despite the storys episodic stopstart framework its a surprisingly smooth wellsculpted journey as the status of their parallel lives  full of dashed dreams personal disappointments career derailments family entanglements and relationship adventures  are continually refreshed every few minutes with the cohesive nature of the narrative no doubt the result of david nicholls adapting his own novel danish director lone scherfig an education deliberately veers away from comedy to deliver a surprisingly earthy soulful romance warmly recommended as a thoughtful date movie for the matureminded general
Sep 2 2011,negative,its a profoundly moving book still the movie is strangely remote and straining for tears
Sep 2 2011,negative,a frothy cappuccino of a film with lots of tears quivering lips and cathartic embraces and little substance
Sep 2 2011,positive,it doesnt quite deliver on its promise but this remains a witty touching and largely enjoyable adaptation
Sep 2 2011,negative,what shouldve been an epic romance a challenger to the notebook becomes a melancholy disconnected drama despite the talent on display
Sep 2 2011,negative,the most desperate cloying weepie seen in many a long time
Sep 2 2011,positive, based on the bestselling novel of the same name and adapted for the screen by the same writer david nicholls dont be surprised to see quotes like this decades the notebook plastered left right and centre on posters for one day but perhaps surprisingly it is actually quite entertaining after spending the night together on graduation night at college thus starts a romance that spans more than a decade following emma hathaway and dexter sturgess year on year as they fall into and out of each others lives even when it seems most unlikely however a powerful love in their heart always keeps the pair seemingly destined for one another one day is a standard chickflick front and centre but only checking in with the pair on the same day each year it feels different to the usual big city glamorous tale pulling away from feeling utterly clichéd and far outdoing the terrible trailer one day develops nicely and its pleasing it takes so long for the central couple to eventually get together spreading the emotional weight out over the whole film while at the start anne hathaways english accent is a little suspect she soon grows into it and as ever its hard not to find the talented actress utterly absorbing if youre looking for a deeper meaning you wont find it but jim sturgess is likeable too and you quickly grow to root for the both of them fan the fire is a digital magazine about lifestyle and creative culture launching back in 2005 as a digital publication about sonys psp handheld games console weve grown and evolved now covering the arts and lifestyle architecture design and travel
Aug 31 2011,positive,theres not really a chance to go very deep here but the two leads are so strong that they make us believe in them anyway
Aug 31 2011,positive, is danish director lone scherfig creating a new genre of revisionist romantic films her three englishlanguage films on the surface all appear to be mainstream romantic dramas with their softlighting seductive soundtracks appealing characters and warm ambiance however underneath the boymeetsgirl narratives are challenging and uncomfortable themes that seem designed to deliberately undermine romantic conventions wilbur wants to kill himself 2002 is about suicide an education 2009 is about a relationship between a teenage girl and an older man with dubious motives and now one day is about missed opportunities and failing to embrace the moment even scherfigs breakthrough film italian for beginners 2000 made under the stylistic restrictions of the dogme 95 movement features a lot of grief and death amid the various romantic storylines while one day is scherfigs least accomplished film it still contains what is becoming her trademark blend of enticing film style and dark thematic undercurrents resulting in a film that is both romantic and unsettling adapted by and when did you last see your father scriptwriter david nicholls from his own 2009 novel one day is intriguingly structured it tells the story of its two protagonists across twenty years by only depicting events that occur each year on 15 july inevitably some of the events that occur on that day are conveniently of monumental importance but mostly the days are used to provide an impression of how the characters have progressed or failed to progress twelve months on from when we last saw them this extreme elliptical device does result in two decades flying by very quickly while the novel presumably dwelt on the significance of each day with more depth in the film it does feel more like a series of snapshots designed to simply flag where we are at in the narrative the two protagonists are emma anne hathaway and dexter jim sturgess who have an awkward encounter early in the morning on 15 july 2010 after their graduation and then spend the next twenty years navigating their resulting friendship they are obviously attracted to each other sexually and romantically but as one day is a drama and not a screwball comedy the audience are left uncertain if they will ever move out of the friends zone a major problem with one day is it struggles to maintain interest in whether or not this will happen due to the unevenness of character development and presentation an immense amount of sympathy is established early on for shy and low selfesteemed emma on the other hand dexter comes across as obnoxious and selfabsorbed and its difficult to see what emma likes in him even as a friend scherfig knows how to make an audience empathise with theoretically dislikeable characters as she demonstrated with the lars kaalund character in italian for beginners but dexter doesnt have enough depth to make the audience care about what happens to him dexters flaws should make him the more interesting character but hes not meanwhile emma is largely reduced to his object of desire and yet despite the patchiness including an outofplace meet the parents sequence involving a family game gone wrong and the heavily signposted and melodramatic plot points one day concludes magnificently the final scenes in the film significantly redeem a lot of what had come previously and distinguish it as a lone scherfig film rather than a slightly above average romance with a quirky approach to narrative by colliding the past and the present through editing scherfig fills in a lot of the gaps about why emma and dexter continued to be in each others lives and how that will resonate in the future by doing so scherfig does what she does best  slyly subverts the romance genre the sting in the tail is that one day is not a film about the whims of fate but a film about the disappointments and regrets that result from not acting on opportunities when they are presented and being blind to what is around you its about squandering good fortune wasting life pursuing trivialities settling for second best and the cruelty of selfrealisation coming later in life when it is needed much earlier there are some beautiful moments in the final fifteen minutes or so of one day giving it a brilliantly melancholic resolution to an otherwise mild film great review sturgess and hathaway are fun to watch together but the rest of the film just feels like a gimmick that was done wrong and brings nothing new at all to the conventions of the romantic drama i saw this film last night here in south florida  the reviews and viewer comments here have been pretty bad but i hadnt seen them prior to the screening  this film is getting an undeservedly bad rap for some reason  maybe its because weve had so many romantic comedies here this past summer in the northern hemispherefriends with benefits  crazy stupid love  that people arent ready for blunt realism albeit with lighter scenes as well  it succeeded in encompassing the twenty years even though critics didnt like the device  its not only a film about lost opportunities but also about succumbing to whats most easily available even though that might be a bad idea  there are powerful scenes here  as you observe the final fifteen minutes are very moving and redeeming and showed that the director actually crafted the previous 90 minutes rather well i thought the performances of the leads were excellent  i also liked sturgess in across the universe  another doomed film here  the films i like never make money  hathaway also did very well in brokeback mountain  an exception to the money rule i share you sentiments tom i had a number of problems with this film but i still found a lot to admire i would certainly sit through it a dozen more times rather than suffer through friends with benefits ever again while we are talking about great anne hathaway films make sure you check out rachel getting married if you havent already its an incredible film and she is fantastic in it thanks so much for recommending rachel getting married the reason i value your reviews is because as you observe when i like a film id rather see it again instead of seeing something that isnt up to par  i began doing this quite by accident when i was comparing screenings of the digital v celluloid versons of films digital was the winner and was surprised at how much i enjoyed seeing them again for their artistic merit i enjoyed the review i saw on box office punch up i think it was nice to see how the film compared to the book i thought the film was distinctly average myself but my friend adored it

Aug 28 2011,negative, this disappointing film adapted by david nicholls from his truthful highly entertaining novel first published in 2009 covers some 16 years in the life of emma morley anne hathaway a workingclass bluestocking educated at a yorkshire comprehensive and dexter mayhew jim sturgess a handsome uppermiddleclass wykehamist they spend an intimate sexually unconsummated night together after graduation from the university of edinburgh in 1988 and subsequently they meet or correspond annually on its anniversary the numinous st swithins day 15 july hes socially confident but shallow and intellectually insecure and graduated with a 22 in anthropology shes socially insecure but intellectually assured politically alert and principled and got a double first in english and anthropology dexter rises rapidly in schlock yoof tv and then sinks in a sea of booze and a haze of cocaine she drifts amusingly for us into a variety of odd jobs before teaching and then finds herself as the author of childrens books we wonder what attracts a smart wisecracking girl to such a dislikable man but then such affairs do occur and there are intimations that this worm is going to develop some backbone reading the novel one becomes aware of the films it resembles like same time next year the characters agree to meet annually while living separate lives like when harry met sally they affect to believe that sexual intimacy is the enemy of true friendship and draw up a code of practice to support this ethic like the way we were a couple from different backgrounds and with contrasting temperaments and sensibilities live through turbulent times their private lives reflecting public events like love story theres an underlying threat of a cruel fate about to scupper the lives of this mismatched yet oddly yoked pair the novel compares more than favourably in wit sophistication and social insight with these movies the film version however is much like them thin superficial and sentimental its danish director lone scherfig who seemed confidently at home swimming in the currents of classconscious britain while making an education is here thrashing around in the unnuanced shallow end the casting and direction of the beautiful anne hathaway as the pretty bespectacled determined emma a sort of yorkshire cross between dorothy parker and mary mccarthy borders on the disastrous her accent is all over the map the best that can be said is that she sometimes resembles the youthful maureen lipman herself from yorkshire at times bespectacled and possessed of fine comic timing but who here appears to be rehearsing her repertoire of regional accents

Aug 26 2011,positive,even the hardesthearted will surely shed a tear
Aug 26 2011,positive, the pair decide to keep things platonic but then elect to meet annually on the same day over 20 years they share tears laughter and give each other shoulders to cry on as life throws up a series of curveballs its clear from the off that emma fancies the pants off dexter but hes more interested in sleeping around in fact the characters couldnt be more different shes a gawky but downtoearth girl who dreams of becoming a published writer but finds herself stuck in a deadend restaurant job hes a cocksure charmer who becomes a tv presenter with severe drink and drug problems exploring the familiar problems of finding the one and your place in the world the achingly middleclass tone is very similar to the old tv series cold feet also written by nicholls the one problem  and its a big one  is that you never get the sense that emma and dexter were made for one another its hard to buy into them even as friends since they have so little in common this means that  and im not giving anything away here  come their inevitable tryst it just seems plain wrong i just dont like you anymore best bit rafe spall is great as emmas boyfriend worst bit flat chemistry between the leads if you liked
Aug 26 2011,positive, and so finally it arrives on the big screen one day has been described as the romance of the current century so its little surprise the film adaptation has been one of the eagerly anticipated films of the year and so finally it arrives on the big screen one day has been described as the romance of the current century so its little surprise the film adaptation has been one of the eagerly anticipated films of the year anne hathaway and jim sturgess take the leads as bookish yorkshire lass emma morley and charming ladies man dexter mayhew who have a drunken encounter on their graduation on st swithins day in 1988 and make a pact to remain friends when i sleep with someone i either end up crying or weeping we might bump into each other in the future well just be friends remarks em after a lame attempt at seducing dexter to which he replies lets keep in touch true to their words the two friends do stay in touch throughout the next few years as dex travels around the world while emma slaves away in a mexican restaurant in london their friendship revisited on july 15 across the years is tested first in 1992 when they decide on a spontaneous whim to go away on holiday together despite the friends working in london  dex channelling a young jonathan ross as his tv career hits a peak where he steals the crown as the king of carcrash tv while em who is now dating standup comic ian rafe spall trains as a teacher  they often lose touch before reconnecting again unsurprisingly the film directed by an educations lone scherfig with a script by the beloved books author david nicholls rushes through the characters lives over 20 years as they deal with the joys and heartbreaks of life hathaway  who has been described as too glamorous for the part  does a pretty good job although she switches between yorkshire and london accents with her american twang slipping out in certain scenes although spall steals the show as ian the other characters such as romola garai as dexs wife sylvie and patricia clarkson as his mother feel largely underused
Aug 26 2011,negative,if middleclass existentialism is not your cup of tea no amount of charm and nineties fashion is going to save this film from seeming pomp
Aug 26 2011,positive, lone scherfigs one day is another on that increasingly frustrating list of movies that i liked but wanted to love and didnt quite oh i think its certainly a good filma good film that focus features has killed any chances for success by releasing it on too many screens at oncebut it ought to have been a great one having spent two days trying to figure out why it doesnt quite work the best i can come up with is to blame everyone by this i mean that the writer the director and the stars are all slightly at fault no single one of them does anything that by itself thwarts the films ambitionsthe writer comes closestbut each of them contributes enough small missteps that the aggregate becomes impossible to ignore the premiseand the hookis simple emma anne hathaway and dexter jim sturgess spend the night of college graduationjuly 15together and then part the story behind that parting isnt revealed until late in the film the film then drops in on themsometimes theyre together often theyre noton future july 15ths over a period of 20 years people keep thinking this is somehow  like same time next year and it isnt in the least the idea is that we will learn about the two and of course wait for them to realize that theyre not only in love with each other but are meant to be together conceptually thats both clever and daunting in execution it works in broad strokes but doesntat least for mehave the emotional punch it ought to have not even when it takes its theoretically surprising turn its hard to fault the actingand no i dont give a damn whether or not anne hathaway has a real yorkshire accent hathaway is as good as the role allows but theres only so much that can be done with emma and the way the character is sketched in we learn for example that she once called dexters father ken stott a bourgeois fascist but we never learn why norapart from her selfconscious middleclass statusdo we get a glimpse of her views that would lead to it sheand the filmhowever are very adept at painting a picture of emma as someone who settles for things she nearly settles for working in a restaurant she does settle for teaching rather than writing and she settles for a nice but terminally dull boyfriend rafe spall in many respects the major thingdespite the screenplays insistence on something elsethat dexter does for her is make it hard for her to settle dexter himself is a trickier proposition it takes his mother patricia clarkson a good while to conclude hes no longer a nice person and even longer for emma to decide i still love you dex but i dont like you anymore no thats not a spoiler thats way before the ending it takes the viewer much less time to conclude that dexter is pretty much a selfabsorbed jerk jim sturgess barely manages to skate by the middle sections of the film on his innate likableness but only barely the filmand the fact that he looks increasingly batteredrectifies this but a somewhat sour taste for the narcissistic spoiled rich boy turned smarmy tv host remains the worst of it though is the facile manner in which everything is tidied up through a single improbable conversation that i cant reveal here and then we have another case of a movie that seems to have not one ending but a series of them any one would have been fine but taken one after another i ended up feeling like wc fields being subjected to endless choruses of a song in the old fashioned way 1934to a point where i nearly muttered oh youre really finished this timewhich is not im sure what was intended but dont misunderstand i did like the movie i did admire the attempt at something different and i do think it a shame that it will never have the time to find its audience in the way a limited release might have afforded it catch it while you can rated pg13 for sexual content partial nudity some violence and substance abuse the comments section is here to provide a platform for civil dialogue on the issues we face together as a local community xpress is committed to offering this platform for all voices but when the tone of the discussion gets nasty or strays off topic we believe many people choose not to participate xpress editors are determined to moderate comments to ensure a constructive interchange is maintained all comments judged not to be in keeping with the spirit of civil discourse will be removed and repeat violators will be banned see here for our terms of service thank you for being part of this effort to promote respectful discussion sounds like a good movie for us this weekend as i was one of the ones that thought it was a remake of same time next year i put the entire blame on the ads which made it seem that way never saw it it came out at a time i hardly ever watched tv because i was working on a play at the time and i just never caught up to it how was it
Aug 26 2011,neutral, just about everyone will at some point or another have had one of those friendships that could amount to more the universality of unrequited  or mutual but unacted upon love  is such that anyone who has reached adolescence should find the central premise of lone scherfigs latest strike a chord which is why it is such a shame that the movie as a whole is so emotionally dissatisfying the will theywont they pair at the heart of the film are emma anne hathaway and dexter jim sturgess she is a downtoearth workingclass yorkshire lass  with glasses which means she is smart  while he is upper middleclass  with a floppy fringe which means he is a hooray henry who is also smart but is wasting his talents both of them of course will turn out to have hearts of gold beneath their failings after a drunken fumble on their 1988 graduation day in edinburgh that seems to amount to little more than sleepover cuddle rather than sex the pair go their separate ways vowing to keep in touch the film then dips in and out of their lives over the next 20 years catching up with them on a single day each year taking the temperature of their lives and their friendship while the idea of charting a longterm relationship via just one day a year may well work perfectly on paper its a much trickier concept on film the choppy nature of the narrative makes it hard to engage with some years for example are inevitably more interesting than others meaning that we long to linger with em and dex longer than we do while other years seem to barely further the story at all the passage of time is also an unwelcome distraction with some of the fashions seeming to stem from the wrong year altogether  the idea for example that emma would be wearing a fulllength under slip in 1988 is nothing short of laughable in fact the scenes in 1988 feel more suited to the time period of scherfigs farsuperior an education than something from the late thatcher era disbelief is suspended by a thread so fine it is in danger of snapping almost constantly first you marvel that someone as pretty as hathaway would be so bereft of boyfriends that she sees the david walliamsalike sweet but hopeless ian rafe spall as the only alternative to dexter then you wonder why on earth they cast patricia clarkson to have a stab at an english accent  a brave failure as is hathaways  when there are any number of excellent british thesps who would have been better suited to the role finally you wonder just how many endings it is possible for a film to have before the credits are allowed to roll despite this there are hints of the early richard curtisstyle sweetness that might have been if the films emotions werent constantly being overwhelmed by its unforgiving structure sturgess  channelling johnny vaughan  and hathaway have convincing chemistry when they are given the opportunity but the rest of the world they inhabit never feels truly believable it is clearly striving to say something profound about love and loss but ultimately one day is just too weak
Aug 26 2011,positive,everything about it is intended to let us know that the emotions in play here are real and nothing to be trifled with unfortunately it all centers around a relationship thats not so easy to root for
Aug 25 2011,negative,if you thought the only thing missing from movies based on nicholas sparks novels was questionably convincing english accents one day may be the movie for you
Aug 25 2011,neutral,movie love stories typically spend most of their running time keeping the lead couple apart until the inevitable final clinch but one day takes this strategy to an extreme it prolongs the sexual tension for almost twenty years

Aug 25 2011,positive, david nichollss one day is that rare thing  a romantic novel that male readers are drawn to at least as much as women in an era of great pessimism about the future of books its a work that inspires devotion as much as admiration that drives its fans to buy multiple copies to give to friends its also an angloamerican creation that marries a when harry met sally storyline to deeply english material adapted by nicholls himself its title refers to st swithins day thats when every year over the course of two decades emma morley and dexter mayhew university of edinburgh students who spent their graduation night together in 1988 meet up bemoan their love lives or sigh thoughtfully about how their friendship has developed children of the eighties of which nicholls is one will likely recall billy bragg singing the polaroids that hold us togetherwill surely fade awaylike the love that we spoke of for everon st swithins day emma is played by anne hathaway becoming jane brokeback mountain an actress who is as many people have pointed out an american its a measure of how deeply loved nichollss book is that this piece of casting has been portrayed in some quarters as a kind of treason the mousy yorkshire girl who blooms into a successful writer has become our em personally i would have liked to have seen rebecca hall who was such a revelation as the gauche bookish undergraduate in tom vaughans starter for 10 2006 from another novel by nicholls play emma still hathaway has the pale consumptive look that was so common among students in the eighties and may well return in this austere feesheavy decade her emma also wears the antibrideshead revisited uniform of the period wirerim glasses clomping big boots crap denim jackets she has an antinuclear nightshirt and listens to tracy chapman records what would she possibly see in a winchestereducated yuppie like dexter jim sturgess a man who after he becomes a wellknown chatshow host is described by one newspaper as the most annoying man on telly its a question the film never really asks yet alone answers hathaways accent has been widely mocked make that accents she shifts somewhat erratically between the softheaded northernisms you might hear in a victoria wood comic monologue and the posh estuaryisms that renée zellweger popularised in bridget joness diary this isnt a major flaw though and its easy to be too harsh many british people codeswitch these days and emma who spends much of her twenties working in a restaurant would be used to performing before diners the bigger flaw is that neither she nor dex is able to draw us into their fears feelings raptures or to suggest that theyre even capable of real emotions their hairstyles and outfits change but they themselves evolve very little often the settings are more charismatic than the leads cinematographer benoît delhomme captures the dingy artificiality of the mexican restaurant in london at which emma works the deadaired creepiness of the production studios at which dexter preens as a buffoonish new lad in the mould of chris evans and terry christian the airy escape emma finds in paris it says something about the lack of spark between the two leads that the most compelling performer far more so than patricia clarkson miscast as dexters cancerstricken mother is rafe spall as ian a struggling comedian with whom emma shacks up a cross between one of the jumbled losers in a mike leigh film and the seemingly insipid but actually quite sharp and kindly steve mirandas husband in sex and the city he offers an endless stream of dire gags ticky gestures and endearing outburst his confession to emma  i think youre the absolute bollocks  is the sweetest thing anyone says in the movie lone scherfig in italian for beginners 2000 which she made according to the austere rules of the danish dogme 95 movement and even in her very engaging treatment of lynn barbers memoir an education 2009 is a director whos happy to stay away from darkness the cankering sense of failure and the vertiginous grief that nicholls relayed so movingly in the novel are absent here snuffed out perhaps by the films episodic structure whats left is a pleasant occasionally amusing tragically tasteful romantic drama thats not an insignificant achievement but it does create an odd situation in which one day the book is more cinematic than one day the movie its a brave director who takes on a film adaptation of a wellloved romantic novel in particular a publishing phenomenon such as one day david nicholls tale of longdelayed love and loss viewers who have read the book are wont to have imagined their own preferred versions of the characters and are ready to pounce angrily on any perceived inauthenticity in this case the director lone scherfig  who made such a good job of the nuances of sixties britain in an education  might have hoped for some indemnity against criticism by having nicholls himself as a screenwriter if so she had reckoned without the controversy caused by casting anne hathaway the american actress in the role of emma morley the downtoearth yorkshire girl who carries a torch from her university days for posh troubled dexter jim sturgess even as he moves unsteadily through life with all the direction of a car with a broken sat nav although hathaway veils her striking prettiness rather well in the earlier scenes thanks to the eighties sartorial penance of shapeless clothes big glasses and doc martens the accent remains a drawback it veers unpredictably between received pronunciation and ee bah gum occasionally coming on yorkshire so strongly that in one scene i thought her character was doing it for a joke the problem with this aside from having a disorienting effect upon the audience is that it thereby fails to nail the novels subtle distinctions of class dexter is born with the natural sense of entitlement of the uppermiddle class and has a corresponding tendency to be careless with what hes got emma must according to yorkshire cliché pull herself up by her bootstraps hes got the charm and shes got the character until they find themselves nearly 20 years on still craving what the other has the snapshots of their relationship through the years of unspoken yearnings and botched signals are deftly handled although the shifting eras could have been tackled with greater zest yet if hathaways diction sometimes fails her the look in those liquid brown eyes can still speak volumes jim sturgess as dexter performs the considerable feat of making his character more likeable than in the book sturgess has an instinctive quickness as an actor and here manages to convey both the crassness of dexter  whose cockiness becomes a cokedup patina of selfloathing as his telly presenting career crashes and burns  and his complicit appeal
Aug 25 2011,positive,youll likely be wiping away the tears
Aug 25 2011,positive,quite unlike the movies which are so keen to continue the modern trend for grossness of the deepest order this film will touch the hearts of many

Aug 24 2011,negative, i havent read one day the book so i didnt know not to expect a same time next year sort of gimmick thats the 1978 dramedy in which alan alda and ellen burstyns adulterous couple meet just once a year for a tryst and a catchup and a reflection on life marriage growing older and all that rot instead in one day the movie we get a completely different gimmick we peek in on the lives of emma anne hathaway and dexter jim sturgess one day each year always on july 15th from the occasion of their graduation from university in edinburgh in the late 1980s through the solidification of their adult lives in the late 2000s in london its a particularly gimmicky sort of gimmick and a deeply dissatisfying one because its not as if emma and dexter dont see each other on many of the intervening days there seems to be no reason for the gimmick except for the coincidence of major events that bookend the story but theres no narrative urgency that requires these events to take place on the same day except to shoehorn them into the gimmick theres a lot of wouldbe wrenching stuff that one day tries to pull that it doesnt earn were meant to see emma and dexter who orbit around each other in a notquiteplatonic notquiteromantic friendship for many of these years as a perfect union of opposites whore are destined somehow to end up as lovers  the conversation about dexters yinyang tattoo smashes us over the head with this notion early in the film but getting us emotionally invested in such an eventuality and gripped with suspense waiting for it to happen requires that we actually like these two that we believe in them individually that we want to see them as a couple and that we buy that theres unresolved sexual tension between them would that that were the case i find jim sturgess legend of the guardians the owls of gahoole 21 relentlessly appealing in a niceguy sort of way which is perhaps why i never accepted not for one minute that he turns into a sleazebag tv personality in his 20s who cares for nothing but himself and his own hedonistic pleasures anne hathaways rio love and other drugs onscreen charms do not extend toward the brainy were meant to see emma as frumpy and literary neither of which she is capable of exuding hathaways accent  emma is from yorkshire  is fairly dreadful but it wouldnt have been enough to sink the movie if that was all that was wrong with it she cant help how pretty she is of course but a bad haircut and a pair of harry potter glasses cant hide it either sturgess and hathaway dont look like a mismatched pair of unlikely lovers which is how were supposed to see them they look like two beautiful people who will fall in movieized love because the script demands it of them and they never feel like theyre destined for each other except in the manipulative ways of poorly written movies that drag you inexorably toward their only possible conclusion the script is a major problem author david nicholls adapted his own novel amazon us amazon canada amazon uk which isnt always a good idea theres one moment early in the film when emma who dreams of being a writer is resolved to continuing to work in the dumpy mexican restaurant shes stuck in because who makes a living as a poet and dexter helpfully tells her you cant throw away years of your life because you think its funny that probably works in the novel and i bet nicholls loves this line he must for him to have lobbed it into the screenplay without anything to support it if emma is supposed to be someone with a snarky sense of selfdeprecation who would somehow find a way to work ironically in a mexican restaurant while say writing a novel theres no sense of that here we never get any notion of emma as a writer at all she merely goes from wanting to write to suddenly having written a bestselling novel deep meaningful lifes work that magically gets done profoundly important relationships that we never see grow maybe we needed to see a few more days each year all that though could probably be forgiven if only we were electrified by dexter and emma onscreen the unforgivable problem with one day is that it is dreadfully miscast i want to give director lone scherfig a pass on this because ive loved her other films an education is a remarkable and rare look at female adolescence and wilbur wants to kill himself is an unforgettable black comedy but as director shes responsible for casting she must have seen that hathaway and sturgess have no chemistry together she must have seen that both of them talented as they are are wildly wrong for these roles these stars through no fault of their own turn something that should be yearningly romantic into a wet blanket of sulking misery
Aug 24 2011,positive,impressively directed and sharply written this is an engaging and ultimately powerfully moving romantic drama with a superb supporting cast and terrific performances from its two leads
Aug 24 2011,negative, its just 24 hours out of a persons life but that can be a long momentous and rather depressing time  as ivan denisovich will tell you david nichollss hugely loved bestseller one day whose distinctive orange jacket design adorns beaches and traincarriages all over the country has now unfortunately been turned into a slushy mawkish and weirdly humourless romance with a subrichard curtis style and more endings than lord of the rings the big emotional climax is unearned and the allimportant high concept is now a bit blurred the point of the book is that each chapter gives us a snapshot update of the same two people on the same day every year 15th july pretty yorkshire lass emma and handsomeyetvulnerable smoothie dexter spend the night together on this date in 1988 their graduation day at edinburgh university they never become a couple but the story follows their twin lives on this day over the next 20 years sometimes together sometimes poignantly apart its a terrifically neat idea on the page on screen little titles pop up to tell you which year were on but without those i frankly wonder whether anyone without previous knowledge of the book would particularly notice the one day organising principle it looks much like any other movie storyline brooklynborn anne hathaway plays emma and there have been mutterings about her yorkshire accent well its not as terrible as all that compared with josh hartnett who had to play a keighley lad in the 1999 brit comedy blow dry hathaway sounds like geoff boycott in drag and jim sturgess is perfectly all right as dex their relationship has some sweet touches but the movie never has much space to breathe and there are only one or two real laugh lines in the entire film i couldnt help remembering marc webbs flawed but interesting romantic comedy 500 days of summer in which key days from a love affair between joseph gordonlevitt and zooey deschanel are presented to us out of order the shuffling technique defamiliarised the personae and gave the audience some perspective perhaps backtofront dramas such as pinters betrayal and françois ozons 5x2 do the same thing well this isnt what one day is about each day comes in sequence yet gradually incremental changes turn out to be easier and more enjoyably described in a book than dramatised in a film rafe spall and romola garai have supporting roles as people with whom em and dex dally while in denial about their romantic destiny and they do a decent job as does everyone else but the day has not been seized

Aug 24 2011,positive,it may not truly capture the complexities of its source material but one day is funny winning and entertaining  if little else
Aug 23 2011,positive, he is familiar to people living in the middle georgia area as the entertainment man since his entertainment reviews run in newspapers and are shown on television there 
Aug 23 2011,positive, the one day is july 15th and in 1988 as they both graduate from the university of edinburgh dexter and emma have a friendly night together there is sex and on ems part at least there is love this is still a movie in which the girl is reckoned to feel love sooner and with more loyalty dex assumes he is handsome and commanding enough to be an adventurer and a flake with a field to play and no urge to commitment but ive only told you the half of it or less than half they are also anne hathaway and jim sturgess two pretty actors with a lot of talent but quite helpless with any notion that they might be making an attempt on real and ordinary people this is from a bestselling and allegedly beloved novel by david nicholls who has done his own script for a movie directed by lone scherfig a danish woman who directed an education i havent read the book and i dont think i will but the structure of the movie is cute and inane over the years we keep up with em and dex every july 15th why well i suppose it seemed like a sweet and artful idea to someone and it does permit all manner of fatuous graphics to tell us heres that lovely day again all of which get in the way of a more interesting possibilitythat we might truly follow a relationship over a period of say twenty years what kind of friends or lovers only think of each other on st swithins day why is the real pattern of obsession drift memory and forgetting reduced to a weird hallmark occasion and why should anyone cater to this fancy when two edible young stars are in sight with every sign of developing intelligence they know and we know that theyre coming together because movies cant resist concepts like true love and made for each other yet in life of course such creeds are not reliable and people do all manner of things in defiance of casting and the intractable laws of movie alliance we insist on being stupid im not going to spoil one days story except to say that the movie acts as its own spoiler with a drastic intervention that may be a nervous defense mechanism against the films accumulation of sweetness as well as a way of getting off after all july 15th could go on and on past retirement and dementia a movie needs a resolution the biggest advantage the form has over life none of this sounds promising especially if you consider that these two people live through the years without any marked sense of the world and what is going on its true that dex becomes an odious television host on what is called a show for young people and in fairly broad strokes we see how his early flakiness prompts a kind of moral downfall so em goes through a stage when she loves him but really cannot like him all the greater pity that ems gradual progress from working in a mexican restaurant and being a school teacher leads to her becoming a novelist i can buy that but i deserve to know about the book she writes it seems to be a success how it shifts the balance in her mind and promotes an adult personality any real novelist would know enough to write dex offand even to make him a warning figure in an expose novel but that courage or critical observation would break the cultural class system of made for each other which weighs more heavily in one day than the british economy blair and iraq global warming or the rampant advance in britain of electronic technology to say nothing of the new aristocracy of shits in other words dex and em are never allowed entry to the real world such as weve seen in the 7up series of documentaries and yet the film is worth seeing in great part because i think ms scherfig has genuine talent you see this most of all in the careful treatment of some of the supporting charactersabove all dexs parents who plainly were not made for each other but who have learned ways of working it out that is a great lesson for the rest of the film for instance our madeforeachother couple do come together after years of being passing ships then for a moment clouds of dismay and unease drift across the bright blue of happinessand that would have been worth exploring because thwarted longing can be easier to sustain than close company in the end however the reason to see this very lightweight film and the reason why it may touch you is because hathaway and sturgess have become the objects of our emotional investment there are difficulties with hathaway she is meant to be british but cant help sounding american at times try as she might she doesnt have it in her to repress her brighteyed radiance she ages in only minor and flattering waysno one puts on weight and she isnt allowed to acquire the demanding selfishness of a creative personality never mind hathaway improves all the time and i can believe there might be something grand coming as for jim sturgess last seen in peter weirs the way back he is a clever deft actor when he has to listen to his dying mother patricia clarkson tell him that he needs to change his ways struggling feelings cross his lovely but debauched face like toothache together hathaway and sturgess deliver one important dividend they make us feel we have been on a journey with these people you could watch one day and feel excited by a stunning proposition suppose you made a movie about two real friends in the twenty or so years after they graduate instead one day is just a gimmicky new way of doing an oldfashioned love story but well hear much more of sturgess hathaway and lone scherfig
Aug 22 2011,neutral, this is jeff bayer and i dont update this site very often if youd like to listen to my current movie podcast you can find it at moviebscom plot based on the novel by david nicholls dexter sturgess and emma hathaway spend the night together after college graduation and then are shown each year on the same date for many years after sometimes they are together sometimes not whos it for fans of the book will appreciate seeing this come to life also if youre a fan of missed opportunity loves stories youll enjoy it expectations hathaway normally delivers while i havent felt the same about strugess plus it seems like a good gimmick to tell a romance scherfig directed an education and i loved that film ending they try not to end the movie on a downer which is a good call but i really could have used that feeling at the beginning of the film questions did the movie start at one minute after midnight on july 15 also why make dex so unlikable without giving me a reason to root for the two of them to be together rewatchability no thanks though my wife will be reading the book so it might be fun to watch the film with her and learn the differences from book to film one day feels like a gimmick that unfortunately never quite works its july 15 over and over again throughout the years dex is selfish sex crazed a drug abuser and extremely unlikable emma likes him correction emma loves him at times do you know what this does for me it makes me dislike emma a little bit how could she like this guy so much not only that im not a supersappy nice guy who always feels like i finish last i know this because i also dont care for ian and cant stand that emma leads him on its a romance i never want to happen i dont ever feel like i get to know the people around dexter and emma the perfect example is on one july 15 when dex is visiting with his new girlfriends family its some game where you whack someone in the face with a newspaper dexter doesnt listen and takes an early swing nailing his girlfriend that kind of physical comedy is funny but has nothing to do with me feeling connected to these people the gimmick means youre only in these moments for a little bit of time i found myself waiting for the next knowing they couldnt spend too much time in any specific place with 20 years to cover
Aug 22 2011,positive,  two appealing stars and a director of talent throw themselves against a glib highconcept story until youre worn out from hoping it turns out better theres promise in it but no matter how gracefully or handsomely or smoothly made it is it never offers more than that promise and as it fizzles along you stop rooting for it bit by bit even though it recovers some near the end adapted from david nicholls novel one day tells the story of emma and dexter who graduate university on july 15 1988 and mark the date by nearly sleeping together instead they become friends  albeit with a constant strain of romance between them  and the film revisits the twists and turns and shapes of their lives which sometimes intersect on each july 15 for the next two decades there are jobs and lovers and spouses and houses and madcap vacations and joys shared and accidental pains inflicted bookish emma is more enamored of playboy dexter than he of her but even in the satyric revels that constitute his life he feels the strength of their bond over the years various moments between them throb with romance but they never quite get there and so each goes on to the wrong relationship or in his case a series of them with the nagging sense that the right person has been there all along emma is played by anne hathaway and dexter by jim sturgess and you couldnt ask for more personable or comely performers in the roles hathaway does a credible english accent and manages as in the devil wears prada to look mousy or ravishing as required sturgess playing a broader range than in across the universe or 21 is able  though fittingly for his role he still sort of coasts on that young paul mccartneypuppy dog thing hes got going alongside them rafe spall son of timothy invests emmas mismatched beau with a real savor of inner pain camouflaged  badly  with a façade of merriment handsome likable stars cant overcome an artificial story about two college chums hathaway and sturgess who nearly become lovers one july 15 and are revisited annually on that date for 20 years scherfig an education has craft and skills but the storytelling is leaden and distancing but the performers cant puncture the phoniness and artificiality at the heart of the film that job falls  or should have  to director lone scherfig who most recently delivered the dazzling an education which plays with somewhat similar themes and tones but without any sense of makebelieve or manipulation scherfig still displays fine craft the film is quietly beautiful and occasionally gorgeous but she cant make the characters come alive in such a cardboard situation in a sense one day is a bottle quite like an education but scherfig never fills it with the least bit of lightning the flaw finally might be in the material having not read nicholls novel i cant comment on its literary merit or on the fidelity of the adaptation but i sense that the device of the recurrent midsummer visits to the characters might feel less contrived on the page than on the screen where time spans are more abbreviated characters states of mind and heart are less readily revealed and ironies of fate are more crudely telegraphed unfolding as chapters in a novel a series of momentous july 15ths might acquire weight in this film though it feels obligatory and shallow and one day despite its attractiveness never manages to find a way to bring the conceit fully to life if you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site we may receive compensation by using this site you consent to our user agreement and agree that your clicks interactions and personal information may be collected recorded andor stored by us and social media and other thirdparty partners in accordance with our privacy policy use of andor registration on any portion of this site constitutes acceptance of our  user agreement updated 442023  privacy policy and cookie statement  and your privacy choices and rights  updated 12312023  2024 advance local media llc all rights reserved about us the material on this site may not be reproduced distributed transmitted cached or otherwise used except with the prior written permission of advance local
Aug 21 2011,negative, if youre looking for a great romance this isnt it one day is a drag i wish it had been only one day but it is many many days spread over nearly 20 years the poster for the film shows anne hathaway and jim sturgess embracing in the street in a hot and heavy kiss this is what we like to call false advertising if only there had been a memorable embrace by anyone in this movie anything to latch onto the gimmick derived from david nicholls novel is that students emma and dexter sort of hook up on the last night of college in england in 1988 and then try to meet on that same date july 15 every year through 2006 for a film like this to work you need an immediate connection to the characters or you need the two characters to be extremely charming clever and likable so that it doesnt really matter what they are up to or you need what theyre up to to be so diverting that it doesnt matter much if the characters lack connectivity or likability one day offers none of these things emma and dexter meet and meet and meet she is a waitress and wannabe writer he is a tacky tv host they love each other but mostly as friends and emma has strict platonic rules to follow when they are together emma and dexter lack chemistry and they find that their visits often lack luster if theyre bored by their recurring encounters imagine how we feel cliches abound dexter is into drugging and drinking his mother is dying of cancer emma shacks up in a loveless relationship with a dullard time marches on marked by changing hairstyles and bad british accents typewriters become laptops its kind of a contemporary same time next year minus the witty dialogue nicholls cannot blame some soulless screenwriter for twisting his words because he wrote the screenplay i suppose director lone scherfig who did a terrific job with an education in 2009 was hoping we would greet each new rendezvous with heightened anticipation instead they become moments of dread when 1993 flashed on the screen i thought oh dear god does that mean we have to sit through 13 more of these if you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site we may receive compensation by using this site you consent to our user agreement and agree that your clicks interactions and personal information may be collected recorded andor stored by us and social media and other thirdparty partners in accordance with our privacy policy use of andor registration on any portion of this site constitutes acceptance of our  user agreement updated 442023  privacy policy and cookie statement  and your privacy choices and rights  updated 12312023  2024 advance local media llc all rights reserved about us the material on this site may not be reproduced distributed transmitted cached or otherwise used except with the prior written permission of advance local
Aug 21 2011,negative,   ive read several articles about this movie that compare it to when harry met sally because the two leads are friends before they become lovers i can see why they would say that but the relationship between emma and dexter is much closer to katie and hubble in the way we were than it ever is to harry and sally although never does this movie even approach the greatness of that 1970s classic nor for that matter does it come close to when harry met sally there are some nice moments in it but i would never call it a classic   the gimmick of the film  and it very much feels like a gimmick  is that we see two people on july 15th every year for 20 years it starts with the night of their graduation when emma a nerdy politically active girl were told and dexter a popular golden boy almost sleep together but  then decide  well he decides  that they should just become friends instead   over the following years dexter becomes a television presenter party animal and kind of a selfish asshole emma gets stuck in a dead job and in a relationship with a very unfunny standup comic the years roll on and dexters career tanks while emmas suddenly takes off as a writer they remain friends although its obvious that she has deeper feelings for him than he does for her until one day it all changes   its been said time and time again on the pages of this site that the most important aspect of a romantic film is that the audience needs to care whether the leads get together and they need to see that these two should be together frankly i never thought these two should get together and i only really cared because emma wanted it so much even if i never did see just why she wanted him so much   i think a big problem with the story is that it should have started a few years earlier like hubble i have the feeling that dexter peaked at university and the rest of his life was a slow sinking from that emma on the fringes of college life would have looked at him and aspired to his ease and popularity instead when we first meet dexter he behaves rather insensitively and he continues to be insensitive to emmas and everyone elses feelings for the rest of the film   anne hathaway delivers another brilliant performance although her english accent is rather dubious its so vague that i had no idea she was supposed to be doing a northern accent until i read an article that told me so despite the occasional flattening of her vowels however she is lovely as emma maybe she cant do the english voice but she does do the repressed english longing quite well   her other half doesnt fare so well sturgess does a decent enough job as dexter but hes nothing special he doesnt have enough charisma to make up for the characters faults and so i was left constantly wondering what emma and everyone else saw in him   by sticking to the films gimmick the story is forced to do one of two things either every important thing that happens to the two of them must happen on that date or the story is going to have to skip some important events the script opts for skipping important events which is fine except that it skips the night the two finally have sex for the first time picture when harry met sally without the scene where the two of them sleep together for the first time and then having sally just casually mention it in a later scene thats how i felt when it happened here   the book this movie is based on has been a best seller for the past two years and received critical praise i can only assume despite the script being written by the author of the novel that something was lost in the translation   i have that same feeling about the book being much better than this movie version in an interview david nicholls the author of the book and screenplay stated that the biggest difference between page and screen is the fact that you cannot film a characters inner thoughts the way you can describe them with words i personally disagree with that statement a well written script should convey exactly what the characters are thinking but it at least explains why the movie never delves very far beneath the surface actions of the characters most likely the book gives more insight into just what emma sees in dexter   i agree that anne hathaway gives another stellar performance she nearly overcomes her characters vague motivations such as why she stays so long in a deadend job and why she gets involved with the standup comic in the first place both of these decisions hint at a lack of selfesteem yet that issue is never fully explored   what empathy the movie musters for the characters is due entirely to her her subdued yet heartfelt pining for dexter almost makes you care what happens to them there are a few moments of genuine emotion but overall i was disappointed  fyi her accent sounded fine to my ears but then i havent spent nearly as much time listening to the english speaking as my brother scott has   and the july 15th angle definitely seems like a gimmick and since the movie makes such a big deal about the passage of time it seems odd that such scant attention is paid to the actual details of the changes in world events technology fashion and music over the years and with the exception of dexter going a bit gray at the temples neither he nor em noticeably age over the course of 2 decades   patricia clarkson has a few good scenes as dexters cancer stricken mother and ken stott is good as dexters loving but stern and emotionally repressed father we are never shown ems parents or told much about her backstory except that she is clearly working class while dexter comes from money   the only thing that one day reminded me about when harry met sally is that harry told sally that a man and a woman cannot be friends as the sex always gets in the way  the fact that emma wanted dexter so much and he just wanted to be friends is ridiculous  on their first date he gets naked and jumps into her bed  when on vacation he convinces her to go skinny dipping  he never lost sexual interest in her  had they in fact had sex that first night they would have likely never had any deeper of a relationship    the writing and editing is horrible  the scene where dexter needs desperately to speak to emma but cannot get ahold of her is incomplete  his father has just told him off and he needs a friend while she is off on a date  before they talk it cuts to another year  the gimmick of the years is annoying  they flirt with each other to nauseam  by the time they get to paris i wanted the movie to be over    patrick wrote that scant attention is paid to the actual details of the changes in world events technology fashion and music over the years  i disagree  many details are thrown in such as the different popular songs and the video game from 1995  when cell phones became popular emma tells dexter he will get cancer from it    the films biggest flaw is that dexter is a dick  he is rude as hell to emma at a restaurant  when an old college classmate offers him a job dexter insults him  when playing a game with a girlfriend he stupidly hits her so hard she bleeds  i did not like this shallow self centered idiot  emma could do so much better than him    dexter is an extravert while emma is an introvert  he took her places and gave her experiences she would never have had without him  she meanwhile provides a female companionship that is is not made complicated by sex  it is a rather flimsy basis for a relationship   i never became emotionally invested in emmas and dexters song and dance and was thus not moved by the ending  the book maybe great this film however is anything but
Aug 20 2011,positive, one day is an unconventional love story told in an unconventional style the conceit of dropping in on them once a year on st swithins day july 15 to check their rocky progression from the 1980s through to the 21st century is as arch and penetrating as it is effective in stripping the story of any trace of flabby exposition and getting to the heart of the infinite complexity of relationships events piled on events are less important than the neat summation from year to year of where emma anne hathaway and dexter jim sturgess stand in relation to themselves and one another  it begins in 1988 as the two graduate from college and fall drunkenly into one anothers arm its less impersonal than it sounds at least for emma though events prevent them from sealing the deal as it were they decide to become friends the which they do with a fervent devotion that survives miscues crosspurposes thirdparties and the ebb and flow of their fortunes its obvious even to them that they are soul mates but of what specific variety eludes them as emma waits for dexter to grow up and dexter waits for emma to find her inner worth its not an easy wait and there is at no time any guarantee of a happy ending dexter discovers the allure of the blonde girlfriend emma discovers the mixed blessings of surrendering to ian rafe spall the desperately unfunny standup comedian rafe spall who makes himself far too emotionally available and cant believe his luck when it seems to pay off written for the screen by david nicholls from his novel of the same name the script reflects its literate origins its intelligent without being selfconscious using telling details and witty wordplay such as emma describing the smell of her shabby first london flat as that of onions and disappointment the excellent writing is illuminated by equally excellent performances hathaway evincing a ferocious honesty and growing strength beneath the vulnerability of emmas selfdeprecating bon mots sturgess finds the sweetness at odds with itself in dexters boorishness not just with emma but with his dexters disapproving father ken stott and gentle mother patricia clarkson whose unconditional love for her son doesnt wear blinders spall brings a vivid complexity to ian making clear his palpable understanding that he and emma are wrong for each other but is nonetheless unable to resist the temptation to try its the perfect tragic counterpoint to the soul mates misconnecting and by comparison makes those misses all the more wrenching one day is a love story that redefines what perfect timing is unblemished by soggy sentiment it is nonetheless a film with a full voracious heart tempered with a surprisingly clear head when it comes to romance funny tragic droll and very very smart its the thinking persons love story 
Aug 20 2011,positive,bookbased drama is too heavy for younger teens
Aug 20 2011,negative,one of the most painfully unromantic romance dramas ive ever seen
Aug 20 2011,negative,the fractured chronological foundation doesnt translate to film with the character arcs stifled by the fragmented glimpses at their stories
Aug 20 2011,negative, the title of the film one day refers to july 15 though in truth it refers to over two decades worth of that date beginning on july 15 1988 when brits emma anne hathaway and dexter jim sturgess graduate from college attempt a onenight stand and then decide to remain lifelong friends instead the picture checks in on the lives of the pair every july 15 through the present day its a highconcept gimmick that could go either way and this one ends up parting straight down the middle emma starts out gawky reclusive and toiling in obscurity while dexter is confident charismatic and famous the ensuing years impart the expected a star is born career switcheroo but the focus is mainly on the personal lives of these two best friends and whether theyll eventually decide if they should become romantically entwined or if they should even be buddies anymore as emma notes during one of dexters obnoxious phases i love you dext i just dont like you anymore considering director lone scherfigs previous film was 2009s excellent an education  one of the best films of recent years  its impossible to consider the frequently choppy one day anything besides a disappointment still thats not to say its a total washout the movie nicely captures the whiplash collision of youthful optimism with strenuous reality and hathaway and sturgess are fine together and even better in their individual scenes i would be even easier on the film if it wasnt for the lastact tragedy a grotesque and clumsy development thats less a logical procession of the story and more a shameless stab at multiplex manipulation and pandering
Aug 20 2011,negative,hathaway had better chemistry with james franco during this years oscars than she does here with the terminally lame sturgess
Aug 20 2011,negative,     confession  i never read david nicholls bestseller on which this romantic drama is based and i simply cannot fathom why anyone would want to see such a depressing dirge about two young brits whose lives seem to intersect every july 15th st swithins day for 20 years beginning in 1988     ambitious aspiring writer emily morley anne hathaway and dexter mayhew jim sturgess meet just as theyre graduating from university ready to launch forth into the world determined to continue their hastily forged friendship they try to spend july 15th catching up and consoling one another shes frumpy and bespectacled indicating bookish while hes a wealthy irresponsible womanizer of course shes secretly in love with him despite having her hopes dashed with predictably regularity     eventually dex becomes a trendy latenight tv host while emma writes a successful childrens book but their personal lives are a mess  drugaddled hardpartying dex impregnates and marries sylvie romola garai an upperclass socialite while dowdy emma moves in with ian rafe spall son of actor timothy a wannabe standup comedian  its obvious that both of these relationships are doomed from the getgo meanwhile dex loses his devoted mother patricia clarkson to cancer     adapted for the screen by novelist david nicholls and helmed by danish director lone scherfig an education its infuriatingly episodic even tedious never developing the characters beyond a teartugging layer of schmaltzy superficiality as the yearly scenes increasingly become shallow redundant sketches about finding ones soul mate   even more bewildering is the total lack of erotic screen chemistry between anne hathaway and jim sturgess dont directors do screen tests anymore  to determine such things     having made such an auspicious debut in the princess diaries anne hathaway has floundered through her past couple of roles love and other drugs valentines day despite making a fashion splash cohosting this years academy awards with hapless james franco  jim sturgess is best known for across the universe
Aug 19 2011,positive, with anne hathaway jim sturgess patricia clarkson ken stott rafe spall running time 108 minutes rated pg13 for sexual content partial nudity language some violence and substance abuse written by david nicholls directed by lone scherfig one day is going to strike some people as a treacly tearjerker for others it will be one from the heart those who like it will have to ignore its contrivance and focus on its emotional core which is the story of two friends who become playthings of fate with the true love they might have found in another story somehow always just out of reach screenwriter david nicholls has adapted his own novel about two british college graduates who meet on july 15 1988 and spend the night together we follow them over the years on that date as their paths cross and recross emma is a mousy wouldbe writer who in true hollywood tradition is played by the gorgeous anne hathaway only wearing glasses she gets a job waitressing in a greasy spoon and falls in with ian a coworker and aspiring standup comic rafe spall meanwhile dexter jim sturgess gets a job hosting a youthoriented television show and is so inyourface that he becomes the tv personality that people love to hate neither emma nor dexter is living up to their potential but as the years go by life happens dexters mother alison patricia clarkson falls ill emma and ian move into together dexter marries still the two stay in touch making us think that this will be one of those stories where love and happiness doesnt occur at first but at last this is the sort of story for people who can relate to the one that got away or the great love of ones life that was unrequited or perhaps even the great love that briefly flowered but could not last it is a story of memory and rueful regret and the recognition that even if it was not meant to be the other person in such a situation can still touch our lives in profound and longlasting ways with the movie covering more than two decades its also about growing up and growing older what seems like success in our twenties may not seem the same in our forties the things that appear impossibly out of reach at one stage of our lives may become achievable goals later on as emma and dexter get older their priorities change even as their friendship endures and thats an important part of the story as well anne hathaway herself is a good example of these themes over the last decade shes gone from movies like the princess diaries and ella enchanted to movies like rachel getting married and this she still does lightweight films like valentines day but shes reaching out for greater challenges as she gets older even holding her own opposite meryl streep in the devil wears prada as emma she explores the frustrations of young adulthood and the growing confidence that comes with successfully taking chances as she gets older jim sturgess is less wellknown  not yet a star  but hes been quietly moving from film to film building up his résumé with some good performances in movies like 21 and the way back this may be his highest profile work yet his dexter is someone who could get by on glibness and good looks but wants more than that out of life even if hes not quite sure what his character has to face a few hard knocks after coasting through his early life coming out wiser for it daniel m kimmel is a veteran movie critic and author of a host of filmrelated books the most recent being jar jar binks must die and other observations about science fiction movies he teaches film at suffolk university and lives in somerville
Aug 19 2011,negative,a ghastly representation of longing and screen chemistry it couldnt make the nuances of attraction more unpleasant if it tried

Aug 19 2011,negative,in one scene we are told a boyfriend of anne hathaways character left at that point im envious how come he gets to leave and i have to stay

Aug 19 2011,neutral,  a great hue and cry arose across the pond last year when it was announced that american anne hathaway had been cast as em the lessthanglamorous british heroine in the film version of the bestselling novel one day  basically when harry met sally with a fourhandkerchief twist    the new films action takes place every july 15 beginning in 1988 and continuing for two decades or so workingclass em hooks up with the handsome more affluent dex british actor jim sturgess of across the universe on the day of their college graduation in edinburgh    theyre not always together on july 15  in 1990 hes partying with a naked woman in paris and em is underemployed as a manager at a mexican restaurant in london she eventually moves in with a smitten colleague a failed comedian rafe spall son of timothy she doesnt quite love    returning to london dex acquires a measure of stardom  as well as a taste for cocaine booze and promiscuity  as the host of a cheesy latenight music program on tv on one of their several reunions on various july 15s including a skinnydipping episode he rudely brushes aside her concerns about his hardpartying lifestyle which is taking a toll on his career    her relationship founders but the comedians parting gift is to encourage her literary ambitions and sure enough her first book is a best seller by this point the selfpitying dex  whos lost his mother patricia clarkson in a small role to cancer and his tv show  has hit rock bottom a shortlived marriage to romola garai that produces a daughter and an unhappy new career does little to reverse his downward trajectory    at some point in the late 90s em and dex decide they were fated for each other after all its easy to see how dex would be attracted to the newly selfconfident em i had more of a problem understanding why em would want anything to do with dex a substanceabusing jerk who is anything but charming    i might be able to get past that if hathaway and sturgess had any chemistry there are no sparks whatsoever and thats always a dealbreaker for me in romantic films    an education conveyed a wonderful sense of time and place something thats largely missing here  if it werent for title cards and the occasional shoulder pad it would be hard to tell whether youre looking at a scene from 1996 or 2006    david nicholls who adapted his own novel for the screen doesnt work the same alchemy that nick hornby created from lynn barbers memoir for an education theres far too much onthenose dialogue she made you decent plus nicholls adds an extremely schmaltzy ending chapter that wasnt in his book    even with his hair grayed up sturgess in no way physically conveys the middleaged man hes become toward the end hathaway though suggests ems life journey beautifully and shes the best reason to see one day if you must 
Aug 19 2011,neutral, emma anne hathaway and dexter jim sturgess have the kind of relationship that women and men sometimes find hard to handle theyre friends not lovers but the potential for sex is always there from their first meeting in the late 1980s to their periodic reunions over about two decades of british cultural change its a classic case of opposites attracting emma is studious and somewhat insecure dexter is outgoing and overconfident emma aspires to be a writer dexter is happy to be host of a tv show emma is sexier than she thinks she is dexter cant live without sex theyd make a great couple if only they could get on the same page  or the same stage it seems that they both have some growing up to do but as often happens in such stories tragedy lurks it also lingers as we dawdle with one of the characters way past what should have been the ending based on a book by david nicholls one day fails to make us care about the young couple at its center working from a screenplay by nicholls director lone scherfig maintains a lively pace and she elicits spirited performances from hathaway and sturgess the problem is a story that may have worked as a novel but never quite gels as a film its a big disappointment coming from scherfig whose drama an education 2009 was a model of concise yet engaging storytelling one day also squanders the talents of hathaway who was terrific in last years love and other drugs she brings to emma an appealing vulnerability as dexter sturgess  who has appeared in films from 21 to across the universe  deftly balances charm and smarm
Aug 19 2011,negative,  has an angel appeared before your eyes or made its presence known to you in some other way here is a collection of stories shared by people who have had angel sightings angel experiences dreams and memories some of these amazing stories may make a skeptical person think twice   i was giving a new client a reiki treatment my hands were focused on her body as were my eyes i felt a presence in the room   when i lifted up my head i saw an angel step through the wall into the room he was so very tall that he had to stoop so as not to bump his head on the ceiling my first thought was this must be the archangel michael because i had been told once that the archangels are tall i dont know why i thought it was michael i was just sure it was   he said she sang to him and laid with him until he fell asleep he then said jesus came back to get her and he brought her back to a door with him where they started to sparkle and then went through the door ever since my son has been obsessed with jesus and angels he prays to an angel often and prays for jesus to come back   ive never told this story when i was about 7 years old i was left at home alone with my nephew who was 3 at the time we were playing in a back room when something scared us i dont remember what i saw or heard but i knew i had to get out of that house or we were going to die   i clutched my nephew tightly both of us screaming and crying and ran toward the front door just before reaching the exit i saw a tiny ball of glowing white light hovering just above our front door i stopped dead in my tracks i could not take my eyes off that ball suddenly it started getting bigger and bigger eventually we were totally engulfed by the light   i have believed in angels all my life in my younger years i lived an exciting life threw caution to the wind and put myself in dangerous situations i used to think i had worked my angels overtime   last year was the worse of my life in six months i lost my brotherinlaw my younger brother passed away i had my adult son and family removed from my house and i divorced my absent husband   it started with me seeing a figure at the end of my bed i also kept seeing purple green and white balls of light in my room at night   one night i had just laid down suddenly i was outside staring at this woman who had long black hair her wings covered the whole of the sky she was massive i asked her what she wanted shouting at her she smiled and she told me she was the angel of the morning sun she flapped her wings three times and my body went all funny i was back in my room i could see myself lying in bed i was on my ceiling   i was 4 years old i was in my brothers room crying this is when i heard a sweet voice called me i looked up towards the footboard and saw a woman with long hair lying on her right shoulder she had on a white flowing cloth with light blue trimming surrounded by a white mist her arms were extended out with her palms facing upward as if she wanted to embrace me   i prayed that god would show me an angel and he did twice many years after i prayed for this both encounters happened when i was sleeping   i suppose angels will come to visit us on occasion when we would be most relaxed and receptive to their visitations the first encounter i had i was in a dream state walking along a dark path at night then suddenly the entire environment setting lit up with incredibly pure bright light as if the sun itself was shining on me   when i was younger i was going through a lot of things that a young 16yearold girl shouldnt have to endure you can try to imagine my mother and i were arguing a lot she was very angry because she was going through things of her on she took it out on my little brother and me   not long ago my father was diagnosed with stage 4 bladder cancer and was not given much hope for survival past the christmas season although the odds were devastatingly against him he chose to go through a round of chemo to take some comfort in the idea that he tried everything he could to be cured although god had other plans i take comfort in my faith that he will be taken care of by christ and the angels themselves   in 1974 while stationed in pearl harbor someone i had been drinking with spiked my wine with lsd he did so with several others we all went back to the base barracks and some of the guys were going crazy i prayed for help a sailor opened his door and asked what was wrong i told him he asked me to get everyone and bring them to his room i did he asked if we believed in god we all shared our experiences about god and that is when i noticed i was sober it was way too soon for the lsd to wear off it can be an 18hour experience it had only been a few hours since our drinks had been spiked   moonville ohio is an old town that was overtaken by a plague almost everyone died all that is left of the town is a tunnel we went through the tunnel and three of my grandsons climbed the hill to the top there was a thin beam of light that looked like a sword it was right in front of us i couldnt see when i looked up to take the picture the light was so bright i took the picture anyway   i had a difficult two years full of losses sadness and major changes i was recently diagnosed with depression i had some very strange experiences and some moments of pure bliss   i called the airlines and had to be at the airport for the last 9 pm commuter plane the terminal was under construction so i was left at a shuttle site in the parking lot in the pouring rain it was 845 pm i had never used this airport so i was terrified and began crying   i looked away and she was gone i asked the fireman where was the lady he said what lady i pointed to where she had come from and he said she could not have come from that area that was a 500foot cliff to the pacific ocean   it was may 2011 i was not feeling well everything seemed to be falling apart i would spent a lot of time on facebook and internet i felt i was challenged by evil spirits i was feeling like i was dead most of the time i would see my spirit get out of my body and wondered if my dad would come in a spirit form to bring my soul back to my body   i know i needed healing i wanted help with my emotions and felt i needed them to flow instead of wearing a protective mask or being like a statue   i have several angels and see them each in different ways my father is rainbows my grandma is butterflies there are orbs in pictures i know they are there when i photograph them they are red and often in shapes of angels i have been told i have five   we were in the jungle at taljai devi near pune india we knew we were lost both of us had almost decided that might have to spend the rest of the night at the jungle but suddenly from somewhere a man appeared his looks were serene in spite of meeting him at that time of day in a jungle we did not get scared of him at all he looked so peaceful there was such serenity on his face we followed him me and my friend both knew that he is either an angel or a man sent by an angel to help us   when i was taking pictures in my backyard one and a half years ago i looked to see how the photos appeared i found that a great awesome cloud came down my alley and three ufos shaped like pyramids were in my backyard three men wearing silver suits and silver coneshaped hats advanced from the ufos toward me   i have a daughter who is permanently disabled she had open heart surgery when she was only 3 months old we were told when she was being prepped for surgery that we shouldnt do it and that her prognosis wasnt good they said that they would make her as comfortable as possible until she passed   the next day i was looking through one of my many handbags and i put my hand in to grab some coins out of it suddenly i found myself with a silver ring in my hand with a coin stuck in the middle of the ring   at the age of 15 years old i was riding my fourwheeler i tried to climb a hill with my four wheeler by myself risky since no one was there if i had wrecked it   during a very rough time last week my daughter and i went to the mall at the bottom of the escalator a lady approached us and started a conversation she asked me a lot about where i was from etc   then she told me that this rough time would pass and that the girls at school were jealous of my daughter and that she just needs to hold her head up high and not respond wow how did she know there was a showdown at her school the day before she also said that my daughter will have her pick of colleges to choose from she is a straighta student since kindergarten and is now in 10th grade she also looked deep into my eyes and told me that she knew i had been to hell and back but this will all make me stronger   i was the manager of a radio broadcast station i worked the morning show in which i had to wake every morning at 3 am to get all my prep together by 5 am which was airtime the night before i abruptly woke up at 1100 pm i had been sound asleep by 930 pm yet felt i had to call the radio station urgently i was initially disoriented yet driven i was barking orders to my equallysoundasleep husband who responded beautifully to my orders i asked my husband to get on the cell phone and get ready to call 911   the other night i came to stay for the christmas holidays with my dad and brother my brother sometimes is a person i still dont get along with even though we are adults he keeps to himself and seems to ignore me most of the time i feel very sad about this every time i visit my family he is not nice to my mom at all who lives separate from him and my dad   i was taking my 3yearold daughter to daycare i had left the house and traveled two blocks when i came to a major intersection that was being widened i was the first car at the light my daughter was in her child seat in the front the light turned green as i readied to go through the intersection loud and clear i heard the words dont go it was so clear that i thought someone was in my backseat   years ago i was out with my two good friends and we were walking around in this big shopping center over an hour we hung around the perfume section looking for the right smell so in the end we were quite dazed   one wednesday night back in the late 1990s i decided to sing for god under the evening stars we live in a semirural area so thankfully i wouldnt be waking anyone up i suggested to god that he may want to have some angels doctor up my lame singing voice as im sure he is used to hearing beautiful angel choirs in the heavenly realms   i believe in angels because i have lots of experiences wherein i know they talk to me angels dont only watch and guide they also make you a better person i was in a bad situation two years ago i was angry with myself but i never noticed it in my dream there were two men standing on a platform they called me i noticed three gray stones in their forehead i dont know why they had that   one guy asked me why are you angry with yourself what is bothering you why are you punishing yourself he said you have everything you have a nice family house people love you then why dont you love yourself his tone was an annoyed tone i cannot answer because i know he is correct i just said i am terribly sorry and i cried   i was raised catholic my mom incorporated angels into our everyday life like to reassure us for example thunder is just the angels bowling and lightning is the angels taking pictures that one led to a bit of danger as we all wanted to run outside and smile at the heavens during a lightning storm   i believe that i saw several angels on several occasions the first sighting was at a devastating fire in west philadelphia of a church that once was affiliated with the peoples emergency center the building was gutted and there appeared to be about two or three pacing back and forth   i had just done the reiki at night i could not sleep around midnight i felt that i was floating though i was still in bed when i opened my eyes i saw the whole room was filled with white shadows but i was not scared and i tried to make out what they were   driving home from work going through a neighborhood i saw a homeless man pushing a grocery cart filled with odds and ends i suddenly felt the need to stop and give him money which was something i did not believe was a good idea i felt compelled to do just that he said that he had no shelter to go to but that god always took care of him i gave him the money and he blessed me   i turned a corner and felt compelled to go back again he had disappeared into thin air he was there in the middle of the street in the middle of a subdivision in the middle of a block and then he was goneshopping cart and all   the accident happened around 1979 my girlfriend donna was driving the car on the bronx expressway one evening with another friend and me we were in the left lane when the car decided to stall normally you would glide over but donna hit her brake that is all i remember until someone called my name veronica wake up i was in the back seat and we were hit from behind the person pulled me out of the car   i believe in angels and my mom was one of them shortly before she died she began preparing an amazing shindig she wanted to look nice have great food and enjoy and celebrate her life two days later she unexpectedly died dont tell me she didnt converse with the angels dont tell me she wasnt planning her entry into the hereafter with the angels and saints and our god she had never ever been so happy in our life and she told me so she brushed off all the materialistic things of this world told me to get rid of her house a house she had clung to with tenacity for years   my two dearest friends of 50 years were each killed in similar headon collisions 17 months apart and each occurred two days after the birth of my daughters children which convinces me that the timeliness of these two accidents was predetermined so that each baby could have a very special guardian angel   i had a surgery a year ago one night i was reading a book about how to communicate with your guardian angel then i fell asleep   an old boyfriend broke my heart by leaving one day without explanation years later i received a phone call from his mother he was dying of brain cancer she felt seeing me would bring comfort to him this was a very emotional situation i found myself in   i decided to visit him and ended up being committed to him in a nurturing way for the rest of his life which ended up being a year this time was an emotional roller coaster and i often felt confused one day while going to the train station an old woman dressed in black stopped right in front of me and said god loves you you are doing the right thing and she walked away 
Aug 18 2011,positive, emma and dexter are the kind of best friends a thousand romantic comedies are made of a straight man and a straight woman who almost got it on during college but regressed into a friendship that remains forthrightly awkwardly platonic over the years you know this situation is never going to last and on some level they do too but one day does the audience a favor by not taking things the way youve seen a hundred times before yes lone scherfigs film includes tearful revelations kisses in the street and other boyfriends and girlfriends who are just so wrong for our main pair but its also sharper and more mature about lovein all its forms and the way it can shift and develop over time unfortunately the movie is also a shallower facsimile of the novel by david nichols who also wrote the screenplay but it hits enough of the same notes and is handsomely packaged enough to stand fairly well on its own so much relies on the chemistry between our emma and dexter anne hathaway and jim sturgess and though both hathaways mousiness and british accent seem iffy at times the two are pretty good at pretending to be crazy about each other the movie starts strong on the heartbreakingly gorgeously shot streets of predawn edinburgh in 1989 where emma and dexter are winding down a postgraduation party and wind up stumbling back to emmas cramped dorm room bed as the sun rises dexter points out that its july 15 st swithins day and suddenly were swept to that day a year later when emma is working a shitty job at a shitty mexican restaurant in london while privileged dexter travels the world its the first of 20 time jumps total as we meet up with emma and dexter on july 15 each year until 2010 emmas life is one familiar to a lot of postcollegiates working that shitty job far longer than she should have falling almost by accident into a relationship with a doofy guy rafe spall whos way beneath her and harboring a dream of writing childrens books while being way too shy to actually follow through with it golden boy dexter on the other hand stumbles into a highpaying job as a caddish tv presenter though it also comes with a raging alcohol problem and the inability to deal with actual life problems like the death of his mother patricia clarkson underused when we meet up with them on july 15 emma and dexter are sometimes together vacationing amid serious sexual tension in the south of france or fighting in the street after a swanky dinner where dexter is too drunk to care hes insulted his oldest friend other times theyre living totally separate lives emma happily accepting a modest job as a schoolteacher and dexter entering into a shotgun marriage that seems doomed from the start even when their lives seem to be turning away from each other though there are many twists left to go life is funny like that sometimes nichols is very very faithful to his own book in the adaptation but theres only time for so much and scenes in the film that felt detailed and emotionally rich often fly by without making their desired impact dexters relationship with his family feels especially shortshrifted making his transformation from carefree playboy to devoted family man feel entirely rote and though hathaway gets some good zingers as emma she never emerges quite as the prickly whipsmart heroine she ought to be scherfig uses several opportunities to translate the books deep emotions into cinema the aforementioned edinburgh streets and that citys landmark mountain arthurs seat are especially effective locations but its a talky book translated into a talky movie thats sometimes more clever than it is effective the primary feeling of one day though is somehow wishing it could be better that sturgess had maintained some of his leading man reserve from the way back and better commanded the screen that hathaway had allowed a little more spark into emma and especially that scherfig and nichols had found better ways to recreate the books livedin confident charm telling a love story over the course of 20 years is no easy task and one day had everything it needed to pull it off but loses something crucial in the leap from page to screen
Aug 18 2011,negative,sturgess is great hathaway is less so and ultimately the more enjoyable high points dont do enough to make up for a lot of serious lulls

Aug 18 2011,neutral,without the interior monologues that gave the novels characters more substance it feels more like a perfume commercial than a story
Aug 18 2011,negative, one day seemed so promising given its pedigree  lovely and sensitive actors anne hathaway and jim sturgess at the forefront lone scherfig a master of intimacy in the directors chair and david nicholls adapting his own bestselling romance novel but as so often happens with love what you hope for is not even close to what you get and in this case we are left with a heartbreaking disappointment of a film  it starts off in edinburgh scotland one day in 1988 july 15 to be exact when emma hathaway and dexter sturgess meet on graduation day end up in bed yet very much off on the wrong foot hes more upper crust really out of her league shes frumpy but smart and sardonic enough to keep him intrigued if not attracted  true romance isnt in the cards on that day but we have time the film as the book did before it covers a 20year span dropping in on them each year on the same july day  the narrative is driven by modern themes em and dex have varying degrees of success and failure on the personal and career fronts which seem to be the main topic of conversation when they meet up each year usually in and around london where much of the film takes place she busses tables at a mexican restaurant and tries to write when shes not at work hes a rising realitytv star on a downward spiral sped along by healthy doses of cocaine and the fickle nature of fame  he has a string of young lovelies while she struggles with relationships ian a standup comic wannabe turns up as her rock for a while a smart turn by rafe spall patricia clarkson and ken stott are mostly underemployed as dexs parents though there are some nice moments between stott and sturgess toward the end  if dex and em are in an extended pickle of whether to be or not to be a couple its nothing compared with the problems the actors are facing in the film there is a lot of tempting and resisting and a few lingering kisses beautifully shot by director of photography benoit delhomme but the passion is missing if anything the awkwardness that rightfully infuses their first encounter never leaves  its a very british production but the accent never sits well with hathaway more problematic she never comes close to the sort of textured portrait she brought to rachel getting married sturgess excellent holding together the very loosely constructed across the universe is no better off as dex hes to be a lovable rogue but charm fails him here  this sort of story should have been a slamdunk for scherfig the danish director has been close to a sure thing since us audiences began discovering her in 2002 with her first englishlanguage film wilbur wants to kill himself a sweet comedy about suicide and family ties but it was 2009s oscarnominated an education that cemented her as a truly significant cinematic voice  in the comingofage story that launched carey mulligans career scherfig allowed us to creep inside a life in transition she made you feel an actual witness to those deliciously dangerous liaisons in one day with the world again turning on the axis of a single relationship the characters and the story slip away from her  nicholls novel was a sensation in part due to the clever way it revealed dex and em  fragments that eventually came together to create a fullbodied exploration of what goes right and wrong with the people we love this is not the first time hes tackled adapting for the screen starter for 10 his earlier go at british class issues school and love in 2006 turned out to be an enjoyable entertainment with james mcavoy its winning lead though the last king of scotland would be that years gamechanger for the actor  but in nipping and tucking nicholls loses too much of the context necessary if were to fall in love with dex and em and the idea that they really should be together and why do we show up for romantic movies if not to pull for an ever after happily or otherwise dialogue that played on page turns tedious on screen and there is an awful lot of it  back for a moment to delhomme the scent of green papaya the boy in the striped pajamas the french cinematographers eye for places and people is so consistently stylish and spoton that even films that otherwise fall short are worth seeing if he shot them when the tedium overtakes one day pass the time looking at how skillfully he moves in to set the mood and frame the moment former los angeles times film critic betsy sharkey is an awardwinning entertainment journalist and bestselling author she left the newsroom in 2015 in addition to her critical essays and reviews of about 200 films a year for the times sharkeys weekly movie reviews appeared in newspapers nationally and internationally her books include collaborations with oscarwinning actresses faye dunaway on looking for gatsby and marlee matlin on ill scream later sharkey holds a degree in journalism and a masters in communications theory from texas christian university
Aug 18 2011,positive, one day is a beautiful movie but beautiful in a way that life often is not movies nothing is sudden or easy either for the characters or for the audience and there are no thunderbolts from the blue rather the film achieves its effects and builds toward a wealth of feeling through an accumulation of seemingly daytoday incidents presented over the course of years we meet two people and with time and maturity the towering consequence of their relationship reveals itself so this is no light romantic movie it may wear its seriousness lightly as it should but this is really about two people discovering meaning in their lives  which is next door to saying that one day is about the meaning of life in general life may be clumsy full of misguided ambitions false directions and inhibiting fears and with long stretches of drudgery interrupted by short bursts of misery but if people are lucky the movie is saying they eventually figure out what they should be doing and whom they should be doing it with or to put it another way there are a million love stories in the naked city and one day is just one of them  but a particularly emblematic one that resonates as a generational story as well based on the novel of the same name by the british writer david nicholls and adapted by the author it introduces us to two people in their early 20s who spend the night together on july 15 1988 emma anne hathaway is caustic witty insecure and smart from a workingclass background and dexter jim sturgess is upper middle class and radiant with a selfconfidence not to be confused with selflove he likes himself but hes on to himself she wants to be a writer and he wants to be famous and the two connect for no reason but that opposites often do they become friends from there on the movie looks in on emma and dexter on every subsequent july 15 from 1989 through the present day this device  one would call it a gimmick were it not so inspired  is not to be confused with anything like same time next year in which the characters contrive to meet every anniversary rather this is just an arbitrary conceit that proves irresistible a series of snapshot portraits of two oftenseparate lives from young adulthood to early middle age without making a big deal about it the movie charts their career trajectories as well as the yearbyyear advances in technology the changing styles the social scene in london and the subtle but very real differences between being say 28 and 32 much of the films humor derives from dexters career as a tv presenter a horror in which he interviews rap groups wears ridiculous pants and pretends to be a cockney but perhaps the most important thing about one day is that this is one of the rare romantic films in which we know why the central characters are or should be in love and for once it has nothing to do with the elusive chemistry of two star personalities hathaway doesnt play her bright usual self but a brainy brit and sturgess is not well known enough to have an established star persona everything here is about the alchemy of the characters which the actors inhabit with knowing good humor lone scherfigs direction is sure and insightful and contains accent notes that release the storys pentup power i was going to describe a shot late in the film in which scherfig includes 1988 and 2011 in the same frame but no ill let you find it but certainly in a film so wedded to the calendar its a stroke of brilliance to suggest that nothing goes away and that time as people experience it is a lie actually if youre keeping score that is the precise moment that a very satisfying movie is transformed to the level of poetry a level that once achieved one day never loses mick lasalle is the film critic for the san francisco chronicle where he has worked since 1985 he is the author of two books on precensorship hollywood complicated women sex and power in precode hollywood and dangerous men precode hollywood and the birth of the modern man both were books of the month on turner classic movies and complicated women formed the basis of a tcm documentary in 2003 narrated by jane fonda he has written introductions for a number of books including peter cowies joan crawford the enduring star 2009 he was a panelist at the berlin film festival and has served as a panelist for eight of the last ten years at the venice film festival  his latest book a study of women in french cinema is the beauty of the real what hollywood can learn from contemporary french actresses
